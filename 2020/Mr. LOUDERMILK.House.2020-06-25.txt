 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding me the  time.   As I came here, I realized there is a lot happening in this country  today I don't understand. I really don't understand.   I have a lot of friends back home. I have friends who are Black and  White, Asian, Hispanic, every race, every nationality. I talk to them.  They don't understand what is happening in this Nation today.   I try to put my finger on it, but I am kind of losing track of where  we are going, and wherever it is we are going, why aren't we going  there together?                                time  1645    Why do we keep dividing ourselves and using different issues to  divide ourselves?   I mean, I don't understand why George Floyd died under the knee of a  police officer. I really don't. I was horrified when I watched the  video of him. Regardless of what his race is, that was horrific. I  don't understand why that happened.   But I also don't understand why, in response to his seeming murder,  it seemed appropriate to destroy the homes, the businesses, the  livelihood of innocent people who had nothing to do with it in the same  community. I don't understand that.   I don't understand why retired Police Chief David Dorn was gunned  down to death as he was trying to protect one of these businesses, a  business owned by someone who had nothing to do with any of this.   I don't understand why Shay Mikalonis, a Las Vegas police officer,  was shot in the head while attempting to disperse a group of  protesters.   I don't understand why Dave Patrick Underwood, a Federal Protective  Service officer, was shot and killed while on duty amid protests in  Oakland, California. I can't wrap my hands around that.   I don't understand why four St. Louis police officers were shot at a  peaceful protest that turned violent--two shot in the leg, one shot in  the foot, and the fourth shot in the arm.   I don't understand why, in New York City, a police officer was  attacked and beaten by several men, while onlookers encouraged them to  do that--a police officer who had nothing to do with what happened to  George Floyd or the young man in Brunswick, Georgia, or in Atlanta.   Mr. Speaker, there is something else I don't understand. I don't  understand why, 3 years ago this month, I was on a baseball field when  a man crazed by extreme political ideology walked on the baseball field  and started shooting bullets at me and many of my colleagues. I don't  understand why that happened.   There is something else I don't understand. As I was there in the  line of fire, I don't understand why one of our Capitol Police  officers, who didn't know anything about me--we weren't friends at the  time--walked into the line of fire to draw fire away from me and one of  my colleagues so we could, hopefully, get to his partner and Matt Mika,  who had been wounded by the shooter.   The Bible tells us that there is no greater love than someone who  would willingly lay down their life for someone else. When I see that  officer walk out in the line of fire to protect me, who didn't know  me--a Black man; I am a White man--I sometimes wonder: Why do they do  that?   My dad served in the Army. He was on the D-day invasion. I often  wonder why they would step off those boats for people that they don't  know and walk into the line of fire. I mean, these are things that I  really don't understand.   I also don't understand why we are not working together to improve  law enforcement in this Nation. I don't know why the media and some  here want to take the action of one or two or a few and apply it to law  enforcement all across the board when I have seen what these law  enforcement officers do. They put their lives on the line daily for us.   I don't know what the answer is, but I do know those who do. I called  on the police chiefs in my district to get together, to talk about  this, and we met yesterday.   There is some stuff that we all agree on that they agree on. There  are plenty of things that they want to see happen. They all agree that  we should hold officers more accountable. They also agree that we  should have a database to track those officers who are bad officers so  they know that they are hiring someone who has had problems in other  States or in other jurisdictions. That is a problem for them.   This is because these police chiefs, they want good law enforcement.  They are there to serve the communities. They are there to uphold law  and order.   Something else I don't understand is, when we see what is going on,  on TV, why some of these officers actually show up to work the next  day. They go to try to protect the peaceful protesters, and they are  attacked by the violent ones and, in some cases, get no support out of  their leadership. I don't understand why they do that.  [[Page H2475]]    Our police chiefs said they need more training, that they need more  funding. One of the problems when it comes to cutting the budgets of  our police officers and our police departments and law enforcement,  usually the first thing that goes is training. They agree they need  more training.   We need more mental health support in this Nation. The police chiefs  told me that I would be surprised--and I am going to go. I am going  spend more time with them. I spend a lot of time with our law  enforcement already, but I am going to go ride with them to experience  some of this. I encourage all of my colleagues to do this.   They said they spend an unbelievable amount of time on the calls of  mental health issues that they really can't do anything about because  the person hasn't committed a crime. They may be on the verge of  suicide, but they haven't committed a crime so they can't arrest them.  They just have to stay there with them. Sometimes, they may get  somebody to come out, or they may not. It puts them in a very difficult  position. So, they are all about doing more, doing more with mental  health issues.   There is a lot that we support. Now, I did hear it said earlier that  this is not defunding the police. But let me tell you what 100 percent  of the police chiefs in that meeting said to me: If you remove  qualified immunity, you will be shutting down the police departments in  America because they will not be able to retain their officers. That  was 100 percent of the police chiefs, and they are police chiefs in all  types of demographics. I have part of Atlanta. I go all the way up into  the rural parts of Georgia.   But they 100 percent said, if you remove our qualified immunity, we  will not keep police officers, and you will shut down law enforcement  in this Nation as we know it.    There was one other thing that they were 100 percent behind: Senator  Tim Scott's bill. Every one of them was 100 percent behind what was in  that bill. Now, a lot of it they already do. They banned chokeholds.  They are way ahead of a lot of different departments.   There are some things in this bill they agree with, but they are also  100 percent--100 percent--against this bill. One hundred percent of the  police chiefs I met with in my district, which was virtually all but a  couple of departments, were against this bill and the way it is written  right now.   The one thing that they asked for me to portray is: Let's not paint  all law enforcement with a broad brush. Those police officers who are  risking their lives, those good ones, they feel like they are getting  kicked in the rear end by the politicians, local and at the Federal  level.   They want us to work together. They want to see us work together. If  we are going to call for unity in this Nation, then we better start  right here. Instead of trying to ramrod a political bill that is not  going to go anywhere, and we know it, we should be here working  together to get something done.   That, Mr. Speaker, is what I don't understand right now, why we are  not doing that.    Madam Speaker, I was unavoidably detained. Had I been  present, I would have voted ``yea'' on rollcall No. 118 and ``nay'' on  rollcall No. 116.
