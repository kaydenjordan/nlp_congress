 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and  ultimate sacrifice of West Feliciana Deputy Fire Chief Russell Achord,  who died Wednesday while responding to a car accident.   Chief Achord served for 24 years and earned Officer of the Year and  Valor in the Line of Duty recognitions during that time. He has also  helped the community by implementing programs to teach high school  students emergency care and improving the fire district's standard of  care.   It is because of the sacrifices of first responders like Chief Achord  that we  [[Page H558]]  enjoy the lives we are able to lead. Our first responders put their  lives on the line every day to keep our communities safe, and for that  we can never say ``thank you'' enough.   Louisiana and West Feliciana Parish are better because of Chief  Achord, and I ask that you keep his family and his firehouse in your  prayers as they grieve.                            ____________________
