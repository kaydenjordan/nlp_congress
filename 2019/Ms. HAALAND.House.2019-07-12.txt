 Madam Speaker, I stand in support of equal pay for equal  work and in celebration of the women's national soccer team.   The team's World Cup victory highlighted a stark reality: There is  still work to be done to ensure equal pay for the same work.   Last week, my colleagues and I in the Democratic Women's Caucus wrote  to the U.S. Soccer Federation with a simple argument: Our most  successful U.S. soccer team in history deserves equal pay.   The work of the women soccer players, coaches, and staff should not  be worth less simply because they are women.   The women's soccer team is inspiring young girls everywhere to dream  big. We must make sure those girls don't have to worry about equal pay.  You shouldn't have to be a record-breaking world champion to get the  same pay as your male counterparts.   As Megan Rapinoe said at the victory parade on Wednesday, ``We have  to be better.''                            ____________________
