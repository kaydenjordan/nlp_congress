 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address  the alarming and growing crisis on our southern border.   Despite the rhetoric surrounding this issue, the reality is families  and unaccompanied children are arriving at our southern border in  greater numbers than in the past decades.   June of this year alone saw a 450 percent increase in border  encounters compared to a year ago, and this fiscal year has seen more  than 1.1 million illegal crossings.   Additionally, Customs and Border Protection have seized more fentanyl  so far this year than in all of 2020, and high positivity rates of  COVID-19 among illegal migrants threaten to undue much of the hard work  our country has done in combating the pandemic.   The Biden border crisis is turning deadlier by the day.   This crisis is a direct result of the policies coming from the Biden- Harris administration.   When Vice President Harris finally visited the border last month, she  claimed the administration has made progress, but the numbers don't  lie, and with roughly 3,000 migrants crossing each day, little progress  has been made.   I believe securing our borders is the first step in a broader  discussion of much-needed comprehensive immigration reform.   Ensuring the safety of American citizens will allow us to address  that and is the best chance for a prosperous future.                            ____________________
