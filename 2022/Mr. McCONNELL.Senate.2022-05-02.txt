 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, inflation has hit a staggering 8.5  percent on Democrats' watch as a result of Democrats' policies.   Last week, the Commerce Department announced that personal  consumption expenditures climbed at their fastest rate this past year  since 1982--40 years ago. Americans are paying 10 percent more on  groceries than they were a year ago and about $1.25 more for a gallon  of gas. In every aisle of the supermarket, in every big box store, the  prices families pay for essentials have skyrocketed.   As the owner of a coffeehouse in my hometown of Louisville put it,  ``We are trying not to pass on too much to the customers, but it comes  to a time when you just have to.''   The owner of a longstanding butcher shop nearby said:         ``We're all holding our breath.'' That goes for small       business owners and shoppers alike.    One new poll found that 94 percent of Americans are upset or  concerned about inflation, and they are overwhelmingly not happy--not  happy--with what the Biden administration is doing about it. Just 28  percent of the country approved of President Biden's handling of  inflation.   The worst part is that this pain was certainly not inevitable.  American families could have been spared all of this.   Last spring, Democrats inherited an economy that was ready for a  historic comeback. Even top liberal economists such as Larry Summers  and Jason Furman--both senior advisers to the Obama White House-- warned--warned--that Democrats' $2 trillion spending binge was  completely out of proportion to the remaining output gap. The country  didn't need anything like it.   Summers warned of ``inflationary pressures of a kind we have not seen  in a generation.''   Furman said:         It's definitely too big for the moment.    But Democratic politicians didn't listen. Here in the Senate, the  Democratic leader said:         I do not think the dangers of inflation, at least in the       near-term, are very real.    That was Leader Schumer last March.   So they spent all that money anyway, and, sadly, for the American  people, the rest is now history. Democrats  [[Page S2232]]  spent $2 trillion of the American people's money and purchased the  worst inflation in more than 40 years.   Well, actually, that is not all it purchased.                            ____________________     Madam President, sure, the Democrats' $2 trillion  didn't buy our country anything lasting like a Hoover Dam or an  Interstate Highway System--nothing like that--but the money had to go  someplace--and, boy, did it ever.   Democrats and lots of the media spent most of 2020 and 2021 shouting  that Republicans were risking calamity because we didn't want to dump  endless sums into slush funds for State and local governments. It turns  out we were right, and they were wrong. State and local governments are  now so awash in Democrat bailout money they can't even figure out where  to put it.   One recent news report found this bonanza has ``provided a boon for  localities seeking to build or upgrade their pickleball amenities.''  Yes, you heard that right.         Dozens of municipalities are adding pickleball courts to       their park and recreation offerings--and many are using a       slice of their coronavirus aid package to underwrite the       construction boom. If the Hoover Dam and the Lincoln Tunnel       are enduring monuments to the New Deal's infrastructure       spending, perhaps pickleball courts will become a lasting       legacy of the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan.    In New York, one county set aside $12 million in so-called relief  funds to renovate a minor league baseball stadium. In Iowa, county  officials put aside $2 million--listen to this--to buy a private ski  area. In Colorado, two golf courses are getting their irrigation  systems replaced, thank goodness. In Wisconsin, a skate park is getting  a million-dollar makeover.   The American Rescue Plan didn't rescue working people from anything.  It only rescued bureaucrats from any semblance--any semblance--of  fiscal sanity.   Remember, Democrats openly admitted they viewed pandemic relief as an  ideological Trojan horse. They called this terrible, deadly virus ``a  tremendous opportunity to restructure things to fit our vision.''   And so right on cue, their so-called rescue plan has funded  environmental justice grants to address something called inequitable  tree canopy cover in Massachusetts. Some public school systems, in the  vice grip of Big Labor, are using their windfalls to advance bizarre  indoctrination in things like critical race theory.   The rescue plan dollars have funded staff trainings to make sure the  educators paid to look after young kids are up on all of the latest  ``woke'' buzzwords and causes.   The American people wouldn't want this junk if it were free. They  definitely don't want it for the pricetag of $2 trillion of their money  and the worst inflation in a generation.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, when a tornado tore through the city of  Mayfield, KY, last December, America's eyes turned to the community.  Volunteers, FEMA workers, and elected officials quickly rushed to the  scene to offer our help. But in the aftermath of the devastating storm,  amid all the commotion, one figure stood out above all the rest,  rallying her town, coordinating recovery efforts, and promising that  Mayfield would bounce back, no matter how long it took to rebuild. That  inspiring leader was Mayfield Mayor Kathy O'Nan, and today, I ask my  colleagues to join me in honoring Mayor O'Nan for her leadership and  for recently earning recognition as the Mayfield-Graves County Chamber  of Commerce Woman of the Year.   In the past few months, Mayor O'Nan has become a familiar figure to  anyone tracking Western Kentucky's recovery from last year's tornados.  To the residents of Mayfield, though, she has long served as a  standalone advocate for their town and an exemplary community leader.  Mayor O'Nan got her start in Mayfield as a high school teacher and  church choir director and still knows how to command a rowdy room,  whether it is full of students or national reporters. She uses those  skills to wear the many hats required of a mayor in a tight-knit town  like Mayfield, from community cheerleader, to event coordinator, to  business developer.   When I first arrived in Mayfield after last December's storms, Mayor  O'Nan came up to me immediately, rattling off all the Federal help her  community needed to recover. On every subsequent visit, she has been  there front and center, ready to discuss storm relief. We have worked  closely to provide Western Kentucky with the resources required to  rebuild. I am incredibly grateful to have such a hard-working,  knowledgeable, and capable friend on the ground.   Mayor O'Nan's leadership has been noticed by figures around the  country in the past few months. But, as always, her first priority is  Mayfield, so I am confident her Woman of the Year Award from the  Mayfield-Graves County Chamber of Commerce means more to her than any  outside recognition ever could. After all, the residents of Mayfield  aren't just her constituents. They are also her neighbors, family, and  friends.   Mr. President, the Mayfield Messenger highlighted Mayor O'Nan's  recognition as the Mayfield-Graves County Chamber of Commerce Woman of  the Year in a recent article. I ask unanimous consent that the article  be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                [From the Mayfield Messenger, Apr. 23, 2022]    To Be the First One To Volunteer: O'Nan Named as Mayfield Business                             Woman of the Year         The Mayfield-Graves County Chamber of Commerce held its       annual Women in Business luncheon at Trace Creek Baptist       Church on Thursday. The event is held yearly to celebrate the       accomplishments of females in the business industry within       the community.        The 2022 Kentucky Derby themed luncheon included lunch, a       keynote speaker, and the announcement of the Woman of the       Year award. This year's recipient is Mayor Kathy O'Nan.        ``Our award this year is named after Mary Propes, a woman       who has served the community for many years,'' said Tanya       Rose, vice-president of quality assurance research and       development at Mayfield Consumer Products, presenting sponsor       of the event. ``Mary told me that she wants the recipient to       be someone to have the commitment to this community as she       does, someone who is an authentic role model. To lead by       setting an example. We are looking for a female today to give       this award to, that distributes that characteristic. She must       have significant community involvement outside of what their       job requires.''        Ester Hubbard was brought onto the stage, along with the       mayor's daughters, Meg O'Nan-Holmes and Ellen O'Nan.        When Hubbard first came to Mayfield in the 1980s, her       husband had just had back surgery and was hospitalized in       Memphis. She had two young children at the time who were both       in preschool.        ``I thought woe is me. I'm here trying to take care of       these children. Well, my friends told me about this woman in       Mayfield who also had two preschool children, however, her       husband has a brain tumor and he's not expected to live,''       said Hubbard. ``I thought to myself--if she can do it. I can       do it.''        O'Nan quickly became Hubbard's role model, before even       knowing her.        ``What a great role model she has been for me, for her       girls, and for all of the people she has touched,'' said       Hubbard.        O'Nan was a former teacher at Mayfield High School, and a       choir director at her church prior to being elected mayor.        ``She was such a good role model, and still is,'' said       Hubbard. ``These young people that she was around--she was a       social studies teacher, and part of that is citizenship. She       didn't talk about it, she acted on it.''        Even though O'Nan was not born in Mayfield, Hubbard states       that she was, and remains a wonderful part of this community.        ``She gave to the school, going to every game or activity       scheduled. She gave to the church, she gave to the       community,'' said Hubbard. ``But she still had time for real       emergencies, like when my Jake was in second grade and they       wouldn't let him practice because he didn't have all his       gear. We hopped in the car and got him some, because to K.O.       (O'Nan), that was an emergency.''        O'Nan is known for her heart to help others, and her want       to ease pain and put hope into the universe. At 5 a.m. on       Dec. 11, O'Nan told the nation about the devastation Mayfield       had just gone through--but also that there's always hope.        ``I woke up the morning after the tornado, texts from       people asking if we were okay of course,'' said Hubbard.       ``But then the rest were saying that my mayor was awesome. I       was absolutely overwhelmed with the number of calls telling       me over and over that my mayor is fantastic.''        Ellen O'Nan spoke out about her mother's nickname--K.O.        ``It originated when I was a senior in high school. I used       to be grounded a lot, and when people would ask if I could do       something--friends would say `she can't, she's grounded, K.O.       says no,' '' said Ellen. ``I always thought it was fitting       though, because, in the boxing world, K.O. means to knock       out. That's how she always approached challenges, anything       hard in her life. She'd just knock them out.''        As Ellen O'Nan thanked her mother for teaching her lessons       about knocking out, O'Nans other daughter, Meg O'Nan-Holmes       spoke about how she admired her mother throughout her life       for so many things.        ``For the entirety of my life, I've admired you,'' said Meg       O'Nan-Holmes. ``But the biggest thing I admire is how strong       you are. When I think about strong women, I think about       her.''        ``I'm not a businesswoman. I'm an old school teacher, and       I'm very proud to be an old school teacher,'' said O'Nan.       ``It's an honor to stand in front of you today. When my       daughters were three and six, my husband did pass away.''        O'Nan stated through all the pain and sorrow, a friend of       hers said that she had been given a gift. She would have a       special relationship with both of her daughters.        ``I've done some really fun things in life, received honors       I probably only half deserve, but in no way ever can I ever       dispute the fact that the greatest part of my life is these       two girls,'' said O'Nan. ``They are my life. And life is to       be fun.''        O'Nan pointed out the women at her table, who work in       Mayfield's city government.        ``There are ten women who work in our government--if you       were my student, you should know how important women getting       the right to vote is to me,'' said O'Nan. ``I always talked       about my hero, Alice Hall. These ten women who sit with me at       this table would not be here in this position today if it       were not for our sisters who fought before us, to get us that       way. To have a right to vote, to serve--to realize our       importance.''        Keynote speaker Alyson Van Hooser, spoke on the true       meaning of leadership. She noted that meeting a need, and       seeing a need is the importance of a true leader. That       leadership is not a title, however, it is a characteristic.        Attendees were given a copy of Van Hooser's book,       `Accelerate Your Success,' along with a goodie bag filled       with items from this year's sponsors.        The following were sponsors of the event: Mayfield Consumer       Products, FNB Bank, Re-Fabbed Boutique, Fox Wealth       Management, US Bank, CFSB, WK&T, First Kentucky Bank, Regions       Bank, Mayfield Water and Electric Systems, West Kentucky       Rural Electric, AwardMasters, Centrifugal Technologies,       CPlant Federal Credit Union, Kyle  [[Page S2242]]       Smith Designs, Graves County Economic Development, and       Pilgrims.                            ____________________
