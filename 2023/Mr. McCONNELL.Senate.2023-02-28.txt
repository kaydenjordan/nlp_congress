 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICE. Without objection, it is so ordered.                            ____________________     Mr. President, Washington Democrats' reckless spending  has embedded painful inflation deep in our economy. Runaway prices are  making families' monthly budgets harder to balance. And as interest  rates rise, the financial markets where millions of Americans invest  their life savings are becoming literally more volatile.   Short-term bond yields are trading at their highest levels since the  precipice of the Great Recession in 2007. Indications of expected stock  market volatility appear to be actually on the upswing.   But with Americans' retirement accounts already in jeopardy,  Democrats have gone looking for still more ways to put workers' savings  at even greater risk. The Biden administration is trying to enact a  radical new regulation that would help liberals use Americans' very own  retirement savings as financial muscle for political causes they may  not even support.   The Labor Department's proposed new rule would water down financial  managers' fiduciary obligation to get the best return for their  clients. This administration wants to let the fund managers prioritize  extraneous factors--from companies' carbon footprints to various HR  policies--when deciding where to invest hard-working Americans'  savings.   The Biden administration wants to let Wall Street use its workers'  hard-earned savings to pursue leftwing political initiatives instead of  trying to maximize the returns for their clients' retirements.  Democrats want to let money managers making these unrelated ideological  goals a higher priority than getting their clients, ordinary American  workers, the best returns for their own retirements.   Not surprisingly, studies suggest that investment funds where the  managers put a political thumb on the scale in this particular fashion  tend, not surprisingly, to underperform normal investments. When you  put ideology ahead of seeking the highest returns, well, the returns,  of course, suffer. And if the Democrats have their way, the losers will  be ordinary American workers who have spent their whole careers putting  money away for their retirement. In effect, we are talking about  letting financial companies garnish the retirement savings of workers,  without their permission, in order to pursue unrelated liberal  political goals.   The Biden administration wants to put American workers in a position  where portions of their potential returns on their retirement savings  could be effectively donated away to leftwing political causes without  their consent.  [[Page S511]]    What a disastrous way to pile onto the pain they have already caused  millions of American families.   I am grateful to my colleague from Indiana, Senator Braun, and to my  friend and fellow Kentuckian Congressman   Andy Barr for leading a  bipartisan resolution in both Houses to make sure that Americans'  retirement accounts are about one thing: maximizing returns on  investments. I will be proud to support this commonsense measure later  this week.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on another matter, crime in our  Nation's Capital is literally out of control. Washington, DC, has  already seen about three dozen homicides in just the first 2 months of  the year. This is a 35-percent increase over last year's pace. There  have been more than 1,300 thefts from autos--a 25-percent increase over  last year's pace--and more than 1,100 thefts of motor vehicles,  including carjackings, more than doubling last year's pace for a  shattering 109-percent increase.   At best, the liberal city politicians who have presided over this  ongoing collapse in law and order are doing basically nothing. The  Mayor recently announced that the city will hand out free steering  wheel locks to residents who own certain kinds of vehicles.   But some local officials are not content with doing nothing and have  set their minds to making the situation actually worse. The city  council just passed a new criminal code designed to go even softer  still on crime, reducing penalties for a number of violent offenses and  property crimes.   To a unique degree, unlike any other city in America, Washington, DC,  issues are national issues. The District of Columbia doesn't belong to  a handful of local politicians; it belongs to more than 330 million  American citizens. The people need their government to function in  safety. Families and school groups need to be able to come tour the  Capital, which their own tax dollars help finance, in peace of body and  peace of mind.   This is why the Constitution entrusts our seat of government to a  Federal district. It is why Federal law gives Congress the ability to  step in and help govern our Nation's Capital City if local politicians  fail to take care of basic business.   Now, amazingly, the same Washington Democrats who have spent the last  several years trying to steamroll localism and federalism in every way  possible are now, all of a sudden, indignant at the notion that  Congress might toughen up penalties for violent crime here in the  District.   Just last year alone, Democrats, right here in this Chamber, tried to  break the Senate rules so they could micromanage every county in  America's election laws. They tried to ram through a bill that would  have swept away State and local laws and forced every community in  America to adopt radical abortion laws on par with China and North  Korea. Over the last 2 years, Democrats have passed bill after bill  that spent trillions of dollars to interfere in American families'  lives and put more of our society under the thumb of Federal  bureaucrats.   So when it comes to radical far-left priorities, Washington Democrats  have no qualms whatsoever about this city steamrolling 50 States and  local communities. They vote for that outcome 8 days a week. But now,  when public safety is in free fall in our Federal city itself, now  Washington Democrats pretend they have become small government  federalists and they want Congress out of the picture. This is a  desperate attempt to change the subject, and it could not be less  persuasive.    Democrats want Washington, DC, to take over every State law, even  small business decisions and every family's financial choices. But we  are supposed to believe that cleaning up violent crime in Washington,  DC, itself, would be a bridge too far. Really?   They are just trying to duck the real debate. Democrats want to  debate anything and everything beside violent crime itself because the  modern Democratic Party and its coalitions have decided it is more  important to have compassion for serial violent felons than for  innocent citizens who just want to live their lives.   That is the issue here--a binary choice. Should we be softer on crime  like Democrats want at the State, local, and Federal levels, or should  we be tougher on crime like Republicans and the American people want?  That is the debate.   I want to thank Senator Hagerty for spearheading the commonsense  resolution that would nullify the DC Council's insane pro-criminal  legislation and bring at least an ounce of common sense back to the  American people's Federal city.                            ____________________     I suggest the absence of a quorum.
