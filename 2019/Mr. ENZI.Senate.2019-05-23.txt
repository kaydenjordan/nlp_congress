 Mr. President, section 251 of the Balanced Budget and  Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, BBEDCA, establishes statutory  limits on discretionary spending and allows for various adjustments to  those limits. In addition, sections 302 and 314(a) of the Congressional  Budget Act of 1974 allow the chairman of the Budget Committee to  establish and make revisions to allocations, aggregates, and levels  consistent with those adjustments.   The Senate will soon consider S. Amdt. 250 to H.R. 2157, Supplemental  Appropriations Act, 2019. This measure provides appropriations to  address recent natural disasters and contains spending that qualifies  for cap adjustments under current statute.   This measure includes $19,121 million in budget authority that is  designated as being for emergency purposes pursuant to section  251(b)(2)(A)(i) of BBEDCA. Of that amount, $2,693 million is for  spending in the security category, and $16,428 million is for  nonsecurity spending. CBO estimates that this budget authority will  result in $5,364 million in outlays in fiscal year 2019.   As a result of the aforementioned designations, I am revising the  budget authority and outlay allocations to the Committee on  Appropriations by increasing revised security budget authority by  $2,693 million, revised nonsecurity budget authority by $16,428  million, and outlays by $5,364 million in fiscal year 2019. Further, I  am increasing the budgetary aggregate for fiscal year 2019 by $19,121  million in budget authority and $5,364 million in outlays.   I ask unanimous consent that the accompanying tables, which provide  details about the adjustment, be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                      REVISION TO BUDGETARY AGGREGATES  (Pursuant to Sections 311 and 314(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of                                   1974) ------------------------------------------------------------------------                  $ in millions                             2019 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Current Spending Aggregates:     Budget Authority...........................                3,639,324     Outlays....................................                3,550,009 Adjustments:     Budget Authority...........................                   19,121     Outlays....................................                    5,364 Revised Spending Aggregates:     Budget Authority...........................                3,658,445     Outlays....................................                3,555,373 ------------------------------------------------------------------------    REVISION TO SPENDING ALLOCATION TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS FOR                             FISCAL YEAR 2019  (Pursuant to Sections 302 and 314(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of                                   1974) ------------------------------------------------------------------------                  $ in millions                             2019 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Current Allocation:     Revised Security Discretionary Budget                        716,000      Authority.................................

This is a milestone for the  Stampede, for Cody, and for Wyoming. One hundred years of the Cody  Stampede Rodeo represents 100 years of us living life the cowboy way.  The cowboy and the rodeo is an integral part of our culture, and this  100th anniversary is a chance to celebrate this long standing history.   The rodeo has long been a part of Wyoming history. Wyoming is often  referred to as the Cowboy State as a reference to its cowboy culture.  At the heart of cowboy culture lies the rodeo. We hold rodeos all over  the State in almost every single town.   Rodeo is in some ways the West's ambassador to the world. With our  bucking horse license plate and visitors' conceptions of the Wild West,  cowboys and rodeo are what they see and expect to see first. Through  the efforts of all who participate, the sport of rodeo continues to  grow. It is a part of western tradition that can be shared and enjoyed  by visitors and residents alike.   The rodeo is a part of our livelihood that is unique to the Cowboy  State and the West. The relationship between the rodeo and the West is  much like the relationship between a cowboy and his horse. Few pairings  have produced a more perfect partnership and the image of a cowboy and  his horse remains an American icon. When one imagines a cowboy, he is  rarely without his horse companion.   The American cowboy represents the greatest parts of the American  West: our courage, honor, and hard work ethic. The cowboy way provides  an ethical code for cowboys to live by. All rodeo participants embody  this cowboy way when competing in the arena, providing the world with a  prime example of the code all Wyomingites live by.   Cody is nicknamed the Rodeo Capitol of the World. Rodeo in Cody began  over 100 years ago with William Frederick ``Buffalo Bill'' Cody and his  Wild West Show. The Wild West Show was never formally held in Cody but  the tryouts for the show were held right behind the Irma Hotel. In  1913, Buffalo Bill closed his Wild West Show. He hosted one last parade  and rodeo in Cody for the prince of Monaco.   In 1917, Buffalo Bill passed away and with that ended a fascinating  chapter in the story of the American Wild West. In 1919, Clarence  Williams led the effort to establish a rodeo celebration in Cody to  commemorate Buffalo Bill and the Old West he personified. Every summer  since 1919, people from all over come to watch cowboys compete in the  Cody Stampede Rodeo, as well as the rodeos held every night from June  to Labor Day.   For its centennial year, the Cody Stampede Board is being inducted  into the Professional Rodeo Cowboy Hall of Fame. This is a great  accomplishment for the town and the Stampede.   Caroline Lockhart was the founder and first president of the Cody  Stampede Board. Caroline was considered a liberated, independent women  ahead of her time. She was described as someone ``with a spirit as wild  as the West.'' Last November, she was inducted into the Cowgirl Hall of  Fame. As we approach the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment, which  granted women the right to vote across the country, it is important to  recognize Wyoming's history of women leaders, like Caroline. Caroline  Lockhart is a great example of the trailblazer nature of our great  State.   As a trailblazer State, women in Wyoming were voting long before the  19th Amendment was passed. Wyoming is coming up on the 150th  anniversary of women's suffrage. In December 1869, Wyoming's  territorial legislature became the first government in the world to  grant women the right to vote. Called the Equality State, we have the  distinction of having the first woman to serve as Governor and the  first woman to vote in the world. Rodeo exemplifies the nature of the  Equality State through its history of inclusion and acceptance.   There are many great sports, but there are probably none as demanding  or difficult as Rodeo. That is why it continues to grow in popularity  and participation. It requires a tremendous combination of athletic  ability, concentration, and dedication from its participants. It takes  a lot of courage to face the challenges of the sport and give it your  very best.   Rodeo also does a lot to build character and increase the self- confidence  [[Page S3102]]  of those who participate in the sport. Best of all, it is something the  whole family can take part in, either in the arena or in the stands,  cheering family and friends on to victory.   The hard work of those who compete in rodeos represents the ``can  do'' spirit of the West. It is great to see the entire community come  together year after year as volunteers, participants, and fans for the  Cody Stampede Rodeo. Again, I congratulate Cody on their 100th  anniversary of the Cody Stampede Rodeo and wish the best for another  100 years of doing things the Cowboy way.                            ____________________
