 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Pastor Frank  Hampton, Jr., as he celebrates 50 years of ministry at the Church of  God in Jackson, Michigan.   Over the years, Pastor Hampton has been a steady example of what it  means to be a father, a pastor, a mentor, and a community servant.   In addition to faithfully shepherding his congregation, Pastor  Hampton has served as a volunteer chaplain for Allegiance Health,  counseled disadvantaged youth, and helped build strong leaders in the  community.   He has worked in conjunction with Jackson's judicial system, Jackson  Public Schools, Jackson County Jail, and the Interfaith Shelter.   The longevity of his service to his congregation and to the community  is a reflection of his mission to make a profound difference in the  lives of everyone he meets.   Pastor Hampton is a remarkable man of integrity, perseverance, and  servant leadership. His 50 years of ministry have set the standard for  our community. I congratulate him on his milestone and pray for God's  many blessings in the years ahead.                            ____________________
