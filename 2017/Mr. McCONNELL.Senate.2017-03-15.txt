 Mr. President, a few short months ago, our colleague  Dan Coats retired from his post here in the Senate. At that time, I had  a chance to reflect on our friend's impressive career, and I noted that  we could expect him to rise to the occasion if called to serve his  country once again. Well, that is exactly what Dan Coats is doing now.  This time he will be taking on the role of Director of National  Intelligence. It goes without saying that the President made an  excellent choice in selecting Dan for this job.   Our former colleague from Indiana has served his Nation in the Army,  in the House of Representatives, as the Ambassador to Germany, and, of  course, he has also served his State here in the Senate where he was a  leader on issues regarding our national security and intelligence  community. I look forward to the Senate confirming him today.   We are also working toward an opportunity to support another of the  President's exceptional selections, LTG H.R. McMaster, his choice for  National Security Advisor. The Chairman of the Armed Services Committee  recently called him ``an outstanding choice'' and ``a man of genuine  intellect, character, and ability.''   He will now be tasked with adapting his vast experience to the  responsibility of coordinating our national security policy at a time  when our Nation faces myriad threats and challenges. I know each of us  appreciates the willingness of both former Senator Coats and General  McMaster to take on these challenging positions and their continued  efforts to keep our country safe.   Now onto another well-qualified nominee we will advance soon. Next  week Judge Neil Gorsuch will come before the Senate Judiciary Committee  for the hearing on his nomination to the Supreme Court. Senators from  both sides of the aisle will have an opportunity to hear from him  directly, ask questions, and listen to the testimony of others who are  familiar with his professional background, abilities, and character.   I know we are all looking forward to his hearing and to learning even  more about this exceptional nominee, but here is what we already know  about Judge Gorsuch. The American Bar Association is an organization  that the Democratic leader and former Democratic chairman of the  Judiciary Committee have deemed the gold standard for evaluating  judicial nominations. What have they done? They awarded him their  highest rating: unanimously ``well qualified.''   Leading liberal lawyers like former President Obama's Acting  Solicitor General, Neal Katyal, and former President Obama's legal  mentor, Professor Laurence Tribe, sing his praises. Mr. Katyal says  Judge Gorsuch is ``an extraordinary judge and man'' whose ``years on  the bench reveal a commitment to judicial independence.'' Professor  Tribe says that Judge Gorsuch ``is a brilliant, terrific guy who would  do the Court's work with distinction.''   To that list, you can now add former law partner and longtime  Democrat, David Frederick, who is a board member of the liberal  American Constitution Society. Other board members of the ACS include  people like former Obama Solicitor General Donald Verrilli, and left- leaning law professor Erwin Chemerinsky, among others.   The ACS is anything but a conservative group. Yet now, even one of  its own board members has backed Judge Gorsuch's nomination. In an op- ed recently published by the Washington Post, Mr. Frederick called  Judge Gorsuch ``brilliant, diligent, open-minded and thoughtful.'' He  went on to say:         Gorsuch's approach to resolving legal problems as a lawyer       and judge embodies a reverence for our country's values and       legal system. The facts developed in a case matter to him;       the legal rules established by legislatures and through       precedent deserve deep respect; and the importance of       treating litigants, counsel and colleagues with civility is       deeply ingrained in him.   [[Page S1810]]     Mr. Frederick, who practiced law with Judge Gorsuch, states:         Over the course of his career, [Neil Gorsuch] has       represented both plaintiffs and defendants. He has defended       large corporations, but also sued them. He has advocated for       the Chamber of Commerce, but also filed (and prevailed with)       class actions on behalf of consumers. We should applaud such       independence of mind and spirit in Supreme Court nominees.    And Mr. Frederick observes:         As a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th       Circuit, Gorsuch has not been the reflexive, hard-edged       conservative as many depict him to be. He has ruled for       plaintiffs and for defendants; for those accused of crimes as       well as for law enforcement; for those who entered the       country illegally; and for those harmed by environmental       damage.    As this self-proclaimed ``longtime supporter of Democratic candidates  and progressive causes'' points out, Judge Gorsuch will be the type of  Justice each of us should want on the High Court. And though he knows  he may not always agree with Neil Gorsuch's rulings as a jurist on the  Supreme Court, Frederick says we need judges like Neil Gorsuch ``who  approach cases with fairness and intellectual rigor, and who care about  precedent and the limits of their roles as judges.''   The bottom line is this: ``The Senate should confirm him because  there is no principled reason to vote no.'' Let me repeat that. ``The  Senate should confirm [Gorsuch],'' Frederick said, ``because there is  no principled reason to vote no.'' This is a board member of the left's  flagship legal group in America, and on this point, he happens to be  absolutely right.   So as colleagues on both sides will continue to find at next week's  hearings, ``there is [simply] no principled reason to vote no'' when  Judge Gorsuch's nomination comes before the full Senate.                            ____________________     Mr. President, one final matter: Last year, President  Obama said his signature healthcare law had ``real problems.'' He  recognized that there are ``people who are hurt by premium increases or  a lack of competition and choice.'' President Clinton called it ``the  craziest thing in the world.'' And the Democratic Governor of Minnesota  said that ``the Affordable Care Act was no longer affordable for  increasing numbers of people.'' So even Democrats recognize that the  ObamaCare status quo is unacceptable.   Costs have continued to climb higher. Insurers have dropped out of  the marketplace. ObamaCare is a disaster, and it is going to keep  getting worse unless we act. My home State of Kentucky, like so many  others across the country, just can't take it anymore.   Republicans promised the American people relief from ObamaCare, and  we are working hard to keep that promise. The legislation the House  introduced to repeal and replace is already moving through the  committee process.   Here are some things the Congressional Budget Office said about it:  It will lower premiums by double digits. It will help stabilize the  healthcare market. It will significantly reduce taxes on families and  lower the deficit by hundreds of billions of dollars as well. These are  the things we heard from CBO.   Instead of forcing Americans to buy something they may not want as  ObamaCare does, it will actually give Americans the freedom to choose  the type of coverage that is right for them. I appreciate the hard work  the House is doing to advance this legislation. We look forward to  receiving it here in the Senate. When we do, I expect to consider  amendments as part of our robust debate.   But remember, this bill is only one part of a three-pronged strategy  to help bring relief to the American people. The first prong is this  bill, the second prong is executive action, and prong three is more  legislation to reform the healthcare market and make it more  competitive for consumers.   The one thing we shouldn't do is nothing. ObamaCare is a failed law  that is hurting the middle class. Maintaining the current ObamaCare  status quo is really not a good option.   We are fulfilling our promise to the American people, and I urge all  of our colleagues to join us.                            ____________________
