 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of both the amendments to H.R. 550  under consideration today. I thank the Speaker for her courage in  bringing these bills to the floor, and I thank the sponsors, my  friends, Barbara Lee and Ro Khanna for their leadership.   It is long past time for the 2002 AUMF to be repealed. This vaguely  worded authorization of force against Iraq, which was obtained under  false pretenses by the George W. Bush administration, has long posed a  problem for proper congressional oversight, though at various points in  time, both parties have shied away from taking action to rectify this.   But now we have no choice but to act, as the Trump administration  argues that the 2002 AUMF which justifies war against Saddam Hussein's  Iraq apparently applies to members of the Iranian Government, even  though the word ``Iran'' appears nowhere in the text.   As Congress, we must assert our constitutional oversight authority in  matters of war. Permitting this and future administrations to rely on  an open-ended authorization of force without proper oversight, is  nothing less than an abrogation of our duty.   I urge each of my colleagues to support this amendment and final  passage of the bill.    Madam Speaker, if I may just respond to some arguments  that this will undermine our rights to self-defense. The President  always has a legal right to defend America and defend U.S. forces and  embassies. This resolution explicitly exempts the defensive actions  described in the War Powers Resolution.   The War Powers Resolution has been around since 1973 and has never  prevented the President from defending America. So that argument simply  is baseless, and I urge all of my colleagues to support both of these  excellent amendments.
