 Mr. Speaker, I want to specifically thank Chairman  Takano  [[Page H8134]]  and Ranking Member Roe for bringing this bill to the floor and allowing  this much-deserved recognition of two young heroes from Odessa, Texas.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the official citations from each  of the awards of the Medal of Honor to Alfred ``Mac'' Wilson and Rex  Young.                             Wilson, Alfred M.       Rank: Private First Class Organization: U.S. Marine Corps      Company: Company M, 3d Battalion Division: 9th Marines, 3d           Marine Division      Born: 13 January 1948, Olney, Ill. Departed: Yes      Place/Date: Quang Tri Province, Republic of Vietnam, 3 March           1969                                   Citation         For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of       his life above and beyond the call of duty while serving as a       rifleman with Company M in action against hostile forces.       While returning from a reconnaissance-in-force mission in the       vicinity of Fire Support Base Cunningham, the 1st Platoon of       Company M came under intense automatic weapons fire and a       grenade attack from a well concealed enemy force. As the       center of the column was pinned down, the leading squad moved       to outflank the enemy. Pfc. Wilson, acting as squad leader of       the rear squad, skillfully maneuvered his men to form a base       of fire and act as a blocking force. In the ensuing fire       fight, both his machine gunner and assistant machine gunner       were seriously wounded and unable to operate their weapons.       Realizing the urgent need to bring the weapon into operation       again, Pfc. Wilson, followed by another marine and with       complete disregard for his safety, fearlessly dashed across       the fire-swept terrain to recover the weapon. As they reached       the machinegun, an enemy soldier stepped from behind a tree       and threw a grenade toward the 2 marines. Observing the       grenade fall between himself and the other marine, Pfc.       Wilson, fully realizing the inevitable result of his actions,       shouted to his companion and unhesitating threw himself on       the grenade, absorbing the full force of the explosion with       his own body. His heroic actions inspired his platoon members       to maximum effort as they aggressively attacked and defeated       the enemy. Pfc. Wilson's indomitable courage, inspiring valor       and selfless devotion to duty upheld the highest traditions       of the Marine Corps and the U.S. Naval Service. He gallantly       gave his life for his country.                                   ____                               Young, Marvin R.       Rank: Staff Sergeant Organization: U.S. Army      Company: Company C, 1st Battalion Division: 5th Infantry,           25th Infantry Division      Born: 11 May 1947, Alpine, Tex. Departed: Yes      Place/Date: Near Ben Cui, Republic of Vietnam, 21 August 1968                                   Citation         For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity in action at the       risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty. S/Sgt.       Young distinguished himself at the cost of his life while       serving as a squad leader with Company C. While conducting a       reconnaissance mission in the vicinity of Ben Cui, Company C       was suddenly engaged by an estimated regimental-size force of       the North Vietnamese Army. During the initial volley of fire       the point element of the 1st Platoon was pinned down,       sustaining several casualties, and the acting platoon leader       was killed. S/Sgt. Young unhesitatingly assumed command of       the platoon and began to organize and deploy his men into a       defensive position in order to repel the attacking force. As       a human wave attack advanced on S/Sgt. Young's platoon, he       moved from position to position, encouraging and directing       fire on the hostile insurgents while exposing himself to the       hail of enemy bullets. After receiving orders to withdraw to       a better defensive position, he remained behind to provide       covering fire for the withdrawal. Observing that a small       element of the point squad was unable to extract itself from       its position, and completely disregarding his personal       safety, S/Sgt. Young began moving toward their position,       firing as he maneuvered. When halfway to their position he       sustained a critical head injury, yet he continued his       mission and ordered the element to withdraw. Remaining with       the squad as it fought its way to the rear, he was twice       seriously wounded in the arm and leg. Although his leg was       badly shattered, S/Sgt. Young refused assistance that would       have slowed the retreat of his comrades, and he ordered them       to continue their withdrawal while he provided protective       covering fire. With indomitable courage and heroic self-      sacrifice, he continued his self-assigned mission until the       enemy force engulfed his position. By his gallantry at the       cost of his life are in the highest traditions of the       military service, S/Sgt. Young has reflected great credit       upon himself, his unit, and the U.S. Army.     Mr. Speaker, both our previous speakers have described  the last days that Mac and Rex spent on this Earth.   I had the privilege of going to high school with Rex. He was a year  older than I. Rex and I played on the football team together. Rex was a  really good baseball player.   I did not have the privilege of knowing Mac. He went to our across- town rival. He was also a wonderful young man.   Mr. Speaker, I want to specifically thank all of those men and women  in Odessa, Texas, who, for years now, have attempted and worked really  hard at maintaining the memory of Mac and Rex in our communities. They  have done great work, and, without their support and efforts, I don't  know if we would have gotten this done as well.   Odessa, Texas, at that point in time, in the late sixties, was a town  of about 80,000 or so folks. Medal of Honor recipients are really rare,  and to have two of them come from one west Texas town is a high honor.   Both these men embody the west Texas values of selflessness, courage,  and devotion to one's country, and their gallant sacrifices serve as a  somber reminder to all of us of the price that some have paid to secure  our freedoms.   Mr. Speaker, on Memorial Day every year we honor all of our  servicemen and -women who have given that ultimate sacrifice on the  altar of freedom, as we should.   When I give speeches and talk to folks back home during that time  frame, I ask people to make it personal. We talk about them as a group,  and it loses some of the punch, some of the impact, so I ask my folks  back home to find somebody specifically who gave that sacrifice and  made that sacrifice and to think about them on that day. For me, every  year, it is Rex.   The VA clinic there in Odessa, Texas, will now bear both their names,  and all of those untold numbers of current vets and future vets who  will walk through those doors and receive the care that they have  earned from their service to our Nation will see those two names and  will know that two of their own were honored appropriately by having  that VA clinic named after them.   I want to thank the hospital in Odessa, Texas, which actually owns  the building, for allowing us to do that, and I thank the VA system  itself for working so hard to get this done. I am looking forward to  the ceremony that we will conduct.   I also want to thank Senators Cruz and Cornyn in the Senate for  introducing the companion legislation in the Senate so that we can get  that done over there and then move to appropriately honor two of  America's finest, two young men who woke up one morning, their last day  on Earth, and then went out and did something stunningly heroic. I  don't know that they necessarily knew that day they were going to do  it, but they did it, and they have earned this medal and they have  earned this recognition and our deep, lasting gratitude for their  sacrifices.                                time  1715
