 Madam Speaker, if you listen carefully, you can hear  drums faintly in the background. It is not a prayer circle. It is John  Bolton down at the White House, beating the drums of war.   This is the same John Bolton who thought invading Iraq was a really,  really great idea. In fact, he said, ``I expect that the American role  actually will be fairly minimal.'' Minimal? The greatest foreign policy  mistake in the history of the United States of America fairly minimal?   Now he wants to do the same thing in Iran.   Iraq was one thing, with Saddam Hussein in a relatively small  country. Iran? Really, buddy? He hasn't seen any problem around the  world that you can't change by regime change: North Korea, regime  change; Venezuela, oh, that worked out really well a couple of weeks  ago, regime change; now Iran.   What about Russia? He is kind of quiet about Russia. I wonder why  that is. It might have something to do with his boss.   Now, his boss goes back and forth: War, no war. War, no war. I don't  know.   We have to hope Bolton doesn't win this debate. He has never  repented. He said, in 2019, ``I still think the decision to overthrow  Saddam was correct.'' The same guy said, ``I confess I had no desire to  die in a Southeast Asian rice paddy.'' Chicken hawk.                            ____________________
