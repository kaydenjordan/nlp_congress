 Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for the time to  speak on this.   Mr. Chair, I do rise in opposition to the amendment. I thank my  colleague, Mr. Diaz-Balart, for his leadership on this bill.   While certainly I don't think any of us want to send American dollars  to terrorists, I do think this amendment would effectively prohibit  financial assistance that is key to protecting religious minorities in  Iraq.   The United States has long been committed to the principle of  promoting religious freedom around the world, and our support for Iraq  for this purpose is no exception.    As drafted, the amendment before us would eliminate critical  assistance to religious and ethnic minorities, including the Christian  Chaldeans, and Assyrians, who have been victims of ISIS extremism and  genocide.   These people have suffered unspeakable harm in the name of their  religious beliefs and, quite honestly, their Christian beliefs, and  they need our assistance.   Mr. Chair, I would encourage my colleagues to oppose this amendment.
