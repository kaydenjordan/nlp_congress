Born in Austria, he eventually made his way to San Diego and enlisted  in the Army as World War II approached. In 1941, Munk returned to San  Diego's Scripps Institute of Oceanography to work in the U.S. Navy  Radio and Sound Laboratory.   The scope of Walter Munk's work was vast. He helped meteorologists  predict the waves troops would face in Normandy during World War II and  developed methods incorporated into modern tsunami warning networks.  His passion for his work and for San Diego also led him to push to  build the UC San Diego campus in the 1960s.   Later in life, and bolstered by years of expertise, Munk brought  attention to climate change and conferred with figures like Pope  Francis and the Dalai Lama to advocate for action. His work earned him  the National Medal of Science and the Kyoto Prize.   In his honor, I have proclaimed October 19 Walter Munk World Oceans  Day in California's 52nd Congressional District.                            ____________________
