 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss  our national debt. In 2022, Speaker McCarthy unveiled the Commitment to  America which outlines the Republican platform for governing as we took  control of the House in the 118th Congress.   Through our plan, it is critical we support policies that lead to a  strong, healthy economy, fight inflation, and lower the cost of living.  We must rein in reckless spending here in Washington and root out  waste, fraud, and abuse in government.   For the last 2 years, the Biden administration has been left  unchecked. Because of their policies, we have seen record-breaking  inflation, skyrocketing gas and grocery prices, and increases to daily  expenses. Hard-working families are forced to decide between feeding  their families or paying the heat and electric bills.   These economic hardships are brought on by unrestricted reckless  spending. That irresponsible spending stops now. With $31.4 trillion in  national debt, House Republicans are committed to finding a reasonable,  practical, and responsible solution to raising the debt ceiling. Just  like millions of Americans are forced to make difficult financial  decisions to make ends meet, we must finally address out-of-control  government spending if we want to put America on a better fiscal path.    Mr. Speaker, I heard from hundreds of my constituents who are  concerned about America's checkbook. On December 16, 2021, Congress  voted to increase the national borrowing limit to $31.4 trillion, an  increase of $2.5 trillion more than the previous allowance. This bill  kicked the proverbial can down the road until now when we are, once  again, faced with raising the Federal debt ceiling even further.   In recent years, the Federal debt has ballooned because of many of  the Biden administration's policies, including the student loan  repayment pause and forgiveness, Congressional Democrats'  multitrillion-dollar spending spree, and rising interest rates stemming  from historic inflation.   The first step toward reducing the debt is controlling the annual  deficit. To fully address the drivers of the national debt, Members of  both parties and the President will have to come to an agreement in  addressing unchecked mandatory spending and reckless discretionary  spending priorities.   Mr. Speaker, as part of my commitment to America, I will continue to  work to rein in government waste, fraud, and abuse, while limiting  skyrocketing government program costs and finding solutions on reducing  our national debt.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  congratulate Dot Monahan of Oil City and Ryan Kunselman of Clarion for  their people's choice awards in the Pennsylvania Parks and Forests  Foundation's 2022 photo contest.
