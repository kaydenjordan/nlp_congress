 Mr. President, today is Texas Independence Day. One hundred  eighty-six years ago today, Texans declared our independence from  Mexico, and we fired a shot for liberty that was heard around the  world.   As I have done a number of years in the past, I am going to read the  letter from the Alamo that Lieutenant Colonel William Barret Travis  wrote calling for help. It is a letter that energized Texans across our  great State and that energized lovers of liberty everywhere.   I read this letter the very first time that I ever stood and spoke on  the Senate floor, and these are the words that inspire us even 186  years after they were written.   Colonel Travis writes:         To the People of Texas & All Americans in the World--        Fellow Citizens & compatriots--I am besieged, by a thousand       or more of the Mexicans under Santa Anna--I have sustained a       continual Bombardment & cannonade for 24 hours & have not       lost a man--The enemy has demanded a surrender at discretion,       otherwise, the garrison are to be put to the sword, if the       fort is taken--I have answered the demand with a cannon shot,       & our flag still waves proudly from the walls--I shall never       surrender or retreat. Then, I call on you in the name of       Liberty, of patriotism & everything dear to the American       character, to come to our aid, with all dispatch--    The enemy is receiving reinforcements daily & will no doubt increase  to three or four thousand in four or five days. If this call is  neglected, I am determined to sustain myself as long as possible & die  like a soldier who never forgets what is due to his own honor & that of  his country--Victory or Death.         William Barret Travis, Lt.Col.comdt.        PS: The Lord is on our side--When the enemy appeared in       sight we had not three bushels of corn--We have since found       in deserted houses 80 or 90 bushels and got into the walls 20       or 30 head of Beeves.        Travis.    The brave men and women at the Alamo would go on to give their lives  for liberty, including Travis, Jim Bowie, and Davy Crockett.   Shortly thereafter, the Texans were victorious at the Battle of San  Jacinto. With a cry in the air of ``Remember the Alamo,'' the heroes  who gave their lives for liberty inspired a successful revolution, and  the Republic of Texas was formed.   Sam Houston, one of the founding fathers of the Lone Star State, was  also born on this very day 229 years ago.   Sam Houston was a great American. He was born in Virginia and spent  many years in Tennessee, where he served in the U.S. House of  Representatives and then became the Governor of Tennessee. In Texas, he  was the George Washington of Texas. He served as the commander in chief  for the Texas Army and led the Texas Army to victory in our revolution.  When Texas became independent, Houston served in the Texas House of  Representatives and then as President of the Republic of Texas. When  Texas joined the United States, he served in the U.S. Senate and then,  finally, as the Governor of Texas.   He was a tireless, talented leader and a great statesman who believed  in freedom. His words, ``Govern wisely and as little as possible,'' are  still true today, and the Lone Star State still endeavors to follow  that principle.   The Republic of Texas was an independent nation from 1836 to 1845-- for 9 years. Then Texas joined the United States of America.   Indeed, there is one fact I discovered a couple of years ago. Heidi  and I are members of the First Baptist Church in Houston. We discovered  that the First Baptist Church was actually started by American  missionaries in a foreign country. Texas was an independent nation, and  American missionaries came to the Republic of Texas and founded the  First Baptist Church, which, today, thrives in my hometown of Houston.   Texans are proud Americans, but we are also proud of the history--the  diverse, brave, extraordinary history--of those Texans all those years  later. William Travis, Sam Houston, Jim Bowie, Davy Crockett, and all  of the people they led risked everything to make freedom a reality for  generations of Texans.   I am reminded of a story that was told to me by a former Senator from  Texas, my friend Phil Gramm.   Phil Gramm, in the early 1980s, was a Member of the House of  Representatives. He was a Democrat. He was a conservative Democrat.  Ronald Reagan was President, and Phil Gramm, as a conservative Democrat  in the House, introduced the Reagan tax cuts, and he fought for the  Reagan tax cuts. Phil described a meeting with other conservative  Democrats in Texas back when we had conservative Democrats in Texas--a  meeting wherein he was urging his fellow Democrats to support the  Reagan tax cuts. Phil drew an analogy to the Alamo on that fateful day  when Colonel Travis drew a line in the sand with a sword and called on  each of the men there to step across that line and commit to defending  the Alamo.   One of those other conservative Democrats said to him at the time:  Phil, everybody who stepped across that line died.   Phil, in not missing a beat, chuckled and said: Yes. Yes, they did.  And do you know what? Everybody who didn't step across that line died,  too, and nobody remembers their names.   Today, I celebrate heroes--heroes who fought to make freedom a  reality for generations of Texans. Today, we celebrate, and we honor  their sacrifices.   To every Texan, I wish you a very happy Texas Independence Day.   I yield the floor.
