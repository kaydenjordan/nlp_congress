 Mr. Speaker, with the departure of Marty Walsh from the  Labor Department, President Biden has nominated Deputy Secretary Julie  Su to succeed him.   For those of us in California, this decision was very hard to  understand. Ms. Su's record as our State's labor secretary under  Governor Gavin Newsom is well known because it had such negative  consequences for so many people.   Having seen my constituents suffer at the hands of Ms. Su's  mismanagement and antiworker agenda, I have felt compelled to make sure  the facts come to light in the confirmation process.   As chair of the House Subcommittee on Workforce Protections, I held a  hearing last week highlighting the countless livelihoods she destroyed  as secretary of labor in California.   Mr. Speaker, I don't want the rest of the country to suffer the way  California has. Our State had the highest unemployment rate for much of  the  [[Page H2109]]  COVID era. We had the Nation's highest poverty rate. In recent years,  we have been last in the country in income growth and first in the  country in U-Haul rentals.   I am joined today by several colleagues who don't want this for their  States or for the rest of the country. They have joined us here for  this Special Order to discuss what a Julie Su-led Labor Department  would mean for their constituents and to urge President Biden to  withdraw this nomination.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Moran).    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Moran for his comments.   He really hit the nail on the head, that if this nomination goes  through, it is hardworking Americans--millions of American workers--who  will pay the price.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Good).    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Good for his remarks. His point  about making the rest of the country like California is explicitly what  they are trying to do here.   President Biden has cited the labor law that Julie Su was in charge  of enforcing in California as his model for labor relations nationwide.  In fact, the Labor Department is now trying to emulate it in order to  cause the same harm to all American workers that California workers  have already suffered.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Mrs. Miller).    Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Miller for her  remarks. She brings up a very important  [[Page H2110]]  point. With everything that has been going on with the economy and  everything that happened during COVID, it really is stunning that we  had people in positions of power like Julie Su who are looking for  reasons to deny people the opportunity to work.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Owens), who is  also part of the Education and the Workforce Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Owens for those very  on-point remarks. He said it very well, that this nominee is  antibusiness, antigrowth, and antiworker, as well.   I think it is important for us to have a sense of perspective here  that this is such a vital moment and a moment of vital importance for  the American workforce. We are coming out of an era of unprecedented  upheaval, and we are heading toward an era of, in many ways,  unpredictable transformation.   For the top labor position in America, we need a Secretary who is  competent and qualified, who is proworker and pro-small businesses, who  will work with Democrats and Republicans alike, who is fair, and who  understands what has made the American workforce the greatest engine  for human progress the world has ever known.   Simply put, Julie Su is not that person. Her record in California  makes that all too clear. Indeed, during the pandemic, Julie Su and her  Employment Development Department, known as the EDD, became the  national poster child for government failure.                                time  1145    I saw this firsthand as a State representative. Millions of  Californians had their legitimate unemployment claims wrongfully  withheld for weeks, months, or sometimes indefinitely under Su's  mismanagement.   You don't need to take my word for that. In July of 2020, 61 of the  80 members of the California Assembly, mostly Democrats, wrote the  following:   ``In our fifth month of the pandemic, with so many constituents yet  to receive a single unemployment payment, it's clear that EDD is  failing California:   ``Millions of our constituents have had no income for months. As  Californians wait for answers from EDD, they have depleted their life  savings, have gone into extreme debt, and are in deep panic as they  figure out how to put food on the table and a roof over their heads.''   The lawmakers went on to explain how the EDD, under Su's management  time and again, failed to take responsibility and failed to correct its  mistakes. They wrote that they had been met with long-winded excuses,  fumbling answers, or unclear and inconsistent data, along with a lack  of transparency and accountability, obfuscation and dishonesty in their  dealings with Su's agency.   We have exhausted all avenues at our disposal, they said, as the  agency has addressed only a few of the many issues we have highlighted  for months and was only scratching the surface of the disaster that is  EDD.   ``The disaster'' is how the California Democrat supermajority  characterized Julie Su's agency.   The frustrated legislators lamented how little has improved at EDD  over the course of the pandemic. Independent reports confirmed the  extent of mismanagement and deception from Su's agency. While the EDD  had said in July of 2020 that its claims backlog would be cleared by  September, a report found 1.5 million claims remained unresolved and  the backlog was increasing by 10,000 each week.   The Independent Legislative Analyst office likewise found the EDD  mischaracterized the crisis. Even allies of the Governor and Secretary  Su concluded that she was responsible for this. Democrat Assemblymember  Cottie Petrie-Norris, who is the chairwoman of the Assembly  Accountability and Administrative Review Committee responsible for  overseeing the EDD said that Su `` . . . has not done a good job at  running the Employment Development Department,'' saying Su's  mismanagement ``caused heartache for millions of Californians.''   That is the top Democrat on the committee that oversaw her work in  California, saying she did not do a good job at running the Employment  Development Department.   What reason is there to think she is going to do a good job then  running the U.S. Labor Department?   It gets much worse. As so many hardworking citizens waited in vain  for their checks in California after they were told they weren't  allowed to work during the COVID shutdowns, as these folks who were  entitled to their checks waited for them, one group seemed to have no  trouble at all getting benefits and those were people who were not  entitled to them, those who perpetrated a massive fraud against the  State government of California.   In fact, it was the largest fraud of taxpayer dollars in history. An  estimated $32 billion was wrongfully paid out from the EDD to State  prison inmates, international crime syndicates, and other criminals.  Payments were made to murderers, rapists, child molesters. 133 death  row inmates received over $400,000 alone. These hardened criminals  didn't have to try hard. They used names like Dianne Feinstein and John  Doe.   The district attorney of Sacramento County called the scheme  ``relatively easy.'' The individual most responsible, once again, was  Secretary Julie Su. She made the inexplicable decision to forego a  basic fraud prevention system. She ignored the Federal Government's  guidance that claims are to be cross-checked against the prison rolls,  which was standard practice in other States.   The agency sent hundreds of benefit cards to the same address, sent  cards  [[Page H2111]]  directly to correctional facilities, issued benefits to infants and  centenarians. A January 2021 report from the California State auditor  notes that the EDD fraud occurred for three main reasons: First, EDD  waited about 4 months to automate a key antifraud measure; second, EDD  allowed claimants to collect benefits, even though they were using  suspicious addresses; and third, EDD removed a key safeguard against  improper payments without fully understanding the significance of the  safeguard.   Yet, perhaps worst of all is that Julie Su has refused to accept  responsibility.   Just last week at her Senate confirmation hearing, she said, ``As  soon as we saw that there was fraud happening, I shut the front door to  that fraud.'' That is her testimony just last week. ``As soon as we saw  that there was fraud happening, I shut the front door to that fraud.''   However, California's independent State auditor has found that  ``despite repeated warnings, EDD did not bolster its fraud detection  efforts until months into the pandemic.''   There is no predicting what will happen to our country, to our  workforce if that level of mismanagement is brought to the U.S.  Department of Labor.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to discuss one more facet of Ms. Su's  tenure in California, but before doing so, I yield to the gentleman  from Georgia (Mr. McCormick).    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. McCormick for his words. Indeed,  the President should pick someone else. Almost anyone else.   What is so really puzzling, mind-boggling about this nomination is  that the President has chosen to elevate the one person in the country  who presided over a fraud on this scale, the single worst performing  Secretary of Labor of any State in the country.   Why would he do that?   That brings us to the final facet of Ms. Su's tenure that I wish to  discuss and that Mr. McCormick touched upon as well, which is her  ruthless enforcement of the labor law known as AB 5, which President  Biden has cited as his model for the Nation.   Su's historic failure to deliver unemployment checks to millions of  Californians along with her allowance of this massive fraud is  disqualifying in its own right, but I actually think it is her  mistreatment of California workers that is most concerning of all.   AB 5 was a law passed in California in 2019. It rendered countless  independent professionals unable to earn a living in our State.  Writers, interpreters, court reporters, musicians, language  pathologists, photographers, forensic nurses, people in literally  hundreds of other professions were told they were no longer allowed to  practice their profession and serve their clients as they had been  doing their whole careers.   Instead, their only option was to find a single hiring entity to  monopolize their services and make them a W-2 employee. For many, that  simply was not possible, and so they lost everything.   Take, for example, a woman named Jodie, who said: I worked years to  gain my skills as an American Sign Language interpreter. It was my goal  since I was 9 years old. After AB 5, I lost all three of my agencies.  The dream I worked for is lost. I can't provide for my family, and  thousands of California deaf won't be serviced.   Andy said: I work with underserved artists of color. None of my  career as an artist, technician, designer, and producer would have been  possible under AB 5. Artists of color will be less able to create their  own work in a field that doesn't favor them.   Jared said: AB 5 forced me to shut down my business. I went from  making $80,000 a year in home services to a minimum wage employee. My  family trade is gone. I have gone from working 4 days a week to spend  time with my kids to not knowing if I can make ends meet working 7  days.   Kathy said: I am a 71-year-old transcriber. I raised six kids and  went to work in my 40s, but I had to retire at 62 due to health issues.  I depend on my at-home transcription pay to survive and pay my bills.  For 8 years, I did okay, until AB 5.   Julie Su has been called an architect of this law, and she is  supporting a Federal version that is estimated to cost millions of  American workers their livelihoods. After her enactment in California-- and this is the important thing, given that this is now percolating up  into Federal law--she used her position as labor secretary to broaden  the destructive impact of the law by enforcing it as aggressively as  possible.   In fact--and I think this is maybe the most concerning thing--she  exploited the COVID-19 shutdowns to hammer the law in even more. She  continued with harassing audits, trying to find businesses to hit with  fines and penalties. I personally asked the EDD to stop doing this  during the COVID shutdowns, and they refused to do so, continuing to  target small businesses.   She even defied the will of Congress in the process. Congress had  provided benefits to independent contractors through the CARES Act, but  put States in charge of distributing those benefits. Under Julie Su,  the EDD wrongfully withheld those benefits, as she aimed to exploit the  sudden need that independent contractors had to interface with her  department. She wanted them to go through the regular unemployment  channel, which they weren't supposed to go through, so that she could  get access to information that could be used then to conduct more  audits and go after more small businesses and to put more people out of  work.   You don't need to take my word for this, either. California  Congressman Adam Schiff wrote a letter to Secretary Su in April of 2020  rebuking her for failing to release the benefits independent  contractors were owed under the CARES Act and requesting urgently that  she do so.   Now, tellingly, with Julie Su's confirmation for Secretary of Labor  now appearing to be in doubt, her backers are making a last-ditch  attempt to save her nomination by absurdly trying to dissociate her  from AB 5. None other than the author of AB 5 itself, a major Su backer  who now leads the California Labor Federation, told the L.A. Times that  Su ``was not involved with the bill at all.''   Yet Su, in her own words, after the law was passed, described in  detail her plans for enforcing AB 5 as California labor secretary: ``So  we will be doing investigations and audits,'' she said, threatening  fines and penalties, ``so that those who want to comply with the need  to reclassify can do so and those who don't will understand that's not  the kind of economy we want in California.''   ``Not the kind of economy we want in California,'' those are her  words. Julie Su didn't want an economy in California where you can  pursue your own calling, support your family on your own terms, and  thrive. She doesn't want that for America, either. That is why Joe  Biden has selected her for Labor Secretary, to wage his war on  independent contractors, and we simply cannot let that happen.  [[Page H2112]]    In closing, there are many, many organizations across the country who  have expressed their opposition to the nomination and confirmation of  Julie Su for Labor Secretary. I will just list some of them: there is  the Air Conditioning Contractors of America; American Hotel and Lodging  Association; American Trucking Associations; Americans for Tax Reform;  Associated Builders and Contractors; Association of Bi-State Motor  Carriers; Center for the Defense of Free Enterprise; Coalition of  Franchisee Associations; Consumer Technology Association; Franchise  Business Services; Flex Association; Heating, Air-Conditioning &  Refrigeration Distributors International; Independent Bakers  Association; Independent Electrical Contractors; Institute for the  American Worker; International Franchise Association; International  Warehouse Logistics Association; Association of Independent  Professionals and the Self-Employed; Leading Builders of America;  National Armored Car Association; National Association of Home  Builders; National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors; National  Council of Chain Restaurants; National Federation of Independent  Business; National Franchisee Association; International Franchise  Association; National Grocers Association; National Ready Mixed  Concrete Association; National Restaurant Association; Owner-Operator  Independent Drivers Association; DoorDash; Lyft; Competitive Enterprise  Institute; TechNet; Fight for Freelancers; Freelancers Against AB5;  California Business and Industrial Alliance; Workplace Policy  Institute; Job Creators Network; Institute for the American Worker.                                time  1200    You have also had State-level associations weigh in in opposition:  for example, in Arizona, the Builders Alliance; Construction Trades;  Franchise Action Network; Lodging and Tourism Association; Restaurant  Association; Small Business Association; Transportation Builders  Association; Trucking Association; and the Independent Electrical  Contractors.   In West Virginia, you have the Associated Builders and Contractors;  Independent Electrical Contractors Chesapeake; the Franchise Action  Network; the Hospitality and Travel Association; the Manufacturers  Association; Oil Marketers and Grocers Association; Retailers  Association; and Trucking Association.   I encourage Members of the United States Senate to join this broad  coalition of small businesses and workers across the country who know  that we deserve and need better than the Secretary of Labor.   I urge Members of the United States Senate to reject this nomination,  and I urge the President to appoint a Secretary of Labor who will be on  the side of American workers.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr.  Duncan).    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
