 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in  morning business.    Madam President, I come to the floor today with a number  of my colleagues on the 26th day of this deeply damaging and completely  unnecessary Trump shutdown. We are here today to lift up the voices and  stories of the people who are being hurt by President Trump and his  Senate Republican allies and to once again call on Republican leaders  here in the Senate to finally allow a vote and work with us to end this  manufactured crisis. While President Trump is very focused on his  political game, actual people, their families, and their communities  are paying the price.   People we represent--moms and dads, workers, small business owners,  people who did not do anything wrong, who just want to work, do their  job, serve their communities--all of them have been pulled into  President Trump's chaos and dysfunction, and it needs to end.   I am very proud to kick off another effort here in the Senate by  those who want to make sure that President Trump and Senate Republican  leaders  [[Page S239]]  don't forget whom this is about and understand who is being impacted by  their refusal to act.   I want to start with a few from my home State of Washington, where  there are nearly 13,000 workers who have been caught up in this Trump  shutdown.   Lauren is a furloughed FAA employee who shared her story with me  through my website. She told me she supports her family with one  income, and now that paycheck has been frozen. She said she has been  losing sleep trying to figure out how to cut her own expenses and pay  her bills since the Federal Government isn't meeting its obligation to  pay her.   I heard from Adam, also from my home State, who is buying his first  home with his fiance. What should be a very exciting time is now filled  with unnecessary stress because Federal loans through USDA and FHA are  held up. As if closing a home isn't stressful enough, now they don't  know when or even if a loan is going to come through. As Adam described  to me, home buyers are now caught in the middle, and that is just  wrong.   One Federal employee I met with while I was home last week is a  scientist at one of the impacted Agencies, and he told me about the  stress that he and his family have endured since the start of the  shutdown, having to cover their childcare expenses and mortgage while  he is not being paid--expenses that total up to $1,700 each month.  Right now, he said he is able to tap into his family emergency fund to  make ends meet, but he doesn't think they can hang on much longer.   I am not the only one, by the way, who is hearing from people in  Washington State about how President Trump's unnecessary shutdown is  impacting their lives. These stories are everywhere.   Earlier this week, the wife of a furloughed TSA employee with a 6- year-old daughter told the Seattle Times about how the shutdown has  thrown her family into an economic tailspin. Their family is currently  living off of money she makes from babysitting and with the help from  her retired father, who has taken now a minimum-wage job to help with  the family's finances. She worries how they are ever going to make it  if this shutdown continues.   This is a small number of the countless stories coming out of my  State and from around the country about how President Trump's reckless  government shutdown is hurting real people. They are people in every  one of our States in the country. They are people on every side of the  border debate. They are people who heard President Trump say he would  be ``proud'' to shut down the government. They are people who simply do  not understand why they are being asked to bear the burden, to pay the  price because President Trump and Republican leaders here in the Senate  have boxed themselves into a political corner.   They are people who are getting angrier and angrier, more and more  desperate with every day that goes by, who are going to make their  voices heard, and we are going to make their voices heard. We are  fighting by their side to end this shutdown. I am going to keep making  sure they have a voice in the Senate.   I am proud to be with a number of my Democratic colleagues today. We  are going to lift up their stories until President Trump and  Republicans here in the Senate agree to end this crisis they started.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Democrats  control the time until 12 noon, with Senators permitted to speak  therein for up to 3 minutes each, and the Republicans control the time  from 12 noon to 12:30 p.m.    Madam President, I respect the rights of the Senator. We  have a number of Senators and a limited amount of time. So if he could  finish quickly, we would all appreciate it. Thank you.    Madam President, we have heard from a number of our  colleagues today about personal stories that are happening to real live  people in their home States--people who have not received a paycheck  and are facing fear about what they are going to do in the coming days.   We have a responsibility--and I think I speak on behalf of  Republicans and Democrats both here. We need to open government. We  have disagreements all the time in Congress over different issues.  Certainly, we cannot put these people's lives at risk and leave them as  pawns in our States. Open up government, and then have a discussion  about the issues we disagree on.   I know the Senator from Minnesota expected to be here, but I also see  on the floor the Senator from Georgia, who would like to speak. I ask  unanimous consent that the Senator from Georgia be allowed to speak and  the Senator from Minnesota, when she returns.    Madam President, we are 26 days into President Trump's  completely unnecessary government shutdown--26 days of pain and  uncertainty; 26 days of missed paychecks and missed bills--26 days, the  longest in our country's history.   I have heard from so many constituents in my home State of Washington  who have been impacted by this shutdown. These are heart-wrenching  stories of workers who do not know how much longer they can make it  without a paycheck. Members of our U.S. Coast Guard--the very men and  women who stand ready 24/7 to make harrowing rescues and keep our  country safe--didn't get paid yesterday. They did not get paid  yesterday, marking the first time ever that servicemembers have not  been paid because of a shutdown.   There are small business owners who don't know when their SBA loans  will come through; people who are dedicated to our national parks--our  national treasures--who are in despair as they hear about trash piling  up and irreparable damage being done; people waiting in lines at  airports; people worried about food inspections; worried about losing  their homes or their cars or their jobs. Entire families, entire  communities are impacted, uncertain, and scared.   In my home State of Washington and in every State in this country, I  have come to the floor time and again to share these stories, along  with many of my Democratic colleagues. We have called on Republican  leaders to stand with us, stand with their constituents, and schedule a  vote to end the shutdown. All it would take is a vote. We know it would  pass, and we can move it through the House and send it to the  President.                                    S. 109    What have Republican leaders done, instead of scheduling a vote to  help workers and families and small business owners and our economy;  what have they done, instead of standing with their constituents to  reopen this government and end this madness? Well, they have done what  they have always done when they don't know what else to do. They  scheduled a vote to attack women and their healthcare.   I almost couldn't believe it when I heard it. This government is shut  down. People are hurting. They want solutions. They want the government  to open, and Republicans are going to vote to effectively ban abortion  coverage. That is the business on the floor.   Instead of voting to pay Federal workers, they are trying to tell  women what kind of health insurance they can or can't have. Instead of  working to make sure our airports are secure, they want to undermine  women's access to the healthcare they choose. Instead of ending the  chaos and dysfunction and getting our country back on track, they want  to chip away again at every woman's constitutionally protected right to  make her own healthcare decisions. Instead of working with us to end  the shutdown and then having a debate on border security or anything  else they want to talk about, they are planning a vote that will not do  anything but tell women across the country what they already know:  Republicans in Washington, DC, think they know better than you about  your healthcare.   Let me be clear. They don't.   This is disgusting. Women and men across the country are not going to  stand for it. We can vote right now to open the government. We can vote  right now to help our workers and our families. We can vote right now  to end governing by Presidential tantrum. If Republicans don't do  this--if they choose, as they have, to attack women and to throw their  healthcare under the bus instead of doing their basic jobs--then the  people across this country are going to see exactly where they stand-- not with them, not with their families, not with their constituents,  and certainly not with women.   I urge the Republicans to end this madness--to pull this anti-women  health vote--and to, instead, schedule a vote to reopen the government.  That is what we should be focused on. That is what Americans want us to  do. We need to end this. Let's reopen the government, not attack women  one more time.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
