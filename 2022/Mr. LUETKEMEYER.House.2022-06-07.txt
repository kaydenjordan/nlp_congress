 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 7352, the PPP and Bank Fraud  Enforcement Harmonization Act of 2022.   Inflation and price increases continue to hinder all Americans and  especially small businesses and their workers. Prices at the pump and  prices on the shelves rattle the mettle of the Nation's job creators.  Month after month, small businesses face price increases that not only  prevent expansion and growth but also hamper recovery. These economic  conditions must improve, and we must get a firm grip on reckless  spending coming out of Washington. Similarly, we must take on a  stronger oversight role when it comes to investigating fraudulent  COVID-19 behavior.   When America's small businesses faced State and local COVID shutdown  orders, Congress moved quickly and stood up the Paycheck Protection  Program. To ensure small businesses and their workers received PPP  relief in an efficient and speedy manner, Congress required private- sector lenders to be the drivers of the program. The result speaks  volumes with nearly $800 billion disbursed to small businesses.   As the Republican leader on the Committee on Small Business, I often  hear about how important the program was for small businesses across  our great Nation. It was the lifeline that many of them needed to be  able to survive.   While most lenders' fraud defenses were strong due to Federal  financial rules such as Know Your Customer, fraudulent behavior did  take place. Investigations are underway, but more time will be needed  and required to bring justice to those who defrauded the program.   Depending on the type of lender that participated in the program, the  current statute of limitations ranges from 5 years for wire fraud that  categorizes  [[Page H5250]]  many fintech lenders, who have been associated with problematic loans,  to 10 years for banks and credit unions that fall under bank fraud.   H.R. 7352, the PPP and Bank Fraud Enforcement Harmonization Act of  2022, takes important steps to create an across-the-board 10-year  statute of limitations on all loans handed out through the PPP program.  This change will ensure all law enforcement and inspectors general have  the time to track down all wrongdoing no matter the type of lender.   H.R. 7352 was created via voice vote in committee. I thank the chair  for treating this issue with the priority it deserves and for working  with me on the bills before us today. This bill is a step in the right  direction, and I urge my colleagues to support it.   In closing, Madam Speaker, when Congress raced to save American small  businesses, criminal actors lurked in the shadows. Although one of the  most popular COVID-19 relief measures, the PPP program, has firmly  moved into the loan forgiveness period, the investigations surrounding  illicit behavior have just begun.   H.R. 7352 will wisely ensure all loans handed out through the  program, no matter the type of lender, have a statute of limitations  window of 10 years.   According to some of the most recent SBA inspector general reports,  nearly $4.6 billion of the $800 billion could be potentially  fraudulent. While these numbers will surely change, it is paramount  that we provide law enforcement the runway to track down all fraudulent  behavior. These are American taxpayer dollars on the line, and they  must be protected.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 7334, the COVID-19 EIDL  Fraud Statute of Limitations Act of 2022.   Similar to the previous bill, the Paycheck Protection Program, the  Small Business Administration's Economic Injury Disaster Loan program,  known as EIDL, was also activated as the Nation's small businesses were  being shut down due to COVID-19. However, unlike PPP, EIDL was a direct  loan and grant program through the SBA. Unfortunately, the SBA acting  as a direct lender and grantor has been problematic and has resulted in  billions of potentially fraudulent dollars flowing to criminals.   In fact, the SBA's inspector general has reported that as much as  $84.4 billion within the $400 billion program could be fraudulent.  Moreover, over 1 million applications have been flagged for identity  theft concerns. This is unacceptable and must be addressed.   H.R. 7334, the COVID-19 EIDL Fraud Statute of Limitations Act of 2022  takes the first step and establishes a 10-year statute of limitations  window to ensure law enforcement and the SBA's inspector general have  the time to investigate all wrongdoing. This change is even more  important as the SBA continues to defer all EIDL payments, thus  clouding the true extent of fraud within the program.   Madam Speaker, I thank the chair for working with me on this measure  which passed out of committee unanimously earlier in May.   If we are to take COVID relief fraud seriously, then we need to  ensure law enforcement has what it needs to catch and prosecute all  criminals. H.R. 7334 provides them the time to act.   Madam Speaker, I wholeheartedly believe this bill is instrumental  when it comes to fraud recoupment. I urge my colleagues to support it,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume  to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Meuser), who is the ranking  member of the Subcommittee on Economic Growth, Tax and Capital Access.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume  to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Tenney), who is the ranking  member of the Subcommittee on Underserved, Agricultural, and Rural  Business Development.                                time  1600     Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I am  prepared to close. I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, fraud associated with the EIDL program is a serious  matter. Due to mismanagement and poor oversight capabilities, the EIDL  program has been overwhelmed with fraud.   As I mentioned earlier, the SBA's inspector general has found more  than $80 billion within the $400 billion program that could potentially  be fraudulent. This represents a double-digit fraud rate.   However, recouping these dollars has just begun and the current  statute of limitations is limited. My bill, H.R. 7334, will ensure the  statute of limitations runway is recalibrated and extended out to 10  years. By passing this bill, Congress will allow the time needed to  correct all wrongdoing within the program.   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 7334, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Williams) be allowed to manage the remainder  of the time for the minority.
