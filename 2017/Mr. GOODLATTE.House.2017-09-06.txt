 Mr. Chairman, I raise a point of order against the  provision beginning with the colon on page 327, line 22, and continuing  through the word ``crime'' on page 328, line 2, of the Rules Committee  print because it violates clause 2 of House rule XXI. Under clause 2(b)  of rule XXI, a provision that changes existing law may not be reported  in a general appropriations bill.   Section 510 of Division C provides that 5 percent of the amounts  available for obligation from the Department of Justice's Crime Victims  Fund be made available for grants to Indian tribal governments in  fiscal year 2018. This provision violates rule XXI because it changes  existing law. The Victims of Crime Act already provides a statutory  distribution formula of the Crime Victims Fund for fiscal year 2018.  Section 510 would change the formula. This statutory formula is  squarely in the jurisdiction of the Judiciary Committee.   As this amendment would change current law by altering a statutory  formula, it is a violation of clause 2(b) of rule XXI.   Therefore, I insist on my point of order.
