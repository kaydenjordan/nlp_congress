 Mr. Speaker, we really should be calling this bill the  ``Puppy Killing Act.''   This resolution would overturn a rule that prohibits some of the  cruelest hunting practices on Federal lands in Alaska. Now, again, this  is not on State land. This is on Federal land that Colorado taxpayers  and taxpayers across the country pay for the maintenance of and  that we, the people of the country, own.    The Fish and Wildlife rule prohibits so-called predator control  activities that Alaska has made legal in State law. As Mr. Huffman  said, the Alaska Board of Game specifically voted to allow aerial  gunning and snaring of bears. They have engaged in gassing of wolf pups  in their dens. These are not theoretical matters. They are actual  matters as to why this rule is so important and why I oppose it being  overturned.   If this bill passes, the activities that are prevented under this  rule for refuges can actually occur.   These cruel and inhumane methods that Alaska wishes to implement,  including killing wolf pups and their mothers at or near their dens,  killing brown bears with the use of steel-jawed traps, and scouting and  shooting grizzly bears from planes and helicopters, are not only  unsportsmanlike, but run counter to the directives of the National  Wildlife Refuge System and the Alaska National Interest Lands  Conservation Act.   Thirty-one scientists submitted their support for the Alaska National  Refuge Act, noting that the best available science indicates that  widespread elimination of bears, coyotes, and wolves will quite  unlikely make ungulate herds magically reappear. So, again, the science  is clear on this matter.   There was another study by the 1997 National Academy of Sciences that  found that Alaska's predator control system, including the assertion of  killing wolves and bears, somehow makes other wildlife populations  healthier is simply not supported by sound science.   This blunt and unscientific and inhumane approach to managing apex  predators and carnivores employed by the State of Alaska is actually  counter to the law and the congressional mandate regarding the National  Wildlife Refuge System.   The Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, which passed  overwhelmingly in this body, says it requires the Fish and Wildlife  Service to:         Conserve Fish and Wildlife populations and their habitats       in their natural diversity.    How does it protect our carnivore species and the species they  consume in their natural diversity if there is artificial and inhumane  human intervention to kill puppies and target bears from aircraft?   It is simply unscientific, inhumane, and wrong.   In direct contrast to Federal law, Alaska has adopted regulations  that require the killing of wolves and bears under so-called predation  control efforts to artificially inflate game populations frequently  above and beyond the carrying capacity of the land. The State currently  authorizes extreme practices like aerial shooting of wolves or bears by  State agency personnel, trapping of wolves by paid contractors, and  using airplanes to hunt wolves and bears.   Not only is this bill inhumane and counter to our stewardship of the  National Wildlife Refuge, but it is also counterproductive for jobs in  the economy of Alaska. Wildlife watching provides roughly five times  more the revenue to the Alaskan economy than hunting or trapping. It  turns out that the American people and tourists around the world would  rather see these puppies and photograph them rather than shoot them and  gas them.   According to the Fish and Wildlife records, wildlife viewing  activities in Alaska support over $2 billion in economic activity.   Why is Congress spending time trying to allow puppy killing and cruel  hunting methods to occur, instead of fair chase methods, especially  when this actually undermines Alaska's economy and their ecology of  Federal refuges?   Why are we repealing this rule when, in fact, most Alaskans support  it?   The American people know there are more pressing issues facing the  country than this rule. I urge Members to join me and vote ``no'' on  the CRA and protecting puppies.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.    I urge my colleagues to join me in voting with the Alaskan  people, with the economic interests of Alaska, and with the taxpayers  of America, who are stewards of this land, for better wildlife  management practices, to stop killing puppies, and engage in inhumane  trapping and hunting practices of bears.
