 Madam President, as a member and former chairman of  the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each month  I recognize and celebrate the American entrepreneurial spirit by  highlighting the success of a small business in my home State of Idaho.  Today, I am pleased to honor Hillco Technologies, Inc., as the Idaho  Small Business of the Month for July 2022.   In the 1950s, Wallace ``Arlie'' Hill, a longtime resident of  Nezperce, designed the first hydraulic foldup harrow cart for his own  family farm. Shortly thereafter, he built them for his neighbors and  eventually for farmers all across North America before opening Hillco,  Inc., in 1963. Arlie Hill became famous for his harrow, springtooth,  and packer cart designs and various multi-unit hitches for drills and  plows which he tinkered with until his mid-80s.   Located amongst the rolling hills of Idaho's Camas Prairie, the Hill  family is familiar with how critical combine leveling systems are for  effective hillside harvesting. When tractor manufacturers stopped  supplying leveling systems in the 1990s, Hillco stepped in to fill the  gap in the market. In 1993, the first Hillco, Inc., leveling system  rolled off the production floor for a Case-IH combine followed by the  first leveling system for a John Deere combine in 1998. In 2021, Hillco  manufactured their 2,500th leveler.   Now called Hillco Technologies, Inc., and owned by Lenny Hill,  Arlie's son, their team of 55 employees pride themselves on their  collaborative effort to design, test, and market methods and mechanisms  that advance farming and agricultural practices from start to finish.  They continue to preserve Arlie's innovative spirit as they expand  their product line to offer additional equipment that addresses the  unique challenges facing farmers and ranchers in the Pacific Northwest  and across the Nation. While Hillco equipment is well known in farming  communities nationwide, the Nezperce community recognizes Hillco for  their generous support of local businesses, athletics, education, and  first responders.   Congratulations to the Hill family and all of the employees at Hillco  Technologies, Inc., for being selected as the Idaho Small Business of  the Month for July 2022. Thank you for serving Idaho as small business  owners and entrepreneurs. You make our great State proud, and I look  forward to your continued growth and success.
