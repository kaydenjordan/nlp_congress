 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill.   To my colleagues in this great House, the people's House, we have  been here in times of triumph and in times of tragedy. This is the  latter. It is a time for civility; it is a time for unity; and it is a  time for us to serve the American people and pass this bill.   Let our resolve be to defeat this virus. No malady, no virus, no  adversity will ever erode the great American Republic.   God bless us all.
