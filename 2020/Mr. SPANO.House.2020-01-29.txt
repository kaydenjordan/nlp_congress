 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Lakeland High  School's Demarkus Bowman, who was recently named Florida's Mr.  Football.   After finishing runner-up last year, Demarkus beat out the  competition this year, having run for over 1,600 yards and 24  touchdowns in only 11 games. As a unanimous 5-star running back and the  number 16 overall player in the Nation, Demarkus will be taking his  talent next season to Clemson University.   Not only is Demarkus a star football player, but Demarkus also excels  in track. More importantly, Demarkus is a young man with a grateful  heart who is supported by a devoted family and friends.   I am proud of Demarkus and all his Dreadnaught teammates who  represent our district so well. Not only do I celebrate their  accomplishments on the field, but I also look forward to seeing them  take on the mantle of leadership in their generation.                            ____________________
