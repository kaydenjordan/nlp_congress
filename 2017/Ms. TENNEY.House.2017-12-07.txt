 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Georgia, Mr. Woodall,  for yielding and for his great comments about bipartisanship.   Mr. Speaker, over the last 10 years, the community financial  institution industry has undergone a dramatic transformation. Since  2006, more than 1,500 banks have failed, have been acquired, or have  merged due to economic factors and the overwhelmingly expensive  regulation brought forth by the passage of Dodd-Frank.   During that same period, there has been a drought in de novo banks.  In fact, only five new bank charters and 16 new credit unions have  chartered since that time.   Today, for the first time in 125 years, there are fewer than 6,000  banks and roughly 6,000 credit unions serving all consumers in the  United States. This is proof that community financial institutions need  smart, commonsense, regulatory relief so they can properly serve local  communities by assisting them with small business startups and consumer  credit, particularly in a region like mine in upstate New York.   It is important that we pass this rule today to consider my bill,  H.R. 3971, the Community Institution Mortgage Relief Act.                                time  1315    This bipartisan measure would offer real relief for institutions that  are barely surviving in an excessive regulatory environment.   I thank my colleague, Mr. Sherman, for assisting us in a bipartisan  way to bring this bill forward and to make it even better than we  originally conceived it.   H.R. 3971 would exempt small community institutions from mandatory  escrow requirements and would provide relief from new regulations that  have nearly doubled the cost of servicing, with direct impact on the  consumer for the cost of mortgage credit.   I know that certain institutions wish to continue to provide escrow  services to their consumers, and under current law and under this  provision, they are welcome to do that. However, for the smaller  institutions, like the ones in my district, like GPO Federal Credit  Union, for example, that rely on relationship banking, customers that  walk in the door and know who your neighbors are and know who your  friends are and whose children serve on the same sports teams and go to  the same schools, this bill will greatly help them and help our  consumers continue with that relationship.   By mandating that all institutions follow escrow requirements, it  raises the cost of credit for those borrowers who can least afford it,  and harms our small local institutions who can barely afford to stay  alive.   This is a great commonsense bill. It is bipartisan, as every bill I  have ever proposed in this Chamber has been since my first year as a  freshman, and I will continue to do so.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  support this bill. I again thank my colleague from Georgia for his  work. I urge everyone to support this commonsense bill that will help  our small community banks and our credit unions.
