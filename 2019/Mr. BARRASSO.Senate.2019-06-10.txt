 Mr. President, this week in Wyoming, one of our finest  will be recognized by the Wyoming GOP for a lifetime of service and  leadership. I am privileged to tell my colleagues about Rita Meyer.   Rita honorably served our great country for more than 23 years in the  U.S. military. She served as an enlisted airwoman before becoming an  officer in the Wyoming Air National Guard. Rita is a combat veteran of  both Operation Desert Storm and Operation Enduring Freedom. In 1995,  the Air National Guard brought Rita to D.C. to act as the strategic  planning officer for the National Guard Bureau's counterdrug  directorate.   Upon returning to Wyoming, Rita was appointed full-time comptroller  for the Wyoming Air National Guard. Although eligible to retire from  National Guard service in 2004, Rita answered the call and volunteered  for an Active-Duty command in Southwest Asia. She was selected to serve  as the 455th Airlift Wing Expeditionary Mission Support Group commander  at Bagram Airfield, Afghanistan. She completed her tour in May 2005.   Having attained the rank of full colonel, Rita retired from her  incredibly distinguished military career in November of 2007. Colonel  Meyer was recognized for going above and beyond during her service by  being awarded with the Legion of Merit, the Order of the Bayonet, and  the Order of St. Barbara.   Although retired from the service, Rita would continue to give back  to the Armed Forces. Colonel Meyer served as a member of my service  academy nomination board. She also served as head of former Senator  Malcolm Wallop's board. I can attest to how vital volunteers like Rita  are to the process of nominating young men and women of Wyoming to West  Point and the U.S. Naval, Merchant Marine, and Air Force Academies.   In addition to an outstanding military career, Rita is an exemplary  scholar. Rita earned two degrees from the University of Wyoming: a  bachelor of arts in education and a bachelor of science in finance. She  later earned a master of business administration in international  business from Regis University, as well as a master's in national  resource strategy from the National Defense University in Washington,  DC.   Ultimately, the University of Wyoming would recognize Rita as  outstanding alumnus in both colleges of business and education. It was  also at the University of Wyoming in Laramie that Rita was appointed to  the board of trustees.   Rita's distinguished career continued as chief of staff for Governor  Jim Geringer. She was later elected as the State auditor in 2006 and  served until 2011.   Building on her career in the military and State government, Rita  took the lead of the largest public utility in Wyoming as vice- president-Wyoming for Rocky Mountain Power. As the company's only  executive based in Wyoming, Rita oversees the utility's State business  plan, customer service, and community relations. Rita's experience as a  statesman proved to be valuable as she helps the company navigate  regulatory and legislative issues. As Wyoming faces challenges in the  ever-changing energy industry, we are fortunate to have a proven leader  like Rita fighting for solutions.   While being incredibly busy in her life as a citizen soldier, public  servant, and later as a corporate executive, Rita never let that get in  the way of being a committed wife and mother. Rita married dentist Dr.  Charles Meyer, a Rawlins, WY, native in 1977. Dr. Meyer served as a  navy corpsman in the Solomon Islands during WWII. He passed away in  2011 after a long and distinguished career as a leader in dental health  and education. Charlie and Rita were blessed with a son, Charles, Jr.,  who followed in his parent's footsteps by serving as an officer in the  U.S. Navy. Charlie, his wife Jen, and their two children, Augusta Grace  and John Charles, live in Maryland.   Rita is married to Stephen J. Miller of SJ Miller Associates in  Cheyenne. Stephen, a senior private investigator with more than 35  years of experience in law enforcement, has a master's degree in public  administration from the University of Wyoming.   Wyoming has benefited immensely from Rita Meyer's wisdom and  leadership. We continue to look to Rita as the voice for veterans and  civilians alike. My wife Bobbi and I are proud to have Rita as our  friend, and folks all over Wyoming are fortunate because Rita set such  a great example for generations to come.                            ____________________
