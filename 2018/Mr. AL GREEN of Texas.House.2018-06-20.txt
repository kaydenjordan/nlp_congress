 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding to me.   Madam Speaker, this is what it has come to. We stand here in the well  of the House appealing to--in a sense, begging--the President to  acknowledge the undeniable truth, the undeniable truth that this is a  crisis that he can end with the stroke of a pen. This is a crisis that  he has created, and it is a crisis that he can eliminate.   The undeniable truth is that, if a President can see these babies  crying and pleading for their parents--momma, father, papa--if the  President can see this and not take action, his heart has hardened to  the extent that he is unfit to be President.
