 Mr. Speaker, a major  responsibility of the farm bill is intended to address the growing  issue of food insecurity in America. As a matter of fact, roughly one  out of every six individuals in Dallas County will go to sleep each  night not knowing where their next meal will come from.   Hunger is not just a major issue within any one district, but it is  one that affects Americans in virtually every district in every part of  the country. It is an important issue. It is one on which Congress  needs to focus.   Sadly, the farm bill introduced last week will hurt far more  Americans than it will help. The proposed changes for the Supplemental  Nutrition Assistance Program within the farm bill are downright  draconian. SNAP was intended to help the poor so they can find  meaningful work on a full stomach. The new proposed work requirements  would starve individuals who are unable to find sustainable employment  due to economic, medical, or family-related issues.   Organizations such as Feeding America and the Food Research & Action  Center have come out opposing these changes because they would lead to  an increase in hungry Americans and is counterproductive to solving  America's hunger problem. It is much harder to climb out of poverty and  onto a path of independence when you must devote much of your energy in  wondering where your next meal may come from.   Instead of throwing people off SNAP, Congress should be focused on  giving greater access to nutritional meals so that these individuals  are able to go on living their lives and trying to find employment that  will get them out of poverty and into the middle class.   SNAP was intended to assist the working poor to ensure they are able  to put food on the table for their children. These changes would throw  many children off the program and subsequently deny access for them to  get food from school breakfast and lunch programs. The cuts in SNAP  benefits for these students would force them to face the challenges of  hunger in addition to the rigors of school.   Countless studies show that students retain more information when  their focus is on school in front of them and not on the fear that they  will go to bed hungry.   Making certain that the next generation of Americans have every  opportunity to grow up with a healthy diet and learn on a full stomach  is not just an investment in the fight against hunger; it is also an  investment in this country's future.  [[Page H3400]]    Mr. Speaker, I speak not just for African Americans. The majority of  the ones who are utilizing this program are non-African American, and  the majority are Anglo Americans. So Congress should be working  together to strengthen the program so that it fulfills its original  goal: ensuring that all Americans, regardless of ethnic origin or  status, have the dignity of a day's work and a day's worth of food.   Mr. Speaker, many districts' voices have been muted through the  intentional gerrymandering so that they don't have to address the  poorest people.   Mr. Speaker, it is time for us to address all of the American people.                            ____________________
