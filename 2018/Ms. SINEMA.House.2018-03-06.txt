 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4768, the National  Strategy for Combating the Financing of Transnational Criminal  Organizations Act.   Mr. Speaker, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration's  Phoenix division, the Sinaloa cartel is the biggest, most violent, and  nastiest organization threatening Arizonans, even bigger than MS-13. It  is a dangerous and highly sophisticated organization. Sinaloa smuggles  heroin and methamphetamine across the border into Arizona and, with it,  a pattern of crime, intimidation, and addiction that rips at the very  fabric of our communities.   Arizonans know we need to be tough, smart, and aggressive to confront  Sinaloa and other cartels. Our bill cracks down on the drug cartels and  other international crime syndicates that threaten Arizona families and  our quality of life by hitting them where it hurts: their bank  accounts.   Drug cartels like Sinaloa obtain wealth and power through money  laundering; cybercrime; and human, drugs, and weapons smuggling. To  stop the drug cartels and protect Arizona families, we need a  comprehensive approach to cut off the money that fuels their  operations.                                time  1430    That is why Congressman Kustoff from Tennessee and I introduced H.R.  4768. This bill requires the administration to develop and execute a  strategy that cuts off funding and other resources for transnational  criminal organizations and to routinely report to Congress and the  American people on the strategy's progress.   Our bill is a commonsense solution that protects Arizona families,  communities, and businesses from the threats of transnational organized  crime.   By focusing on the money, we take a meaningful step in combating  cybercrime, money laundering, drug trafficking, and human trafficking,  as well as other issues that transnational criminals bring to our  communities.   I thank Chairman Hensarling and Ranking Member Waters for supporting  this important legislation, and I will continue working with my  colleagues across the aisle to keep Arizona families safe.
