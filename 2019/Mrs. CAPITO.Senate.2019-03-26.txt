 Madam President, I wish to recognize a dedicated  public servant and proud West Virginian, Tony Bazzie, on the occasion  of his retirement from the Raleigh County Housing Authority.  Innumerable West Virginians have benefited from his tireless efforts to  improve access to affordable housing in our great State and his  advocacy for increased Housing and Urban Development funding. Tony has  been a vocal champion for encouraging investment in section 8 housing  and an advocate for a regulatory framework that balances the interests  of tenants and property owners.   Tony started with the housing authority at its inception in 1979 and  since then has worked hard to dispel the negative stereotypes regarding  housing assistance. Currently, his office assists over 1,200 families  in Raleigh County, as well as Braxton, Summers, Nicholas, Fayette, and  Webster Counties. In fact, demand has been so high that the housing  authority has had to implement a waiting list to serve additional West  Virginians.   Beyond the critical assistance that the housing authority provides to  West Virginians in need, it also has a positive effect on the economy.  Through section 8 subsidies, Tony and his staff have contributed over  $4.5 million in rental payments to local property owners. Supporting  local economies is something I have worked for in the Senate and  knowing that I have allies such as Tony in the State has made this  journey all the more successful.   Tony has come before Congress to testify about the importance of  housing authorities across West Virginia, and his insight informed the  discourse regarding the Section Eight Housing Choice Voucher Reform  Act, SEVRA. In his testimony, Tony highlighted the need for providing  decent, safe, and sanitary housing to low-income families. His passion  for and knowledge of housing policy were of great help to my  colleagues, and I thank him for his service.   I would like to thank Tony for all his insight and advice over the  years. His yearly visits to my DC office were always a highlight, and  his input was invaluable when discussing housing issues, particularly  in West Virginia. On a personal level, he was kind and helpful not only  to me, but to my staff as well. They spoke highly of how attentive,  patient, and nice he was to everyone he worked with. I am honored to  call Tony my friend and fellow West Virginian, and I wish him well in  this new phase of life. I wish him the very best during his well- deserved retirement, and I hope he can enjoy more time with loved ones.  West Virginia owes Tony our gratitude, and I thank him for all his  excellent work for so many years.                            ____________________
