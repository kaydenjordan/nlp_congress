 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the scheduled  vote start immediately.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, at the outset, let me thank my colleague  from Alaska for his service to the United States of America and the  Marine Corps, and let me thank all the women and men who serve in the  Marine Corps and all our branches of military service. We owe them a  great debt of gratitude, and we certainly owe them justice.   What is at issue here is the discovery that the water that they were  drinking while they were training at Camp Lejeune was poisoned, and it  was endangering the health of the marines and their families. For  years, they sought compensation and protection and failed. And just  this last year, we passed the PACT Act. Under that provision of law, it  finally gave a cause of action to these marines and their families to  recover for the damages they had suffered because of this poisonous  water at this U.S. Government facility training camp at Camp Lejeune. I  voted for that, proudly. It was a strong bipartisan rollcall, as it  should have been. But let me make sure you understand and everyone  listening understands what these marines who believe that they have  been damaged by this poisoned water--this contaminated water--have to  go through now to recover even the first dollar.   The first instance is, they don't receive it automatically. The  Senator from Alaska continues to refer to the Biden administration's  standards of 2 percent and 10 percent and so forth. He is quoting from  a hypothetical that dealt with the Compensation Fund, not what we  passed here in the U.S. Senate.   The Compensation Fund is like for 9/11 victims. We understand those  cases. It wasn't a question of the victims going in and proving that 9/ 11 actually occurred or that their loved one was killed. It was almost  an automatic thing that you qualify for. So the low contingency fees  which he quoted was for a hypothetical approach which is not the law.   What is the law today?   What if my father or someone in my family--my son--had gone through  training at Camp Lejeune in the period of time that is affected by  this? How do they recover? There are two avenues to recovery. One of  them is file a claim with the U.S. Navy, and the Navy can decide that  the claim is meritorious and pay it.   But if the Navy does not pay it, the administrative hearing does not  result in a payment to the plaintiff, to the claimant, to the marine,  the next step is a serious one. It goes to the Federal court, not just  any Federal court but the one we designated, the Eastern District of  North Carolina.   What happens at that court? That marine now is walking into a Federal  courtroom and has to establish a case and prove the liability of the  government for his losses.   What does he have to prove? Well, he has to prove causation,  liability, and damages.   Have you ever been in a Federal courtroom or walked in there by  yourself and seen what happens? I am telling you that it is a humbling  experience even for a trained lawyer.   I have been through it, and I will tell you this: I wouldn't want to  go through it with something as serious as recovering damages for  healthcare costs or injuries to someone dear to me and my family  without having adequate legal representation.   What does it cost to get this representation?   Well, there is no requirement that the marines hire a lawyer at all,  but if they do, the ordinary course of business says that they are  going to pay a contingency fee, which means you don't pay the lawyer  upfront. The lawyer basically represents you, and if they recover, then  you recover, but if they don't recover anything for your claim, they  are emptyhanded as you are emptyhanded. That is the nature of a  contingency fee.   The Senator from Alaska came to the floor about 2 weeks ago and  raised this issue, and I said: Let's work on this together. I want to  say our staffs have worked on it together. I am sorry that we haven't  reached an agreement, but here was the proposal that I put on the table  and the reason for it.   First, on the contingency fee, if you are just going to go to the  Navy and file your administrative claim, we put a cap on the  contingency fee, which the lawyer is paid, of 20 percent--20 percent.  Where did we get that? From the Federal Tort Claims Act. That is the  percentage that is used now under the law. Then we said, if you have to  go to a trial in a Federal court, the maximum--maximum--attorney's fee  is one-third if you recover. If you don't recover, you don't pay. It is  a contingency fee.   Now, the Senator from Alaska has said: Well, let's do 2 percent and  10 percent instead of 20 percent and 33 percent.   So what can you buy for a 2-percent contingency fee or a 10-percent  contingency fee? Well, you can probably buy a lawyer who has never  tried a case in court. You could buy an attorney whose office is in the  trunk of his car. You could buy an attorney who will put the veteran's  file at the bottom of the stack because there is so little money  involved in it--or you could buy an attorney who will say: My paralegal  in Singapore will get back to you later.   That is what you get if you try to get by with 2 percent and 10  percent when, in the ordinary course of business, it is 33\1/3\  percent. You are doing the veterans no favor by saying that they can't  pay any more than a 2-percent contingency fee if they can't find a good  lawyer, and I am sorry to say you won't find a lot of good lawyers at a  2-percent contingency fee. That is just the reality.   We went to the Senator from Alaska and said: We will cap the  contingency fees: 20 percent for an administrative case and no more  than a 33\1/3\-percent contingency fee if the case goes to trial.   Then we went further. He raised a point that I think is a valid  point: How does a marine know he is going to get paid? We think the  lawyer will be paid, but will the marine be paid if there is a verdict  or a settlement? We put in language that said, definitely, the marine  has to be the first paid. We offered that to the Senator from Alaska.   We went further. There is a bill pending before the U.S. Senate--a  bipartisan bill. Senator Blumenthal of Connecticut and Senator Boozman  of Arkansas, a Republican, have come up with a bill that says: Those  people who are ripping off veterans--unaccredited groups that are  ripping off veterans--by making them pay fees to collect the benefits  they are owed by law ought to be criminally liable. There is a criminal  fine in that bill.   So those are the three things we offered to the Senator from Alaska.  It was not that he would go away emptyhanded but that he would get a  result and get that result in a timely way. We made that offer over the  last 2 weeks. He did not accept it. I wish he had.   I am still going to work with him to reach that goal so that we can  make sure that all men and women who are affected by the Camp Lejeune  contaminated water get compensated with competent attorneys who can  represent them in court effectively and recover for them. We are doing  them no favor if we limit the contingency fee and they can't hire a  competent attorney. That is the maximum amount, 20 and 33, but it is  certainly within the realm of ordinary practice.   So I would say to the Senator from Alaska that the offer I made 2  weeks ago I make to you again now. Let's fix this problem. Let's not  trade speeches on the floor of the Senate. We both feel intensely about  our points of view, but we share one common value that, I think, we  ought to make very clear here: We want these marines to be compensated.  That is why we passed the PACT Act. We want to do it in a way that they  are not exploited. I  [[Page S7230]]  abhor those attorneys or even those who are not attorneys who are  trying to exploit these individuals.   Let's work together to put an end to that once and for all, and let's  do it in a timely way. By the time we get back here to consider  legislation, it will be almost February--another 6 weeks or longer--and  time will have been wasted.   I would just say to the Veterans Health Administration and to all of  the veterans' services organizations: Warn all of those who would be  plaintiffs in these lawsuits not to be taken in by anyone who is going  to cheat them. Make sure that they are treated fairly. We can do our  part too. Let's pledge together to get that done in the new year.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I want to close by thanking the Senator  from Alaska--a Republican, a Democrat but committed to the same  values--for making sure that these marines and their families are  treated fairly.   We currently have 14,000 pending. These marines had 2 years from when  we passed the law back in, I believe, June or July to file their  claims. There is going to be a mountain of claims involved here, and we  have got to make sure that we do it in a thoughtful way and in a timely  way that is fair to the marines every step of the way. I will be part  of that effort with you, Senator.                              Order of Business    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that if the motion to invoke  cloture on the motion to concur with respect to amendment No. 6513 is  not agreed, the motion to concur with amendment be withdrawn; and that  if cloture is invoked, by the use or yielding back of time, the second- degree amendment be withdrawn.    I yield the floor.    I announce that the Senator from Arizona (Mr. Kelly) is  necessarily absent.    I announce that the Senator from Arizona (Mr. Kelly) is  necessarily absent.    I announce that the Senator from Arizona (Mr. Kelly) is  necessarily absent.    Madam President, stop me if you have heard this one  before: Two atoms walk into a bar, they collide into one other at  extreme speeds, under extreme heat, and they leave later that evening  combined--as one, single element.   The process I have just described is known as nuclear fusion. For the  past 60 years, it is a process that has only existed in theory--written  on chalkboards and debated in lecture halls. But last week, everything  changed, when the brilliant minds at the Lawrence Livermore National  Laboratory in California made a breakthrough. For the first time in  human history, these American researchers achieved what is known as  fusion ignition.   They constructed the world's largest laser system--the size of a  sports stadium--to recreate conditions that can only be found in the  cores of stars and giant planets. And they harnessed that power to  combine two particles into one, and as a result, they created more  energy than was used to start the process. In other words, these  federally funded researchers achieved a scientific feat that could pave  the way for unlimited, carbon-free energy. And in the words of our  Secretary of Energy, Jennifer Granholm, it is a breakthrough that  ``[only] happened because we invested in our national labs . . . and we  invested in fundamental research.''   Now, let's be clear, this technology is a long way off from powering  our homes and businesses, but it is a revolutionary proof of concept.  These American researchers have proven that nuclear fusion--and,  potentially, a carbon-free future--are possible.   And this remarkable breakthrough is a return to form for America:  Throughout our history, our government has funded the revolutionary  research considered too risky for investors in the private sector--the  kinds of discoveries  [[Page S7244]]  that cost too much and take too long for private investors--but can  change the world. And time and again, these Federal investments have  paid off. Could you imagine the world economy today without the  internet or the microchip? Well, both were the products of federally  funded research. And both have created well-paying jobs for generations  of families in our country. This new breakthrough in nuclear fusion  proves that America is at its best when we pioneer the inventions and  industries of tomorrow.   And that is exactly why we, in this Senate today, need to invest our  Nation's capacity to innovate. We can't face tomorrow's challenges with  yesterday's budget. But sadly, that is the reality we are faced with if  Congress fails to pass a spending package by the end of this month.   Yes, it is that time of the year again in Washington: the end-of-year  sprint to pass a government funding bill--also known as an omnibus. And  as we approach the closing days of this Congress, we need to answer a  fundamental question: Will we pass a government funding bill that  adequately addresses our Nation's greatest challenges? Or we will give  up and kick the can to the next Congress?   And this isn't just about funding for fundamental research; we are  talking about the fundamental problems Americans face every single day.  If we don't pass an omnibus in the next several days, the Federal  Government will have to rely on what is known as a continuing  resolution; it is essentially copying and pasting last year's budget  into next year. Imagine if a high school student did that on a term  paper; they would fail the class--and for good reason.   Fortunately, earlier this week, Senator Leahy, Senator Shelby, and  Congresswoman DeLauro announced a spending framework that will  hopefully lead to an omnibus appropriations package to fully fund the  government through the next fiscal year. That omnibus bill will support  healthcare for our senior citizens and veterans, infrastructure  projects to rebuild and revitalize our communities, and community  violence prevention programs to keep our kids and families safe. These  are real solutions to the urgent problems American families deal with  every single day. In fact, over the past 2 years, this Senate has  passed a number of policies to address those same problems--many of  them bipartisan.   We passed the biggest infrastructure bill in a generation, to rebuild  our roads and bridges and replace lead pipes in cities like Chicago. We  passed the CHIPS and Science Act, to bring manufacturing jobs back to  our shores and secure our domestic supply of a component that is  critical in the 21st century economy. We passed the PACT Act, to keep  our promise to America's veterans and help those suffering from toxic  exposure during their time on the battlefield. And we also passed the  Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, to combat the scourge of gun violence  that has now become the No. 1 killer of America's children.   But here is the issue: If we leave Washington without passing a  spending package, these policies will be little more than words on  paper--because none of these initiatives will receive the funding they  need to start helping American families. That is unacceptable; the  American people have already shown that they support these policies.   How do we know that? Well, as members of this Senate, we voted on  every one of those measures I just mentioned. They all passed. Last  month, many of these same Senators touted their support for these  measures in their reelection campaigns. And every single one of them  was reelected--every single one. That hasn't happened since 1934. That  is about as clear a message as you get in politics: The policies we  have passed are popular--and even more important, they are necessary.   So how can we now turn around and tell the American people: Sorry,  you will just have to wait a little longer. We have decided not to fund  those promises we made? How can we tell that to the veteran who needs  lifesaving medical care today? Or the mother whose child is at risk of  gun violence today? Or Americans who don't have access to safe drinking  water today? These Americans have already waited too long, and they  shouldn't have to wait a moment longer. We should do our job and fund  the government.   Passing an omnibus also will bring millions of dollars in earmark  funding that Senator Duckworth and I have worked to secure for  community projects in Illinois. These projects will improve our State's  transportation systems, clean up our water, strengthen community  violence prevention initiatives, expand access to healthcare, create  jobs, and much more. But if we leave Washington without passing an  omnibus, these projects will not receive the funding they need to move  forward.   And worse yet, public safety will suffer. In my town of Springfield,  our U.S. Attorney tells me his office needs Federal funding to hire  more assistant U.S. Attorneys, who are on the frontlines of combating  gun violence and violent crime. And across the country, there is a  shortage of more than 750 assistant U.S. Attorneys. If we fail to pass  a spending package, those shortages, which are a risk to public safety,  will extend into next year. That would be a pitiful closing act for the  117th Congress, which has done a lot of good work for the American  people.   So let's come together and finish the job. Let's fully fund the  government before we leave for the holidays, so hard-working Americans  can finally get the solutions they have been waiting on.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.
