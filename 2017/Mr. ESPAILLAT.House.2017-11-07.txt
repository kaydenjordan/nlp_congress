 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a constituent  of mine, Dr. Joachim Frank. Dr. Frank is a faculty member at Columbia  University who, earlier this month, along with his international  research colleagues, was awarded the 2017 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.   Dr. Frank becomes the third constituent from New York's 13th  Congressional District who has received this tremendous honor and  crowning achievement from the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. Dr.  Frank's work and success is the foundation for scientists to explore  and illuminate an almost unimaginable world that exists much beyond  what you and I can imagine.   We will see new medicines, curative therapies, and access to more  information than we have ever seen before: the true product and  potential of unrelenting intellectual curiosity.   Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to congratulate my constituent, Dr.  Joachim Frank, and his research partners as the distinguished  recipients of the 2017 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 3441, the  so-called Save Local Business Act.   This bill virtually eliminates joint employer liability under the  National Labor Relations Act and under the Fair Labor Standards Act. As  my colleagues have highlighted, there are numerous unintended  consequences presented by this bill.   I want to highlight the impact on an often overlooked segment of our  workforce: our Nation's farmworkers.   Farmworkers are among our Nation's most vulnerable workers.  Farmworkers work long hours in poor conditions for low pay. Many  farmworkers are undocumented and subject to severe abuse. The Migrant  and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act is the principal labor  statute protecting agriculture workers and establishes wage, health,  safety, and recordkeeping standards for both seasonal and temporary  farmworkers. Joint employment standards under this law and the Fair  Labor Standards Act are vital to protecting the rights and protections  afforded to these workers.   Oftentimes, farmworkers are recruited, hired, supervised, or  transported by intermediaries, sometimes referred to as farm labor  contractors. Farm operators utilizing farm labor contractors maintain  control over working conditions seeking to ensure the financial success  of their operation.   Despite this shared responsibility, farm operators may argue that the  farm labor contractors they engage are the farmworkers' sole employer  responsible for compliance. Farm labor contractors are often thinly  capitalized. This means if a farmworker seeks redress for a violation,  he or she may not be able to collect from the farm labor contractors.  Under the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act,  joint employer liability helps ensure covered workers can also hold  liability from farm operators that share responsibility.    By amending the Fair Labor Standards Act's broad  definition of ``employ'' and creating a new extremely narrow definition  of ``joint employer,'' H.R. 3441 upends the Fair Labor Standards Act's  joint employer framework upon which we rely on.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a statement from Farmworker  Justice in opposition to this bill.  Statememt on ``Save Local Business Act,'' House Education and Workforce   Committee--Bruce Goldstein, President, Farmworker Justice, October 2,                                    2017         Farmworker Justice appreciates the opportunity to submit       this statement to the House Committee on Education and the       Workforce. Farmworker Justice, a national advocacy, education       and litigation organization for farmworkers founded in 1981       and based in Washington, D.C. Farmworker Justice has played a       leading role in advocacy, education and litigation regarding       the joint employer concept to remedy and prevent labor       abuses. I am President of Farmworker Justice and have 37       years of experience as an attorney, including at the National       Labor Relations Board, Legal Services, in private practice       and at this organization.        Farmworker Justice opposes the ``Save Local Business Act,''       HR 3441 because it would remove an important mechanism to       protect farmworkers and other low-wage workers from suffering       violations of the minimum wage and child labor requirements.       The bill would make it extremely difficult to hold two       businesses jointly liable as ``joint employers'' of the same       worker or group of workers. This bill, if enacted, would       result in massive violations of the minimum wage and other       labor abuses that would harm farmworkers and harm the       reputation of the entire agricultural sector.        This bill, if enacted, would reverse more than 130 years of       knowledge developed in the  [[Page H8570]]       quest to eradicate sweatshops. The Fair Labor Standards Act       of 1938, which sets minimum wage, overtime, and child labor       standards, adopted a definition of employment relationships       based on 50 years of experience under state laws that evolved       to address employers' efforts to evade child labor and other       labor laws.        During the mid- to late-1800's states adopted laws to       regulate and limit the hours of employment of children and       quickly confronted employers' efforts to evade the laws.       Business owners that operated a manufacturing plant would       claim that the children in the plant were employed solely by       a subcontractor within the plant or had been brought to the       plant by a parent or sibling and therefore should not be       considered to have ``employed'' the child. Even if the       subcontractor or parent were punished, in the absence of       liability on the part of the plant operator it would suffer       no adverse impact and would be free to find another       subcontractor or parent to bring children to do the work. In       addition, often a labor contractor lack sufficient assets to       pay a court judgement, leaving workers remedy-less.        One of the responses of state legislatures was to adopt a       broad definition of employment relationships that imposed       employer status on the larger business owner even where there       existed a labor intermediary. Numerous states adopted       language defining employment relationships that later became       the model for the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938.        The state laws and the FLSA defined employers as entities       that directly or indirectly employed a worker and defined the       word ``employ'' as including not just the restrictive common       law definition's ``right to control test'' but also as ``to       suffer or permit to work.'' 29 USC Sec. 203(g). To ``suffer''       in this context means to acquiesce in, passively allow or to       fail to prevent the worker's work.        This broad definition imposed liability on a company that       had the power to prevent the work of the worker from       happening and denied the business the ability to hide its       head in the sand about what was happening in its business,       including where it utilized labor contractors or other       intermediaries which were considered employers of those       workers. See Goldstein et al., ``Enforcing Fair Labor       Standards in the Modern American Sweatshop: Rediscovering the       Statutory Definition of Employment,'' 46 UCLA Law Review 983       (1999). The purpose of establishing joint responsibility is       also reflected in FLSA's definition of ``employer,'' 29 USC       Sec. 203(d), `` 'Employer' includes any person acting       directly or indirectly in the interest of an employer in       relation to an employee.''        The facts in the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in       Rutherford Food Corp. v. McComb, 331 U.S. 722 (1947)       illustrate the concept. A slaughterhouse company retained a       contractor to assemble a crew of workers to de-bone meat in a       special room within the slaughterhouse. The Department of       Labor sued the defendant company for recordkeeping and       overtime violations. The company denied that it employed the       meat de-boners, arguing that the contractor was their sole       employer. The Court found that the definition of employment       relationships in the FLSA imposed liability on the       slaughterhouse.        The Save Local Business Act would alter the longstanding       meaning of employment relationships under the FLSA and the       National Labor Relations Act. The NLRA excludes agricultural       workers from its protections, so I will focus on the FLSA.       The FLSA's minimum wage applies to farmworkers on most (but       not all) larger farms; small farms generally are excluded       from the minimum wage. 29 USC 213(a)(6). Agricultural workers       are excluded from overtime pay. 29 USC Sec. 213(b)(13)-(16).       FLSA prohibits certain types of child labor although it       allows large agricultural employers, as well as small family       farms, to employ children at younger ages than is allowed in       other occupations. Id. at (c)(1)-(2).        The bill would set criteria so onerous that it would be       rare for two businesses that shared responsibilities       regarding workers to be held to be joint employers; just one       business would be held to be an employer. Because the Migrant       and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act (AWPA) refers       to the definition of ``employ'' in the Fair Labor Standards       Act, the proposed law may also apply to AWPA. 29 USC       Sec. 1802(5). AWPA is the principal federal employment law       for farmworkers, regulating employment contracts and the use       of farm labor contractors.        Many agricultural workers suffer violations of the Fair       Labor Standards Act's minimum wage and other basic labor       protections. Often, when such workers try to remedy illegal       employment practices, they run into a problem: the farm       operator that really determines their job terms and has the       capacity to prevent abuses, denies that it is their       ``employer'' for purposes of the minimum wage and other labor       protections. Instead, the farm operator claims that a ``farm       labor contractor'' or other intermediary is the sole       ``employer'' of the farmworkers on its farm. Often a labor       contractor competes for business by promising low labor costs       and when sued by victimized workers cannot afford to pay a       court judgment.        In most such cases, the definition of employment       relationships in the FLSA enables courts and the Department       of Labor to ensure compliance with the law by considering the       farm operator and the farm labor contractor to be ``joint       employers'' and jointly responsible for meeting FLSA's       obligations. This issue has been the subject of numerous       lawsuits in which farm operators have been held to be joint       employers with their farm labor contractors.        This Committee played a historic role in addressing abuses       of migrant workers at the hands of farm operators and their       labor contractors and recognized the importance of the joint       employer concept in ensuring a law-abiding, prosperous       agricultural sector. The Farm Labor Contractor Registration       Act of 1964 was passed in part in response to the powerful       documentary by Edward R. Murrow, ``Harvest of Shame'' that       aired during Thanksgiving weekend in 1960. Congress revised       its provisions and replaced it with the Migrant and Seasonal       Agricultural Worker Protection Act of 1983, 29 U.S.C.       Sec. 1801 et seq. At the heart of this Committee's motivation       was ensuring joint employer responsibility.        ``This broad scope of joint employment--and joint employer       liability--is one of the AWPA's most important features. The       AWPA's legislative history indicates that Congress considered       the joint employer doctrine ``a central foundation'' of this       new law. 29 C.F.R. Sec. 500.20(h)(5)(ii); citing House       Report, n.2 at 4552. It is the ``indivisible hinge'' that       allows workers to hold accountable all those responsible for       violating the AWPA's protections. Id, citing H.R. Rep. 97-      885, 97th Cong., 2d Sess.1, reprinted in 1982 U.S.C.C.A.N.       4547, 4552 (1982) (``House Report'').        The economic reality is that few farm operators will risk       their profitability and the survival of their business by       delegating all responsibility to a labor contractor. Most       farm operators who engage labor intermediaries exercise       substantial decision-making regarding the impact of       subcontracted workers on their business. If strawberries or       grapes are harvested when they are over-ripe or under-ripe,       are subjected to pathogens transmitted on the footwear or       hands of farmworkers, or are not handled carefully to prevent       bruising, huge financial losses could result. A farm operator       generally makes these and other major decisions to ensure its       profitability, even if it uses a farm labor contractor,       instead of its own supervisor, to ensure that its decisions       are carried out. Such farm operators should not be able to       avoid complying with the minimum wage or child labor       requirements by blaming a labor contractor as the sole       employer. In most cases, there is shared responsibility among       the farm operator and the labor contractor so that the       workers on the farm ensure the profitability of that       business. That shared responsibility means shared liability       is appropriate.        The joint employer concept does not deprive farms or other       businesses of the ability or right to engage labor       contractors or other intermediaries such as staffing       agencies. Nor does it prevent businesses from entering into       agreements that require labor contractors to comply with all       employment-law obligations, purchase liability insurance       against employment-law claims and hold the larger business       harmless for any litigation and liability that may result.        Joint employer liability creates an incentive to ensure       that a business selects its labor contractors, as well as its       directly-hired supervisors, wisely and ensures compliance       with employment laws. In addition to ensuring protections for       workers, joint employer liability helps protect law-abiding       businesses from unfair competition by unscrupulous employers       that keep their labor costs low by using labor contractors       that violate employment-related obligations. The joint       employer concept is an important, longstanding approach to       minimizing sweatshops and its elimination would result in a       return to an era in which sweatshops are more prevalent.        The joint employer concept also helps create consumer       confidence regarding their purchases. People want to feel       good about the food they eat. Agriculture has a reputation       for poor treatment of farmworkers that would be exacerbated       by the increases in abuses that would flow from this       legislation.        Congress should reject the Save Local Business Act because       it contradicts 130 years of experience in preventing       sweatshops in factories and at least 50 years of consensus       regarding policies needed to remedy and prevent abuses of the       people who labor on our farms and ranches to produce our       food.
