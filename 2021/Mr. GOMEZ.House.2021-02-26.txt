 Madam Speaker, we don't have any time to waste. By the  time I am done with this 1-minute speech, roughly 10 people in L.A.  County, home to my district, will have tested positive for COVID-19.  And in another 5 minutes, someone in my county will die of COVID-19.   And while I am sure our healthcare heroes and frontline workers  appreciate our thanks, words alone are not enough.   Our gratitude needs to be expressed with funding and resources. Our  appreciation needs to be in the form of benefits and assistance.   Our Black and Brown communities, those being disproportionately  impacted by this pandemic, aren't going to get through this crisis with  platitudes. They need action. They need access to vaccines, money in  their pockets to pay their bills, help getting their kids back in the  classrooms, and support putting food on their tables.   Madam Speaker, that is why I am going to vote to pass the American  Rescue Plan, and I encourage my colleagues to do the same.   This is our chance to stop the spread of this virus, rebuild our  economy, and give every American, regardless of their background or ZIP  Code, the opportunity to turn the page on this dark chapter of our  country's history and come out stronger in the end.
