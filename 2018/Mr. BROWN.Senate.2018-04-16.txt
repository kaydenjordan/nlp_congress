 Mr. President, I strongly encourage my colleagues to  reject this anti-worker bill masquerading as an issue of Tribal  sovereignty.   I strongly support Tribal sovereignty. I can't speak for everyone in  this body, but I am virtually certain that every single Democratic  Member of this body supports Tribal sovereignty, and I am pretty  certain that most Republican Members of this body support Tribal  sovereignty, but that is not what this bill is about. This is just the  latest battle in the decades-long war that so many in this town have  been waging to undermine the rights of  [[Page S2135]]  American workers. This bill strips away the rights of 600,000 employees  at Tribal casinos, so 600,000 employees at casinos on Tribal lands will  lose their right to collective bargaining. We know what that means to  their wages and their benefits. Seventy-five percent of these 600,000  employees are not members of a Tribe. So when these casinos all over  the country, on reservations, these casinos on Indian lands--most of  the 600,000 employees at the Tribal casinos have the right to  collectively bargain, to form unions if they choose, to collectively  bargain if they choose, and to get better wages and benefits if that is  what brings them to it. Again, 75 percent of these workers are not  members of any of these Tribes. There are other Federal laws that apply  to workplaces on Tribal lands.   The Fair Labor Standards Act, the Occupational Safety and Health Act,  the Employment Retirement Income Security Act--so-called ERISA--and  title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act all apply on Tribal  lands, but this bill only goes after collective bargaining rights, only  goes after those workers. There is no reason Congress should single out  and attack the rights of these workers to organize and advocate for  themselves in the workplace.   We can protect Tribal sovereignty. I want to do that. I am leading  the charge against this bill. I want to protect Tribal sovereignty, but  you can also protect workers' rights at the same time. You don't have  to jettison workers' rights. You don't have to hurt these workers. We  don't have to take rights away from these workers--the right to  organize and bargain collectively--in order to protect Tribal  sovereignty. Our laws do that right now.   Some of my colleagues will say they want to make sure that Tribes  have the same rights as States, whose workers are carved out of the  National Labor Relations Act, but Tribal government employees are  already exempted from the National Labor Relations Act. This bill  eliminates the Federal labor rights of workers at for-profit  businesses, like casinos.   So who is behind this? The national chamber of commerce wants to go  after unions every chance they get and take away collective bargaining  rights. Do you know what that means when companies do that? It means  higher profits. It means they can pay less to workers. It means they  can strip workers of their healthcare and their retirement. Of course  these companies want to take away collective bargaining rights and put  unions out of business. That is the whole point of this bill.   Again, Tribal government employees are already exempted from the  NLRA. This bill eliminates the Federal labor rights of workers at for- profit businesses, like casinos. You don't think these casinos are  making lots of money? Of course they are. They will make more money if  you take away the collective bargaining rights of employees. Employees  will make less. Employees will, in some cases, lose their health  insurance. Employees will get fewer dollars for retirement, but profits  will go up for these casinos.   These casinos are often run by companies that have nothing to do with  these Tribes. That is not establishing parity. States can't carve out  home State, for-profit businesses from the NLRA. Nevada can't say that  it has decided its casinos on the Vegas Strip are exempt from Federal  labor laws. So why would we treat these private, for-profit casinos any  differently?    Supporters of the bill will say it is necessary to prevent overreach  by the National Labor Relations Board. That argument doesn't hold up  either. The Board is methodically evaluated when they do and don't  assert jurisdiction on Federal lands. They use a very careful test to  ensure that the Board's jurisdiction does not infringe on Tribal rights  or interfere in the Tribes' exclusive right to self-government.   All of us in this body--at least all of us on this side of the aisle;  I think all of us in the body--of course we want to make sure that  Tribal rights are enforced and that we don't interfere in the Tribes'  exclusive right to self-governance. These, though, are for-profit  businesses on these reservations.   In a June 2015 decision, the Board used the test and did not assert  jurisdiction in a labor dispute on Tribal lands.   As I said, I think all of us here support Tribal sovereignty. I wish  all of us here supported American workers' right to organize just as  strongly.   My friends on this side of the aisle have spent day after day, week  after week, month after month, doing all they can to stop workers in my  State, in the State of Kansas, and all over this country from  organizing. This bill is an attempt to take advantage of Tribe support  in Congress to attack workers.   There is another provision slipped in. At a time when Congress is  engaged in a long-overdue discussion about sexual harassment in the  workplace, this bill repeals all Federal protections against harassment  for the 600,000 workers. So it strips collective bargaining rights from  600,000 people. It also repeals all Federal protection against sexual  harassment for those same 600,000 workers. Right now, these workers  cannot bring Federal harassment claims. Their only Federal protection  against harassment is the NLRA. Under that law, workers have the right  to collectively protest harassment. They can file grievances under  union contracts to enforce their rights. If this bill passes, that  Federal protection will disappear. All of the collective bargaining  agreements in these workplaces would expire at the end of their terms,  and the union-won protections against harassment would simply disappear  along with all of them.   We are going in the wrong direction. Today more than ever, workers  need a voice in the workplace.   Think about this: Over the last 40 years, gross domestic product has  gone up and up and up. Corporate profits have gone up and up and up;  worker productivity has gone up and up and up; executive salaries have  gone up and up and up--all because of the productivity of American  workers. But workers haven't shared in the wealth that they have  created for their bosses. Workers haven't shared in the growth of those  companies. Wages are flat.   So think about that again. Profits go up, productivity goes up,  executive salaries go up, productivity of American workers, as I said,  goes up, but wages are flat. A big part of that is because of this  attack from this body and the House of Representatives--the attack on  workers trying to organize and bargain collectively. So if this bill  passes, we are going to make sure that 600,000 fewer Americans have the  right to organize and bargain collectively. Again, it means profits  will go up at these casinos, executive salaries will go up at the  casinos, and wages will be flat and go down even as these companies do  better and better.   Workers don't share in the growth they create. Hard work just doesn't  pay off the way it used to. The dignity of work has been undermined by  this Senate, by the House of Representatives, and by the White House.  If work isn't valued, then Americans can't earn their way to a better  life for their families no matter how hard they work. This bill will  make it harder for these workers to ensure that their work is valued.   This bill undermines the dignity of work in this country. We ought to  be lifting up workers. We shouldn't be undermining their right to  advocate for themselves. These are workers banding together to advocate  for themselves. Their voices are stronger when they are together, and  that is when management has to listen to them. That is why they get  better wages. That is why they get better healthcare. That is why they  get better retirement. But we know what this bill does. It doesn't  protect Tribal sovereignty. That is just what they say it does, just  like they said--80 percent of the tax cut went to the richest 1 percent  of Americans, and they called that a tax cut for the middle class.  Surely it wasn't that. Just like the bank bill that rolls back some  tough rules on Wall Street--they like to say that was a bill for the  small banks. No, it wasn't. It was much about Wall Street. Just like  this bill is not for Tribal sovereignty--it is to help put labor unions  out of business and depress wages. That is why I oppose this bill.   I urge my colleagues to vote no.                         Nomination of Ronny Jackson    Mr. President, over the next few weeks, the Senate will consider the  President's nominee to head the Department of Veterans Affairs, Dr.  Ronny Jackson. I will be meeting with Dr. Jackson tomorrow, and I look  forward to that meeting. I am eager to  [[Page S2136]]  hear what his plans are and how he will make the VA system work better  for the women and men who serve our country. I will have some tough  questions for him. I know my friend, the Senator from Kansas and the  current Presiding Officer, who also sits on the Committee on Veterans'  Affairs, has the same concerns that I have.   One of my top priorities will be finding out his views on the  misguided idea that some are pushing of privatizing the Veterans'  Administration. Privatizing the VA would mean putting profits ahead of  veterans. It would mean depriving the women and men who served our  country the best possible care just to line the pockets of healthcare  executives.   We have seen what happens when we introduce corporate profit motives  into organizations that should be set up to serve the American people.  Just look how private, for-profit charter schools have failed children  in my State. The owners of the private, for-profit charter schools have  done well, while taxpayers have been fleeced and students have been  betrayed. We know that privatization of the prison system or  privatization of Social Security or privatization of Medicare or  privatization of the Veterans' Administration all works the same way.  The people who are to be served find they have less quality care or  service. The people who own the newly privatized agencies or companies  do very well.   Study after study in my State shows these for-profit charter schools  don't give Ohio students an adequate education and cost taxpayers more.  According to a report from Stanford University's Center for Research on  Education Outcomes, students at Ohio's charter schools lose 43 days of  math instruction and 14 days of reading instruction, compared with  traditional public schools in the State. We allowed for-profit school  operators to inject profits into Ohio's public education, and they  treated taxpayers like ATM machines and shortchanged students. We can't  allow the same thing to happen to veterans. I will fight any effort to  use America's veterans to pad the profits of wealthy corporations. Dr.  Jackson will have to commit to oppose any VA privatization efforts to  earn my vote.   We know the VA system isn't perfect, and we know it can improve. We  have work to do to rebuild and strengthen it. Dr. Shulkin was trying to  do that and made some inroads in doing it, but it will be hard. It is  the largest healthcare system in the country. It serves 9 million  veterans every year and provides care at more than 1,200 facilities  across the country, including about three dozen in my State.   Some of those serve veterans very well, while others need significant  investment to improve their services. Too many veterans still face  obstacles to get the highest quality care through the VA system. I know  veterans service organizations, some of the best groups and civic  organizations in our country--to name a few, knowing I will leave some  out: the Disabled American Veterans, the American Legion, the AMVETS,  the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Paralyzed Veterans of America, the  Polish American Veterans--all these organizations have said: We don't  want to privatize the VA. We want improvements in the Veterans'  Administration, but we want to keep it a public organization that  serves veterans who fought for this country.   Just because the task to fix the VA is hard doesn't mean we abandon  our responsibility to the men and women who served this country. We  need to redouble our efforts to strengthen the VA, not tear it down and  not privatize it.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
