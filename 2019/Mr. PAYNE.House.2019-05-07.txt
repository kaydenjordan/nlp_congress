 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Dr. Joseph M. Juliano  upon his retirement from the City of Orange Fire Department after 30  years of service.   Dr. Juliano's commitment to the people of Orange, New Jersey, was  inspired by his mother, Patricia, who was the first woman elected to  the Orange City Council.   Dr. Juliano joined the Fire Department in 1988 and rose through the  ranks during his 30-year career. He retired with the rank of fire  captain.   In addition to being a firefighter, Dr. Juliano has served on the  Orange Housing Authority for the past two decades, with the motto of  ``getting Orange back on track.''   Dr. Juliano is a community leader and a role model from Orange, New  Jersey, and I ask that my colleagues join me in honoring his service to  the people of my district.                            ____________________
