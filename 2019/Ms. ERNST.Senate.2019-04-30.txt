 Madam President, today I wish to honor Mr. William  ``Bill'' Armstrong of Mount Ayr, IA. Bill is a lifelong Iowan and  outgoing president of the Iowa Funeral Directors Association.   Bill Armstrong has served as one of the most effective advocates for  both Iowa morticians and morticians across the country for almost 40  years. He graduated from Dallas Institute of Mortuary Science in 1984  and soon after moved to his current hometown of Mount Ayr, where he  accepted a position as a funeral director at Wilson-Watson Funeral  Home. His journey was only just beginning.   In remarkably short order, he achieved partnership at the funeral  home and ultimately acquired the business from Jay and Donna Watson in  2009, officially making the funeral home, Armstrong Funeral Homes.   This prompted Bill to become an outspoken leader for current and  future funeral professionals. He proudly represented morticians on both  the local and national level by pioneering annual trips to both Des  Moines and to Washington, DC, in order to raise awareness about the  profession.   Bill was always forward looking, with a singular objective of  training the next generation of funeral home leaders. He worked with  the University of Northern Iowa to establish a 4-year degree program  for mortuary studies.   These are all amazing accomplishments, and I want to thank Bill again  for his service and for helping Iowans through their most difficult  life moments. I wish him success in his new endeavors.                            ____________________
