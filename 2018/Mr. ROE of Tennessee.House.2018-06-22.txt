 Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   As a practicing physician for over 30 years, I have incredible  respect for nurses and the work they do. I married a nurse. Some of the  best employees I have worked with were nurses. I could not appreciate  the job they do more, Mr. Chair, but care for patients is better  directed with physician oversight.   Even with my training, we need fewer doctors like me writing these  prescriptions and more physicians trained in pain management. The  American Society of Addiction Medicine is establishing approved  fellowships in training in addiction medicine today.   Expanding the scope of practice for nonphysician providers to  dispense drugs like buprenorphine goes in the wrong direction, in my  opinion.   There are many factors that contribute to the explosive growth in  opioid use, but clearly a big factor was the lack of knowledge about  opioids' addictive qualities. I would argue that we have a similar lack  of knowledge about buprenorphine today, and allowing providers who have  less training and less knowledge about these substances exponentially  increases the chances of abuse in these substances.                                time  1045    If we remove the most highly-trained specialist from administration  of buprenorphine, I fear that all the good we are trying to do in this  bill could be negated.    There are plenty of provisions to support in  this underlying bill. It is a good bill, but section 303 is not one of  them.   I encourage my colleagues to support the amendment.
