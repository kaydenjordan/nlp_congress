 Madam Speaker, last month, House Democrats announced an  impeachment inquiry into the President without a formal vote, and they  chose Adam Schiff to lead the process.   This effectively means that, for the first time in American history,  the impeachment of a duly elected President will take place in secret.   Chairman Schiff has been caught on at least three occasions making  blatantly false statements about this investigation. He has a complete  lack of credibility to lead this sham of an inquiry. This whole thing  is profoundly unfair and just not worthy of Congress.   So I say to my Democrat colleagues: Stop this secret, partisan  impeachment, and let's get back to work for the American people.                            ____________________
