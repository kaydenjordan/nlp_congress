 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 3441, the so-called Save  Local Business Act. Mr. Speaker, in recent years, employers have  increasingly moved away from direct hiring of employees to the use of  permatemps and subcontracting to reduce labor costs  [[Page H8567]]  and liability. For many workers, the name on the door of the building  where they work may not be the name of the company that technically  signs their paycheck.   In situations like these, where more than one entity controls or has  the contractual right to control the terms and conditions of  employment, the National Labor Relations Act and the Fair Labor  Standards Act hold both entities responsible for violations as joint  employers. The joint employment standard under the NLRA ensures that  workers can negotiate with all parties that control the terms and  conditions of employment. Similarly, the joint employment standard  under the FLSA ensures the appropriate companies can be held  accountable for wage theft, equal pay, overtime pay, and child labor  violations.   H.R. 3441 rewrites both the NLRA and the FLSA by establishing a  narrow definition of joint employer that effectively eliminates  accountability for some of the entities that are actually calling the  shots. Under this bill, an entity may be a joint employer only if it  ``directly, actually, and immediately'' exercises control over nine  essential terms and conditions of employment, such as hiring, firing,  determining rates of pay, and scheduling.   However, an entity could have control over all nine of the essential  terms, and if it indirectly exercises control through an intermediary,  such as a subcontractor, then the entity would not be an employer  because its control is not direct. This loophole would allow joint  employers to evade liability for child labor or wage theft and  undermine workers' ability to bring all of the entities to the  bargaining table that actually control the terms and conditions of  employment.   Alternatively, if an entity controls only eight of these nine  essential terms and outsources the ninth, then it may also not be  deemed a joint employer under this legislation. That is just a  loophole.   Under this legislation, an employee could have no employer liable for  a violation. This would arise when each of the joint employers raises a  defense that they are not liable because they are not an employer,  because they don't control all nine of the essential terms and  conditions of employment.   This bill provides no guidance over how many of the essential terms  the joint employer must control. Do they have to control two? a  majority? all nine?   The consequence is that a court could find an employee is owed  overtime, but nobody owes the money because nobody qualifies as an  employer under the definition of the bill. This bill opens the door for  potential chaos. And one thing for sure, H.R. 3441 does not provide the  clarity that its proponents advertise.   Today, we are debating legislation that is based on a misplaced  criticism of the National Labor Relations Board's 2015 decision in  Browning-Ferris Industries, where the NLRB held that the client  employer, BFI, and its staffing agency, Leadpoint, were joint employers  at a recycling facility and, therefore, jointly had the duty to bargain  with the union.   BFI capped wages that Leadpoint could pay and set scheduling,  reserved the right to overrule Leadpoint's hiring decisions, and, if  the NLRB had certified the union with only the staffing agency,  Leadpoint, as the employer, then collective bargaining would have been  a waste of time because Leadpoint was contractually limited in its  ability to bargain without BFI's permission.   The BFI decision reinstated the common law definition of an employer,  a precedent that had been in place at the NLRB for decades prior to  1984. Critics contend that the BFI case threatens the independence of  franchisees.                                time  1645    Well, first, the BFI decision states that it does not cover  franchising. Second, there are no decisions where a franchisor has ever  been held to be a joint employer with its franchisees under either law.   Despite claims that H.R. 3441 would protect the independence of  franchisees, legal experts point out that, under this bill, the bill  actually insulates franchisors from liability, which leaves the  franchisors free to exercise greater control over their franchisees'  employee relations without liability.   Under this bill, if a franchisor directs actions that could violate  wage or labor laws, then the franchisee is forced to accept this shared  control, without shared responsibility. For example, suppose the  franchisor directs the franchisee to designate all of the employees as  managers and refuse to pay them overtime and the court comes in and  says overtime was owed, then the franchisee is stuck with the bill  because the franchisor is not an employer under this bill. That is not  fair to small businesses and it is not fair to franchisees.   This legislation also creates perverse incentives by rewarding low- road construction contractors who compete by outsourcing entities that  drive down costs by stealing wages, not paying overtime, and other  violations. A national coalition of construction contractors is warned  that H.R. 3441 would ``further tilt the field of competition against  honest, ethical businesses.''   For those reasons, Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds to  state that I agree with the gentleman when he says that no rights are  reduced. The only problem is you can't have anybody that is liable to  fulfill your benefits under whatever those rights are. If you are owed  overtime, you are owed overtime. That is not reduced. It is just that  nobody is there to pay it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms.  Fudge).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Espaillat).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds  to the gentleman from New York.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Takano), the ranking member of the  Subcommittee on Workforce Protections.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Norcross).    Mr. Speaker, could you advise us as to how  much time is remaining on both sides.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 15 seconds.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record page 50 of the committee report,  which outlines the exchange with Mr. Braddy, which suggests that the  franchisors do not become joint employers under the present law.         In an exchange between Representative Guthrie and Ed       Braddy, a Burger King franchisee testifying on behalf of the       International Franchise Association, Mr. Braddy was asked:        Representative Guthrie: Do you or do [sic] the franchisor       hire and fire and determine the work of your employees?        Mr. Braddy: I schedule interviews every other Wednesday. I       sit down with eight people every other Wednesday. Even though       I am not hiring, I do the interviews because I always like to       have a waiting list of people who want to work. So I do all       the hiring. I don't allow my managers or my assistants to       terminate anyone because I want to make sure that once I let       someone go it is for a good reason.        Mr. Guthrie: But it is you as the business owner, not the--      what role does the franchisor play in any of your--those       issues?        Mr. Braddy: None at all.        Based on this testimony, nothing in the Browning Ferris       decision could establish that these franchisors are       exercising sufficient control to be deemed a joint employer       with their respective fanchisees.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro), the ranking member of the  Labor-Health and Human Services Appropriations Subcommittee.    I yield the gentlewoman from Connecticut an  additional 1 minute.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Massachusetts (Mr. Lynch).    Mr. Speaker, how much time is remaining for  both sides?    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms. Bonamici), the ranking member of the  Committee on Education and the Workforce.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, so I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Mr. Speaker, in conclusion, this bill will undermine employees'  ability to secure recourse for unfair labor practices and wage theft  when there should be a joint employer. It undermines the workers'  freedom to negotiate for better wages in return for their work. It  inflicts damage to prime contractors who play by the rules and are  forced to compete against unscrupulous other employers who save money  by failing to pay wages. And it exposes franchisees to liabilities they  should  [[Page H8579]]  not have to shoulder alone because it allows franchisors to exercise  more control over franchisees without incurring any liability.    Mr. Speaker, therefore, I urge my colleagues to oppose the bill, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
