 Madam President, I come to the floor today in support of  the Respect for Marriage Act. I want to summarize my remarks, though,  and ask unanimous consent that my full remarks be printed in today's  Record.    The Supreme Court declared same-sex marriage as a  constitutional right way back in 2015, and the overwhelming majority of  Americans support that group. According to Gallup, over 70 percent of  Americans believe same-sex marriage should be recognized as valid under  law, including a majority of Republicans.   Despite this strong support, the U.S. Code does not reflect that  consensus in America. Current legislation allows States and the Federal  Government to  [[Page S6839]]  refuse to recognize valid same-sex marriages. While it is true the  Supreme Court has held this law is not enforceable, it still represents  Congress's last word on the subject. The American people rightly expect  their elected representatives to bring our laws in line with their  beliefs. That is part of what this legislation does.   It is time for the Senate to settle the issue. The Respect for  Marriage Act, which passed the House with overwhelming partisanship  support, including the support of 46 Republicans on the House side,  simply allows interracial or same-sex couples who are validly married  under the laws of one State to know that their marriage will be  recognized by the Federal Government and other States if they move.  This is all in accordance with well-established Supreme Court  precedence.   Settling this issue is well within the constitutional authority of us  here in Congress. After all, the full faith and credit clause is part  of our Constitution.   Since the bipartisan passage of this bill by the House of  Representatives earlier this year, in response to concerns over  religious liberty, this already narrow bill has been significantly  amended in the Senate to include robust religious liberty protections.  By working collaboratively on a bipartisan basis with religious liberty  scholars; faith organizations; Senate colleagues, including some I see  on the floor here today; and other stakeholders, we have developed a  substitute amendment that contains important protections for people of  faith. It has five key changes to the underlying bill.   Remember, this is a bill that already passed the House with 46  Republican supporters, but these are religious liberty provisions that  we have added to it.   First, it has an express acknowledgement that decent and honorable  people hold diverse views about the role of gender and marriage and  that such people and their beliefs are due respect. This is an  important statement that has implications that protect religious  liberty.   Second, it explicitly protects all existing religious liberty and  conscience protections under the First Amendment and Federal laws  including the powerful protections provided by the Religious Freedom  Restoration Act.   Third, it guarantees that this bill cannot be used to target or deny  benefits, including tax-exempt status, grants, contracts, educational  funding, licenses, accreditation, certification, and many others  because a person or organization holds a traditional belief about  marriage. This protects everything from the tax status of religious  nonprofits to the accreditation of religious schools, to the contracts  between faith-based adoption providers and the government from being  attacked using this bill.   Fourth, it ensures that nonprofit religious organizations, including  churches, mosques, synagogues, religious schools, and others cannot be  required to provide facilities, goods, or services for marriage  ceremonies or celebrations against their will.   Fifth, it has an explicit prohibition on the recognition of  polygamous marriages.   These religious liberty provisions are significant and they are  meaningful and they have earned the endorsement of important faith  groups. In a joint letter to the Senate, eight different faith-based  organizations, including the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day  Saints, also known as the Mormon Church; the Seventh-Day Adventist  Church; the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America; the  Council for Christian Colleges & Universities; the Center for Public  Justice; the AND Campaign; the Institutional Religious Freedom  Alliance; and the 1st Amendment Partnership--all of them concluded that  our religious liberty amendments ``[protect] the core religious freedom  concerns raised by the bill, including tax exempt status, educational  funding, government grants and contracts, and eligibility for licenses,  certification and accreditation.'' And they said: ``If passed, it would  continue to build on the congressional wisdom represented by the  Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993.'' So that is what these  religious groups--that is what they say about it. They helped write the  language.    A group of leading religious liberty scholars and advocates for  religious liberty have analyzed the bill, and they have reached the  same conclusion. These scholars include, by the way, Professor Doug  Laycock, who argued on behalf of faith groups and won two foundational  religious liberty cases before the U.S. Supreme Court. On balance, a  group of these distinguished professors determined that this bill is an  ``advance for religious liberty'' because, as they say, the  ``protections are important.''   Notwithstanding these important protections and the opinion of  leading experts in the field, the critics of this bill continue to  level accusations about what this bill does that are simply not  accurate.   First, some critics claim this bill provides grounds for the IRS or  other government bodies to revoke the tax-exempt status or other  benefits from religious organizations that adhere to traditional views  on marriage. This couldn't be further from the truth. Section 7(a) of  our amendment actually expressly forbids the outcome that these critics  are warning of. It prohibits the use of the bill to target the tax- exempt status, certification, accreditation, grant, funding, loan,  license, or any other nonmarital status, right, or benefit of religious  organizations. To quote Professor Laycock's analysis:         Those who claim that the bill would be used as a ground for       denying tax-exempt status to organizations adhering to male-      female marriage, by analogy to Bob Jones, are disregarding       the statutory text.    In addition to the statutory prohibition, this amendment contains a  clear statement from Congress, again, that diverse beliefs about the  role of gender in marriage, including the belief that marriage is  between one man and one woman, come from decent and honorable premises  and are due respect. This congressional statement distinguishes the  belief that marriage should be between a man and a woman from the  belief that interracial marriage is wrong. This distinction is  important, and rather than portraying those who believe in traditional  marriage as bigots, reflects a national policy that respects diverse  beliefs about the role of gender in marriage, while also protecting the  rights of same-sex married couples, and that is the key.   Second, some critics argue that this bill will lead to more  litigation between ``institutions and individuals trying to live  according to their sincerely held religious beliefs.'' This is also  false. The bill only governs the conduct of State actors and contains  no litigation tools that would be used against private religious  entities acting in a private capacity, even the ones that receive the  majority of their funding from the State. To quote, again, from  Professor Laycock's analysis, the Respect for Marriage Act and our  bipartisan substitute amendment ``poses little or no new risk to  religious liberty beyond those that already exist.''   Third, some critics continue to make the bewildering argument that  this bill will lead to legalized and recognized polygamy. Again, this  has no grounding in reality. No State allows bigamy or polygamy, and  this bill does not change this. Moreover, our amendment explicitly says  now:         Nothing in this Act, or any amendment made by this Act,       shall be construed to require or authorize Federal       recognition of marriages between more than 2 individuals.    Finally, some critics argue this bill is deficient because it does  not contain new enforceable rights for private businesses and other  entities beyond the scope of this bill. This bill, as legal scholars  and many faith groups agree, poses no new risks to religious  organizations, while containing significant benefits and protections  for people of faith.   Of course, this bill does not cover or address every lawsuit or  dispute that may arise between LGBTQ and religious interests, but it  does address the disputes that could arise because of this bill.   In conclusion, I urge my colleagues to look carefully at the new  religious liberty provisions. Take a look at it. I hope you will be  able to support the Respect for Marriage Act. The substitute amendment  is a carefully negotiated, well-crafted piece of legislation that  protects people of faith as well as same-sex married couples. A  statement in a recent letter from the Council for Christian Colleges &  Universities accurately states that our amendment  [[Page S6840]]  ``sends a strong bipartisan message to Congress, the Administration,  and the public that LGBTQ rights can co-exist with religious freedom  protections, and that the rights of both groups can be advanced in a  way that is prudent and practical.''   I think that is the major point here. They can coexist. That is what  our legislation proves. That is why it deserves the support, in my  view, of our colleagues.   So I urge them to join me in taking this path forward to pass this  bill with the same overwhelming bipartisan support we saw in the House  of Representatives. The American people want us to settle this issue  and millions of American couples who are married, including many in  Ohio, are counting on us to recognize and protect their marriage and  give them the peace of mind that they deserve.   I yield the floor.   Madam President, I come to the floor today in support of the Respect  for Marriage Act. I hope the Senate will pass this important  legislation today.   The Supreme Court declared that same-sex marriage is a constitutional  right in 2015 and the overwhelming majority of Americans support this  view. According to Gallup, over 70 percent of Americans believe that  same-sex marriage should be recognized as valid by the law, including a  majority of Republicans.   Despite this vast support, the U.S. Code does not reflect the  American consensus. Current legislation allows States and the Federal  Government to refuse to recognize valid same-sex marriages. While it is  true that the Supreme Court has held that this law is not enforceable,  it still represents Congress's last word on the subject. The American  people rightly expect their elected representatives to bring our laws  in line with their beliefs.   It is time for the Senate to settle the issue. The Respect for  Marriage Act, which passed the House with overwhelming bipartisan  support, simply allows interracial or same-sex couples who were validly  married under the laws of one State, to know their marriage will be  recognized by the Federal Government and by other States if they move  in accordance with established Supreme Court precedent.   This short, narrow bill has two main effects, both of which are well  within the constitutional authority of Congress.   First, it ensures that marriages legally performed in one State are  recognized as valid in other States, regardless of sex or race. This is  a straightforward application of the full faith and credit clause of  the Constitution.   Under this clause, States are required to recognize things like court  judgments and public records from other States. This bill will simply  clarify that marriage is one of the things that must be recognized  across State lines.   Second, this bill specifies that the Federal Government will  recognize a marriage that is valid in the State where it was performed.  This portion of the bill keeps the Federal Government out of the  business of defining marriage and leaves that decision to the States,  where it properly belongs.   As you can see, this bill is extremely narrow, it is constitutional,  and it does not infringe on State sovereignty. This is a bill that  simply ensures, as a matter of statutory law, that interracial and  same-sex marriages that were legal in the State they were performed  will be recognized if the couple moves to a different State.   In response to concerns over religious liberty, since the bipartisan  passage by the House of Representatives earlier this year, this already  narrow bill has been significantly amended in the Senate to include  robust religious liberty protections. By working collaboratively on a  bipartisan basis with religious liberty scholars, faith organizations,  colleagues, and other stakeholders, we have developed a substitute  amendment that contains important protections for people of faith. This  amendment contains five key changes to the underlying bill.   First, it contains an express acknowledgment that decent and  honorable people hold diverse views about the role of gender in  marriage and that such people and their beliefs are due respect.   Second, it explicitly protects all existing religious liberty and  conscience protections under the First Amendment and Federal laws,  including the powerful protections provided by the Religious Freedom  Restoration Act.   Third, it guarantees that this bill cannot be used to target or deny  benefits--including tax-exempt status, grants, contracts, educational  funding, licenses, accreditation, certification, and many others-- because a person or organization holds a traditional belief about  marriage. This protects everything from the tax status of religious  nonprofits, to the accreditation of religious schools, to the contracts  between faith-based adoption providers and governments from being  attacked using this bill.   Fourth, it ensures that nonprofit religious organizations, including  churches, mosques, synagogues, religious schools, and others cannot be  required to provide facilities, goods, or services for marriage  ceremonies or celebrations against their will.   Fifth, it contains an explicit prohibition on the recognition of  polygamous marriages.   These religious liberty provisions are significant, they are  meaningful, and they have earned the endorsement of important faith  groups that hold to an understanding that marriage is between one man  and one woman. In a joint letter to the Senate, eight different faith- based organizations--including the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day  Saints, otherwise known as the Mormon Church; the Seventh-Day Adventist  Church; the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America; the  Council for Christian Colleges & Universities; the Center for Public  Justice; the AND Campaign; the Institutional Religious Freedom  Alliance; and the 1st Amendment Partnership--concluded that the  religious liberty amendment ``protects the core religious freedom  concerns raised by the bill, including tax exempt status, educational  funding, government grants and contracts, and eligibility for licenses,  certification, and accreditation'' and that, ``if passed, it would  continue to build on the congressional wisdom represented by the  Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993.''   This view is not limited to faith groups. A group of leading  religious liberty scholars have analyzed the bill and reached the same  conclusion. These scholars include Professor Doug Laycock, who argued  and won two foundational religious liberty cases before the Supreme  Court. He argued on behalf of faith groups in the case Church of Lukumi  Babalu Aye, the premier case on unconstitutional religious targeting,  and Hosanna-Tabor, the leading case on the hiring rights of religious  organizations. He won both unanimously.   Professor Laycock was joined by Professor Thomas Berg, Professor Carl  Esbeck, and Professor Robin Fretwell Wilson in his analysis of the  bill. Professor Berg has advocated for religious liberty in briefings  before the Supreme Court, including in Fulton v. City of Philadelphia  to defend the rights of faith-based adoption agencies. Professors  Esbeck and Wilson have themselves authored briefs and influential texts  on religious liberty. On balance, these distinguished professors  determined that this bill is an ``advance for religious liberty''  because the ``protections are important and [] any new risks it creates  are quite limited.''   Notwithstanding these important protections and the opinion of  leading experts on the issues, the critics of this bill continue to  level incorrect accusations about what this bill does. I want to take a  moment to respond to three arguments that opponents have made.   First, some critics claim that this bill provides grounds for the IRS  or other government bodies to revoke the tax-exempt status or other  benefits from religious organizations that adhere to traditional views  on marriage. This couldn't be more wrong. Section 7(a) of the amendment  expressly forbids the outcomes that the critics are warning of. It  prohibits the use of this bill to target the tax-exempt status,  certification, accreditation, grant, funding, loan, license or any  other nonmarital status, right, or benefit of religious organizations.  To quote Professor Laycock's analysis: ``Those who claim that the bill  would be used as a ground for denying tax-exempt status to  organizations adhering to male-female marriage, by analogy to Bob  Jones, are disregarding the statutory text.''   In addition to this statutory prohibition, this amendment contains a  clear  [[Page S6841]]  statement from Congress that diverse beliefs about the role of gender  in marriage--including the belief that marriage is between one man and  one woman--come from decent and honorable premises and are due respect.  This congressional statement distinguishes the belief that marriage  should be between a man and a woman from the belief that interracial  marriage is wrong. This distinction is important, and rather than  portraying those who believe in traditional marriage as bigots,  reflects a national policy that respects diverse beliefs about the role  of gender in marriage, while also protecting the rights of same-sex  married couples.   Second, some critics argue that this bill will lead to more  litigation against ``institutions and individuals trying to live  according to their sincerely held religious beliefs.'' This is also  false. This bill only governs the conduct of State actors and contains  no new litigation tools that could be used against private religious  entities acting in a private capacity, even ones receiving the majority  of their funding from the State. To quote again from Professor  Laycock's analysis, the Respect for Marriage Act and our bipartisan  substitute amendment ``poses little or no new risk to religious liberty  beyond those that already exist.''   Third, some critics continue to make the bewildering argument that  this bill could lead to legalized and recognized polygamy. This has no  grounding in reality. No State allows bigamy or polygamy, and this bill  does nothing to change this. Moreover, our amendment explicitly says  that ``Nothing in this Act, or any amendment made by this Act, shall be  construed to require or authorize Federal recognition of marriages  between more than 2 individuals.'' No court would entertain the  fanciful arguments suggested by critics that a man married to multiple  women is somehow not engaged in polygamous marriage.   Finally, some critics argue that this bill is deficient because it  does not contain new enforceable rights for private business or other  entities that apply beyond the scope of this bill. This is not a fair  criticism. This bill--as legal scholars and many faith groups agree-- poses no new risks to religious organizations, while containing  significant benefits and protections for people of faith. Of course,  this bill does not cover or address every lawsuit or dispute that may  arise between LGBT and religious interests, but it does address the  disputes that could arise because of the bill.   Having addressed these erroneous arguments and criticisms, I also  want to take a moment to address the three amendments that we will vote  on today. None of the amendments that we are voting on solve perceived  problems created by this bill. As I just described, this bill is  narrow, it provides no new risks to religious organizations, and it  contains important protections for people of faith.   Senator Lee's amendment provides new affirmative rights that allow  people to sue the government--including lawsuits for money damages--if  the government discriminates against their beliefs about marriage in  any number of ways. Now, because of the significant protections and  prohibitions that we have added, none of the discrimination  contemplated by Senator Lee could occur because of the Respect for  Marriage Act. In other words, this new right proposed by the Lee  amendment goes far beyond the scope of the bill before us and seeks to  address harms and resolve disputes that are not created by the Respect  for Marriage Act. Although I disagree with Senator Lee that his  amendment solves any potential problem created by the Respect for  Marriage Act, I support the overall goal of providing a defense to  discrimination in other contexts. I, therefore, will vote in favor of  this amendment.   Senator Lankford and Senator Rubio have proposed separate amendments,  both which remove the private right of action from this bill. I do not  support this change. It does not fix any alleged problem created by  this bill or improve it in any way. A private right of action is a  common way for Congress to allow Americans to enforce their statutory  rights. It simply allows someone to go to court and to receive a  judgment if they have been harmed. To illustrate just how common it is,  Senator Lee's amendment that I just discussed--and will support--also  provides a cause of action.   There is no reason to strip the private right of action from this  bill because it is extremely narrow and cannot be used against anyone  acting in a private capacity. It also cannot be used to obtain money  damages. This provision simply allows someone to get a court order  requiring a State actor to recognize their valid marriage. Contrary to  the claims of some critics, it absolutely does not allow lawsuits  against private parties simply because they contract or receive funding  from the government.   The right of action is a necessary enforcement mechanism for this  bill and removing it could leave those who have their rights under this  law violated without a remedy. In other words, it undermines the very  purpose of this bill. I will not support the Lankford or Rubio  amendments for this reason.   In conclusion, I urge my colleagues to look carefully at the new  religious liberty provisions and to support the Respect for Marriage  Act. The substitute amendment is a carefully negotiated, well-crafted  piece of legislation that protects people of faith as well as same-sex  married couples. A statement in a recent letter from the Council for  Christian Colleges and Universities captures my views precisely, and so  I will directly quote from it: This amendment ``sends a strong  bipartisan message to Congress, the Administration, and the public that  LGBTQ rights can co-exist with religious freedom protections, and that  the rights of both groups can be advanced in a way that is prudent and  practical.''   I urge my colleagues to join me in taking this path forward and to  pass this bill with the same overwhelming bipartisan support that we  saw in the House of Representatives. The American people want us to  settle this issue once and for all. Millions of American married  couples, including many in Ohio, are counting on us to recognize and  protect their marriage to give them the peace of mind they deserve. We  shouldn't let them down.    Madam President, I come to the floor today for the 26th  consecutive week that the Senate has been in session to highlight the  very latest from Russia's illegal, unprovoked, and deadly assault on  Ukraine. This continues to be a critical time for Ukraine and Ukraine's  freedom fighters, and it is a classic fight for freedom. At this  critical juncture, as the winter months approach, Russia's morale is  flagging and Ukrainians are making steady gains on the battlefield. It  is absolutely vital that the United States and our allies continue to  stand by the people of Ukraine. We can't pull back now.   Ukraine, as you know, is a democracy. They are a great ally of ours.  They just want to live in peace with their neighbors, including Russia.   Over the objections of 140 countries in the United Nations, Russia  launched a brutal invasion of Ukraine on February 24. That was 9 months  ago, and they haven't let up. While we celebrated Thanksgiving holiday  this past week here in America, Ukrainians endured a deadly week of  Russian attacks and bombardments on civilian population centers far,  far from the frontlines. They didn't get a Thanksgiving break from the  war.   Russia's military is actually continuing to bomb inside of Ukraine  even today, civilian targets. What is interesting is that, at the same  time, Ukraine is winning on the battlefield. Over half of Ukraine's  Russian-occupied territory has now been liberated. Remember, at one  point, Ukraine included the occupied territory up here near Kyiv, the  capital, and all this area. Most of that area has now been liberated,  and these are the areas where the Russians continue to occupy: Crimea,  which they took back in 2014, parts of the Donetsk, and these  additional areas. Even today, Ukrainians are making progress in these  areas.   So on the battlefield, the Ukrainians, with our help and the help of  50 countries around the world, are making  [[Page S6863]]  progress. Yet, Russia continues to launch these missiles into Ukraine.  Even in a place like Bakhmut, one place where the Russians were making  some progress using mercenary forces--the Wagner Group, it is called-- the monthslong assault by these Russian forces has turned into a  grinding battle of attrition, and Russia has made little to no gains.  So in the Bakhmut region, which is right here, even there, where the  Wagner Group is fighting, they are not making significant progress at  all.   By the way, back in April 2018, I visited Bakhmut. I was able to go  there as part of a congressional factfinding trip, and the Ukrainian  military allowed me to see the line of contact--actually go to that  border area--the line of contact being between the occupied part in  2014 and the rest of Ukraine.   That is where I learned that the Ukrainians were going to fight, by  the way, because I talked to a lot of the soldiers there about what was  going on, and when there was discussion several years later about  whether Ukrainians would fight if the Russians invaded, as it appeared  clear they were going to do, I had no doubt that the Ukrainians were  going to fight because I met these soldiers and talked to them, and  they were hardened, and they knew what Russia had done to them and  their families and their country and their freedom. And they have  fought.   Here is a photo of me back in 2018 in this area of Bakhmut. As you  can see, you have Ukrainian soldiers walking around freely.   Here is a photograph of Bakhmut today, to show you the difference.  Back when I was there, there was sniper activity. You could hear some  artillery being fired off in the distance, but today, months and months  of Russia's brutal assault has led to Bakhmut looking like this.   Here is the Ukrainian soldier today.   It is a hellscape straight from the Western front of World War I,  isn't it? Relentless artillery bombardments have forced soldiers into  these trenches, just like they dug in France during World War I and  World War II. This is the condition that Ukrainian soldiers are  fighting in to defend their families, their freedom, and their country,  and they are doing it as the temperature is falling and winter  approaches. But they are undeterred, and they continue to fight hard.   The response to Ukraine making progress on the battlefield by Russia  is to launch these missiles into the interior. I really think it is out  of frustration. It is a cowardly approach. They can't win on the  battlefield, so instead they are sitting back in Russia and bombing  these civilian targets.   Here is one you can see. It is an energy grid in Ukraine. This is in  western Ukraine. And it is just relentless bombing. They are killing  people when they do this, by the way. They are not just taking out  energy infrastructure; they are killing civilians, including energy  workers. Again, it is a cowardly approach. They are killing civilians  and noncombatants, needlessly slaughtering men, women, and children.  They are attacking residential areas, and they have been all along-- apartment buildings, hospitals, community buildings--and, of course,  causing cities to go dark as they go into winter, dark and cold.   When we were in Ukraine just a few weeks ago--Senator Coons and  myself--Senator Coons and I went to get some additional information on  the ground in Ukraine, and we got to see this firsthand.   This is in Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine. This is where the control  center was for this energy utility, and this had happened just a few  days before we got there. So the Russians are targeting very  specifically energy to knock out electricity, knock out heating, knock  out water.   That night, by the way, we had dinner with Ukrainian  Parliamentarians. It was a dinner meeting to talk about what we  could do as Congress and they can do as Parliamentarians to help the  Ukrainian people right now. We had to have the meal by flashlight and  candles because there was no electricity.    The systemic bombing of civilian infrastructure, throwing these  Ukrainian cities in the dark and in the cold, without running water,  has been met by heroic repair by Ukrainians. I imagine this is already  repaired. But again, the Russians keep bombing. They need our help to  be able to help prepare and provide more equipment as this equipment is  being destroyed by the Russians.   Today, I was pleased to see that Secretary of State Antony Blinken  announced an additional $53 million from the United States to support  efforts to rebuild this Ukrainian energy grid that keeps getting  destroyed by the Russians. This package will include distribution  transformers, circuit breakers, surge arresters, disconnectors,  vehicles, and other key equipment. It brings U.S. support for Ukraine's  energy infrastructure since February up to about $145 million.   But again, it is not just us, and it shouldn't just be us. Our allies  need to step forward to help Ukraine in this difficult moment as well,  and they are. Finland, as an example I just saw, will send energy  equipment to Ukraine this week. The EU, the European Union, will give  Ukraine 200 transformers and 40 heavy generators to support the energy  sector. The EU has probably given more than anyone else. This critical  aid is needed because, again, these attacks just continue and continue.   The recent attacks in Kyiv, by the way, that we saw earlier when I  was there 3 weeks ago, 300,000 Ukrainian citizens in Kyiv had lost  power when we were there. I am told that there are currently about  130,000 Kyiv residents losing power, without electricity.   The Ukrainian military, again, has been making progress. They have  had a huge success here in Kherson. This city of Kherson in Ukrainian  was the first provincial and only provincial capital the Russians  occupied and the first major city that they took. The Ukrainian  military carefully and over time orchestrated a great victory there,  and about 3 weeks ago, it was liberated.   As this photo shows, Ukrainian citizens have welcomed these soldiers  as heroes. You have probably seen some of this on TV news. They have  just embraced these soldiers, and they put the Ukrainian flags back up  in all the buildings. They have told these soldiers and others,  including the investigators from the International Criminal Court, of  the war crimes, the unthinkable war crimes that were committed by the  Russian occupiers while they were there.   So the Russians were forced out of Kherson because of very effective  work by the Ukrainians, using the weapons that we and the Europeans  have provided them, including longer range missiles, taking out their  supplies, taking out their ability to resupply themselves.   So what has happened now is that Russia, once they had left Kherson,  has now started their bombing campaign, just nonstop bombing in the  very city they occupied only a few weeks ago. So they are saying: If we  can't have it, we are just going to bomb it into oblivion. Ukrainians  are having now, after having lived through the occupation, to try to  live through this bombing.   I saw the Deputy Prime Minister of Ukraine recently urge civilians to  leave Kherson and go to other parts of Ukraine this winter due to these  Russian attacks. That is what has to be done. The soldiers will stay  and they will fight, but the Russians are just constantly attacking  Kherson.   In this area--this oblast, it is called--that provincial area, 10  people have recently been killed and 54 injured. The Russians shelled  this provincial area 49 times on Thanksgiving day, 49 missiles and  bombs on Thanksgiving day, hitting residential buildings, a shipyard,  the school grounds, gas pipelines, everything.   The Russian shelling hit a school that was being used as a  distribution point for humanitarian aid in the Zaporizhzhia area, up  here. So in Zaporizhzhia, they had a school that was handing out  humanitarian assistance, and it was attacked by a Russian missile. It  killed a social worker and injured two other people.   You probably saw that also in eastern Ukraine recently, the Russians  attacked a maternity hospital, and again they killed innocent  civilians. They actually killed a newborn baby, a baby boy. They  critically injured a doctor. The overnight explosion left a smalltown  hospital there in total disrepair, just a crumble of bricks and  scattered metal. There were medical supplies, by the way, strewn all  over the streets. The newborn who was killed was only 2 days old--2  days old--but he had a name, Serhii, and his death will not be  forgotten in Ukraine.  [[Page S6864]]    These are flagrant human rights abuses and war crimes. As a Zelenskyy  Presidential adviser said, ``There is no military logic [here]: they  just want to take revenge on the locals. This is a huge war crime.''   I agree. Vladimir Putin is trying to bring Ukraine to its knees, but  do you know what it is doing? It is only strengthening their resolve,  the amazing resolve of the Ukrainian people.   Russia is beginning to feel the negative impacts of this war more and  more. The sanctions are beginning to bite more, and we should  strengthen them even more, in my view. But it is having an impact. The  Russian banking sector has been hit by this. The Russian central bank  reported that a record $14.7 billion in hard currency was withdrawn  from the Russian banking system last month, in October. People are  taking their money and running. This was during the 300,000 troop  mobilization of mostly untrained recruits.   A November report by the central bank warned that Russia's GDP would  face a sharper contraction of 7.1 percent in the fourth quarter of this  year, after falling 4.1 percent and 4 percent compared with last year  in the previous two quarters.   So the economy is going the wrong way in Russia. Last week, the  economy officially entered into a recession. So this war is having an  impact on Russia, finally.   The central bank chairwoman told the Russian lawmakers that next year  the situation will get darker still. She said:         We really need to look at the situation very soberly and       with our eyes open. Things may get worse, we understand that.    I sure hope so. I sure hope so--that countries around the world see  what is happening here and tighten these sanctions.   For many Russian companies, the reality of war sank in with the  latest desperate mobilization. This is according to the German  Institute for International and Security Affairs. I think that is true.   While there are a lot of Russians who still believe the propaganda  and the disinformation from the Kremlin about Ukraine and, therefore,  continue to fight innocent Ukrainians--their neighbors--other Russians  now understand that this battle is not against an enemy; this battle is  a failed ploy by Vladimir Putin to achieve his misguided ambitions to  recreate the Russian Empire, the Russian Federation. That is what it is  about. It is not about Ukraine.   I want to take a moment to talk about the aid package that is being  developed right now here on the floor to send to Ukraine to continue  our help at this crucial moment and to make an important point, which  is that oversight of our assistance to Ukraine is very important. It is  important to me. It is important to my constituents. It is important to  my colleagues. We need to be sure there are significant accountability  measures in place. We have got to know where the aid is going. We need  to know exactly where it is going and who is using it and how.   No one is advocating that we give Ukraine a blank check; and, by the  way, they have not gotten a blank check. There are spending safeguards  in place already. President Zelenskyy agrees with that. He wants those  kind of checks in the system because he knows that that transparency is  critical to the continued aid--not just from us but from the 50 other  countries around the world that are providing assistance or more.   There is an accounting firm from the United States involved that  follows all the aid to the government, as an example. Also, the World  Bank sends a report about all the aid that goes to--the state aid, the  government aid part, and they constantly audit that and report on that.  So there are mechanisms in place already. Could they be strengthened?  Probably so.   With regard to military equipment, we have put in place unprecedented  policies to be able to have what is called end-use monitoring of the  military weapons that are going to Ukraine. I visited with the 101st  Airborne in Poland a few weeks ago and talked a lot about how that end- use monitoring is going. We finally have a military attache in country  and some people who can help follow where these various weapons are  going. And, honestly, so far, so good.   I have to tell you, I am surprised by this, but there has been  absolutely no documented instance yet of diversion of U.S.-supplied  weapons--to Russia, to Belarus, to third parties. Now, that may happen  in the future, but this end-use monitoring is carefully ensuring that  you get the serial number and you find out where the thing is going and  you check on it. And I think that is very important, and my colleagues  need to know that. This is something that the Ukrainian Government  wants to do. And they should want to do it, and our military certainly  wants to do it.   The Ukrainian Government has been transparent in terms of the funding  because it is in their interest. It is in all of our interest. They  hear questions about oversight coming from Members of Congress, and  they understand the need to provide the accountability. So we need to  continue the assistance at this crucial time, as we have said tonight,  but we need to be sure it continues to be accountable.   You know, Vladimir Putin, when he decided to initiate this invasion,  which so many people around the world thought he would never do because  it made no sense; there was no logic behind it. But when he did this,  he thought it would be a walk in the park. He thought the Russian Army  would roll in and the Ukrainians would roll over.   It turned out to be a walk through Hell for his army and his  government. Why? Because the Ukrainian people showed grit and  determination and the military fought more effectively than anybody  expected. It is because Ukraine's morale and leadership has not  faltered, even against overwhelming odds, a much larger military, and  many more missiles. They have not faltered.   I have seen this mindset in Ukraine on my visits there. I think I  have been there 8 or 10 times since 2014. It goes from President  Zelenskyy all the way down to the soldiers we saw in the trenches, to  the civilians who are doing their part.   The Wall Street Journal recently reported that during the Russian  occupation of Kherson, the area we talked about earlier, the 68-year- old head doctor at the hospital there in Kherson refused to bow down to  the Russian invaders, setting a tone for citywide resistance. He told  the invaders: ``You can shoot me if you want,'' but I am not going to  do what you want. I have a responsibility to this hospital, and I am  going to carry it out for the citizens of Kherson.    Other Ukrainian workers at the hospital were just as heroic and  clever. The Journal reports that their resistance lasted 8 months. They  faked a COVID outbreak to keep Russians from stealing their equipment,  coming into the hospital and taking equipment. They spied for Ukrainian  forces.   The fighting spirit of the Ukrainians should come as no surprise.  They are a proud, patriotic, and tough people. For perhaps one of the  best illustrations of this courage, I am reminded of the grandmother  who gave sunflower seeds to invading Russian soldiers way back in  February when they first started coming in. She gave them the  sunflowers and said: Give these to somebody to plant at your burial  place because you are going to die for invading our country and you  might want to have something beautiful being grown at your gravesite.   That was a brave Ukrainian grandmother. I remember the photograph of  a woman about 5 feet tall telling this to a Russian soldier a foot or  so taller.   And who can blame the patriotic defiance that they have shown. Today,  half of Ukraine's energy infrastructure is gone. Kyiv is operating on  scheduled blackouts that last 4 hours. This is the capital. Civilians  are being killed every day. Ukraine's economy continues to suffer  catastrophic consequences. War crimes continue to be revealed day after  day.   The actions by the Kremlin to knowingly destroy and attack civilian  areas and kill innocent Ukrainians, of course, are meant to dampen  Ukrainians' resolve, but, instead, these actions encourage fortitude  among the ranks of Ukraine's freedom fighters against the barbaric  enemy that has invaded their homeland. That is how they feel.   When I have come down to the floor each week to discuss the status of  this  [[Page S6865]]  war on Ukraine's land, I have pointed out that this is where the battle  is occurring for freedom over tyranny, of democracy over  authoritarianism. This is where it is being waged here, in our  generation, now. This is why we need to stand up and be counted.   If we don't join allies throughout the world in condemning it and  helping Ukraine defend itself, what happens? Well, the world becomes a  much more dangerous and volatile place. Trust me, people are watching-- our enemies and our adversaries. Iran is watching. China is watching.  Others are watching.   This is not the time for the United States and the allies around the  world--more than 50 of them who have provided military assistance--to  pull back. At a meeting in Romania today, the NATO Secretary General  reaffirmed that NATO's door to membership remains open to Ukraine. It  has been open since 2008.   I found this to be very welcome news, something I have called for,  for years. I don't think Russia would be in Ukraine if it had happened.   Ukraine is making gains on the battlefield, as I said. Russian forces  and equipment are being destroyed and depleted. Russian war crimes  continue to be committed as they punish Ukrainian civilians, and the  Russian people are beginning to feel the negative effects of this  failed war.   I think, frankly, that Vladimir Putin believes his supply of missiles  will outlast the patience of the free world. I think that is what he  believes. That is why he continues this senseless war. I think he  believes he will continue to be able to have enough missiles to outlast  the patience of the Western World, of us, the freedom-loving people.   I don't think that is accurate, but we need to prove him wrong. We  need to keep the pressure up to end with a resolution to this  senseless, brutal war. I believe, with the help of the United States  and our allies, democracy can and will prevail over tyranny and  authoritarianism. And that, of course, would send the right message  echoed across the world, a message that tyranny and authoritarianism  must not triumph.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
