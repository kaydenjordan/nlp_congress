 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a truly  talented group of students whose artistic abilities are on display here  in our Nation's Capital.   Students from Washington Middle School and the South Arkansas Arts  Center in El Dorado, Arkansas, designed ornaments adorning this year's  Arkansas State Christmas tree on the Ellipse here in Washington, D.C.   The students used colored pencils, paper, markers, and glitter to  create beautiful pieces of art which represent Arkansas' natural  resources and economy.   I congratulate these students on highlighting the best of the Natural  State in a truly wonderful way. I wish them, their families, and all of  the Fourth District of Arkansas a Merry Christmas filled with joy and  smiles, like I felt when I saw this remarkable art from home.                            ____________________
