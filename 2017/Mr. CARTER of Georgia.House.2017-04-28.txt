 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the  life of one of Savannah, Georgia's finest, Mr. Joe Murray Rivers, who  passed away on April 5, 2017, at the age of 78. Born February 3, 1939,  in Savannah, Georgia, Mr. Rivers became a proud public servant in the  area he was born and raised.   Mr. Rivers graduated from Beach High School before attending the U.S.  Air Force Institute and the University of Maryland, The City College of  New York, and Savannah State University.   Mr. Rivers later opened the Olympic Sport Shop in downtown Savannah,  and it was during this time that he realized the drastic need for  improved public transportation. Inspired to solve this issue, Mr.  Rivers was elected to the Chatham County board of directors in 1985.  Throughout his 20-year tenure, he became a warrior of public transport  and cosponsored legislation to solve the transportation problem in the  county. In appreciation for the work Mr. Rivers has done, Savannah's  Intermodal Transit Center now bears his name.   Mr. Rivers' public service extended far beyond elected office and  transportation reform. His leadership and compassion towards every  member of the community will be sorely missed.                            ____________________
