 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I thank both the chairman and the ranking member of the  committee and the sponsors of this important piece of legislation. I am  proud to rise in support of the Autism CARES reauthorization act.   This issue is very personal to me. As an uncle of a young man with  autism, my nephew, Joshua, I know how challenging this condition can  be.   I also know that, unfortunately, we still don't know the causes, let  alone how to cure autism. It underscores the importance of why this  legislation is so important to continue to invest in research and, at  best, treatments for the condition.   We do know, Mr. Speaker, that early intervention and early treatments  do make a difference in the long-term outcomes.                                time  1530    So the provisions in this bill, the Autism CARES Act, are right on  point. It is well thought-out and, again, encourages both research  through NIH and the talented researchers who do this important work  and, again, those who also treat both children and adults with autism.  It is essential we pass this bill.   We also need to pay attention to the long-term care components. There  are long-term care challenges that families have to contend with. We  need to do our best to support them, and Mr. Speaker, I urge passage.    Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman for yielding  and his important leadership on this bill and on the committee.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 2035, the  Lifespan Respite Care Reauthorization Act of 2019, legislation that I  introduced with my good friend and colleague from Washington State,  Mrs. Rodgers.   In 2002, I authored the Lifespan Respite Care Act to create a network  of services and supports for family caregivers across the Nation. In  the years since the bill was signed into law in 2006, the Lifespan  Respite Care program has provided grants to 37 States and the District  of Columbia to streamline the delivery of planned and emergency respite  services, provide access to direct care services, and address the  direct service worker shortage by training respite providers. I am  thrilled to be here today to continue building on Lifespan Respite  Care's successes and reauthorize the program.   Mr. Speaker, family caregivers are a critical part of the long-term  services and supports system in the United States. Approximately 43  million family caregivers provide hundreds of billions of dollars--and  yes, that is billions with a B--in uncompensated care each year. In  fact, in 2013, the last time that statistics were updated,  uncompensated family care totaled--if you had to put a dollar figure to  it--approximately $470 billion. That is more than Medicaid spending for  that year.   Respite care services provide short-term relief for family  caregivers, allowing them time to account for their own health and  wellness needs. Despite respite care being one of the services most  often requested by caregivers, 85 percent of family members caring for  adults don't receive any respite services at all.   For many older adults and people with disabilities, receiving care in  the home is preferable, both from a quality of life perspective and a  financial perspective. In addition to improving caregiver health,  researchers also found that providing access to services such as  respite care can reduce the need for admission to more costly  institutional settings and allow individuals to remain in their own  homes.    Mr. Speaker, the Lifespan Respite Care program is the only Federal  effort that provides family caregivers access to respite care services  regardless of the age or type of disability of their loved one. This is  especially important for family members caring for individuals with  chronic illnesses or disabilities with an early onset, such as multiple  sclerosis, brain injury, spinal cord injury, or ALS. Programs that are  predicated on age or a certain degree of disability can often struggle  when adapting to the needs of a young person with a degenerative  disease, and the Lifespan Respite Care program helps to bridge those  gaps.   For example, Lifetime Respite Care funds were used in my home State  of Rhode Island to establish the CareBreaks program which helps family  members caring for an individual of any age access respite when they  have nowhere else to turn.   Reauthorizing the Lifespan Respite Care program at $20 million in the  first year and steadily increasing funding each year after will allow  each State and territory to establish and maintain a respite care  program. In authoring the original bill, I recognized that different  States have different needs for caregivers. Expanding funding will grow  additional, unique programs that directly address community needs. By  taking this important step to support family caregivers, we move  forward in our efforts to provide quality, community-based care for the  millions of Americans with special needs.   Mr. Speaker, as an American with a disability--in fact, the first  quadriplegic elected to the United States Congress--I know the immense  service that caregivers provide. I am privileged enough to have paid  home health aides, and I want to thank my CNAs, Dave, Valerie, Carolyn,  Kelly, and many others over the years, for the vital assistance they  provide me each and every day. But, injured as I was at the age of 16,  I also relied on my family members; my brothers, Rick and Dave, and my  sister, Joanne, and especially my mother and my late father, Richard,  for their support over the decades. I would not be here before you  today without their help, and I am forever grateful to them for their  love and their care.   For so many families in a similar position around the Nation, this  bill recognizes their sacrifice and the immense support that they  provide to their loved ones while reducing the strain on our healthcare  system. Indeed, Mr. Speaker, our family caregivers are truly unsung  heroes.   Beyond those who helped me personally, Mr. Speaker, I want to  recognize the many people who were instrumental in bringing this bill  to the floor. In addition to the chair and the ranking member, I also  want to recognize Jill Kagan with the ARCH National Respite Network for  her coalition and her coalition partners for their tireless work to  help families access respite care and provide technical assistance to  States building respite programs.    Mr. Speaker, on my staff, I am indebted to my health  and disabilities LA Katie Lee and also Todd Adams, my Chief of Staff,  who has been intimately involved in these issues for more years than he  probably would like to admit.   I also want to thank again Chairman Pallone and his staff, as well as  Ranking Member Walden, for supporting this effort through the  committee.   I also must acknowledge the leadership of Senator Collins. I hope  that our actions today will help her in her effort to get this  important bill through our sister Chamber.   Finally, again, I want to thank the gentlewoman from Washington  State, my colleague, Mrs. Rodgers, for partnering with me on this bill  when we first attempted to reauthorize this program in 2011 and for her  continued leadership on this issue in Congress and on many others in  the disability community.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support family caregivers and  vote in favor of the Lifespan Respite Care Reauthorization Act. I thank  the gentleman for yielding.
