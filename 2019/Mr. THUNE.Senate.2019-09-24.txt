 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, in just a few days, we will mark the 1- year anniversary of the President's concluding negotiations on the  United States-Mexico-Canada Free Trade Agreement. It is time for  Congress to ratify this agreement now.   The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement will benefit pretty much  every sector of the U.S. economy: the automobile industry, textiles,  digital trade and e-commerce, services, manufacturing, and yes, of  course, agriculture.   As the representative of a State whose lifeblood is agriculture,  farmers and ranchers are always at the top of my mind, and a huge focus  of mine right now is helping our struggling agricultural economy.   Low commodity and livestock prices, natural disasters, and protracted  trade disputes have made a tough few years for our Nation's farmers.  One of the most important things we can do to help our agricultural  economy recover is to open new markets for American agricultural  products.   During August, I spent a lot of time talking to farmers back home in  my State of South Dakota. Again and again, they emphasized that they  need action on trade from Washington. With so many trade deals  currently up in the air, farmers and ranchers are struggling with a  lack of certainty about what international markets are going to look  like.   While they share the President's goal of addressing trade imbalances  and securing more favorable conditions for American products, they also  believe that we need to conclude the agreements that we are negotiating  as soon as possible. The longer negotiations drag on, the tougher their  situation gets. That is why I have repeatedly stressed the need to  bring these agreements to a swift conclusion, and I emphasize that  point to the President nearly every time I talk to him.   However, there is one deal we don't need to wait for, and that is the  United States-Mexico-Canada Free Trade Agreement. As I said earlier,  negotiations on this agreement concluded a year ago, and it is high  time for Congress to take it up and pass it so that farmers and  ranchers can start seeing the benefits.   The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement is a big win for farmers  and ranchers. Of particular interest to South Dakota are the  agreement's dairy provisions. Dairy is an important and rapidly growing  industry in South Dakota. Drive the I-29 corridor north of Brookings,  SD, and you can see firsthand the massive dairy expansion that we have  experienced over the past several years.   The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement will preserve U.S. dairy  farmers' role as a key dairy supplier to Mexico, and it will  substantially expand market access in Canada, where  [[Page S5637]]  U.S. dairy sales have been restricted. The U.S. International Trade  Commission estimates that the agreement will boost U.S. dairy exports  by more than $277 million.   The agreement will also expand market access for U.S. poultry and egg  producers, and it will make it easier for U.S. producers to export  wheat to Canada, and so much more.   Above all, this agreement will provide farmers and ranchers with  certainty about what the Canadian and Mexican markets are going to look  like going forward. American farmers depend upon these markets to sell  their products, and it is vital that farmers have a clear idea of what  these markets are going to look like in the future.   Republicans in the Senate are ready to take action on the United  States-Mexico-Canada Agreement at any point. I hope House Democrats  will quickly work out their remaining issues and indicate their  willingness to vote on this deal. The administration has made  addressing Democrats' concerns a priority throughout the negotiation  process, and it is time for Democrats to bring this process to a swift  conclusion.   As I mentioned, we are almost a year now past the time when the  President signed this agreement, and it has been available for  consideration by the House of Representatives for that entire time. It  is high time that we act on this trade deal and get it over here to the  Senate, where we can vote on it and get it to the President for his  signature.   Last week, seven former U.S. Agriculture Secretaries, from both  Democratic and Republican administrations, sent a letter to House and  Senate leadership stating their strong support for the United States- Mexico-Canada Free Trade Agreement.   The Secretaries noted:         With farmers facing one of the lowest net farm incomes in       the last decade, USMCA would create enhanced export       opportunities and help fully capitalize on increased global       demand for food products. Furthermore, USMCA would       significantly boost farm incomes and create jobs both on and       off the farm in rural communities.    Again, that is from seven former U.S. Agriculture Secretaries,  serving both Republican and Democrat Presidents.   Life hasn't been easy for our Nation's farmers and ranchers over the  past few years, and I can certainly attest to that, as I have looked at  what the economy in South Dakota has been like in these last several  years. The surest way that we can stabilize and boost farm income and  help farm country is to conclude agreements like the USMCA. I urge my  Democrat colleagues in the House of Representatives to make getting  this deal done in the House, over to the Senate, and across the finish  line their No. 1 priority.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator  from South Carolina (Mr. Graham) and the Senator from North Carolina  (Mr. Tillis).    The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator  from South Carolina (Mr. Graham) and the Senator from North Carolina  (Mr. Tillis).

[[Page S5643]]         The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator  from North Carolina (Mr. Tillis).
