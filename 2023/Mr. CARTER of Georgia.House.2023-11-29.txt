 Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Chair, I rise in support of H.R. 5283, the Protecting our  Communities from Failure to Secure the Border Act of 2023.   Mr. Chair, these days, every State is a border State, even New York  State. Our national parks are treasures that should be enjoyed by the  public, not used to house illegal immigrants. That is what the Biden  administration wants to do, and we have already seen this unfolding on  Federal land in New York. Not only is this unsightly, but there are  tremendous security concerns given the lack of oversight; not to  mention that this is a horrible misuse of taxpayer dollars, which  should be used to enhance our Federal lands for our citizens.   Under this bill, President Biden and Secretary Mayorkas will no  longer be able to use your tax dollars to shelter illegal immigrants  who could be threats to our national security and personal safety.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
