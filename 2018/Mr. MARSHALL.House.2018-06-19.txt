 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss the opioid crisis.  Opioid addiction is sweeping the Nation. It is an epidemic that knows  no race, gender, income, or marital status, and certainly no political  party.   As we continue to work together here in Washington to combat that  crisis, I met with the physicians in Hutchinson, Kansas, who have taken  responsibility and ownership of this issue. They have developed their  own scientific and compassionate approach to curb addiction in their  community.   The Hutchinson Clinic has created an office-wide task force, working  with nurses, pharmacists, physicians, and social workers, that outlines  steps and procedures to reduce the number of narcotics prescribed in  their medical practice.   When I met with the staff and physicians yesterday, they explained  that these new steps will not only reduce the number of people  unnecessarily exposed to narcotics, but identify patients at risk for  addiction. They will use clinical-wide protocols and best practices,  which will eliminate doctors shopping for narcotics and manage chronic  pain and acute pain more uniformly.   I was heartened to hear the success stories of many of their patients  being fully removed from narcotic prescriptions after years of narcotic  use. They have carefully tried to sit down with all of their patients  on chronic narcotics, and, in many cases, they uncovered some type of  an underlying depression or psychosomatic issue that could be resolved  with counseling and other medications. In some instances, they found  out that the patient was not taking the narcotics but, rather, a family  member was selling them.   In either case, they are trying to use a compassionate approach to  deal with this growing problem. This is a great prevention and  awareness approach. As a physician of 30 years, we must make sure that  prescribers understand the risks involved with these highly addictive  drugs and minimize addiction.   While we continue to look at solutions here in Washington, I am proud  that physicians, nurses, and pharmacists in Kansas are also finding  solutions by looking in the mirror and recognizing there are steps that  communities, physicians, nurses, social workers, and pharmacists  working together can take to prevent addiction before it ever starts.   This month, as the House continues approaching dozens of bills that  work on this epidemic from every angle, I want to take time to applaud  the Hutchinson Clinic--the physicians, the nurses, the pharmacists, the  social workers, and their staff--for the action that they are taking in  implementing solutions that are working, for those closest to the  problem will have the best solutions.                            ____________________
