 Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 461 and ask  that it be reported by number.    Mr. President, prior to the pandemic over the last  several years, our country did something remarkable. We grew our  economy, created millions of good-paying energy jobs, and reduced  greenhouse gas emissions.   In fact, from 2005 to 2017, the United States reduced greenhouse gas  emissions by almost 15 percent--way more than any other country in the  world. How did we do that? The dramatic increase in America's  production of clean-burning natural gas was largely responsible for all  of this.   So my amendment is very simple. It calls for the continued expansion  of American natural gas production and energy infrastructure to create  more jobs, grow our economy, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.   This is what President Biden said about this issue just a few years  ago--    Are you sure you don't want to hear that?   I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense, pro-jobs amendment.  And I am happy to take this amendment by a voice vote.    Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the  Congressional Budget Act, I move to waive and ask for the yeas and  nays.    Mr. President, along with Senator Murkowski and  Alaska Congressman Don Young, we rise to congratulate and pay special  tribute to a great, hard-working, and inspiring Alaskan, the Honorable  Bill Sheffield, former Governor of Alaska, upon the occasion of his  receiving an honorary doctorate of humane letters from the University  of Alaska. On Sunday, December 13, 2020, the University of Alaska  Anchorage awarded Governor Bill Sheffield this special degree at its  fall commencement ceremonies.   Born in Spokane, WA, and raised in the Seattle area, Governor  Sheffield served in the U.S. Air Force, worked as a sales and service  rep for Sears Roebuck, and was transferred by Sears to Alaska in 1953.  He went into the hospitality business, establishing the Anchorage Inn.  Bill bought out his business partner, expanded his hotel holdings, and  grew his hotel empire to 19 properties in Alaska and the Yukon.   He was elected the fifth Governor of our State in 1982. During his  tenure, he oversaw massive infrastructure projects, including roads and  water systems. He pushed through a bill that consolidated the State's  four time zones into two and is responsible for creating Alaska  Standard and Alaska Daylight Time. Governor Bill was instrumental in  the purchase of the Alaska Railroad by the State from the Federal  Government and commissioned the construction of Spring Creek  Correctional Facility in Seward. His accomplishments are many and his  love of Alaska and his kindness, warmth, and generosity to its people  are widely known.   The Governor is 92 and going strong. Governor Sheffield's story in  Alaska embodies what many of us love about our great State. It doesn't  matter where you come from or your social status. In Alaska, if you  have grit, tenacity, determination, and a servant's heart, nothing can  hold you back. As the 117th Congress begins, we want to say  Congratulations, Governor Sheffield, upon the occasion of your much- deserved honorary doctorate.                             ____________________
