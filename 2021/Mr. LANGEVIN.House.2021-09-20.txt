 Madam Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the 10th  anniversary of the repeal of Don't Ask, Don't Tell.   For over 18 years, this discriminatory policy resulted in the  discharge of thousands of brave, honorable, and capable servicemembers,  solely due to their sexual orientation.   On December 22, 2010, the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act was signed  into law, and the policy officially ended 10 years ago today.   As a longtime supporter of repeal, I was thrilled when years of  advocacy and determination paid off in the victory for dignity and  equality.   LGBTQ servicemembers are an integral part of our Nation's defense,  and they deserve our eternal support and gratitude for the sacrifices  they make every day to keep us safe.   Please join me in commemorating this historic day and in thanking all  LGBTQ servicemembers and veterans for their service to our Nation.                            ____________________
