 Mr. Chair, I thank the gentlewoman from California  (Ms. Maxine Waters) for yielding me time.   I rise in opposition to H.R. 10, the ``Bad'' CHOICE Act, which brings  back the Wild West to our financial markets and hurts consumers.   It is a bad choice because this takes us back to a time when we were  losing 800,000 jobs a month--not gaining 200,000 jobs a month. Colorado  takes us back to when we had 10 percent unemployment--not 2.5 percent  unemployment. It takes us back to a time when the stock market was  6,500--not 21,000.   It brings back no discipline. The markets were in chaos. People got  hurt. This kind of return to bad legislation and bad regulation is not  good for America, and we should all vote ``no.''
