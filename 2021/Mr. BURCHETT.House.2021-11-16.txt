 Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Aaron Clay, who was  named the Tennessee Secondary School Athletic Association's Athletic  Director of the Year.   Aaron Clay is the athletics director at the Washburn School. He  graduated from Washburn in 1997. His brother, Greg, hired him shortly  after graduating to help the school's basketball team.   Since returning to coach the basketball team, Director Clay led  several of Washburn's athletic teams to success. He coached two  basketball teams to the substate tournament, won two district titles in  basketball, and sent a cross-country student athlete to the State  championship meet for five straight years.   Mr. Speaker, under Director Clay's leadership, the school recently  completed a new gymnasium. Away from athletics, Director Clay also  leads Washburn's academic curriculum as an assistant principal. In his  academic role, he once again teamed up with his brother, Greg, who is  Washburn's principal.   The TSSAA Athletic Director of the Year award celebrates an athletic  director who builds up students on and off the field and, clearly, he  does this, Mr. Speaker.   Director Clay's work throughout his career as a school administrator  and athletic director positively influenced hundreds of Washburn  students. Our community is proud of the impact he has had on young  people.   Congratulations, Director Clay, and keep up the good work.                     Huge Victory for Individual Freedom     Mr. Speaker, individual freedom just scored a huge  victory. Last weekend, a court of appeals ruled what we already know.  Joe Biden overstepped his authority with his vaccine mandate. No more  jobs will be threatened by the administration over coronavirus  vaccination status, for now.   I applaud those who stood up to Biden's vaccine mandate in court. But  the fight isn't over, Mr. Speaker. It is clearly not over. Biden's far- left Justice Department is plotting a legal assault to revive the  mandate. Those of us who value personal liberty cannot be content with  one court ruling.   More action is necessary, Mr. Speaker.   My bill, the Keeping our COVID-19 Heroes Employed Act, which is  sponsored in the Senate by Senator Marsha Blackburn, also from  Tennessee, would further protect American workers by forbidding certain  employers from firing unvaccinated employees.   We need to ban Biden's vaccine mandate because it is  unconstitutional, Mr. Speaker, but also because of the crippling effect  it will have on our economy.   For example, supply chain jobs will be lost if Biden's vaccine  mandate takes effect. A labor shortage in the supply chains means it  takes longer to move products to America's storefronts, Mr. Speaker.  The costs of keeping up with demand is passed to consumers in the form  of higher prices.   If Biden gets his way, it will devastate our struggling economy and  steal paychecks from hardworking Americans, Mr. Speaker. Congress can't  wait for the Biden administration's next attack on the unvaccinated.  Let's protect the civil liberties of the workers by passing the Keeping  our COVID-19 Heroes Employed Act, Mr. Speaker.                            ____________________
