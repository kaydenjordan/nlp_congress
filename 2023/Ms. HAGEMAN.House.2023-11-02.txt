 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, today, I rise in support of my amendment  that cuts funding for the Bureau of Land Management by 50 percent.   The mission of the BLM is to sustain the health, diversity, and  productivity of public lands for the use and enjoyment of present and  future generations. Unfortunately, the BLM isn't living up to its  stated purpose, and it has lost its way.   It is becoming harder and harder for each new generation to use and  enjoy our public lands because the BLM is locked in on its goal to lock  out land users, including recreationists, livestock grazers, and energy  producers.   Earlier this year, the BLM proposed the so-called landscape health  rule, which seeks to replace productive activities under the BLM's  multiple-use framework by creating an additional use, so-called  conservation leases, a designation never approved by Congress.   The current framework already balances conservation with other uses.  Creating an entirely new use under the umbrella of conservation is  simply a means to eliminate other uses and bar anyone from even setting  foot on these lands.   Now, I am grateful that this act also includes a section that  prevents funding from going toward the implementation of this proposed  rule, but that is not enough. We must also address the BLM's overall  agenda to lock us out of our Federal lands. My amendment does just  that, and I request my colleagues to support it.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, The BLM has recently launched an attack on  3.6 million acres in Wyoming through its proposed draft Rock Springs  Resource Management Plan, or RMP. Through their preferred alternative,  they are trying to lock out land users by designating 1.8 million acres  as areas of critical environmental concern, which essentially prevents  us from accessing and using these lands, particularly as it relates to  recreation, livestock grazing, energy production and mineral  extraction.   The Rock Springs Draft RMP is entirely biased, unscientific, violates  FLPMA and NEPA, and is an abuse of BLM's authority. We can mine, we can  drill, we can graze, and we can recreate on Federal lands while also  conserving our important natural resources and wildlife, and, in fact,  we have been doing so for literally decades.   Come to Wyoming and see how we have managed these resources. We have  a beautiful State, abundant wildlife, clean water, and clean air. We  are also one of the largest energy producers in the United States.  Conservation and protection go hand-in-hand with grazing and energy  development.   The BLM's preferred alternative for the Rock Springs RMP does not  strike the proper balance between conservation and development. It  would ravage Wyoming's and the Nation's economy and ultimately destroy  opportunities to use the land in a productive, profitable, and  effective way.   The BLM has turned into an arm of the radical environmental  organizations running this administration, is aggressively exceeding  its authorization, and ignoring its very purpose for existence.   I encourage adoption of my amendment so that we can begin to right  this ship.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, the BLM is attacking not only the State of  Wyoming's economy, but the economic well-being and security of every  American. It continues to pursue these failed policies that force us to  depend on importing our food and our energy, while also stifling  competition for companies that operate on public lands.   Examples of these aggressive actions include: Leading out on  President Biden's war on oil and gas, as well as his war on coal;   Crippling conservation efforts by eliminating uses that improve the  environment;   Preventing local and State and multigenerational input as to what the  most appropriate uses and management of land are, while also pursuing  policies that impact the value and quality of our property resources;   Holding projects on Federal lands hostage to environmental  litigation, and then selling out to the demands of environmental groups  that are gaining traction in the fight against local control.   The BLM has perfected the sue-and-settle model, and all of us are  suffering the consequences.   There are so many other examples of the BLM attacking the State of  Wyoming, as well as the economic well-being of every citizen in the  United States.   Mr. Chairman, today, my State faces an onslaught of proposals from  the Bureau of Land Management and other Federal agencies as they pursue  the terribly destructive Green New Deal. Cutting the BLM's budget as  proposed in amendment No. 2 is one step forward in addressing those  attacks.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, the system that we have with the BLM is no  longer sustainable, and most States across the West are struggling as a  result. My colleagues in the House and Senate are wholly opposed to  reining in the executive state, so I have no choice but to try to slash  this agency's budget to try to rein in what they have been doing.   The fact is that the Federal Government's ever-growing presence in  the West and its adversarial nature to our way of life is undermining  our prosperity. In short, the BLM doesn't work for us anymore, it  doesn't work for the people of Wyoming, and it doesn't protect our  natural resources. It is time that we do something about it, recognize  where the problem lies, and slash the budget.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, today, I rise in support of my amendment,  which prohibits the BLM from finalizing its draft Rock Springs resource  management plan, the purpose of which is to severely restrict livestock  grazing, mining, energy development, recreation, and other activities  on 3.6 million acres of land in southwestern Wyoming.   The BLM is required to update its resource management plans  approximately every 10 years. The Rock Springs field office began the  process of updating its own plan in 2011 in accordance with FLPMA.   The proposed RMP contains four alternatives for the planning area,  including alternative A, which keeps the current management plan in  place; the BLM's preferred plan, alternative B,  [[Page H5286]]  which would have tremendous negative consequences for Wyoming and the  Nation as a whole; alternative C, which severely restricts recreational  activities; and alternative D, which provides a better balance between  various uses but still substantially impacts the activities of key  contributors to Wyoming's economy, such as our trona mining and  existing oil and gas operations.   Contrary to the very purpose of the BLM, it has chosen the most  restrictive, the most draconian, and the least scientifically  defensible plan--the one that Wyomingites are the most opposed to--as  its preference, that being alternative B.   In total, under BLM's preferred alternative B, about 2.5 million  acres would not be available for new rights-of-way. This would be an  increase of more than 480 percent in acreage off-limits to important  things like power lines, pipelines, and maintaining roads.   The draft RMP restricts the use of vehicles on millions of acres of  land, restricts recreation, cuts livestock grazing, destroys our trona  industry, and severely restricts our ability to explore for and produce  oil, gas, and coal.   BLM's alternative B is a nonstarter and will have severe impacts on  the economy of not only Wyoming but the Nation. It will impact our food  supply.   It is for these reasons that I have introduced my amendment to defund  the BLM's efforts to finalize or implement the RMP as a whole.   Mr. Chair, I encourage my colleagues to support this important  amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1345     Mr. Chairman, none of the responses from my colleague on  the other side had anything to do with the amendment before us, so I am  going to proceed with the statistics related to this particular RMP.   The RMP severely restricts vehicle access, including 4,500 miles of  routes to all uses, while removing an additional 10,000 miles of routes  from the transportation network.   This draft RMP designates 1.8 million acres out of 3.6 million acres  as areas of critical environmental concern without any congressional  input whatsoever.   Perhaps what is most disheartening and disturbing and illegal about  this RMP is the fact that it has ignored not only stakeholder input  over the past 12 years, but the input and analysis undertaken and  completed by the BLM personnel in the Rock Springs district's office.   The administration has proven time and again that its primary agenda  is to push forward with the radical Green New Deal, as we just heard  from my colleague on the other side, and that it views the opinions of  unelected bureaucrats in Washington, D.C., over the citizens of this  country, and that it does not care whether its actions actually work in  the real world or cause severe damage.   In addition to the fact that alternative B is just plain bad on its  face, it was also adopted in violation of FLPMA and NEPA. According to  a former BLM engineer who worked in the Rock Springs field office on  this very RMP, most of the research and work went into studying and  pursuing alternative D. What does that mean? The most controversial  alternative, the alternative that the BLM is now seeking to impose on  Wyoming, was never adequately evaluated.   Alternative C, which includes heavy recreational restrictions, also  had little time and little review. The lack of planning and analysis  and input related to alternative B exposes the fact that this is a  political decision that is not based on the real-life situation in the  Rock Springs district, but more related to the idea of blocking any  access to our natural resources for the things that we have  historically used them for.   Mr. Chair, we have historically balanced our energy development, land  use recreation, wildlife management, and grazing, and we have done it  well. Come to Wyoming. It is a beautiful State. We have been able to  balance all of these interests and, in the process,  [[Page H5287]]  become the largest producer of trona in the United States, raised  hundreds of thousands of head of cattle and sheep, and produced massive  amounts of coal and oil and gas to power this country, all the while  protecting our habitat, our air quality, our water quality, and our  very way of life.   I am proud of Wyoming producers, ranchers, and recreationists and  what they have created, and we cannot allow BLM to destroy it.   It was said the other day by a reporter that this BLM RMP takes the  public off public lands. I couldn't have said it better.   Mr. Chairman, we have seen this kind of thing happen across the  interior West, including with the Bears Ears designation in Utah, and  others in Colorado and Arizona. We need to put a stop to this effort to  block our access, use, and management of our resources.   I urge my colleagues to support my amendment, which would prevent any  funds from going towards implementing this monstrosity of a plan.   Mr. Chair, I encourage my colleagues to support this amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I rise in support of my amendment, which  prevents any funding from being used to finalize or implement the CEQ's  ``National Environmental Policy Act Guidance on Consideration of  Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Climate Change.''   Earlier this year, the CEQ issued interim guidance for agencies to  analyze greenhouse gas and climate change effects of their proposed  actions under the National Environmental Policy Act.   Madam Chair, for decades, radical environmental groups have  weaponized NEPA to attack and block natural resources development. They  have done so through a variety of techniques, including by colluding  with various Federal agencies in sue-and-settle schemes that have  poured massive amounts of money into their coffers while doing very  little to actually protect the environment or ensure that we can access  and use our Federal lands and projects to produce oil and gas, coal,  hydropower, and nuclear energy.   These are just some of the reasons as to why Republicans in Congress  have prioritized the passage of H.R. 1, the Lower Energy Cost Act,  which is intended to streamline, improve, and expedite the NEPA process  while also ensuring that we are protecting our environment. We can do  both, and in fact, we have been doing so for decades.   I have had multiple constituents reach out to me over the last year  seeking assistance in getting various Federal agencies to move  important projects along in the process.   In one such case, a constituent described being stuck on his fourth  and final solicitors review, a do loop that had been going on for  literally years. Although they had completed every single task and done  every single thing asked of them multiple times, the agency refused to  move forward.   My staff has since met with the Office of Surface Mining only to be  told that there is a queue, as though that is an adequate answer. To  date, there has been no movement on this review.   This situation represents a failure of the system, and allowing the  CEQ to unilaterally impose radical GHG and global warming requirements  on these agencies will not make the situation any better.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to support my amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, we simply have no accountability, no taking  of responsibility, and no consequences for these agencies that fail to  carry out their responsibilities. What that means in the long term is  that there is ultimately no more gas for our cars, oil to heat our  homes, or energy to power our First World economy.   What is my point? We do not need to add any more roadblocks under  NEPA making it even more uncertain and difficult for these agencies to  process applications. We don't need any more steps, reviews, analyses,  or guidance documents to make NEPA more burdensome to our producers,  small businesses, ranchers, and manufacturers. We don't need to make it  any more difficult to properly manage our national forests or to  maintain our water infrastructure.   We have reclamation projects that need to be constructed and  maintained. We have forests in dire need of management. We need these  things now, not 10 years from now.   My amendment defunds the CEQ's and this administration's efforts to  use global warming hysteria to further delay such projects that are  subject to NEPA.   My amendment is also critically important to block CEQ's illegal  attempt to avoid compliance with the APA's rulemaking requirements. CEQ  doesn't have the authority to issue guidance documents with the force  and effect of law, yet that is exactly how this guidance document will  be interpreted--as imposing new requirements on project proponents as  part of the NEPA review process.   We must, therefore, stop CEQ from implementing a so-called guidance  document that is, in reality, no such thing. CEQ should be forced to go  through the public rulemaking process to adopt such wide-ranging  changes to NEPA procedural requirements.   The reality is that NEPA was designed to address reasonably  foreseeable impacts of a particular project, not to allow agencies to  try to guess what temperature it will be a thousand miles away 75 years  from now.   I read an article a year ago assessing the global warming hysteria  that we are living through. This gentleman who wrote the article made  an excellent observation that I believe is worth repeating here: ``The  notion that government should impoverish actual human beings as a means  of promoting the welfare of humanity is a pagan superstition on par  with sacrificing individuals to the sun god.'' I couldn't have said it  better.                                time  2000    We must block the CEQ from pursuing an agenda of impoverishment and  government imposed wretchedness. We must no longer tolerate their  bowing to the sun god, and we must return common sense and rational  thinking to our permitting and NEPA processes.   Please join me in supporting my amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I rise today in support of my amendment  which prohibits the implementation and enforcement of the EPA's final  rule entitled: Clean Water Act Section 401 Water Quality Certification  Improvement Rule.   The U.S. EPA published in the Federal Register its revised Clean  Water Act Section 401 certification rule on September 27 of this year.  This proposal was made in direct response to the 2021 Biden executive  order that directed agencies to tackle the so-called climate crisis.   This rule applies to 401 certifications, which are water quality  certifications issued by State or Tribal authorities that verify  compliance with water quality requirements. The CWA allows States a  great deal of discretion in reviewing and conditioning 401  certifications to ensure compliance with the CWA and State surface  water quality standards.   This final rule returns to the broader scope of review that was in  place prior to the 2020 rule and requires States and Tribes to evaluate  the water-quality-related impacts from an entire activity as a whole,  including construction and operation, rather than doing what it should,  which is solely focusing on the aspect of the activity directly  authorized by a given Federal license or permit.   The final rule also includes a broad definition of the term  ``neighboring jurisdiction'' which means that it can include any  jurisdiction other than the one in which the discharge originates.   The EPA's proposed rule is too broad, is contrary to the clear intent  of section 401 of the Clean Water Act and is outside of the EPA's  authority and jurisdiction.   My amendment would prohibit the implementation of this broad,  wrongheaded rule.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to support my amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, we all want clean water. This rule has  nothing to do with that. This has to do with the EPA controlling and  dictating matters that they have no business being involved with.   This proposal will put many pending projects at risk, including  mining projects, and it will force the courts to make the final  determinations with regard to such projects by interpreting and  applying two extremely vague and ambiguous provisions included in the  new rule.   This situation will ultimately result in a significant loss of  investment in mining projects throughout the country, and it will cause  greater regulatory uncertainty and inefficiency.   My amendment will block the EPA from implementing this wrongheaded  rule, and I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of it.   Not only does this rule broaden reviews and jurisdiction for permit  requirements, but it substantially expands the jurisdiction of States  to regulate even those waters that are not considered navigable waters  of the United States as required by the Clean Water Act.   The Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality had this to say about  the rule:         We are deeply concerned with EPA's blatant claims in the       preamble of the rule to use the section 401 certification       process as a mechanism to expand Federal jurisdiction in       waters that are not waters of the United States.    Wyoming DEQ also highlighted the burdens that would be imposed on  entities due to broadening the scope of activities measured under this  certification to include conditions unrelated or only speculatively  related to water quality.   I will say it again: We all want clean water. This rule has nothing  to do with that.  [[Page H5330]]    EPA's new interpretation of section 401 and its efforts to broaden  States' authority over water bodies and features that are outside of  the jurisdiction of Clean Water Act must be stopped.   We are fed up with the EPA using the Clean Water Act as part of its  effort to implement this administration's radical environmental agenda  and land grab. My amendment is designed to stop this nonsense, to block  the EPA's misinterpretation and application of section 401 of the Clean  Water Act, and to force the EPA to follow the law.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
