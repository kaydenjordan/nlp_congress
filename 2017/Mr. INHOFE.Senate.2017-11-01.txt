 Mr. President, I am not the first guy to stand up here  and make this observation, but I have serious concerns with how the  nominee confirmation process has been going in this Congress.   There is a blatant lack of respect for the Senate nomination process  and an unprecedented level of obstructionism. I have been here for a  number of years, so I know what to compare it with. I have never seen  so many people being delayed in their confirmations, knowing that they  are, ultimately, going to be confirmed and that they are well-qualified  civil servants.   The Democrats are forcing cloture votes on nominees who have well  over 60 votes in support. Last week, we held a cloture vote on Scott  Palk. Scott Palk is from Oklahoma. He is a guy who everybody likes. He  doesn't have  [[Page S6962]]  any enemies out there. In fact, he was actually nominated by President  Obama. He was not even nominated by this President. He ended up getting  79 votes. Still, the stall was there, and we had to wait and wait and  wait. Meanwhile, things are not getting done that should be getting  done. Furthermore, the agency positions that we have hardly ever held  rollcall votes on are being forced to occupy floor time. There is no  reason for these votes except to delay the work of the courts and our  agencies.   I am very supportive of the leader's commitment to our courts and how  he has prioritized judicial nominees. These nominations are extremely  important and will ensure that the rule of law is upheld for, possibly,  decades to come, benefiting all Americans.
