 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Oklahoma for yielding  to me.   Mr. Speaker, the American people are sacrificing on the front lines.  It has already been discussed about the truck drivers, the nurses, and  all of that.   I was going to go on to that, but then when I sat on this floor and  listened to things that were being said--remember, I come from the  State of Illinois where over a long period of time, about 35 years, we  have seen small moves that sounded so good at the time, giving all of  their power to the Speaker--all of their power given away, which is not  what our Founding Fathers said.   Mr. Speaker, the sponsor of this bill has said on several occasions  that he would like to insert this statement into the Record and this  article into  [[Page H2038]]  the Record. Well, they do not change the facts of Article I, Section 5  that are so clear, that this is unconstitutional.   I hope for the sake of the people who I represent or the people who  each one of us represent that the Members will stand against this  proposed rule, a rule that gives more power to one person instead of  the individuals that we have here the way it was originally set up.   Mr. Speaker, as I direct my comments toward you and the Chair, I  would like to say this: If you believe that I, as a Member, am going to  give up by proxy the ability to represent my 720,000 people, it will  not happen.
