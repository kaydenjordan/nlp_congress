 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 70, I  call up the joint resolution (H.J. Res. 38) disapproving the rule  submitted by the Department of the Interior known as the Stream  Protection Rule, and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the joint resolution.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 70, the joint  resolution is considered read.   The text of the joint resolution is as follows:                                H.J. Res. 38         Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the       United States of America in Congress assembled, That Congress       disapproves the rule submitted by the Office of Surface       Mining Reclamation and Enforcement of the Department of the       Interior relating to the ``Stream Protection Rule''       (published at 81 Fed. Reg. 93066 (December 20, 2016)), and       such rule shall have no force or effect.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Utah (Mr. Bishop) and the  gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Grijalva) each will control 30 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Utah.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks on  H.J. Res. 38.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Utah?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks on  H.J. Res. 38.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Utah?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 4 minutes.   We are starting an historic week in the House, something that was  replicated almost two decades ago, but we are doing it again and are  using the Congressional Review Act to look at actual rules and  regulations. What we are doing is the right thing.   In 1996, when this act was first passed, President Clinton, after  signing it, said that this act would give congressional accountability  for regulations. Even Harry Reid said that this act would be reclaiming  for Congress some of its policymaking authority, and Sander Levin of  Michigan, at the time, also said that now we are in a position to do  something ourselves. If a rule goes too far afield from the intent of  Congress in its passing the statute in the first place, we can stop it.  That is exactly what we are attempting to do, and this is one of the  first of those activities we will be doing this week.   The Congressional Review Act actually has three purposes in mind.  They said, if a rule has excessive costs, if a rule goes beyond the  particular agency's statutory authority, and if a rule is duplicative  or unnecessary, it should be reviewed by Congress and rescinded. That  is exactly what we are going to do because this rule, commonly called  the stream protection rule, does all three of those criteria.   What I want to do is talk about this rule that was passed at the last  minute by the former administration--it actually went into effect on  the very last day of the administration--and say that it violates all  of those three elements. The act itself--the rule itself--was done in  secret. They had their own opaque study that they did without letting  anyone know what the data was. We asked for it repeatedly, but the  agency refused to tell us. Even in 2015, Congress passed a law in the  Appropriations Act that mandated they tell us the data, the  information. They simply ignored that law. They have refused to work  with Congress in any particular way.                                time  1400    Actually, it violates law. If this rule goes forward, it violates the  NEPA law. If gone into implementation, it would violate the Endangered  Species Act.   It violates a memo of understanding the Federal Government had with  10 States at the time. In fact, there are 14 States suing over this  rule and regulation. We have the letters of support from 14 State  attorneys general in support of what we are attempting to do here.   If put into effect, it clearly violates the Clean Water Act by its  effort to redefine hydraulic balance, which this agency does not have  the authority to do. It is given to other elements.   It also puts us at risk of litigation on a takings issue. There is  precedent for that. It could happen again, all because of this ill- defined and unnecessary rule and regulation.   If we roll it back, there is still protection. There will always  still be protection. In a Department of the Interior study, they  clearly said that 93 percent of all the impact has already been taken  care of and does not actually exist. It would be easy for us to do and  it would put us back to a rule established in 1983 that is effective in  protecting these areas. Ninety three percent of all streams have no  impact by this issue whatsoever.   It also clearly says, under the report when this rule was being done,  that the States that are legally supposed to be coordinated and be a  part of the process were shut out of the process. It is one of the  reasons why they are still suing, which means the memo of understanding  signed by those States was ignored by the agency in coming up with this  rule. The States that regulate 97 percent of the Nation's coal  production, States and tribes that abate well over 90 percent of the  abandoned mine problems--they have it in line, they have it ready, they  are ready to move forward with it--they were simply shut out of the  process. It is a poor process.   There was a former icon of this body, a great Member who once  allegedly said: If I let you make the policy and you let me make the  procedure, I will screw you over every time.   This is poor procedure that has produced a poor rule, which will  result in poor policy. At best, this rule is redundant. It is clearly  unnecessary, and it does have the potential of hurting people  nefariously when it does not need to.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Johnson) to explain this joint resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Johnson) to explain this joint resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from West Virginia (Mr. Jenkins), someone who has forgotten more about  coal than I will ever know.   Mr. JENKINS of West Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this  resolution. Like so many folks, I have been fighting this misguided  rule for years. Miners have been fighting this rule for years. And  States--bipartisan, Democrat and Republican--have been fighting this  rule for years.   Stopping this rule matters to West Virginians, to our miners, to our  families, to our consumers. We produce 95 percent of our electricity  from coal. It is reliable and it is affordable. Coal employs 20,000  West Virginians, and tens of thousands more make their living related  to coal.    The loss of a coal job and the closing of a coal mine affects us all.  Its severance tax revenues help to fund our schools, pay for our police  and fire departments, and put money in the coffers of our local  governments.   This rule would cost cities and counties $6.4 billion in tax revenue  over a year, with the decline in coal mining. That means even more  cuts.   When we lose coal jobs, we lose other jobs as well. When coal  families lose a paycheck, they aren't able to buy goods and services  like they used to. That hurts small businesses, our shops, and our  restaurants.   It is estimated that this rule would kill 281,000 coal jobs and  related jobs in other fields. My State can't afford to lose any more  jobs, and I know that goes for other coal States.   However, despite these facts and the objections of more than a dozen  States, the Office of Surface Mining adopted a go-it-alone approach.  They ignored input that contradicts their agenda. They withheld  information on the rule and restricted States from reviewing it. Well,  that ends today.   I thank Chairman Bishop, I thank the House Natural Resources  Committee, and I thank the leadership of the House for their support on  this resolution. Thank you, Senator Capito and Leader McConnell, for  your leadership in the Senate. We also have the support of the White  House on this resolution.   With a simple majority vote in the House and the Senate, we will end  this rule and stop this job-killing, anticoal agenda.   I urge support on this joint resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I don't want to quibble over  details, but we actually held 13 hearings and passed four bills over  the last three Congresses about this particular rule and found  countless problems with it. That is why we are here today.   I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. McKinley),  who knows the real impact on his constituents that this rule will have.   Mr. McKINLEY. Mr. Speaker, as chairman of the Congressional Coal  Caucus, I rise today in strong support for this action.   After 8 long, tortuous years, our coal communities have endured a  withering attack from Washington bureaucrats focused on this agenda of  anticoal. What has been the result?   Across this country, in the coal fields of this country, 400 mines  have closed down, 83,000 coal miners have lost their jobs, 246 power  plants have closed down, and our electric utility bills have gone up 45  percent.   Then, right before President Obama left town, his administration  punctuated its war on coal with this damaging further rule. This rule  is nothing more than an organic manifestation of a Washington  bureaucracy drunk with power. If it is left unaddressed, this rule  would shut down an additional number of coal mines, and 78,000 men and  women would lose their jobs because of this rule.   For the last 2 years, our Coal Caucus, bipartisan members, have made  stopping this rule our number one priority, because it has nothing to  do with the health of America, the safety of America, and the life of  Americans.   Simply put, it was President Obama's attempt to drive a final nail  into the coffin of an industry that made America great.   Look, enough is enough. This war on coal has to come to a stop, and I  think this election set the tone for that.   Now that we finally have a President who understands the painful  impact of excessive and unnecessary regulations, we should pass this  CRA as quickly as possible so he can sign it.   It is time to give the families of the coal fields all across America  a chance to get relief from the unelected bureaucrats in Washington.   I thank the chairman for his work in getting this. I thank him for  the cosponsorship that we have had with Congressmen Johnson and Jenkins  to help us out on this, to get this before us. We have to do this for  the people of West Virginia and around the country.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Colorado (Mr. Lamborn), who chaired most of our 13 hearings on  this issue, and who represents a State that is suing because they were  ignored in this rule, where they should have had their rights under the  Clean Water Act, which is part of the problem we have here.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Arizona (Mr. Gosar), part of our committee who has heard the 13  hearings, understands this issue, and was part of the House when we  voted four different times to be opposed to this particular rule.    Mr. Speaker, I now have the pleasure of  recognizing people who are not on our committee but still know how  silly this rule actually is.   I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Bost.)    Mr. Speaker, nice to know that 2:30 in the  afternoon is the dead of night.   I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Rothfus).     I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Ohio (Mr. Renacci).    Mr. Speaker, I am happy to yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Tipton), another State that was promised,  in the Clean Water Act, to have authority which was taken away by this  simple rule.    I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Kentucky (Mr. Comer), a new Member of Congress, who realizes that  this rule is long on regulations and short on real new protections for  people.                                time  1445     Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from California (Mr. LaMalfa), one of the other members of our  committee who has served for a long time and has heard many of these  arguments before.   Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the measure for  congressional disapproval of the Department of the Interior's stream  protection rule, which was created under the guise of protecting the  environment but, instead, has been very harmful to American jobs.   They have attempted to cripple an industry--energy--that has provided  vast amounts of energy to States across this country for decades. My  home State of California has had a long history of mining that has led  to incredible economic growth and job opportunities for many of my  local communities.   This one-size-fits-all approach fails to provide any regulatory  certainty to industry and denies important tax revenue from energy  extraction to the American taxpayer.   I appreciate my colleagues bringing this to the floor, and I hope we  can sort through the rhetoric on this against energy jobs of a very  important segment across the country that supplies so much of our  energy currently, and can do it with safety and a mind for redeveloping  our economy.    Mr. Speaker, the opposition to this particular  bill goes from coast to coast. We just heard from California. Now we  will go back to the East Coast.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Yoho).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Kentucky (Mr. Barr), who clearly understands the situation that  this rule has presented.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Illinois (Mr. Rodney Davis).   Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this  resolution providing for a congressional disapproval of the stream  buffer rule.   In my home State of Illinois, coal production employs roughly 5,000  workers and the industry contributes $2 billion a year to our State's  economy. In southern Illinois, these are some of the region's best- paying jobs.   Unfortunately, this rule was one of the final shots the Obama  administration fired in their war on coal. Unless reversed, this rule  is directly going to hurt our Illinois coal miners and those working at  coal power plants and, in the end, consumers--those who pay the utility  bills in this country.   The last administration refused to work in good faith with the States  when finalizing the rule, even after Congress told them to do so in the  2015 omnibus bill.   I include in the Record a letter from the Illinois Department of  Natural Resources in opposition to the rule.                                              Illinois Department of                                               Natural Resources,                                  Springfield, IL, January 30, 2017.      Re The Stream Protection Rule and The Congressional Review           Act.       Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan and Majority Leader McConnell: As the       regulatory authority for administering the federal Surface       Mining Control and Reclamation Act (``SMCRA'') in the State       of Illinois, the Department of Natural Resources       (``Department'') appeals Congress to use its power under the       Congressional Review Act to disapprove the ``Stream       Protection Rule'' (``Rule''), issued by the Office of Surface       Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (``OSM'') at 81 Fed. Reg.       93066 (Dec. 20, 2016).        The Rule's ``one size fits all'' approach to regulatory       performance standards fails to incorporate important regional       differences, such as local geology, hydrologic regime, and       climate, as required under SMCRA. For example, stream loss       has rarely been a problem in the State of Illinois given the       regional hydrogeology of the Illinois Basin. To universally       require long term upstream and downstream monitoring would       place an undue burden on the State to continually review such       data. The rule gives no discretion to state regulatory       authorities.        Despite the claims of OSM in its Regulatory Impact       Analysis, the Rule would place significant burdens and       additional costs on state regulatory programs. Compliance       with the rule would require the Department to revise and       restructure its entire coal mining program and add $600,000       to $800,000 per year in staffing and equipment costs.        OSM's failure to properly consult with the State of       Illinois and the other states has resulted in a burdensome       and unlawful Rule that usurps states' authority as primary       regulators of coal mining as intended by Congress under       SMCRA, and demands congressional action.        The Congressional Review Act provides Congress the       authority to take action to avoid the harm imposed by the       Rule. Accordingly, we respectfully request that you and your       colleagues in the Congress pass a joint resolution       disapproving the Final Stream Protection Rule under the       procedures of the Congressional Review Act, S U.S.C. 801 et       seq., so that it shall have no continuing force or effect.        Thank you for your careful consideration of this request.            Sincerely,                                                Wayne A. Rosenthal,                         Director, Department of Natural Resources.    Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. In this letter, IDNR notes that the  Office of Surface Mining failed to properly consult with the State of  Illinois and the other States, resulting in a burdensome and unlawful  rule that usurps States' authority as primary regulators of coal mining  as intended by Congress and demands congressional action.   Mr. Speaker, rules like this are what the CRA is all about. I ask for  your support.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute.   The stream protection rule has got to be the poster child for the  Congressional Review Act's action. There are 400 changes to the bill.  There are 400 changes in over 1,600 pages of regulations, and there is  no new, real protection above and beyond what we were using since the  Reagan administration.   But it does outline benefits and potential problems for 70,000 people  directly with their jobs, for 300,000 people whose jobs are threatened  in a ripple effect, and, unfortunately, for everyone else. Every time  you turn a light on, your costs will be exacerbated because of this  particular rule.   This rule affects the most vulnerable of our population and it hurts  them. It is time for us to realize that it is time to stop making rules  and regulations for an ideological approach, and, instead, new rules  and regulations that help people, not hurt people, as this particular  one does.   That is why this House, on four different occasions over the last  three congresses, has voted against this particular proposal.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Ohio (Mr. Gibbs).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Ohio (Mr. Gibbs).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Kentucky (Mr. Rogers), the former chairman of the Committee on  Appropriations.    I yield myself the balance of my time to close.   Mr. Speaker, we have heard a lot of false science today, which is  appropriate since the agency that concocted this rule refused to allow  any of the data they used to make the rule to be made public. We asked  for it. We asked for it in legislation. They simply refused to comply.  Ninety-three percent of the sites are not having any impact on the  streams, and the other seven percent we already had rules that covered  them that did this protection. There is no real new protection in this  particular act.   The States, which regulate 97 percent of the coal mines in the United  States, were shut out of the process, which is why they are suing over  it. This rule undercuts the State primacy that was provided in the  Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act.   What we are doing here today with this effort is to reestablish the  article I authority that we have in the Constitution by saying we are  responsible for the policy, not some agency of the executive branch.   Adopting this resolution protects the rights of States tasked with  regulating the coal industry in their borders, and it also actually  helps people. People are going to be harmed if this act is not repealed  and actually goes into effect, and the most vulnerable of our  populations are the ones who will suffer the most because of it.   Because of that reason, it is right for Congress to do our  responsibility here and now and repeal this bad act that was done in  secret that was not allowed to have the openness that we have requested  in the past and that is simply redundant at best, totally unnecessary,  and does the harm that it does to real people: 70,000 direct jobs, over  300,000 indirect jobs, as well as a higher cost to everyone who uses  energy in this Nation.   I ask my colleagues to support the resolution of disapproval and vote  for its final passage.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
