 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.    Mr. Speaker, I think before I begin, I would just like to ask any of  my Republican colleagues whether anybody found the secret three-page  memo detailing all the concessions that were made to the most extreme  elements of their Republican Conference?   Anyone?   Mr. Speaker, I heard that Speaker McCarthy told Members during a  closed conference meeting that there is no official document or three- page addendum to the House rules package detailing these concessions.  None of us ever said it was official. If it was official, it would have  been in the official rules package.   I also took note of the fact that in Axios today we saw this. It  says: ``One thing the document doesn't contain, according to NRCC Chair  Richard Hudson, who said he's seen it, is promised committee  chairmanships for specific Members: `No names, just representation on  panels.' ''   So we were able to find out from Mr. Hudson what is not in that  secret memo, but it would be helpful maybe before the end of the day if  we could actually get the document so that the American people know  what was promised.   Mr. Speaker, China has the second largest economy in the world, and  there is no doubt that their government seeks to extend their sphere of  influence and export their model of authoritarianism abroad.   The question is: How should the United States respond?   For the past 4 years, I have served as chair and co-chair of the  Congressional-Executive Commission on China. We have monitored China's  compliance with international human rights and rule of law standards.   Under my leadership, alongside Senators Jeff Merkley, Marco Rubio,  and Congressman Chris Smith, the Commission has continued to draw  attention to the Chinese Government's human rights violations and  technology-enhanced authoritarianism.   We passed my bill, the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, which  seeks to address the genocide in Xinjiang, and we hope can serve as a  model for future human rights legislation.   We passed the Tibet Policy and Support Act to support the people of  Tibet in their struggle against Chinese repression, and the Hong Kong  Human Rights and Democracy Act to require the U.S. Government to impose  sanctions against mainland China and Hong Kong officials considered  responsible for human rights abuses in Hong Kong.   Now, everything that we accomplished at the CECC has been because  that Commission operates in a bipartisan manner with nonpartisan staff.  Our comprehensive annual reports are widely respected by government  officials, academics, and the advocacy community because they are well- researched and they are fact-based.   That brings us to today.   Mr. Speaker, we are here to consider the creation of a select  committee. This select committee on China would investigate and submit  policy recommendations on the status of China's economic,  technological, and security progress, as well as its ongoing  competition with the United States.   I will be honest. I have reservations here. Many of us have concerns  about this turning into a committee that focuses on pushing Republican  conspiracy theories and partisan talking points. We certainly don't  want it to turn into a place that perpetuates anti-Asian hate. We  cannot and will not tolerate that.   But, instead, I would hope that this new committee would work in a  similar fashion as the CECC--producing bipartisan work with a fact- based tone and approach that could be received by the international  community seriously and substantively.   There are a few things that I think the select committee needs to  keep in mind if they truly want to be effective.   First, President Trump repeatedly mislabeled COVID with racist  language. Such rhetoric coincided with spikes in hate-based acts of  violence and discrimination against people of Chinese or Asian origin  across the country. This language has no place on this committee or  anywhere in Congress.   Second, this committee should not seek to focus solely on military  solutions. Yes, China's military modernization is a legitimate issue,  but that does not demand a military-first policy response.   Third, I am concerned that a committee focused myopically on the  economic, technological, and security challenges of China could  distract us from the need to build a holistic approach in many of these  policy areas. We need to remember that the United States faces  economic, technological, and security challenges from many different  regions across the globe, not just China. To focus solely on China,  whether it be policy related to trade, technology, authoritarianism, or  anything else, is neither analytically sound nor effective.   Fourth, and finally, the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Gallagher)  said if he were to chair this committee, he would focus on  ``ideological competition and human rights.'' I would just like to say  that human rights are not ideological. Human rights are fundamental and  universal, protected by a vast body of international law codified at  the United Nations and widely adjudicated. They apply to every person  in every country and territory on Earth.   It is the Chinese Communist Party, in fact, that portrays human  rights along an ideological divide. That falsely portrays Chinese  values as something distinct from Western values in an effort to  justify its repression of the people of China. It is important that the  committee does not adopt the rhetoric of Chinese officials.   While I do have concerns here, after reading the resolution itself, I  will be voting yes. The Democratic Party has led the way in  implementing efforts to monitor China's compliance with international  human rights and rule of law standards, and we will continue to do so  here.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the Speaker for his assurances.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Bera).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Foster).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Takano).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Chu).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Khanna).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Georgia (Mr. Johnson).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Connolly).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1315     Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, this select committee has the potential to do some  substantive work, and there is a bipartisan group here in this House  that for years has been focused on holding China accountable and  upholding a high standard of human rights.   I don't want to close without acknowledging the incredible leadership  of Speaker Pelosi in all of this. I traveled with Speaker Pelosi to  China a few years back, and she insisted that we visit Tibet, a place  that was blocked off for congressional visits for many years.   She refused to take no for an answer, and we went to Tibet. Under her  leadership, the legislation that I mentioned at the beginning of my  remarks was passed, the most consequential legislation to hold China  accountable passed in this Congress in history.   The potential that this select committee has really is contingent on  making sure that the words that were expressed by Speaker McCarthy and  by incoming Chair Gallagher are actually upheld. The concern that you  hear on our side really is concern that this devolves into something  that is about promoting conspiracy theories and that tolerates racist  language.    We say that because we have been through all of this. The use of the  words that the former President chose to employ resulted in hate crimes  against Asian Americans in this country. It is unconscionable.   If this committee goes in that direction, I assure you that the  Democrats on that committee will push back forcefully.   We want this committee to be effective. In theory, this is a  committee that we should all get behind, and I hope that it is  successful. I hope that it is bipartisan. I hope that it is all that we  have been promised here today.   As I said, I am going to vote for this because I think it is the  right thing to do, and I have faith that our Members on both sides will  do the right thing.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote their conscience. I am  going to vote ``yes'' on this, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        January 10, 2023, on page H129, in the third column, the  following appeared: The question was taken; and the Speaker pro  tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it.  Mr. Speaker, on that I demand  the yeas and nays.    ========================= END NOTE =========================      The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, today, we will consider the creation of a new  subcommittee here in the House that Republicans call the Select  Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government. I call it  the McCarthy committee, and I am not talking about Kevin. I am talking  about Joe.   Mr. Speaker, this committee is nothing more than a deranged ploy by  the MAGA extremists who have hijacked the Republican Party and now want  to use taxpayer money to push their far-right conspiracy nonsense.   Let's start with the subcommittee's mandate, which is recklessly  broad.  [[Page H131]]  Speaker McCarthy is essentially handing Mr. Jordan the power to target  anyone and anything he doesn't like, anything and anyone he deems  unconstitutional, illegal, or unethical.   Who decides what is unconstitutional, illegal, or unethical? Mr.  Jordan does.                                time  1330    Why don't we just be blunt here? Republicans claim to care about law  enforcement, but this new committee is about attacking law enforcement.  It is about going after people. It is about destroying people's careers  and lives. It is about undermining the Department of Justice, defunding  the police, and settling scores on behalf of the twice-impeached and  disgraced former occupant of the Oval Office.   The MAGA extremist fringe of the Republican Party will use this  committee to push QAnon conspiracy theories and lies from Truth Social.  They are going to use it to gin up fake investigations into nonexistent  scandals. I think we need to just start calling this the tinfoil hat  committee.   Speaker McCarthy even changed the language at the last minute to  provide unprecedented authority for the subcommittee to interfere in  ongoing criminal investigations.   Let me repeat: The Republican Party, the party that claims to care  about law and order, has created a committee not just to defund the  police based on their wacky conspiracy theories, but to actually try to  shut down ongoing investigations, including into domestic terrorists,  phony electors, insurrectionists, people who are on trial for sedition  because they tried to overthrow the government, and even disgraced  former President Donald Trump.   This is outrageous. We are a country of laws, but this committee  seeks to undermine the law, undermine the police, and make a complete  mockery of the investigative and oversight powers of the House.   As seen on this week's Sunday shows, some sitting Republicans being  investigated right now by the FBI and the Department of Justice want to  serve on this committee.   I mean, what? I mean, come on. Give me a break. I know my Republican  friends have some ethically challenged members who asked for pardons  from the former President, but this is beyond the pale. This is  unconscionable. This is a conflict of interest.   First, they gut the Office of Congressional Ethics. Now, they give  Members of Congress the ability to investigate and to try to shut down  criminal investigations that they are subjects in. One set of rules for  the American people, another set of rules for Republican Members of  Congress. It is incredibly offensive.   On their first real week in the majority, this is what my Republican  friends are pushing through? Not a bill to fight inflation. Not a bill  to raise wages for people. A bill for Republican Members of Congress to  shut down investigations into their own wrongdoings. What is wrong with  these people?   On top of all of that, this subcommittee expects to use the power of  the subpoena to advance their delusional QAnon conspiracy theories and  harass Federal law enforcement agents.   I would say it is almost comical if it wasn't so disturbing that  Speaker McCarthy and Mr. Jordan refused to comply with bipartisan  subpoenas issued by the January 6th Committee. So I guess for them, it  is do as I say, not as I do.   In my mind, it speaks volumes that House Republicans are choosing to  prioritize this kind of dangerous partisan garbage instead of actually  trying to help everyday Americans.   Whatever happened to Republicans' commitment to America? They  promised to tackle inflation, end the opioid crisis, reduce the  national debt, and more. None of those issues are addressed in their  first 12 bills.   In fact, the very first bill they passed last night doesn't reduce  the deficit, it adds $114 billion to the deficit by making it easier  for billionaires to cheat on their taxes.   This is where we are week 2 of the 118th Congress, and we are  creating a witch-hunt committee where Republicans plan to air their  grievances and further incite crazy fringe conspiracy theories from the  internet at the taxpayers' expense.   Senator Joseph McCarthy would be very proud of what Republicans are  doing today. Putting their own personal power and partisan politics  over the needs of the American people. Just like Senator McCarthy  looking for imaginary communists, they are going to find QAnon  conspiracies everywhere they look because that is what they want to  find.   Just like the McCarthy committee, this will become another shameful,  disgraceful moment for the Congress of the United States.   This has nothing to do with the rule of law, nothing to do with  proper oversight of government. It is simply about revenge. It is about  disrupting and destroying rather than collaborating and creating. It is  about putting politics over people instead of putting people over  politics to build a better future for America.   This subcommittee is an awful idea, and I urge my colleagues, in the  strongest possible terms, to vote ``no'' on this monstrosity that will  further empower the extremists at the expense of the American people.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record an article from  The Hill titled: ``January 6 panel names six House GOP lawmakers who  asked for pardons.''                       [From The Hill, June 23, 2022]      Jan. 6 Panel Names Six House GOP Lawmakers Who Asked for Pardons                   (By Mychael Schnell and Emily Brooks)         The Jan. 6 committee investigating the attack on the       Capitol revealed Thursday that at least a half-dozen       Republican lawmakers asked for presidential pardons for their       role in voting to overturn election results in certain states       on Jan. 6, 2021, according to testimony from former Trump       aides.        Testimony from Trump aides named Reps. Matt Gaetz (Fla.) Mo       Brooks (Ala.) Louie Gohmert (Texas), Andy Biggs (Ariz.), and       Scott Perry (PA.) as seeking pardons.        An aide also said that Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (Ga.)       contacted the White House Counsel's office seeking a pardon.        Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.), a member of the panel who       played an elevated role in Thursday's proceedings, presented       an email from Brooks, dated Jan. 11, 2021, in which the       congressman asked for presidential pardons for himself,       Gaetz, and lawmakers who objected to the Electoral College       vote for Arizona and Pennsylvania.        ``President Trump asked me to send you this letter. This       letter is also pursuant to a request from Matt Gaetz,'' the       email reads.        ``As such, I recommend that President give general (all       purpose) pardons to the following groups of people:,'' the       email adds. ``Every Congressman and Senator who voted to       reject the electoral vote submission of Arizona and       Pennsylvania.''        A spokesman for Brooks forwarded a full copy of the email,       which included a concern that Democrats would ``abuse       America's judicial system by targeting numerous Republicans       with sham charges.''        ``The email request says it all. There was a concern       Democrats would abuse the judicial system by prosecuting and       jailing Republicans who acted pursuant to their       Constitutional or statutory duties under 3 USC 15,'' Brooks       said in a statement. ``Fortunately, with time passage, more       rational forces took over and no one was persecuted for       performing their lawful duties, which means a pardon was       unnecessary after all.''        The panel also showed a video of former special assistant       to the president Cassidy Hutchinson, saying Gaetz and Brooks       ``both advocated for there to be a blanket pardon'' for       members of Congress involved with a meeting that took place       on Dec. 21, 2020, presumably the huddle at the White House       that focused on overturning the 2020 presidential election.        She also said Gaetz and Brooks advocated for a blanket       pardon for ``a handful of other members that weren't at the       Dec. 21 meeting.'' Those were meant to be ``preemptive       pardons,'' she noted.        Additionally, Hutchinson said ``Gaetz was personally       pushing for a pardon, and he was doing so since early       December,'' but said she did not know why.        Gaetz reached out to Hutchinson asking for a meeting with       Meadows ``about receiving a presidential pardon,'' according       to her closed-door testimony presented at Thursday's hearing.        Hutchinson said Biggs, Gohmert and Perry also asked for       pardons, but did not reveal more details.        And she said Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), a fierce defender of       Trump, ``talked about congressional pardons, but he never       asked me for one,'' noting that he was largely inquiring       about whether or not the White House was going to grant the       lawmaker pardons.        Brooks, Biggs, Perry and Jordan were all issued subpoenas       by the select committee in May.        Perry previously denied that he asked for a pardon, and       stood by that in light of new testimony.        ``I stand by my statement that I never sought a       Presidential pardon for myself or other Members of Congress.       At no time did I speak with Miss Hutchinson, a White House       scheduler, nor any White House staff about a pardon for       myself or any other Member of Congress--this never       happened,'' Perry said in a statement.        A spokesman for Perry previously denied that he asked for a       pardon, calling it ``laughable, ludicrous, and a thoroughly       soulless lie.''        In a statement Thursday night, Gohmert said he requested       pardons for U.S. service members and military contractors--      not himself.        He called the claim that he requested a pardon for himself       ``malicious, despicable and unfit for a U.S. Congressional       hearing.''        ``I requested pardons for brave U.S. service members and       military contractors who were railroaded by the justice       system due to superiors playing politics, as well as a       civilian leader who was also wronged by a despicable       injustice,'' Gohmert said. ``These requests were all far       prior to, and completely unrelated to January 6.''        Biggs also objected to the committee's assertion that he       sought a parton, writing in a statement Thursday night that       Hutchinson ``is mistaken.''        He said the testimony of Hutchinson discussing the pardons       was ``deceptively edited to make it appear as if I personally       asked for her a presidential pardon.''        Greene, Hutchinson said, did not contact her directly, but       she said she had heard that Greene contacted the White House       Counsel's office for a pardon.        Greene pushed back on the testimony in a tweet, but did not       directly deny asking for a pardon.        ``Saying `I heard' means you don't know,'' Greene said.       ``Spreading gossip and lies is exactly what the January 6th       Witch Hunt Committee is all about.''        Eric Herschmann, a former Trump White House attorney, was       also asked by the Jan. 6 committee in a deposition if Gaetz       was seeking a pardon.        ``Believe so,'' Herschmann said in a video presented at the       hearing. ``The general tone was, `we may get prosecuted       because we were defensive of, you know, the President's       positions on these things.''        Herschmann said that Gaetz's pardon request was ``for any       and all things,'' and that Gaetz had mentioned former       President Richard Nixon's pardon. Herschmann said that       Nixon's pardon was not that broad.        Trump adviser John McEntee also testified that Gaetz told       him he asked Meadows for a pardon.        A spokesman for Gaetz responded to testimony about the       pardon request by pointing to a tweet from Gaetz calling the       committee a ``political sideshow.''     Mr. Speaker, there were at least six House Members who  sought pardons from President Trump following the January 6  insurrection, and many of them would like to be on this committee, we  are told.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Nadler).    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a CNN article  titled: ``There are clear distinctions between Trump and Biden's two  cases.''                     [From CNN Politics, Jan. 10, 2023]         There Are Clear Distinctions Between Trump and Biden's Two       Cases                           (By Stephen Collinson)         Republicans seized on revelations that several classified       documents from Joe Biden's time as vice president were found       in his former private office to create cover for former       President Donald Trump's hoarding of secret records.        The disclosures Monday about the material found last fall       spun up an immediate political storm at a time when Trump is       in increasing legal peril. The new GOP House majority is       meanwhile rushing to undermine investigations against him and       unleashing a wave of counter investigations against the       current president.        But there are clear distinctions between the two cases.        The new controversy so far appears to be on a smaller scale       than the more than 100 classified documents--some bearing the       highest designations of government secrecy--taken from       Trump's resort at Mar-a-Lago after a court-approved search by       FBI agents. And Biden appears to be cooperating with the       National Archives and the Justice Department in a way that       Trump failed to do and unlike the former president he is not       being investigated for possible obstruction of justice.        But Trump, who brands attempts to make him face       accountability for his conduct in office and afterward as       political victimization, sought to capitalize on Biden's       discomfort over the documents in a post on his Truth Social       network.        ``When is the FBI going to raid the many homes of Joe       Biden, perhaps even the White House? These documents were       definitely not declassified,'' he wrote.        New House Oversight Chairman James Comer told CNN: ``This       is (a) further concern that there is a two-tiered justice       system.''        New House Speaker Kevin McCarthy also moved quickly to       respond to the discovery of the documents in an office used       by Biden after he left the vice presidency.        ``Oh, really? They just now found them after all these       years,'' he told CNN. ``What has he said about the other       president having classified documents?''        Attorney General Merrick Garland has asked the US attorney       in Chicago to review the material, some of which bore the       marking ``sensitive compartmentalized information''--showing       that it came from intelligence sources.                          Questions Biden must face         Fairness and respect for the law dictate that Biden should       answer many of the same questions that Trump is facing,       regarding whether he was entitled to the records, why they       were not previously turned over, whether they were securely       stored and how they ended up in his office in the first       place.        Critics will also wonder why Biden didn't immediately       disclose the discovery of less than a dozen documents last       fall to the public, given the huge sensitivity of the Justice       Department probe of Trump on a similar question. And the       president will be sure to face accusations of hypocrisy given       his sharp criticisms that Trump did not take the proper steps       to secure classified documents at Mar-a-Lago.        Still, even if there are adequate answers to these issues,       any distinctions in the severity of the Biden and Trump       documents will be obliterated in the political torrent that       is already stirring and with conservative media likely to       draw false equivalencies between the two cases.        The report offers an immediate opening for Trump as he       seeks to dodge culpability for his behavior and claims he's a       victim of persecution to thwart his 2024 campaign. The former       president is a master at turning one incident into an entire       campaign narrative--as he did with former Democratic nominee       Hillary Clinton's emails in 2016.        And the report will give the new Republican House majority       fresh material as it unleashes a multi-front investigative       assault against the White House. And while there so far       appear to be clear differences in the magnitude of the cases,       the report--first carried by CBS--about Biden will inevitably       raise political pressure on Special Counsel Jack Smith's       investigation into Trump's retention of classified material.        Smith is also now reaching even deeper into the ex-      president's inner circle by subpoenaing his former lawyer       Rudy Giuliani as part of a federal grand jury probe looking       at Trump's fund raising, among other issues related to the       2020 election.                              Garland's dilemma         The Biden document disclosures will also deepen the already       intense political headache facing Garland as he contemplates       an eventual decision on whether to charge Trump, whose status       as an ex-president and an active 2024 candidate carries huge       political implications.        Garland insists that investigations will go where the       evidence and the law demands as he seeks to stress the       independence of the Justice Department--which was perpetually       in question when Trump was president. But now, inevitably and       however the Biden vice presidential documents issue is       resolved, a decision to charge Trump over the classified       documents case but not to take the same action against Biden       would incite political uproar among conservatives who would       be sure to allege double standards.        The former president's legal team issued a temperate       response to the Biden report that sought to broaden openings       that could shield their client. One lawyer said that the       Biden story was ``indicative of a larger problem with trying       to keep track of classified information in the offices of the       President and the VP. There is an over classification       problem, and at the end of an Administration, things get       packed up and moved and it's hard to keep track.''        The lawyer also warned that if Trump were to be charged,       his representatives would demand all communications between       the National Archives and Biden's team on the matter.                             The Biden discovery         Biden's attorneys found the documents in a locked closet in       a private office in Washington the future president used as a       visiting professor with the University of Pennsylvania. The       White House Counsel's office notified the National Archives       and officials at the agency took control of the documents the       morning after they were found. Biden wasn't aware the       documents were in the office until his personal lawyers       reported their existence and remains in the dark of the       content of the material, a source familiar with the matter       told CNN. Federal office holders are required by law to       relinquish official documents and classified documents when       their government service ends.        Unlike in Trump's case, Biden doesn't appear to have tried       to assert ownership of the files, to obstruct their handover       or make outlandish claims that he had previously declassified       them based on an undisclosed private thought.        Trump is being investigated by Smith to see whether he       infringed the Espionage Act by keeping classified material       and for the possible obstruction of justice.         Republicans muster for investigative assault on White House         The Biden documents case will intensify the showdown       already emerging between the new Republican House majority       and the White House.        For two years, Trump has been rocked by blow-after-blow       from congressional and criminal probes over his conduct       during and after his presidency that have nudged him ever       closer to accountability.        But help is on the way.        The new Republican majority in the House is ready to       unleash a vast investigative machine apparently designed to       discredit and distract from Trump's alleged transgressions       and to wound Biden's nascent reelection race.        Such an offensive was always coming, given the extent to       which the deeply conservative House GOP remains in thrall to       the  [[Page H134]]       ex-president. But the intensity, scope and financial muscle       of the investigations was bolstered by the concessions       offered by McCarthy as he caved to right-wing hardliners in       order to win his speakership last week. And it represents a       fast-expanding challenge for the White House, which has       already spent months preparing its defense.        A new House rules package passed on Monday for instance       will set up probes into alleged political bias in agencies       like the FBI and the Justice Department and what Republicans       see as political weaponization of such agencies.        The move cements the GOP's sharp turn away from the FBI,       once seen as one of the most conservative agencies in the US       government following Trump's repeated claims he was illegally       targeted by investigations and his failure to enlist the       bureau as a weapon to advance his political grievances.        Rigorous scrutiny and oversight are inevitable and       desirable as part of the constitutional duty of Congress and       responsibility to ensure accountability with taxpayer money.       And in the first two years of the Biden administration, there       are multiple questions that merit further investigation and       over which the public deserves more clarity.        This includes the chaotic management of the withdrawal from       Afghanistan in 2021, the way that Covid-19 mitigation funds       were spent or the administration's unwillingness at least       until recently to consider the rising numbers of migrants       crossing the southern border as a crisis. Proper oversight       can avoid the repeat of errors and inform better policy in       future.        But as always in Congress, there are questions over when       genuine oversight stops and hyper-partisan politically       motivated witch hunts begin, especially in the case of key       Republicans who have a long record of crossing over the line.        Incoming House Judiciary Chairman Rep Jim Jordan, for       instance, was a leading player in a previous investigation by       a GOP House into the death of US ambassador to Libya Chris       Stevens and three other Americans who were killed by Islamic       militants in Benghazi in 2012.        The two-year GOP-run House probe found a perfect storm of       bureaucratic inertia, rapidly worsening security in Libya and       inadequate resources led up to the killings. But Jordan was       not satisfied when the final report did not bear out       conservative attacks on the conduct of Hillary Clinton--who       was Secretary of State at the time of the deaths.        The Ohio lawmaker released his own far more critical       report, along with then Rep. Mike Pompeo, who later became       Secretary of State himself. And at the time, McCarthy boasted       that the investigation harmed Clinton's 2016 presidential       campaign, apparently revealing partisan motivations behind       the probe.        As well as the building storm over classified documents, a       key focus of the new GOP House majority will be to       investigate the House Select Committee in the previous       Democratic-run House that painted a damning picture of       Trump's behavior following the 2020 election and before the       Capitol insurrection.        The fact that many of the current members of the House       voted to deny certification of Biden's election victory based       on lies about electoral fraud Trump was using to try to steal       power underscores why many observers are raising new       questions about the partisan nature of Republican       investigations.        But after the revelations about documents found in Biden's       office, Republicans know a political gift when they see it.     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the difference is clear. Unlike in Trump's case, Biden  doesn't appear to have tried to assert ownership of the files to  obstruct their handover or make unhinged claims that he had previously  declassified them through his thinking. Trump is being investigated to  see whether he infringed the Espionage Act by keeping classified  material and for the possible obstruction of justice.   I would just say to my colleague who spoke before, the American  people also have expectations of elected officials, such as respecting  the Constitution and respecting free and fair elections and not trying  to overturn free and fair elections. Unfortunately, a majority of my  friends on the other side of the aisle chose to ignore that.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Goldman).                                time  1345     Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record an article from  The Guardian titled: `` `It's going to be dirty': Republicans gear up  for attack on Hunter Biden,'' and an article from Politico titled:  ``It's not just Hunter Biden: Prepare for a 2023 packed with House GOP  investigations.''                     [From the Guardian, Jan. 8, 2023]    `It's Going To Be Dirty': Republicans Gear Up for Attack on Hunter                                   Biden                              (By David Smith)         When Borat--alias British actor Sacha Baron Cohen--told       risque jokes about Donald Trump and antisemitism at last       month's Kennedy Center Honors in Washington, Joe Biden was       not the only one laughing in a red velvet-lined balcony.        Sitting behind the US president was Hunter Biden wearing       black tie and broad smile that mirrored those of his father.        The image captured the intimacy between the men but also       the sometimes awkward status of Hunter as both private       citizen and privileged son of a president. It is a dichotomy       likely to come under a harsh public glare this year as       congressional Republicans set about making Hunter a household       name and staple of the news cycle.        ``The right wing is licking its chops at the chance to go       after him,'' said Joshua Kendall, author of First Dads:       Parenting and Politics from George Washington to Barack       Obama. ``The level of venom is going to be over the top and       really, really dirty. The Republicans' rhetoric might get so       heated that it detracts from some of the actual behaviour.''        Republicans have been waiting a long time for this moment.       After regaining control of the House of Representatives in       last November's midterm elections, they used their first       press conference to promise to investigate the Biden       administration and, in particular, the president's allegedly       errant son.        Hunter has long faced questions about whether he traded on       his father's political career for profit, including efforts       to strike deals in China and reported references in his       emails to the ``big guy''.        Hunter joined the board of the Ukrainian gas company       Burisma in 2014, around the time that Joe Biden, then vice-      president, was helping conduct Barack Obama's foreign policy       with Ukraine. Hunter earned more than $50,000 a month over a       five-year period.        Senate Republicans claim that his appointment may have       posed a conflict of interest. Last year more than 30 of them       called for a prosecutor to be given special counsel authority       to carry out an investigation into alleged ``tax fraud, money       laundering, and foreign-lobbying violations''. But they have       not produced evidence that it influenced US policy or that       Joe Biden engaged in wrongdoing.        House Republicans and their staff have been studying       messages and financial transactions found on a now notorious       laptop that  [[Page H135]]       belonged to Hunter. Having gained the majority, they now have       the power to issue congressional subpoenas to foreign       entities that did business with him.        Richard Painter, who was chief White House ethics lawyer in       the George W Bush administration, believes that Joe Biden       should have recused himself from matters relating to Ukraine.       ``The Ukrainian gas company wanted to curry favour with Joe       Biden so they put his son on the board,'' he said.        ``It's pretty clear what's going on there but the missing       link the Republicans are looking for--but I don't think       they're going to find--is any kind of a quid pro quo, Joe       Biden for the Ukrainian gas company. Still, it would have       been better if Joe Biden had said: `Look, my son is going to       be on this board, maybe the secretary of state or somebody       else could handle Ukraine,' and he'd step aside.''        Hunter's taxes and foreign business work are already under       federal investigation with a grand jury in Delaware hearing       testimony in recent months. There are no indications that       this involves the president, who insists that he has never       spoken to Hunter about his foreign business arrangements.        Republicans are pulling at another strand. Ethics experts       have accused Hunter of cashing in on his father's name as he       pursues a career as an artist. He is represented by the       Georges Berges Gallery in New York, which reportedly struck       an agreement with the White House to set the prices of the       art and not reveal who bid on or bought it.        Berges said in an lnstagram post in November that       Republicans on the House oversight committee had written to       him with ``certain requests'' and subsequently got into a       Twitter debate with Painter about money and influence in art.       Berges wrote: ``If you're going to scrutinize a profession       then scrutinize all of them and every position that children       of Congress take in DC and elsewhere.''        Painter said in an interview: ``I don't think there's       anything corrupt about the White House or anything corrupt       about President Biden. But keeping the identities of the art       buyers secret was a bad idea. It leads to suspicion that       people are passing money under the table. It's hard to keep       who buys the art secret in the close-knit world of Hunter       Biden's friends or Hunter Biden himself so the secrecy was a       bad idea.''        Fox News and other rightwing media may relish an       opportunity to demonise the president's son ahead of an       election in 2024. But Republicans are in danger of overreach.       Trump's attempt to get Ukraine to examine Hunter's business       dealings led to his first impeachment. His efforts to       weaponise Hunter's troubles in the 2020 presidential election       fizzled.        David Brock, a veteran political operative and president of       Facts First USA, a new group set up to combat the       congressional investigations, said: ``What we're going to see       in the hearings is a recycling and a rehash of old       discredited stories and conspiracy theories. They're doing it       for political reasons. [Congressman] Jim Jordan is on the       record saying that the investigations are all about 2024 and       electing Donald Trump again. That's his own words, not       mine.''        Hunter's 2021 memoir, Beautiful Things, generated sympathy       in some quarters for a man who 50 years ago last month       survived a car crash that killed his mother and sister and       who has been honest about his struggle with alcoholism and       drug abuse. Brock believes that a fresh Republican onslaught       will backfire.        ``Going after someone who has an addiction and has had       mental health issues is sadistic politics and I don't think       it will work with the American people,'' he added. ``There       are so many people who have family members who've suffered in       one way or another and will identify with Hunter; they won't       identify with the attackers. The Hunter-hating narrative has       been out there for three years. It hasn't really gained any       traction outside of the far right and I don't think it       will.''        Republicans could also lose credibility by focusing on       Hunter and other retreads of the past instead of advancing a       plan for domestic issues such as inflation, jobs and taxes.        Kurt Bardella, a Democratic strategist who served as a       senior adviser for Republicans on the House oversight       committee from 2009 to 2013, said: ``For all the talk about       Republicans saying they want to return to regular order, they       want to have better stewardship over taxpayer dollars, they       want to act more responsibly with legislative power, well,       OK, but how does investigating Hunter Biden do anything to       help the American people?''                                   ____                        [From Politico, July 19, 2022]   It's Not Just Hunter Biden: Prepare for a 2023 Packed with House GOP                               Investigations                            (By Jordain Carney)         House Republicans are planning to bombard Joe Biden's       administration with investigations next year, from Hunter       Biden to the border to the chaotic U.S. withdrawal from       Afghanistan.        As the GOP prepares for a likely takeover of the chamber       next year, committee chairs-in-waiting have laid out a       lengthy list of oversight goals that goes beyond Biden's       White House--including Democrats' formation of the Jan. 6       select committee. But the party's highest-profile targets are       those with the potential to politically bruise the president       ahead of 2024: his son's business dealings, Afghanistan, the       origins of the coronavirus, inflation causes and the U.S.-      Mexico border.        Months before the midterms, Republican lawmakers are       already working behind the scenes to divvy up which committee       gets which piece of the investigative action next year. That       includes talks with Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and other       conference leaders, plus member-on-member discussions.        ``I've been really impressed with leadership--both from       [Rep.] Jim [Jordan], from [Rep.] Jamie Comer, from Kevin's       office--in already starting to talk about that,'' said Rep.       Kelly Armstrong (R-N.D.).        Republicans view executive-branch oversight as a       significant piece of their 2023 agenda, driven in part by the       reality that divided government would leave no path for most       of their legislative priorities. Investigations also give the       House GOP high-profile chances to lob subpoenas and tough       questions at Biden officials heading into 2024, when it hopes       to take the Senate and White House too.        Republicans still need to nail down the timelines and other       specifics for each investigation, but they've already taken       initial steps such as document preservation requests. Those       have already hit the Jan. 6 panel, administration officials       involved in the Afghanistan withdrawal and Twitter over its       legally challenged sale to Elon Musk, among other recipients.        After four years in the House minority, Republicans have a       backlogged wish list of topics to dig into. Their real       challenge, GOP lawmakers predict, won't be finding areas to       investigate but rather winnowing down their focus.        ``It's not something where we're having to drum up, 'OK,       what are we going to do?' It's more of a limiting factor of,       we only have 50 weeks a year,'' said Rep. Michael Cloud (R-      Texas).        Much of the investigative churn will spin out of the       Oversight Committee, a legislative octopus with       jurisdictional tentacles that can reach into several parts of       the administration.        Jamie Comer, the Kentucky Republican who is expected to       lead the panel should Republicans take the majority, said       that he was trying to lay the groundwork now so that he and       his members could start right away in January.        Republicans on the committee plan to hold high-profile       probes into Hunter Biden's dealings with overseas clients,       but they also want to hone in on eliminating wasteful       government spending in an effort to align the panel with the       GOP's broader agenda. They're also expected to probe the       infant formula shortage and the Food and Drug Administration,       which regulates formula.        ``We're going to spend a lot of time in the first three,       four months having investigation hearings and then we're       going to be very active in the subcommittee process, focused       on substantive waste, fraud and abuse type issues. . . . I'm       going to bring the Oversight Committee back to what its       original intent was,'' Comer said in a brief interview.        Comer said he's already having conversations with the       expected chairs of other committees to avoid duplicating       investigative work, adding that his panel is ``so broad,       sometimes you ruffle feathers with other chairs.''        The U.S.-Mexico border, for example, is expected to be a       hot point for several committees.        Jim Jordan, the Ohio Republican and House Freedom Caucus       founding member who is line to chair the Judiciary Committee,       immediately pointed to Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro       Mayorkas and the border as a focus for his panel in 2023.        ``We certainly need to dig into more of the terrible way       Mayorkas has run--I think intentionally--the way he has the       Department of Homeland Security,'' Jordan said.        Jordan pointed to two potential areas he wanted to probe:       border enforcement and the creation of a DHS       ``disinformation'' board, which the department subsequently       paused after a flood of GOP criticism. Jordan has also been       communicating with Senate Republicans who are brainstorming       their own investigative plans if they are able to flip the       upper chamber this fall.        Republicans are still sorting out how they will probe the       Jan. 6 panel and Capitol security, an area of particular       interest within the conference. Illinois Rep. Rodney Davis,       the current top Republican on the House Administration       Committee, had pledged to use his panel as an investigative       springboard into the select committee next year but recently       lost his primary to Rep. Mary Miller (R-111.).        And some conservatives in the conference are pushing for       investigations into debunked 2020 election fraud claims,       underscoring how embedded former President Donald Trump's       baseless claims to that end have become within the party.        Beyond the headline-grabbing probes, Republicans are       prepping more bread-and-butter oversight hearings that will       give nearly every committee a pathway to dive into government       agencies.        ``Oversight is going to be significant. And we'll have       significant oversight of the Securities and Exchange       Commission, as well as the [Consumer Financial Protection       Bureau],'' said Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), who hopes to       chair the Financial Services Committee.        And while Republicans' legislative dreams would have to       clear a high bar--given Biden's ability to veto anything for       the next two years--they see their oversight goals  [[Page H136]]       dovetailing with their legislative agenda, giving them       another lane to pressure Biden and congressional Democrats.       Investigations have a longer political half-life, spanning       weeks and months beyond a one-time floor vote.        Armstrong pointed to a border security and immigration       reform bill, a decades-long legislative white whale, as a       springboard for Republicans holding oversight hearings on       related areas like fentanyl--potentially building pressure on       Democrats heading into 2024.        ``If you can't get to 60 in the Senate, you can make it a       real issue . . . going into the next election,'' he said.     Mr. Speaker, without a doubt, Mr. Jordan will use this  subcommittee to go after people MAGA extremists see as their opponents.  All the MAGA Republicans seem to want to do is create a forum for  settling scores and pushing conspiracy theories. They are not  interested in governing.   They want to go on FOX. They want to investigate Hunter Biden's  laptop. They want to try to steal elections. They want to shut down the  government if they don't get their way.   We are at a very dangerous moment in this country, and it is one of  the reasons why many of us were so stunned that the new Speaker gave  away so much of his authority to a group of extremists in the  Republican Conference who have spent their entire careers trying to  blow this place up.   The bottom line is this committee is basically an assurance that we  are going to see these very partisan, political, MAGA-driven  investigations go forward.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote  ``no.''   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr.  Grijalva).    Mr. Speaker, here is a curious thing. The legislation  that creates this select committee, we were first given this on January  2. Then, it changed on January 6, and we didn't get that until 10 p.m.  on January 6, after 13 Speaker votes.   What changed in this legislation--and this is really curious--is they  expanded the select committee's authority to investigate ongoing  criminal investigations--think about that--in an unprecedented way.   I don't know how many votes that got, but clearly, it was important  enough because we went through 13 Speaker votes before we got to this.   The reason why this is included, and I am sad to say this, is because  we have Members in this Chamber who themselves may be subjects of  investigation. There are ongoing investigations against the former  President. So, this was added.   Why was this added? To try to frustrate those investigations.   When we talk about corruption, when we talk about undermining the  rule of law, let's understand what just occurred here.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from California  (Mr. Schiff).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Johnson).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Texas.    Mr. Speaker, I would simply say in response to that  that there are oversight committees that are equipped and ready to look  into all the issues that the gentleman just raised, and into all the  conspiracy theories that they want to raise. But they went ahead and  created this additional committee, and there is a reason for it.   This new committee they are creating has the authority to basically  investigate ongoing criminal investigations. It is unprecedented.   In any event, I would remind the gentleman, you have oversight  committees. You are in charge now; you can do whatever you want to do.   But there is a reason for this committee and there is a reason why  after 13 roll call votes for Speakership they added an additional line  giving this committee the authority to look into ongoing  investigations.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, the gentleman just got up and made all  kinds of assertions that things were just said that weren't said. I  don't know what the hell he is talking about.   Mr. Speaker, I will, again, urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' against  the creation of that committee because this is unprecedented. This is a  witch hunt. This is a committee designed basically to protect those  who, quite frankly, are under investigation right now.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1415     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, let me just make this clear for my colleague. A change  was made in this legislation, and it was not just to allow the  committee to investigate ongoing criminal investigations which is quite  nefarious in and of itself.   Originally it was only supposed to be able to have investigative  authority over the Department of Justice, DHS, and the FBI; the CIA and  the IRS were added. This was all done after 13 Speaker votes at 10  o'clock at night clearly in an attempt to win more votes.   The people who are asking for these changes are the same people who  want to investigate the people who are investigating them.   This is really, really unprecedented. I don't know what the hell is  going on here, but this isn't right. This isn't openness, and this  isn't transparency.   My friends talk about corruption. This is corruption. This is  unacceptable. The American people ought to know it, and reasonable  colleagues on the Republican side ought to say no to this.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I would say what the gentleman just said  is terrible, but this committee has absolutely nothing to do with that.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I would just say in response to the  gentleman who said that he hopes that we populate this select committee  with serious Democrats that he populate the committee with Republicans  who did not ask for a pardon and who did not have their phones seized  by the FBI.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record an article from  The Hill titled: ``Perry won't agree to stay off new House committee  investigating January 6 probes.''                       [From The Hill, Jan. 8, 2023]  Perry Won't Agree To Stay Off New House Committee Investigating Jan. 6                                   Probes                             (By Julia Mueller)         Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) on Sunday wouldn't pledge to stay       off the possible new House committee that would investigate       probes into the Jan. 6, 2021, attack at the U.S. Capitol       despite being a subject of a Department of Justice (DOJ)       inquiry into the matter.        ``Why should I be limited--why should anybody be limited--      just because someone has made an accusation? Everybody in       America is innocent until proven guilty,'' Perry said on       ABC's ``This Week.''        Host George Stephanopoulos pressed Perry, asking, ``Doesn't       that pose a conflict to you, since you're also part of the       investigation?''        ``So, should everybody in Congress that disagrees with       somebody be barred from doing the oversight and investigative       powers that Congress has? That's our charge. And again,       that's appropriate for every single member, regardless of       what accusations are made. I get accused of things every       single day, as does every member that serves in the public       eye,'' Perry countered.        Newly elected Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) has       indicated the Republican majority just sworn in plans to       review the work of the House select committee that last year       probed Jan. 6 and look into the federal investigations.        DOJ investigations seized Perry's phone in connection with       the rioting, and obtained email exchanges between Perry and       former Trump attorney John Eastman, among others.        Perry also introduced former President Trump to Jeffrey       Clark, whom Trump considered appointing as attorney general       in order to propagate his claims of election fraud during the       2020 presidential contest.     Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, the American people want us to roll up our sleeves and  get to work. They want us to make progress and deliver results that  help them in their day-to-day lives.   They don't need Congress to bend and break to the will of MAGA  extremists, and they definitely don't need us to push crazy conspiracy  theories and go on witch hunts to settle political scores.   My friends in their rules package gutted the Office of Congressional  Ethics, and here they are with this new subcommittee which threatens  our safety, our security, and our freedom.   It is an unprecedented attack on our Nation's law enforcement  agencies, our justice system, and our intelligence community.   Mr. Speaker, I would just say to my colleagues who spoke before about  the intelligence oversight, we have an entire Select Committee on  Intelligence that has oversight responsibilities on those matters. I am  sorry the gentleman who spoke doesn't have confidence in whom the  Republicans are going to propose as chair.   This committee is deranged. It is a bad idea, and it will go down in  history as one of the worst committees that a Congress has ever put  forward. It will be in the same category as the Joseph McCarthy  Committee on Un-American Activities or the Benghazi Committee which now  Speaker McCarthy admitted was an attempt to try to take down Secretary  Clinton.   But here is the deal, and here is what it is all about: There are six  on the other side of the aisle who asked for a pardon from President  Trump. They did his dirty work, but Trump left them hanging. He did not  give them a pardon. So now they are effectively trying to pardon  themselves with the creation of this select committee.   This is unconscionable. It is so blatant. Again, the changes that  were made to give them the ability to pardon themselves were done after  the 13th Speaker vote in the dead of night to try to win their votes  over.   This is not the way this Congress should run. This is not the way  Republicans or Democrats, or any majority should behave. People should  be ashamed of themselves that this is in the rules package and that  this is what my friends are pushing right now.   We are better than this. We should not be going down this road. My  friends said that they want to combat inflation and that they want to  make the lives of the American people better. Let's focus on those  things. Let's focus on areas that actually improve the lives of the  American people. This is a colossal waste of time. But even worse, it  is to me the epitome of what corruption is all about.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
