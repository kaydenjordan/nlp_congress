 Mr. Chair, I will vote today in support of  H.R. 268, the Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2019. Americans have a  long history of helping each other in times of emergency and this bill,  in that American spirit, provides needed funding to help families and  businesses recover from natural disasters.   That said, I am concerned that the bill, in many respects, is a stop- gap measure that defers action on bigger problems. Our disaster funding  protocols have historically been predicated on the idea that, when  American citizens' face a loss of property due to a rare and  unpredictable event, we have a moral obligation to help them rebuild.  That is a noble and righteous goal and consistent with this bill.   However, we must also begin to face up to the fact that climate  change is creating a situation where disasters are no longer rare, nor  unpredictable. We know with certainty where flood risk is intensifying  in low-lying coastal regions. We know with certainty where the risks of  wildfires are growing.   A review by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration of  $1-billion-plus  [[Page H639]]  weather and climate disasters proves the point--such disasters are  increasing in frequency and concentrated in very specific regions of  the country.   To continue to provide federal funds to encourage rebuilding in those  areas is ultimately unsustainable. At some point, those funds will have  to be diverted to development on less disaster-prone grounds. That is  scary and unfortunate, but we cannot ignore that reality. It is my hope  that, as a body, we can begin to develop the strategies to redirect  those funds on our terms rather than being compelled to do so by fiscal  or natural events.
