General Leave     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  that all Members be given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks.    Madam Speaker, today, the Rules Committee  met and reported a rule, House Resolution 233, providing for  consideration of H.R. 1620 under a structured rule. The rule self- executes a manager's amendment by Chairman Nadler, makes in order 41  amendments, and provides en bloc authority to Chairman Nadler.                                time  1645    The rule also provides for consideration of H.R. 6, H.R. 1603, and  H.J. Res. 17, under closed rules.   The rule provides 1 hour of debate each, equally divided and  controlled by the chair and ranking member of the Committee on the  Judiciary or their designees for H.R. 1620, H.R. 6, H.R. 1603, and H.J.  Res. 17.   The rule provides for one motion to recommit on each bill. The rule  also self-executes a manager's amendment by Chairman Nadler for H.R.  1603.   The rule provides for consideration of H.R. 1868 under a closed rule.  It also provides 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the  chair and ranking member of the Committee on the Budget or their  designees.   Finally, the rule provides that H.R. 232 is hereby adopted and  extends the deadline for the committee funding resolution until April  22, 2021.   Madam Speaker, we are here today to protect the vulnerable among us,  to strengthen the foundation of our democracy, and ensure humane  working conditions for the people who feed America.   We are here to live up to our best ideals as a Nation by creating  protections against some of the worst threats that a person can face,  threats like domestic violence.   In the minute that I have been talking, 20 people in this country  have been abused by their partner. By the time we are done tonight,  that number will be over a thousand.   As someone who worked as a 911 dispatcher for nearly 18 years, as  someone who has been on the other end of the line from domestic  violence, as someone who has heard gunshots silence a young girl's  screams for help, I am telling you, the thousand people victimized  while we are here tonight need and deserve our help.   That is exactly what the Violence Against Women Act does. It makes  vital new investments in prevention. It strengthens essential  protections for the most vulnerable among us, including immigrant,  LGBTQ, and Native American women, and it improves services for victims,  prevents abusers and stalkers from getting firearms, and much, much  more.   VAWA is one of many vital protections we will discuss today, but it  isn't the only one.   Madam Speaker, this September will mark 100 years since an amendment  was first proposed for our Constitution to guarantee women equal rights  with men. It finally passed Congress in 1972.   This simple amendment, which reads in part, ``Equality of rights  under the law shall not be denied or abridged,'' is being held up on a  technicality. States took so long to sign on that the arbitrary  deadline that was set by Congress, this body, has passed, even as 38  States have ratified the amendment.   Congress created this problem, and Congress must fix it. H.J. Res. 79  will remove the deadline for ratification and finally allow us to  ensure women are treated as equals to men in our democracy.   The need for equal rights under the law is not debatable. Too often,  we have seen the results of unfair and unequal policies for women. This  bill will help end those injustices.   As we strive to make our Nation a more perfect union, we need to  consider how we treat immigrants, too. Immigrants are the invisible  backbone of this country. They are our family members, our neighbors,  our frontline workers, woven into every aspect of the American fabric.   Dreamers grew up in our communities. They pledge allegiance to our  flag. They played in our fields, prayed in our churches, and worked in  our stores. They want to contribute to the only Nation that they have  ever called home.   The American Dream and Promise Act helps them do that. It creates a  pathway to citizenship for our Dreamers. And it updates our temporary  protected status and deferred enforced departure laws to prevent  devastating deportations.   The fact is, too often the contributions of aspiring Americans are  left out of our dialogue about immigrants. But this pandemic has put a  spotlight on just how vital they are.   Without immigrants working our fields, your last meal would have  looked much different. Without them enduring record-setting  temperatures, facing threats of wildfires, and doing it all without  proper PPE, the price you pay to feed your family would go way up.  [[Page H1395]]    Deaths among Latino farmworkers increased by 60 percent during the  pandemic. They are sacrificing their lives to feed us. The question is:  What are we willing to do in return?   The Farm Workforce Modernization Act creates a pathway to legal  status for more than a million farmworkers and addresses our future  labor needs by modernizing our outdated system for temporary workers.  This bill will give farmworkers the dignity and recognition they  deserve, while giving our farmers the stability they need to run their  businesses.   Now, before I move on to another topic, I want to say something about  my personal immigration story. Just like many other Dreamers, I was  sent here by my parents to escape the violence my family faced in  Guatemala. I know exactly what it is like to decide between the  violence and poverty of staying or the dangers and unknowns of trying  to immigrate here.   What I know is that we cannot legislate a solution for immigration  when we ignore the factors that drive it. Strongmen, narco-traffickers,  have taken hold in Central America, and the rule of law is under  assault.   The organizations that once fought to hold corrupt actors accountable  have been dismantled, and their former employees are now being pursued  by those very same corrupt actors. Attorneys General, unfortunately,  are asylum seekers in our own country.   We don't just have a responsibility to help stabilize the region; it  is imperative if we are ever to stop the rush of people trying to come  here.   I will close by saying every policy I describe today is a policy I am  truly proud of. Just like the American Rescue Plan did last week,  Democrats are making clear, with our actions, exactly what our  priorities are.    It doesn't matter how good our agenda is if we can't deliver on the  bills we pass. The one thing standing in our way right now is an  inside-the-beltway term called ``PAYGO.'' If we don't address it now,  it will trigger massive cuts. It goes without saying that this would be  completely unacceptable at a time when Americans are in urgent need of  more support, not less.   Republicans passed legislation in 2017 to avoid PAYGO, in order to  provide tax cuts for the filthy rich, so they clearly understand the  need to avoid draconian cuts. I expect them to join us in preventing  them.   H.R. 1868, the final bill we are here to discuss today, will do  exactly that. I look forward to a fruitful debate on these bills.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 1  minute to the gentlewoman from Texas.    Madam Speaker, let the Record show that  Oklahoma's Fourth District has 146,168 eligible Medicare beneficiaries  that will be harmed if H.R. 1868 does not pass.   Let the Record show that Minnesota's Seventh District has 152,451  eligible Medicare beneficiaries that will also be harmed if H.R. 1868  does not pass.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record an October 18, 2019, USA Today  article entitled, ``1 in 3 American Indian and Alaska Native women will  be raped, but survivors rarely find justice on tribal lands.''                      [From USA TODAY, Oct. 18, 2019]     1 in 3 American Indian and Alaska Native Women Will Be Raped, But               Survivors Rarely Find Justice on Tribal Lands   (By Maren Machles, Carrie Cochran, Angela M. Hill and Suzette Brewer)         Twila Szymanski lowered the scope on her rifle, took aim       and hit a target in the distance. The shooting range is where       she and her husband go to relax and forget the things they       worry about, she said.        Some experiences are hard to shake.        ``To trust somebody you know after a sexual assault happens       . . . it has been so difficult to work through that,''       Szymanski said.        Szymanski, 40, has lived on the Fort Peck Reservation in       northeast Montana since she was born and is an enrolled       member of the Fort Peck Assiniboine and Sioux tribes. She       said she's been assaulted three times.        ``I was a victim when I was 13, a victim when I was 14 and       a victim when I was 34,'' she said.        Twila Szymanski is a lifelong resident of the Fort Peck       Reservation. ``Native women have told me that what you do       when you raise a daughter in this environment is you prepare       her for what to do when she's raped--not if, but when,'' said       Sarah Deer, University of Kansas professor and author of       ``The Beginning and End of Rape: Confronting Sexual Violence       in Native America.''        More than half of American Indian and Alaska Native women       will experience sexual violence in their lifetimes, according       to the Department of Justice.        ``You talk to Native women who have lived their whole lives       on a reservation, and they say, `I can't think of anyone, any       woman that I know who hasn't been victimized in this way,' ''       said Deer, a citizen of the Muscogee (Creek) Nation of       Oklahoma.  [[Page H1397]]         National data on sex crimes in tribal communities is       scarce, so Newsy spent 18 months focused on two reservations:       the Fort Peck Reservation in Montana and the Fort Berthold       Reservation in North Dakota. After analyzing exclusively       obtained documents and conducting dozens of interviews, a       stark picture emerged.        Sexual assault investigations can fall through the cracks       when tribes and the federal government fail to work together.       Even for those few cases that end in a conviction in tribal       court, federal law prevents most courts from sentencing       perpetrators to more than a year.        Survivors who come forward to report assaults often find       themselves trapped in small communities with their       perpetrators, and several said the broken legal system       contributed to their trauma.        The federal government has a unique political and legal       relationship with the 573 federally recognized tribes. The       tribes are sovereign and have jurisdiction over their       citizens and land, but the federal government has a treaty       obligation to help protect the lives of tribal members. This       legal doctrine, called the ``trust responsibility,'' goes       back to the treaties the United States signed with tribal       nations in the 18th and 19th centuries.        The array of Supreme Court decisions and federal laws that       followed resulted in a complicated legal arrangement among       federal, state and tribal jurisdictions, making it difficult       for survivors of sexual assault to find justice.        Sarah Deer is author of ``The Beginning and End of Rape:       Confronting Sexual Violence in Native America.'' ``A lot of       times, when I try to explain it, people don't even believe me       because it's so bizarre,'' Deer said. ``And the reason it's       bizarre is because there's been this patchwork of laws that       don't talk to each other over the last century.''                                Only one year         The tribal courthouse on the Fort Peck reservation is a       small brick building. The front desk is lined with pamphlets       about dating violence and sexual assault.        ``The trauma that has developed over the generations . . .       some of the assaults are generational, and they're within the       same home,'' said Chief Judge Stacie Smith, a member of the       Fort Peck Assiniboine and Sioux tribes. ``Pretend it wasn't       there, and maybe it'll go away, you know, the next       generation, it won't happen again. But it continues.''        Smith wants to break the cycle, but tribal courts face       major restrictions, including a one-year limit on sentences       regardless of the crime and almost no jurisdiction over non-      Indians.        Stacie Smith is chief judge of the Fort Peck Tribal Court.       ``When you think about rape and you think about somebody who       is a perpetrator of that kind of crime, and you think, `What       do they deserve?' one year doesn't usually sound like the       right answer,'' Deer said.        In 2010, the sentencing cap was expanded to three years per       offense through the Tribal Law and Order Act as long as the       tribes met certain requirements. Only 16 tribes have       implemented the three-year sentencing enhancement.        Fort Peck is one of them.        When the law took effect, there were no attorneys, no one       with a law degree in the court system.        Smith decided to leave her young daughters to attend law       school hundreds of miles away. This would help the tribal       court meet the federal requirements and give it more       authority.        The tribal court was able to hand out three-year sentences       starting in late 2012. From 2013-2018, there were three       sexual assault convictions, but none of them had enhanced       sentences. The longest sentence was still one year.        ``We use the enhanced sentencing sparingly because we want       it to have meaning,'' said Scott Seifert, a member of the       Comanche Nation of Oklahoma and Fort Peck's lead tribal       prosecutor.                                Going federal         Tribal court is not the only option for those seeking       justice for sexual assault. In most cases, the FBI, Bureau of       lndian Affairs (BIA) and U.S. attorneys' offices are       federally mandated to work with the tribes to investigate and       prosecute ``major crimes,'' which include sexual assault.        ``So if you have a rape case or a child sex abuse case and       you do want to see that perpetrator put away, the best       possibility for you is that it will go federal,'' Deer said.        That responsibility falls to the U.S. attorneys' offices,       which have seen their funding and staffing in Indian       communities cut by more than 40% in the past seven years,       according to the Department of Justice.        Data Newsy obtained from the DOJ shows that the Montana       U.S. Attorney's Office declined 64% of cases of sexual       assault in the past four fiscal years.        Kurt Alme is the U.S. attorney for Montana. The U.S.       attorney for Montana, Kurt Alme, said a lot of cases are       declined because of weak or insufficient evidence, ``and it       is something that has to be worked on,'' he said.        According to the BIA, tribal courts received less than 5%       of the funding that was needed in 2016. Law enforcement       received 22% of what was needed, and jails received less than       50%.        Less than half of the law enforcement agencies that the       bureau funds and oversees are properly staffed, said Charles       Addington, director of the BIA Office of Justice Service and       a member of the Cherokee Nation.        In August 2018, Fort Peck tribal police had funding for 21       positions, but nine of them were vacant, said Ken Trottier,       criminal investigations supervisor for the Fort Peck Tribes       and a member of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa.        ``We have a hiring pool that is literally nothing here on       the reservation, even though we open it up to off-reservation       people,'' he said. ``There's no houses for sale. No houses       for rent. Where's that person going to live?''        Constant turnover and understaffing can lead to an under       trained police department, Deer said.        ``[The survivor is] waiting for help. They don't know if       help is coming. They don't know if the help is going to be       compassionate and trained,'' Deer said. ``The system is not       feeling like a safe, productive system to them anymore.''        Big money but little justice Three hours east of Fort Peck,       the Fort Berthold Reservation in North Dakota sits on the       Bakken oil basin and has an annual budget of $400 million.       The reservation is home to the Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara       Nation, or the Three Affiliated Tribes.        Driving around the remote reservation, council member       Monica Mayer pointed to a multimillion-dollar housing project       that she said will soon have an aquatic center, baseball       diamonds and mini golf.        A $17 million public safety and judicial center was built,       and staffing increased in the court system. In the past three       years, the reservation has hired more than a dozen additional       officers to help an understaffed police department.        Monica Mayer is a tribal council member on the Fort       Berthold Reservation. Despite this financial independence,       the justice system appears to be failing sexual assault       survivors who report.        ``At every level, we are not adequately functioning to       provide the services that are needed in a critical       situation,'' Mayer said.        The Fort Berthold tribal court does not have enhanced       sentencing. The court sentenced three people for sexual       assault from 2013 to mid-2018, according to court records.       Sentences ranged from eight days to six months.        The tribes' relationship with its federal partners--the       BIA, the FBI and the U.S. attorneys--is crucial to helping       survivors get justice. Based on interviews and records       obtained from federal and tribal agencies, it's unclear       whether all sexual assaults on Fort Berthold were fully       investigated by any agency in the past six years.        The tribes are supposed to refer every major crime to       either the BIA or the FBI for investigations. Both are       charged with overseeing all major criminal investigations on       Fort Berthold and will determine which agency takes the lead.        The tribal criminal investigators had records of 66 sexual       assault cases from January 2016 to September 2018. The BIA       had records of only 10 investigations during that same time       period. The FBI declined to provide any records.        After Newsy asked about the status of these cases, Three       Affiliated Tribes Police Capt. Grace Her Many Horses, a       member of the Oglala Sioux tribe from the Pine Ridge       Reservation, said she would do a case file review.        ``The priority for me, right now, is to go through those       case files to find out what's been declined, why, and is       there anything we can do to make it happen,'' she said. ``I       guess part of that is on me, too. I should know this by       now.''        Her Many Horses said she finished the case file review       nearly a year later, but she did not provide the details of       what she found, nor did she disclose whether the police       referred all 66 cases up to their federal partners.        Exactly one week after Newsy's last trip to Fort Berthold,       during which reporters asked how sexual assaults and rapes       are handled on the reservation, the Department of Justice and       the BIA released a joint statement saying, ``A number of       concerns have been raised about public safety and criminal       investigations on the Fort Berthold Reservation.''        Citing ``the high rate of violence against women and       children,'' it said the BIA was increasing the number of       special agents from ``one to two.'' As of the start of       October, no second agent had started working on Fort       Berthold.        The U.S. Commission on Civil Rights issued two reports on       funding in Indian communities, one in 2003 and an update in       December 2018, called ``Broken Promises.'' The report said,       ``The federal government continues to fail to support       adequately the social and economic well-being of Native       Americans,'' and this ``contributes to the inequities       observed in Native American communities.''                         Trying to make a difference         Twila Szymanski works as the deputy court administrator for       the Fort Peck Tribal Court, maintaining records and stats.        Szymanski reported only one of her three assaults--the one       when she was 14. Her case made it into federal court.        The defendant pleaded guilty in 1995. He was sentenced to       three years' probation and no prison time.        Twila Szymanski is the deputy court administrator for the       Fort Peck Tribal Court. ``Justice wasn't served, in my       opinion,'' she said. ``He was back in the community quickly,       and I had to see him when this was all fresh.''  [[Page H1398]]         Szymanski is confronted with the memory of what happened to       her each time a case comes up and each time she sees her       perpetrator in the community.        She said she uses her position in the court to go through       cases and stop them from dropping through the cracks, and she       is running for Fort Peck associate judge in the election this       month.        ``When the system has failed you time and time and time       again, you don't feel empowered,'' Deer said. ``It feels like       a disconnect between this moment of `Me Too' and the reality       of lndian country and sexual assault.''    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, the situation at the border  has nothing to do with the Dream and Promise Act. If anything, former  President Trump's attempt to eliminate all resources contributed to the  crisis at the border. The Dream and Promise Act does not apply to  future migrants, just those who were already in the country before  2021.   This Dream and Promise Act has a very high criminal bar. An applicant  is disqualified if they have any one of the following: A felony  conviction, one misdemeanor conviction involving moral turpitude, more  than two misdemeanors, or one misdemeanor for domestic violence.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, my colleagues across the  aisle are not supportive of provisions to protect LGBTQ-plus  individuals in this bill, but LGBTQ-plus members of our community  experience domestic violence, too. Abusers do not discriminate based on  sexual orientation, and neither should this body.   Legislators who oppose equality are trying to turn this into a debate  about abortion to distract from the issue at hand. I would like to  clarify that the ERA doesn't include any requirement to provide  specific healthcare services, including abortion. It is about equality  under the law.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a  March 16 USA Today opinion piece from activists Dolores Huerta, Carol  Jenkins, and Eleanor Smeal titled ``There is no deadline on women's  equality. Add the equal rights amendment to the Constitution.''                      [From USA TODAY, March 16, 2021]  There's No Deadline on Women's Equality. Add the Equal Rights Amendment                            to the Constitution.            (By Dolores Huerta, Carol Jenkins and Eleanor Smeal)         For the second time in a century, a global pandemic has       occurred at the height of a determined movement to expand       women's rights under the U.S. Constitution. The 1918 flu       pandemic nearly halted the drive for ratification of the 19th       Amendment on women's suffrage. But advocates rallied, lobbied       President Woodrow Wilson for support and urged Congress to       pass a joint resolution adopting the amendment. That was       followed by ratification by the states and final       certification in August 1920.        Today, the campaign for ratification of the Equal Rights       Amendment is in the middle of another global pandemic with       women losing jobs at a much higher rate than men, especially       affecting women of color. In these first 100 days of the       Biden-Harris administration and during Women's History Month,       there is a real opportunity to make constitutional history       again with lasting change for women's rights and gender       equality by adding the ERA to the Constitution.        No rights denied 'on account of sex'        Congress approved the ERA in 1972. It says, very simply,       that ``equality of rights under the law shall not be denied       or abridged by the United States or any state on account of       sex.''        President Joe Biden and Congress now have the opportunity       to rally as well. This week, the House of Representatives       will consider a joint resolution clearing the way for the ERA       to be added to the Constitution. If the Senate also adopts       the resolution, it could become part of the Constitution this       year.        The ERA won ratification by the necessary three-fourths of       the states when Virginia became the 38th state last year.       Earlier, Nevada ratified in 2017 and Illinois in 2018.       However, the ERA has yet to be formally enshrined into the       Constitution because of an arbitrary timeline in the       amendment's preamble--not the legislative text sent to the       states for approval--which set 1979 for ratification.       Congress changed the timeline by extending it to 1982.        Congress can again weigh in by removing the timeline and       recognizing the final three states, because Article V of the       Constitution puts the amending process with the Congress and       ratification with the states.        Button supporting the Equal Rights Amendment on April 2,       2013, in Little Rock, Arkansas. Congressional action is       needed to support the attorneys general of Virginia, Nevada       and Illinois, who went to federal court asking the national       archivist to include the ERA in the Constitution.        But a U.S. district judge ruled this month that the three       states did not have standing to bring the case, and the 1982       deadline remains in effect.        Now is the time for Congress to recognize there can be no       time limit on equality. The  [[Page H1400]]       House and Senate should approve a joint resolution ``removing       the deadline for the ratification of the equal rights       amendment.'' The measure, introduced in the House in January,       already has more than 200 co-sponsors.        The vast majority of Americans across demographic and       partisan lines agree that women should have equal rights with       men in this country. In a 2020 Pew Research Center survey,       more than 9 in 10 U.S. adults said it is very important (79%)       or somewhat important (18%). Fully 78% of U.S. adults--      including majorities of women, men, Republicans and       Democrats--favored adding the ERA to the Constitution.        `All men would be tyrants if they could'        Abigail Adams is often quoted as saying, ``Remember the       Ladies.'' In March of 1776, she wrote more than these three       words to her husband, John, just months before the       Declaration of Independence was adopted and as he was engaged       in drafting the U.S. Constitution. She had some ideas about       what should be included ``in the new code of laws' he was       making: ``I desire you would remember the ladies and be more       generous and favorable to them than your ancestors. . . .       Remember, all men would be tyrants if they could. If       particular care and attention is not paid to the ladies, we       are determined to formant a rebellion, and will not hold       ourselves bound by any laws in which we have no voice or       representation.''        That rebellion has been taking place through the hundreds       of peaceful ERA marches and rallies that led up to the 2017       Women's March, events that galvanized millions of women and       men nationwide to new levels of political activism. The       #MeToo movement sparked public outrage over sexual assault       and misogyny in the workplace.        In 2020, women again far outnumbered men as voters with a       gender gap that has become decisive in presidential, Senate       and House elections. And women and men alike supported the       Equal Rights Amendment by electing a pro-ERA majority of       members in the House and Senate.        An estimated 1 million more women than men have lost their       jobs during the COVID-19 lockdowns, and the pandemic shows       that most essential workers are women, most of them are Black       and Latina, and most still have the majority of caregiving       responsibilities. These along with other economic realities       make constitutional rights for women more urgent than ever       before.        The pandemic has sparked a reexamination of the role of       government and the need for social safety net and economic       policies that work for all. In short, the new reality of 2021       demands that Congress approve the ERA resolution. It will       mark a historic commitment to women's rights by ensuring       equality under the law for current and future generations.    Madam Speaker, COVID's impact on women  shows the continued need for equality. We have the power to remove the  ERA ratification deadline and make it a reality.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, President Biden inherited a  dismantled and gutted immigration system. The prior administration's  strategy of cruelty, chaos, and confusion was ineffective and set the  stage for our current challenges.   I include in the Record a March 15 Columbus Dispatch article titled  ``Undocumented immigrants pay billions in taxes each year--and have  been for 25 years.''                [From the Columbus Dispatch, Mar. 15, 2021]  Undocumented Immigrants Pay Billions in Taxes Each Year--and Have Been                                for 25 Years                              (By Danae King)         Every year, Arturo pays thousands of dollars in taxes from       the revenue produced by his central Ohio-based painting       company.        But he will never receive Social Security benefits. Or       Medicare. Or Medicaid.        That's because Arturo, whose last name is not being used       for his safety, is an undocumented immigrant from Mexico--one       of about 6 million who pay taxes annually, according to the       Congressional Budget Office.        Jorge Beltran is a Columbus tax preparer who is certified       by the IRS to file taxes for undocumented immigrants. He       hopes to shatter misconceptions about immigrants not paying       taxes and being drains on society.        A report from the office shows that 50% to 75% of       undocumented immigrants pay billions in taxes each year--and       have been since the Internal Revenue Service created a       program 25 years ago allowing people without a Social       Security number to file taxes.        When it comes to state and local taxes, undocumented       immigrants pay more than $11 billion a year, according to a       2017 report from the Institute on Taxation and Economic       Policy, a nonpartisan nonprofit based in Washington, D.C. In       Ohio, they paid $83.2 million in state and local taxes in       2017, according to the institute.        Jorge Beltran, left, reviews tax documents with client Ana       Narciso. Beltran is a Columbus tax preparer who is certified       by the IRS to file taxes for undocumented immigrants. He       hopes to shatter misconceptions about immigrants not paying       taxes and being drains on society. Narciso has legal status       to be in the United States.        ``When you hear people who are citizens--who may be against       immigration or immigrants, especially undocumented--say, `Oh,       they're here and sucking up all the government resources and       taking handouts and  [[Page H1401]]       welfare.' That's not the case,'' said Jessica Rodriguez Bell,       a Columbus immigration attorney who has undocumented clients.        ``These people are not eligible for those benefits, and       many times they're paying into the system like we are. It's       frustrating to hear that a lot.''        Still, many attorneys recommend their undocumented clients       pay taxes, Rodriguez Bell said.        ``The reason for that is that, one, it's income they've       been paying in and are likely entitled to a refund of some       sort,'' Rodriguez Bell said. ``Then, also because in the       future, even if they don't have a current immigration case       pending or even if they're not eligible for relief at this       time . . . oftentimes you want to demonstrate good moral       character and that you've been an upstanding citizen while       you've been here.''        Years of tax returns also establish that a person has been       living in the United States, she said.        To some, though, the issue is not whether or not       undocumented immigrants pay taxes, said Mark Krikorian,       executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a       Washington, D.C.-based conservative think tank.        ``There's this sort of implicit assumption that if you pay       your taxes everything else is fine,'' he said. ``Paying your       taxes doesn't wipe away everything else that you've done.''        Krikorian said that the real question is what is the       balance of taxes undocumented immigrants pay versus the       services they consume.        ``There's no real debate about less-skilled workers,'' he       said. ``Whether they're legal or illegal, they use more in       services than they pay in taxes.''        A 2010 report from another Washington, D.C., think tank,       the Brookings Institution, however, suggests that while U.S.-      citizen children of undocumented immigrants can be costly       when they're young, those costs are paid out through a       lifetime of taxes.        The mere act of filing taxes could be seen as a risk for       undocumented immigrants because it could result in the       federal government pursing legal action to return the       immigrants to their home country. But Rodriguez-Bell said she       hasn't seen any such negative consequences.        ``The IRS is a separate department, so it's not something       where we've ever seen information exchanged between the IRS       and, say, ICE,'' she said, referring to Immigration and       Customs Enforcement. ``This is not something that's going to       get you in trouble, and you're not doing something illegal by       doing that. It can only help your situation in the future if       you are filing.''        In 1996, the IRS created the Individual Taxpayer       Identification Number (ITIN) to allow people working in the       United States without Social Security numbers to pay taxes.       It is a 9-digit number, the same length as a Social Security       number, issued only to those who are not eligible for Social       Security numbers.        In order to help undocumented immigrants get a tax ID       number and file, the IRS certifies what are called acceptance       agents. There are 13 in Columbus, 79 in Ohio and more than       5,000 nationwide.        Jorge Beltran, the owner of Belmont Services LLC, a tax       preparation company on Columbus' Northwest Side, has been a       certified acceptance agent with the IRS since 2008. The vast       majority of Beltran's clients are undocumented immigrants,       and he's passionate about letting people know that they pay       taxes.        ``Imagine if more people knew this,'' Beltran said. ``These       are not people asking for a handout. They're not asking for       unemployment. They're not asking for any benefits. Even if       they wanted to, they couldn't.''        Consider his clients Javier and Norma--whose first names       only are being used, as with other undocumented immigrants in       this story, for their safety--who both worked in food service       before the pandemic. In March 2020, Javier got laid off but       had no access to unemployment or COVID-19 relief payments due       to his status. Over the course of the rest of the year, he       worked six different jobs to support his family, which       includes their three U.S.-born children.        The couple made $56,369 in 2020 and got a refund of $3,337,       which made a big difference in their lives, Beltran said,       possibly paying for five months of their rent. If they had       Social Security numbers, they could've gotten $6,900 in       federal COVID relief payments in 2020 to help support their       family, Beltran said.        ``They contribute to all of our communities,'' he said.       ``They pay the school system from their taxes. They pay for       the roads from their taxes, and they spend money they make in       the grocery stores and movie theaters and everywhere but       nobody knows about it.''        Beltran shared the story of another two of his clients,       Cirilo and Patricia, who live in Mount Vernon and have been       in the country for almost 20 years. Cirilo works two jobs as       a cook, but only made $26,784 last year, paying $3,706 in       taxes. His earnings had to support his six children--four of       whom have Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA)       status, allowing them to work and go to school legally, and       two of whom were born in the United States.        Nicole, who owns a painting business with her undocumented       immigrant husband, Arturo, both pose for a portrait on       Friday, March 12, 2021. Undocumented immigrants pay taxes and       own businesses that employ people and help the local economy.        Arturo and his wife, Nicole, a U.S. citizen whose family is       from Mexico and who owns their painting company with him, are       Beltran's clients as well. They employ 47 people and paid       $118,250 in estimated taxes this year, according to Beltran.        ``Talk about being productive members of society,'' he       said. ``Forty-seven people can feed their families, help pay       the schools, whatever, with the employment they have and       that's generated by this company.        More than $11,000 from the family's taxes went to the city       of Columbus.        The couple started their business after Arturo got injured       in his job as a butcher and was fired. He started working for       a friend as a painter, but had always dreamed of working for       himself and owning a business. So, with the help of a friend,       they started their own business six years ago and now support       themselves and their four children.        ``He comes from nothing in Mexico. His parents are farmers,       and he has just a middle school, almost high school       education,'' Nicole said, of her husband. ``It was really       important for him not to be stuck. He came to the United       States to make something for himself, to provide a better       future for his children.''        Immigrants are here to make the country better, Nicole       said.        ``This is what makes America great,'' she said.       ``immigrants coming here and finding their way and helping       the country prosper, too.''    Madam Speaker, during the last 4 years,  millions of immigrants faced uncertainty as the Trump administration  pursued cruel immigration policies. With passage of H.R. 6, we are  beginning a new chapter in our Nation's immigration policy.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a  statement by Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro N.  Mayorkas in which he states the many issues associated with the  southern border and what we are doing to address those issues.   For example, Border Patrol facilities and border personnel that had  not had complete access to a COVID-19 vaccine now have complete access  to the vaccine. It talks about the disruptions of the previous  administration and their lack of commitment to deal with tender-age  children and many other issues that could help inform this conversation  moving forward.       [From the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Mar. 16, 2021]      Statement by Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro N. Mayorkas              Regarding the Situation at the Southwest Border         There is understandably a great deal of attention currently       focused on the southwest border. I want to share the facts,       the work that we in the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)       and across the government are doing, and our plan of action.       Our personnel remain steadfast in devotion of their talent       and efforts in the service of our nation.        The situation at the southwest border is difficult. We are       working around the clock to manage it and we will continue to       do so. That is our job. We are making progress and we are       executing on our plan. It will take time and we will not       waver in our commitment to succeed.        We will also not waver in our values and our principles as       a Nation. Our goal is a safe, legal, and orderly immigration       system that is based on our bedrock priorities: to keep our       borders secure, address the plight of children as the law       requires, and enable families to be together. As noted by the       President in his Executive Order, ``securing our borders does       not require us to ignore the humanity of those who seek to       cross them.'' We are both a nation of laws and a nation of       immigrants. That is one of our proudest traditions.                                  The Facts         We are on pace to encounter more individuals on the       southwest border than we have in the last 20 years. We are       expelling most single adults and families. We are not       expelling unaccompanied children. We are securing our border,       executing the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's       (CDC) public health authority to safeguard the American       public and the migrants themselves, and protecting the       children. We have more work to do.        This is not new. We have experienced migration surges       before--in 2019, 2014, and before then as well. Since April       2020, the number of encounters at the southwest border has       been steadily increasing. Border Patrol Agents are working       around the clock to process the flow at the border and I have       great respect for their tireless efforts. To understand the       situation, it is important to identify who is arriving at our       southwest border and how we are following the law to manage       different types of border encounters.                                Single Adults         The majority of those apprehended at the southwest border       are single adults who are currently being expelled under the       CDC's authority to manage the public health crisis of the       COVID-19 pandemic. Pursuant to that authority under Title 42       of the United States Code, single adults from Mexico and the       Northern Triangle countries of El Salvador, Guatemala, and       Honduras are swiftly expelled to Mexico. Single adults from       other countries are expelled by plane to their countries of       origin if Mexico does not accept them. There are limited       exceptions to our use of the CDC's expulsion authority. For       example, we do not expel individuals with certain acute       vulnerabilities.        The expulsion of single adults does not pose an operational       challenge for the Border Patrol because of the speed and       minimal processing burden of their expulsion.                                   Families         Families apprehended at the southwest border are also       currently being expelled under the CDC's Title 42 authority.       Families from Mexico and the Northern Triangle countries are       expelled to Mexico unless Mexico does not have the capacity       to receive the families. Families from countries other than       Mexico or the Northern Triangle are expelled by plane to       their countries of origin. Exceptions can be made when a       family member has an acute vulnerability.        Mexico's limited capacity has strained our resources,       including in the Rio Grande Valley area of Texas. When       Mexico's capacity is reached, we process the families and       place them in immigration proceedings here in the United       States. We have partnered with communitybased organizations       to test the family members and quarantine them as needed       under COVID-19 protocols. In some locations, the processing       of individuals who are part of a family unit has strained our       border resources. I explain below additional challenges we       have encountered and the steps we have taken to solve this       problem.                            Unaccompanied Children         We are encountering many unaccompanied children at our       southwest border every day. A child who is under the age of       18 and not accompanied by their parent or legal guardian is       considered under the law to be an unaccompanied child. We are       encountering six- and sevenyear-old children, for example,       arriving at our border without an adult. They are vulnerable       children and we have ended the prior administration's       practice of expelling them.        An unaccompanied child is brought to a Border Patrol       facility and processed for transfer to the Department of       Health and Human Services (HHS). Customs and Border       Protection is a passthrough and is required to transfer the       child to HHS within 72 hours of apprehension. HHS holds the       child for testing and quarantine, and shelters the child       until the child is placed with a sponsor here in the United       States. In more than 80 percent of cases, the child has a       family member in the United States. In more than 40 percent       of cases, that family member is a parent or legal guardian.       These are children being reunited with their families who       will care for them.        The children then go through immigration proceedings where       they are able to present a claim for relief under the law.        The Border Patrol facilities have become crowded with       children and the 72-hour timeframe for the transfer of       children from the Border Patrol to HHS is not always met. HHS       has not had the capacity to intake the number of       unaccompanied children we have been encountering. I describe       below the actions we have taken and the plans we are       executing to handle this difficult situation successfully.                Why the Challenge is Especially Difficult Now         Poverty, high levels of violence, and corruption in Mexico       and the Northern Triangle countries have propelled migration       to our southwest border for years. The adverse conditions       have continued to deteriorate. Two damaging hurricanes that       hit Honduras and swept through the region made the living       conditions there even worse, causing more children and       families to flee.        The COVID-19 pandemic has made the situation more       complicated. There are restrictions and protocols that need       to be followed. The physical distancing protocol, for       example, imposes space and other limitations on our       facilities and operations.        The prior administration completely dismantled the asylum       system. The system was gutted, facilities were closed, and       they cruelly expelled young children into the hands of       traffickers. We have had to rebuild the entire system,       including the policies and procedures required to       administer the asylum laws that Congress passed long ago.        The prior administration tore down the lawful pathways that       had been developed for children to come to the United States       in a safe, efficient, and orderly way. It tore down, for       example, the Central American Minors program that avoided the       need for children to take the dangerous journey to our       southwest border.        The previous administration also cut foreign aid funding to       the Northern Triangle. No longer did we resource efforts in       El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras to tackle the root       causes of people fleeing their homes.        And, there were no plans to protect our front-line       personnel against the COVID-19 pandemic. There was no       appropriate planning for the pandemic at all.        As difficult as the border situation is now, we are       addressing it. We have acted and we have made progress. We       have no illusions about how hard it is, and we know it will       take time. We will get it done. We will do so adhering to the       law and our fundamental values. We have an incredibly       dedicated and talented workforce.                            Actions We Have Taken         In less than two months, Customs and Border Protection       stood-up an additional facility in Donna, Texas to process       unaccompanied children and families. We deployed additional       personnel to provide oversight, care, and transportation       assistance for unaccompanied minors pending transfer to HHS       custody.        We are standing up additional facilities in Texas and       Arizona to shelter unaccompanied children and families. We       are working with Mexico to increase its capacity to receive       expelled families. We partnered with community-based       organizations to test and quarantine families that Mexico has       not had the capacity to receive. We have developed a       framework for partnering with local mayors and public health       officials to pay for 100% of the expense for testing,       isolation, and quarantine for migrants. ICE has also       developed additional facilities to provide testing, local       transportation, immigration document assistance, orientation,       travel coordination in the interior, and mechanisms to       support oversight of the migrant families who are not       expelled.        Working with Mexico and international organizations, we       built a system in which migrants who were forced to remain in       Mexico and denied a chance to seek protection under  [[Page H1403]]       the previous administration can now use a virtual platform--      using their phones--to register. They do not need to take the       dangerous journey to the border. The individuals are tested,       processed, and transported to a port of entry safely and out       of the hands of traffickers. We succeeded in processing the       individuals who were in the Matamoros camp in Mexico. This is       the roadmap going forward for a system that is safe, orderly,       and fair.        To protect our own workforce, we launched Operation       Vaccinate Our Workforce (VOW) in late January. At the       beginning of this administration, less than 2 percent of our       frontline personnel were vaccinated. Now more than 25 percent       of our frontline personnel have been vaccinated.        We directed the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)       to assist HHS in developing the capacity to meet the surge of       unaccompanied children. FEMA already established one new       facility for HHS to shelter 700 children. They have       identified and are currently adding additional facilities. We       are working with HHS to more efficiently identify and screen       sponsors for children. In two days, we recruited more than       560 DHS volunteers to support HHS in our collective efforts       to address the needs of the unaccompanied children.        We are restarting and expanding the Central American Minors       program. It creates a lawful pathway for children to come to       the United States without having to take the dangerous       journey. Under this expansion, children will be processed in       their home countries and brought to the United States in a       safe and orderly way.        In addition, DHS and HHS terminated a 2018 agreement that       had a chilling effect on potential sponsors--typically a       parent or close relative--from coming forward to care for an       unaccompanied child placed in an HHS shelter. In its place,       DHS and HHS signed a new Memorandum of Agreement that       promotes the safe and timely transfer of children. It keeps       safeguards designed to ensure children are unified with       properly vetted sponsors who can safely care for them while       they await immigration proceedings.                               The Path Forward         We are creating joint processing centers so that children       can be placed in HHS care immediately after Border Patrol       encounters them. We are also identifying and equipping       additional facilities for HHS to shelter unaccompanied       children until they are placed with family or sponsors. These       are short-term solutions to address the surge of       unaccompanied children.        Longer term, we are working with Mexico and international       organizations to expand our new virtual platform so that       unaccompanied children can access it without having to take       the dangerous journey to our border. As mentioned, we are       expanding the Central American Minors program to permit more       children to be processed in their home countries and if       eligible, brought to the United States in a safe and orderly       way.        We are developing additional legal and safe pathways for       children and others to reach the United States. While we are       building a formal refugee program throughout the region, we       are working with Mexico, the Northern Triangle countries, and       international organizations to establish processing centers       in those countries so that individuals can be screened       through them and brought to the United States if they qualify       for relief under our humanitarian laws and other authorities.        For years, the asylum system has been badly in need of       reengineering. In addition to improving the process by which       unaccompanied children are placed with family or sponsors, we       will be issuing a new regulation shortly and taking other       measures to implement the long needed systemic reforms. We       will shorten from years to months the time it takes to       adjudicate an asylum claim while ensuring procedural       safeguards and enhancing access to counsel.        President Biden laid out a vision of a ``multi-pronged       approach toward managing migration throughout North and       Central America that reflects the Nation's highest values.''       To that end, we are working with the Departments of Health       and Human Services, Justice, and State in an all-of-      government effort to not only address the current situation       at our southwest border, but to institute longer-term       solutions to irregular migration from countries in our       hemisphere that are suffering worsening conditions. This is       powerfully exemplified by the President's goal to invest $4       billion in the Northern Triangle countries to address the       root causes of migration.                                  Conclusion         The situation we are currently facing at the southwest       border is a difficult one. We are tackling it. We are keeping       our borders secure, enforcing our laws, and staying true to       our values and principles. We can do so because of the       incredible talent and unwavering dedication of our workforce.        I came to this country as an infant, brought by parents who       understood the hope and promise of America. Today, young       children are arriving at our border with that same hope. We       can do this.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.                                time  1730     Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Madam Speaker, as difficult as the situation is at our southern  border, we are addressing it.   The Biden administration has acted, and they have made progress. They  have no illusions about how hard it is, because they inherited a  dismantled program. And to protect our own workforce, they have  launched Operation Vaccinate our Workers, VOW, in late January.   At the beginning of the Biden administration, less than 2 percent of  our frontline personnel were vaccinated. To date, more than 25 percent  of our frontline personnel have been vaccinated. That is leadership.  That is not avoidance of the problem that we face.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Last week, we passed a historic American Rescue Plan, which set out a  vision of who we are as a nation. We are a country that can conquer  this virus, a country that cares about eliminating childhood poverty,  and a country that is dedicated to ensuring that  [[Page H1404]]  everyone--everyone, not just the rich--are able to emerge from the  pandemic and do better.   The bills before us today are a continuation of this vision of a  country committed to doing better for the people. Too many people in  America live in fear, fear because they are not protected under the  law, but these bills before us today say: ``No more.''   The Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act says to domestic abuse  survivors: ``You are safe. You are going to be safe.''   H.J. Res. 17, which removes the deadline for the ratification of the  equal rights amendment says to women: ``You are equal.'' ``We are  equal.''   The Dream and Promise Act says to Dreamers: ``You, too, can have a  shot at the American Dream.''   And the Farm Workforce Modernization Act tells our farm workers:  ``You can do your job without fear of deportation.''   H.R. 1868 tells Americans: ``Don't worry about draconian cuts. Let's  focus on recovery.''   Madam Speaker, the bills before us today will continue the Democratic  Congress' work to do better by all the American people.   Madam Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule and the previous  question.   The material previously referred to by Mrs. Fischbach is as follows:                     Amendment to House Resolution 233         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 11. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the       House shall proceed to the consideration in the House of the       bill (H.R. 1897) to require a diagnostic test for COVID-19       for an inadmissible alien released from the custody of the       United States Customs and Border Protection or the United       States Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and for other       purposes. All points of order against consideration of the       bill are waived. The bill shall be considered as read. All       points of order against provisions in the bill are waived.       The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the       bill and on any amendment thereto to final passage without       intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on the Judiciary; and (2) one motion       to recommit.        Sec. 12. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 1897.    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of  my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution.
