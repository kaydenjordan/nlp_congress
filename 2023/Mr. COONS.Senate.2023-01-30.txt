 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the achievement  of the Stennis Center for Public Service's service-oriented students,  following the publication of their journal, the ``Public Service  Review.''   For all who are looking for encouragement about the future of our  country, I want to bring to your attention the most recently published  issues of ``Public Service Review,'' produced by the Stennis Center for  Public Service. ``Public Service Review'' features inspiring and  informative stories from young leaders who share in their own words  their experiences, insights, hopes, and dreams as they engage in public  service through internships, jobs, and activities in their communities  and throughout the world.   The publication, available on the Stennis Center's website at  www.stennis.gov, provides a glimpse into the future for all who care  deeply about the future of American democracy. As they explore the  challenges and rewards of public service, the commitment of these young  leaders to help keep our Nation strong and free is truly inspirational.  The 33 authors featured in the 2022 issues are Adam Duffy of Ohio State  University, Alex Siegal of Columbia University, Alexandra Dorotinsky of  University of New Haven, Amanda Guilardi of American University, Anna  Zmistowski of University of Maine School of Law, Catherine Lawson of  Texas A&M University, Jaydn Smith of Hastings College, Owen Rosenberg  of American University, Alexandra Schindewolf of Rutgers University,  Ava Goble of University of Hawai'i, Ben Savercool of California State  University, Chico, Caroline Rykard of University of Georgia, Diana  Grechukhina of Salisbury University, Disha Jhaveri of Harvard T.H. Chan  School of Public Health, Drew Ficociello of George Washington  University, MAJ Matt Romanowski of Princeton University and U.S. Army,  Ethan Sanders of Oklahoma State University, Jagaar Halverson of Grand  Canyon University, Jennifer Rivera Galindo of Florida International  University, Kathleen Griffith of University of South Carolina, McKayla  Steineke of Northeastern University, Mia Robertson of Mississippi State  University, Alanna Cronk of Georgetown University, Mini Ganesh of  Harvard College, Natalie Gilbert of Georgetown University, Anum Syed of  West Chester University, Avinash Maniam of Rutgers University, Mignely  Nunez of Indian University Bloomington, Natalie Salazar of Carnegie  Mellon University, Niklas Kleinworth of University of  [[Page S143]]  Idaho, Sydney Smith of Claremont McKenna College, Victoria Izaguirre of  Texas A&M University, and Zach Blair-Andrews of University of South  Florida.   ``Public Service Review'' provides these young leaders an opportunity  to write about their experiences and inspirations in their own words,  sharing stories of challenge and hope as they engage in public service  in a variety of formats and focus on a range of causes that draw their  passion. Not only do their stories inspire those of us engaged in  public service here in Congress and elsewhere, but their experiences  provide insights and guidance for younger students as they look for  ways to become involved in public service.   On behalf of my colleagues, who I serve with on the Stennis Center  Board of Trustees, U.S. Senator Roger Wicker, Tom Daffron, U.S.  Representative Terri Sewell, and former U.S. Representative Martha  Roby, I commend the Stennis Center for this excellent publication and  urge you to read it and share it with others who will benefit from  reading these inspiring stories.                            ____________________
