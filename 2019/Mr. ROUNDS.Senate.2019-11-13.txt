 Mr. President, today I join my fellow Senate Armed  Services Committee subcommittee chairs in expressing my serious  concerns with the possibility that congress might not pass a National  Defense Authorization Act, NDAA, for fiscal year 2020.   For more than five decades, the NDAA has been signed into law with  bipartisan support. We had our differences, but if we fail to pass the  NDAA this year, what kind of message does that send to the men and  women who, in many cases, are risking their lives for our national  security? Further, they will receive this message at a time of  heightened strategic competition with China and Russia and a continued  need to support our allies and partners. Meanwhile, we must continue  [[Page S6546]]  to rebuild the readiness of our Armed Forces and take care of our  troops and their families.   With regard to rebuilding our readiness, I remember the recent and  significant dip in the readiness of our B-1B bomber fleet at Ellsworth  Air Force Base in South Dakota. While the Air Force has reversed that  trend, it remains an example of the wear and tear on our forces after  18 years of war. Now is not the time to go backward by failing, for the  first time in 58 years, to pass a National Defense Authorization Act.   NDAA is must-pass legislation, as it has been every year for over  half a century. That is why Chairman Inhofe introduced his ``skinny''  NDAA. The NDAA is typically bipartisan, and it should stay that way. I  am hopeful we will find a final agreement.   This is about more than the NDAA. It is also about Defense  appropriations. In that regard, I will not vote for another continuing  resolution with its distinctive impact on our national security.   As chairman of the Cybersecurity Subcommittee of the Senate Armed  Services Committee, I am particularly concerned about what failure to  enact NDAA 2020 would mean for our cybersecurity. Some vital  cybersecurity measures in the NDAA passed by the Senate include the  following: critical funding for United Stated Cyber Command, CYBERCOM,  infrastructure development. In a sense, CYBERCOM is at war every day,  operating in our enemies' backyards to negate or at least reduce their  ability to attack the United States. It is not a coincidence that there  was no successful interference in our 2018 mid-term elections. We can  thank the men and women of CYBERCOM for that. Now is not the time to  deny them what they need to boost their capabilities. Our adversaries  and enemies will surely boost theirs; development of a consistent,  comprehensive framework to enhance the cybersecurity of the U.S.  defense industrial base after disastrous theft of critical defense  information relating to development of an important new weapon system.  I am concerned there may be other ongoing such instances of which we  are not even aware; a consortium of universities, to include Dakota  State University in Madison, SD, to advise and assist the Secretary of  Defense on cybersecurity matters; authorization for the armed services  to use operation and maintenance funds for the rapid creation testing,  fielding, and operation of new cyber capabilities; and completion of  the work of the Cyberspace Solarium Commission charged with evaluating  divergent approaches to defending the United States in cyberspace and  driving consensus toward a comprehensive strategy.   These are just some of the cybersecurity related measures that will  have to wait another year, unless Congress passes NDAA 2020. When added  to the concerns noted by my fellow chairs, it should be clear to all  that now is the time to put aside partisan obstructionism and enact  this must-pass legislation.                            ____________________
