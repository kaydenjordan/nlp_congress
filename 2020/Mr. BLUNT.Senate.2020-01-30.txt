 Mr. Chief Justice.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator from Missouri.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        On page S725, January 30, 2020, third column, the following  appears:  Mr. Chief Justice, I send a question to the desk on behalf  of myself, Senators Hawley, Wicker, and Capito.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you.   The question from Senators Blunt, Hawley, Wicker, and Capito is  addressed to counsel for the President:         What responsibility does the president have to safeguard       the use of taxpayer dollars for foreign aid and work to root       out corruption?    Mr. Counsel CIPOLLONE. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and Members of  the Senate.   The President has an important responsibility to safeguard taxpayer  dollars that are used in foreign aid or used anywhere, frankly, and to  root out corruption. Now, it is no secret that President Trump, from  the beginning, from the time he came down the escalator, has been  committed to ensuring that American taxpayer dollars are used  appropriately--are used appropriately. And if they are going to foreign  countries, he wants to make sure that they are used wisely. And there  is ample evidence of that--ample evidence of that. I don't think that  is even disputed or disputable. And he is fulfilling that obligation.   The other point that he makes repeatedly is that if we are helping  countries around the world, other countries should help us help them.  We use the word ``burden-sharing.'' What does that mean? ``Burden- sharing'' means that if American taxpayers are going to help with a  problem in a country around the world--and we do, and we do a lot. We  do it to the tune of billions and billions  [[Page S726]]  of dollars. When here in our country, we need to fix our roads; we need  to fix our bridges. So if we are going to take money away from those  important projects here in America that come from the hard-earned  dollars of taxpayers, why can't other countries help us? That is called  burden-sharing. It is also called fairness. So he has that obligation,  and every day he fulfills that obligation.   Let me make another point in response to Senator Warren's question.  The most important thing, in terms of the fairness of this proceeding-- and that is why I have quoted repeatedly. I haven't played the videos  over and over again, but you remember them--the wise words, the true  words of the Democrats in the Clinton impeachment years. And the only  point the American people understand--they understand it, and I think  everyone in this body understands it; that there can't be one standard  for one political party and another for the other political party. That  is important. Those words should be applied here. We can't have a  standard that changes depending on what somebody thinks about political  issues.   In order to be fair, the same standard has to be applied, regardless  of your party. So that is the critical issue here. And that is the  bedrock principle, not a double standard for justice in the Senate but  one standard--the true standard, the standard that has been articulated  eloquently by Democrats over and over again in the Clinton proceedings.  That is the standard that is right. That is the standard that we ask  for, regardless of political party.   Thank you.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, counsel.
