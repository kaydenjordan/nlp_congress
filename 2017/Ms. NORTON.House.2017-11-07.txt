 Mr. Speaker, what happens if Congress goes nuts on tax  cuts without paying for them?   Kansas, which did just that, has now had to raise State taxes back to  where they were, providing a valuable object lesson for Congress right  now: tax cuts about ideology, not economics, do not work.   Yet Republicans seem to be taking a page out of the Kansas tax cuts,  authored by Governor Sam Brownback, that crushed that State's economy.   He promised tens of thousands of jobs to fund the State's schools. He  guaranteed a progrowth economy that would pay for the tax cuts and then  some.   Kansas did grow initially, but then lagged behind all the rest of the  States. Now Brownback's tax cuts have produced new taxes for Kansas.   Let's learn from Kansas, not become Kansas 2.0.                            ____________________
