 Mr. Speaker, I want to raise my voice in support of  H.R. 2, the Moving Forward Act.   I want to congratulate Chairman DeFazio. He has been working on this  for a long time. This is the infrastructure bill that we have been  waiting for. He has followed what my father advised me to do as a young  boy: If you are going to do something, do it right. And it is a  wonderful bill.   This is something that will repair our crumbling roads and bridges in  this country, expand transit and commuter rail, repair and rebuild  schools, make childcare facilities safer, deliver broadband to the  entire country, reclaim abandoned mines, save affordable housing units,  provide access to safe drinking water and good sewer systems, and put  more energy into the grid. This is something that this entire Nation  needs.   It is time for us to come together and fulfill this promise to the  American people to rebuild and reinvest in our American infrastructure.  It is the Moving Forward Act, H.R. 2. Let's all vote ``yes'' on that  bill.                            ____________________
