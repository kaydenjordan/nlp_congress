 Madam Speaker, today I raise my objection to H.R. 1,  the so-called For the People Act. This act should really be called the  Fund the Politicians Act. It is a Federal takeover of our election  system. It opens up our precious election system to fraud, and it  violates free speech rights.   This bill would allow for the funding of politicians' campaigns. They  would be given a 6-to-1 match with government money for their  campaigns. I don't believe Americans want their money going to help pay  for more robocalls from politicians that they don't even support.   It also will give $25 to citizens to give to a campaign of their  choice. What a terrible use of our tax dollars.   It also opens up our system to fraud by requiring that they have to  allow for online registration, same-day registration, and it nullifies  all the State protections. No Secretary of State was even consulted  about this bill.   And finally, it violates our free speech rights by requiring the  publishing of the names and addresses of donors to organizations who  may speak about a candidate.   This bill is terrible. Every vote should count, and no government  money should go to line politicians' campaigns.                            ____________________
