 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the  legacy of a constituent of mine in my district, Dr. Richard Alberta,  senior pastor at Cornerstone Evangelical Presbyterian Church in  Brighton, Michigan. On December 31, 2017, Dr. Alberta stepped down from  the pulpit after 40 years of service.   Originally from New York, Dr. Alberta was raised in a nonreligious  home. After marrying his high school sweetheart, Donna, he embarked on  a successful career until, one day, something changed. He attended a  church service and realized the missing puzzle piece in his life was to  do whatever he can to pursue and prayerfully consider the path felt by  the love of his Lord and devotion to his ministry.   Over the past four decades, Dr. Alberta dedicated his time, wisdom,  and leadership to the Lord and the church. His friendship and faithful  guidance has made a lasting impression on the lives of so many.   As he begins his next chapter, I wish him all the best, and I commend  him on his unwavering commitment to his congregation and to our  community as a whole.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman  for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today on National Law Enforcement Appreciation  Day with a heavy heart to pay tribute to two of Michigan's finest  Oakland County sheriff's deputies and their legacy of service.   Oakland County Sheriff's Deputy Eric Overall, a 22-year-old veteran  of the sheriff's department, was killed this past Thanksgiving while  serving and protecting. Deputy Overall was pursuing a suspect who posed  a threat to the public and died ensuring no one else's life was put in  danger that day.   He is remembered by his friends and family as someone who lived by  the mantra ``never quit.'' Sonja Overall, the widow of Eric Overall,  described her husband as a man of integrity who truly left his stamp on  everyone's heart. His life and legacy will never be forgotten.   Now, just 5 days ago, the Oakland County Sheriff's Office suffered  yet another tragedy. Oakland County Sheriff's Deputy David Hack, a 17- year veteran of the sheriff's office, was securing a car accident scene  when he was critically struck by a passing car.   Deputy Hack is well known in the Rochester community, as he serves as  the sheriff's liaison at Rochester Adams High School in Rochester  Hills, Michigan.   He is currently in critical condition. I would like his family to  know that all the students, educators, and staff at Adams High School  and the Rochester community schools are praying for his recovery and  his continued strength to keep fighting until he is fully recovered.  Indeed, our entire Rochester community sends our prayers.   Please join me in a moment of silence for Deputy Hack's recovery and  to honor the memory and mourn the loss of Deputy Eric Overall.   Mr. Speaker, on this National Law Enforcement Appreciation Day, I  send my deepest condolences to their family, friends, Oakland County  Sheriff Michael Bouchard, and the entire Oakland County Sheriff's  Office during this time of tragedy and loss.
