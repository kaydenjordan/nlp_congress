 Madam President, one of the most solemn eulogies any man  can deliver is for a fallen officer killed in the line of duty. Senator  Boozman and I have delivered too many of these eulogies already, and we  regret that we must do so again, but we want to celebrate the life and  service of Police Officer Travis Wallace of the Helena-West Helena  Police Department, who died last month at age 41, while attempting to  bring a murder suspect into custody.   Officer Wallace and his partner recognized the dangerous suspect in a  vehicle in a motel parking lot. They conducted a traffic stop. The  suspect got out of his vehicle and immediately opened fire. Officer  Wallace bravely and skillfully returned fire, causing the suspect to  flee, but it was too late. He had already suffered grave wounds. He  passed away later at the hospital, despite the valiant effort of  doctors to save his life.   Officer Wallace believed that policing was his life's calling. He had  worked in law enforcement for almost a decade, including 5 years with  the Helena-West Helena Police Department, before his life was so  tragically cut short.   In that brief time, Officer Wallace established himself as a leader  and not just in his department. He was also a loving father, son, and  brother, known for his sense of humor and his ability to make people  smile. And he was a man of faith, serving as a deacon at St. Luke  Missionary Baptist Church.   Officer Wallace served his community with honor. Tragically, he is  the fourth law enforcement officer from Arkansas killed this year and  the 279th officer nationwide.   Like every officer, he dedicated his life to protect and defend his  community. That commitment takes courage. It requires officers to run  toward danger--to approach dangerous men when every human instinct  might scream to run away.   Officer Wallace did his job and did his duty with honor. Now his  watch has ended, but we will always remember the great sacrifice he  made to keep his community and our State safe.   May he rest in peace.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, the U.S. Air Force's 389th Fighter  Squadron--known, respected, and feared around the globe as the  Thunderbolts--flew downrange from the 366th Fighter Wing at Mountain  Home Air Force Base in Idaho to support Operations Inherent Resolve and  Spartan Shield from October 2019 until June 2020. Led by Lt. Col. Rod  ``Brick'' James, the squadron of F-15E Strike Eagles deployed to the  United States Central Command area of responsibility for the fight  against the Islamic State.   During its historic combat deployment, the T-Bolts employed 263  munitions of myriad types during over 2,600 sorties and a record 13,000  combat hours throughout CENTCOM. Demonstrating the rapid, agile, and  lethal characteristics of airpower, the 389th executed close air  support for troops in Syria and Iraq. In addition to CAS, the Squadron  Weapons section loaded the first Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile,  AGM-158, expended in combat by the 366th Fighter Wing, for just one of  a host of special missions. All the while a deterrent, the T-Bolts  stood ready to defeat Iranian aggression if the call came. Finally,  they stayed in the fight 50 percent longer than planned to ensure  COVID-19 did not cause any loss of support to those who needed Strike  Eagles overhead.   Throughout their deployment, the men and women of the 389th Fighter  Squadron and Aircraft Maintenance Unit performed exceptionally under  intense combat pressures executing a new, highly mobile deployment  construct during a pandemic. The Thunderbolts represent the best  America has to offer. They ride hard, shoot straight, and always speak  the truth. I join all grateful Americans in congratulating this  outstanding team on a job well done. Banzai.                            ____________________
