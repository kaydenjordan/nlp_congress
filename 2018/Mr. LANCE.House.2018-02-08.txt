 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (S. 96) to amend the Communications Act of 1934 to ensure the integrity  of voice communications and to prevent unjust or unreasonable  discrimination among areas of the United States in the delivery of such  communications.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                   S. 96         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Improving Rural Call Quality       and Reliability Act of 2017''.       SEC. 2. ENSURING THE INTEGRITY OF VOICE COMMUNICATIONS.         Part II of title II of the Communications Act of 1934 (47       U.S.C. 251 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the       following:       ``SEC. 262.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Lance) and the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Michael F.  Doyle) each will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the bill.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from New Jersey?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the bill.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from New Jersey?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that we are considering S. 96 to improve  rural call completion. S. 96 will require the Federal Communications  Commission to establish call completion standards for intermediary  providers that sometimes have not routed calls properly in rural areas  of our country.   By focusing on these standards, we will ensure that the high-quality  telephone service people in big cities may take for granted will be  shared by those Americans living in harder-to-reach areas.   I appreciate the bipartisan work of Congressman David Young and  Congressman Peter Welch. Their companion bill, H.R. 460, passed the  House on January 23, 2017.   I also thank Senator Klobuchar and Senator Thune for their work on  rural call completion.   Without the bipartisan and bicameral work of all of these Members, we  would not be here today.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself  such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I also rise to support S. 96, the Improving Rural Call  Quality and Reliability Act. It is a bipartisan bill championed by  Representative David Young and cosponsored by a number of other  Members, including Representatives Welch and Loebsack from the Energy  and Commerce Committee.   We deal with a lot of technologically complicated issues on the  Subcommittee on Communications and Technology, but this bill aims to  address the most essential function of our telephone system: making  sure that all Americans' calls go through.   Many people take for granted our modern communications tools. But in  rural America, even the basic function of connecting a call is  sometimes next to impossible.   Consumers tell us often when they call rural areas, they are met with  false busy signals or calls not even arriving, just silence.   This isn't just an important problem for rural Americans, but also  for people in all of our districts who want to reach loved ones across  the country and can't.   This status quo is unacceptable. We need reliable telephone service  to keep us connected. It is too important for everyday life,  particularly in the wake of the terrible natural disasters that swept  through our country earlier this year.   It is clearer than ever that basic phone service is critical when  responding to emergencies and critical for everything from finding a  job to managing your health.   We know that problems with call completion are often related to  intermediate providers--the middlemen hired to route calls. This bill  requires intermediate providers to register with the FCC and comply  with service quality standards. These commonsense steps should make it  easier to figure out when providers are cutting corners or not doing  their jobs.   Ultimately, the bill puts consumers first by helping them make sure  that we can stay connected to one another.   S. 96 is a bipartisan bill that passed on suspension earlier this  Congress and last Congress, and I urge my colleagues to support it  today.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Tennessee (Mrs. Blackburn), the distinguished chair of the  Communications and Technology Subcommittee of the Energy and Commerce  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Iowa  (Mr. Young), who has worked so hard on this issue.  [[Page H992]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  South Dakota (Mrs. Noem).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  South Dakota (Mrs. Noem).    Mr. Speaker, the House should pass this legislation  unanimously. We are one country: urban, suburban, and rural, and this  will help rural America.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Burgess). The question is on the motion  offered by the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Lance) that the House  suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 96.   The question was taken.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds  being in the affirmative, the ayes have it.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a  quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not  present.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further  proceedings on this question will be postponed.   The point of no quorum is considered withdrawn.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and concur in the  Senate amendment to the bill (H.R. 582) to amend the Communications Act  of 1934 to require multi-line telephone systems to have a configuration  that permits users to directly initiate a call to 9-1-1 without dialing  any additional digit, code, prefix, or post-fix, and for other  purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the Senate amendment is as follows:   Senate amendment:         Beginning on page 4, strike line 10 and all that follows       through page 5, line 2, and insert the following:        (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a)       shall apply with respect to a multi-line telephone system       that is manufactured, imported, offered for first sale or       lease, first sold or leased, or installed after the date that       is 2 years after the date of the enactment of this Act.    The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Young of Iowa). Pursuant to the rule,  the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Lance) and the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Michael F. Doyle) each will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to insert  extraneous material in the Record on the bill.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from New Jersey?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to insert  extraneous material in the Record on the bill.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from New Jersey?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   H.R. 582, or Kari's Law, was sponsored by my good friend, Congressman  Gohmert. This important bill passed earlier this Congress on January  23, 2017. I am pleased that at this time it will be sent to the  President to be signed into law.   The residents of Texas know of a very painful story. Kari Hunt was  murdered in a hotel room by her estranged husband in 2013. Kari's 9- year-old daughter did the exact right thing she knew to do, which was  to call 911. Unfortunately, she did not know to dial another digit to  get an outside line; and, parenthetically, I would not have known that.   This legislation will ensure that when you stay at a hotel, you can  dial 911 and the call will go through without dialing another number.  Kari's dad, Hank, and Mr. Gohmert had been relentless advocates to make  sure that this legislation becomes law. I commend their efforts and  that of Senator Klobuchar and her staff, along with Senator Deb  Fischer.   God bless Kari's family for not giving up and fighting for this law.  It is impossible to express how important it is, especially as we  approach the 50th anniversary of 911 service next week.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself  such time as I may consume.  [[Page H993]]    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Senate amendment to H.R. 582, a  bill that passed the House last Congress by voice vote.   I agree that we must do all we can to make sure that consumers using  multiline telephone systems can directly dial 911 without having to  dial additional digits first. These are the large enterprise phone  systems that we use in big office buildings and hotels. Many of these  phones require consumers to dial an extra 9 to get an outside line.  Most of us know that, but too many people do not realize that you also  have to dial 9 before dialing 911 on these phones, and if you don't  dial the 9 first, you can't reach emergency services.   As you can imagine, in desperate situations, being able to quickly  reach first responders can mean the difference between life and death.   This very issue led to a tragedy in Texas several years ago. Kari  Dunn was killed while her 9-year-old daughter tried to call for help.  Kari's daughter did what she thought she was supposed to do in an  emergency, dial 911. But because the system she was using required her  to dial that additional 9 first, she only heard silence on the other  end.   Building on the Herculean effort of Kari Dunn's family, we are one  step closer to fixing this problem once and for all.   H.R. 582 is an important step toward making our systems work better  in an emergency. But for all the good this bill does, it still leaves  work to be done. Specifically, these multiline systems still often fail  to deliver accurate location information to first responders. That  means that if someone calls 911 from this very building that we are  sitting in, for instance, precious minutes could tick by as emergency  personnel struggle to figure out where the call came from in this  enormous complex.   That delay could be the difference between life and death. We must  act to correct this problem, too, because making sure the call goes  through is only helpful if public safety officials can find the caller.   Democrats tried to include such a provision in the version of this  bill from last Congress, and at that time we received a commitment from  Chairman Walden to work together on a separate bill to address this  concern. We were not able to solve this problem last Congress, and we  expect the commitment will carry over to this Congress.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Tennessee (Mrs. Blackburn).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Gohmert), the principal sponsor.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Burgess).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Burgess).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Shimkus).   (Mr. SHIMKUS asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, this is the way Congress should work in a  bicameral and a bipartisan capacity. I think those of us who serve on  the Energy and Commerce Committee are very proud of our service there.  It is the committee in the House of Representatives the sends the most  bills to the floor--the most bills that pass, the most bills that pass  in the Senate, and the most bills that reach the desk of the President  of the United States. This was true of President Obama, as I am sure it  will be true of President Trump.   This act will improve the lives of the American people. We mourn the  loss of the terrible tragedy in Texas, but out of that terrible tragedy  we hope to improve the American Nation, and this certainly will do  that.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore.
