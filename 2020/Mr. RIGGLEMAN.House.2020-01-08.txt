 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to support our brave men  and women serving overseas, specifically, those in Iraq and the Middle  East.   I support their mission, as I did during my time on Active Duty. I  also rise to recognize all of those who have been working to support  this mission, including constituents of mine working at the National  Ground Intelligence Center in Charlottesville, Virginia.   I have personally worked, during my past, with NGIC on efforts to  stop the Quds Force and Qasem Soleimani, specifically their support to  IED technologies that killed American troops. Soleimani was a  terrorist.   The President recently addressed the Nation proposing an allied  effort with our partners in NATO to address Iran and ensure they stop  their pursuit of hegemonic goals and their nuclear program.   I support this effort. Resolute strength is the only way to deal with  state sponsors of terrorism.                            ____________________
