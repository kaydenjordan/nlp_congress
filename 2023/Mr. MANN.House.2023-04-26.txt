 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the life and legacy of Joe  Kejr, a great Kansan who passed away on April 8 at the age of 64. Joe  was a third-generation wheat farmer, a passionate advocate for  agriculture, and a follower of Jesus who was committed to building and  fostering deep relationships in the agricultural community.   Wheat harvest was Joe's favorite time of year. He loved spending long  hours with family and friends, racing to beat a storm, and enjoying the  quiet peace and camaraderie of suppertime in the field, and sharing the  entire experience with younger generations.   He and his crew loved the challenge of trying to be the last truck to  go through the elevator each night. At the end of harvest, Joe would  hold court and share stories at the big ``last supper'' that he and his  wife Geena would host at their house for everyone who came to help.   Joe served on the Kansas Association of Wheat Growers board of  directors from 2002 to 2010, serving as president in 2007, and as the  president of the National Wheat Foundation in 2022.   First and foremost, however, Joe was a follower of Jesus who served  in the Kansas legislature on various ministry boards, including At  Stake Ministries and church committees, and he was passionate about  sharing the Gospel and he led mission trips to and made many friends in  Guatemala.   Mr. Speaker, Joe is now at rest with his Savior. I am praying for  Geena and Joe's family as they mourn his loss and celebrate his life.   Commemorating the 150th Anniversaries of the Chisholm Trail and Western                                Cattle Trail     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the 150th  anniversaries of the Ellsworth Route of the Chisholm Trail and the  Western Cattle Trail through Dodge City and beyond. The American  cowboys who used these trails were the original pioneers who ventured  West in search of new opportunities with nothing more than their  horses, their dogs, their ropes, and their prayers.   I grew up on a cattle operation in Quinter, Kansas. There are more  than 4.4 million cattle and calves on ranches and feed yards in our  district, which means that plenty of cowboys called The Big First home.   Kansas has been the first frontier for cowboys since the 1860s when  cattle were driven from Texas to places like Abilene and Dodge City to  be sold near the closest railroads.   The cowboys would drive about 3,000 head of cattle on their thousand- mile journey at a pace of about 15 miles per day, so it took 2 months.  They would look after their cattle 24 hours a day, sleeping under the  stars in shifts in the land that would later become Oklahoma.   By the late 1870s, so many cowboys were making this trek from Texas  to Kansas that half a million head of cattle were being shipped out of  Dodge City alone every year.   These long drives disappeared at the end of the century, but the  modern cowboys of today still embody the courage, dedication, personal  responsibility, and traditional methods from their pioneering history.   Cowboys remain a constant in an ever-changing world. They know how to  break a horse without breaking its spirit, and they put in a 40-hour  workweek by the time Wednesday morning rolls around. Cowboys know that  they can't take shortcuts or do the bare minimum if they want to  succeed. They are resourceful multitaskers who do things the right way,  which is often the hard way, and their reward for all their hard work  isn't public accolades, but simply providing for their families, caring  for their stock, and keeping America fed.   It is exciting to see all the local celebrations of Kansas' history  around these trails.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Dennis Katzenmeier, president of the  International Chisholm Trail Association; Michael Grauer, president of  The Western Cattle Trail Association; Ron Wilson, and many others for  their dedication to preserving the history of these trails and the  cowboys that use them.      Thanking Emily Woods for Her Service to Kansans and The Big First                                  District     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and thank Emily  Woods for her service to me, my office, Kansans, and The Big First  District.   Emily served on my team since my first day in Congress, and she  consistently brought a caring, professional, and attentive approach to  building relationships, providing thought leadership, and connecting  with Kansans and her coworkers alike. Emily established herself as a  resource for everyone in the office, always offering helpful advice and  solving problems with a creative perspective.   This scripture comes to mind for Emily, Proverbs 3:5-6: ``Trust in  the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in  all your ways submit to Him, and He will make your paths straight.''   I am so excited to see what lies ahead for Emily and her move back to  the Sunflower State. I know that with her many skills, her passion, and  her work ethic, she will go very far.   Mr. Speaker, I again thank Emily for her dedication to The Big First  District. My time in Congress wouldn't have been the same without her.  We will miss her and wish her well with all of her future endeavors.                            ____________________
