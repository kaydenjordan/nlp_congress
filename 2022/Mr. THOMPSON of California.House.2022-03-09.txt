 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of  H.R. 6968 which will cut off oil and other energy imports from Russia  which provide key support to Putin's war machine.   This bill stands in solidarity with the proud Ukrainian people  fighting for their homeland and builds on President Bidens executive  actions to ban Russian energy imports.   The crippling sanctions the Biden Administration has coordinated with  our allies have isolated Russia to an unprecedented degree: are  weakening Russia's ability to fund their illegal military offensive.   I believe that we can and should do even more. Although our European  allies have moved quickly to support punishing sanctions against Russia  and its corrupt leaders, other countries are providing aid and comfort  by actually stepping up trade with Russia.   As we look to ratchet up the pressure on Russia to force them to stop  the needless bloodshed, we need to ensure that every country is doing  their part to help end this war and hold Russia accountable.   Mr. Speaker, as an original cosponsor of this bill, I urge my  colleagues to vote yes to send a strong unified message that we are  committed to doing everything we can to fight Russian aggression, stand  with the Ukrainian people, and provide the military assist Ukraine  desperately needs to defend itself.
