 Madam Speaker, I rise to recognize the importance of ALS  Awareness Month and continued Federal support of funding towards a cure  for ALS.   ALS a progressive nervous system disease that affects nerve cells in  the brain and spinal cord, causing loss of muscle control.   This devastating disease can affect anyone, anywhere, at any age,  and, still today, is always fatal.   Veterans are twice as likely to develop ALS, which is why ALS has  been designated a service-connected disease.   Not only is there no cure for ALS, but there is also no effective  treatment to halt or reverse the progression of the disease.   Patients typically live 2 to 5 years after diagnosis.   President Biden announced an initiative to leverage a $50 billion  investment over the course of his presidency through a new HHS program,  called ARPA-Health.   This investment would bring focus, scale, and innovation to combat  devastating diseases like ALS, Alzheimer's, diabetes, and cancer.   Madam Speaker, the need is urgent, and I would encourage my  colleagues to join me in supporting these investments. Our response  must meet the moment.                            ____________________
