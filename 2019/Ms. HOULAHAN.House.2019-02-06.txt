 Madam Speaker, I rise for Rodney and Michelle Roberson  and their daughter Bianca, who was fatally shot in a road rage incident  in June of 2017.   Bianca had recently graduated from Rustin High School in Chester  County, in my district. She was coming back from a pre-college shopping  trip when she found herself in an encounter with someone who tried  passing her in a merge lane and then, in a horrific act, pulled out a  loaded firearm and fired a single, fatal shot at Bianca.   Bianca was a beautiful and smart young lady who was, tragically,  taken from us too soon because of senseless gun violence.   I rise for the 1,635 other Pennsylvanians whose lives were cut short  in 2017 because of gun violence. I am a third-generation veteran, and I  support responsible gun ownership. And, like many in my community, I  support commonsense safety measures that Congress should act on to  curtail gun violence in our communities.   We must act now.                            ____________________
