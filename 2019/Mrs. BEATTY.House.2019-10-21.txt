 Mr. Speaker, I have met many people in my life, but  Elijah Cummings was steadfast and unmovable in his quest to protect our  democracy.   He was my friend from day one. I was a lost freshman, trying to find  my way to the Rayburn Building from Cannon. Not only did Elijah teach  me how to read the numbers, but he walked me all the way to the Rayburn  Building. Then he recommended a chief of staff to me, Kimberly Ross,  who is with me today.   He was a mentor to me and so many. We texted often and talked about  healthcare challenges and the challenges of our communities and this  great Nation.   He cosponsored and saluted me for my work putting Harriet Tubman on  the $20 bill.   Elijah would often say his life was based on pain, passion, and  purpose, which propelled him forward.   A few months ago, he keynoted an event in my district for his good  friend, the Reverend Dr. Charles Booth's program, Bridges to the  Future, for its 25th anniversary, although he was not feeling well  himself. But Elijah was a friend to the end.   His unmatched ability to tap into the heart of the matter and find  consensus that mattered was Elijah.   So, Elijah, my brother, my friend, my mentor, my colleague, I assure  you, when times get tough, I will borrow your fighting spirit and  harness the power to stand firm in the face of injustice.   My heart and prayers are with his wife and my friend, Maya; his  children; his family; his constituents; and his staff.   Elijah, my friend, my colleague, rest in peace. Rest in power, my  friend. I know you are dancing with the angels. God bless you.
