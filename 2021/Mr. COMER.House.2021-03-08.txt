 Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Georgia (Ms.  Williams), my colleague.               Commemorating 56th Anniversary of Bloody Sunday     Mr. Speaker, in the weeks since President Biden took  office, we have seen a dramatic reversal from the America First  policies that we saw under President Trump.   Mr. Speaker, after 4 years of policies that empowered middle-class  Americans to prosper, the working class is now getting the shaft under  Joe Biden. And it is all happening through heavy-handed executive  orders, not through legislation that reflects the voice of the people's  representatives.   On day one, he acted recklessly to cancel the Keystone Pipeline,  which provided thousands of good-paying energy jobs to the American  people. From there, it was only worse.   Rejoining the Paris climate agreement, reentering the communist- compromised World Health Organization, and reducing security on our  southern border were all executive actions that will make America less  safe and prosperous. The President's radical proposal to grant amnesty  to 11 million illegal immigrants, while 11 million Americans are  unemployed, is the definition of putting Americans last.   As it relates to immigration, this administration's reckless policies  know no bounds. Due to President Biden's loosening of security on our  southern border, we are sending a message to the world that our  immigration laws can be violated without consequence.   Stopping construction of the wall and weakening enforcement,  especially during a pandemic, is a huge national security and health  risk to the American people. The Biden administration, specifically the  Department of Homeland Security, must answer questions the Committee on  Oversight and Reform has asked about how they plan to keep the American  people safe as they incentivize illegal immigration.   Rather than focus on the unity outlined in his inaugural speech,  President Biden has issued divisive executive orders and hurt the  safety of the American people.   Mr. Speaker, it is time for this President to work in a bipartisan  way to take his duties seriously and enforce our immigration laws. It  is also long past time to reopen schools and get Americans back to  work. These are the things the American people expect us to be working  on, not engaging in excessive partisanship.   If we continue to see an approach to governing focused on pandering  to our  [[Page H1104]]  far-left base rather than putting America first, American jobs,  national security, and energy independence will suffer greatly.                Congratulating Graves County High School JROTC     Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate the Graves County High  School JROTC for their first-place finish in the All-Service Raider  National Competition, Co-Ed Division, in Molena, Georgia.   The cadets, led by Lieutenant Jason Caldwell, competed against 12  other schools, including military prep schools, in various physical  activities. They should be proud of this outstanding achievement.   Over the summer, many competitions were canceled due to COVID-19,  leaving each cadet to train individually to prepare for the  competition. This victory is a testament to the hard work and  dedication of each of these students under unusual circumstances.   Graves County was very well-represented by this talented group. The  Junior ROTC program at Graves County High School cultivates leadership  and service skills in its cadets that will benefit their local  community, the First District of Kentucky, and our Nation for many  years to come.   Once again, congratulations to the Graves County High School Junior  ROTC for their victory in this very prestigious competition.                   Honoring Allen County Jailer Larry Piper     Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor my good friend and a  political powerhouse, Larry Piper, of Allen County, Kentucky, who  recently retired after serving as Allen County jailer since 2007. At  the end of January, Larry stepped aside after faithfully serving his  community for years in this important role.   During his time in public office, Larry was known for always  performing his duties well, treating everyone with respect, and doing  what was asked of him. These traits are the hallmark of a good and  honest public servant and describe Larry to a tee.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate my friend, Larry Piper, on a successful  career, and I wish him and his wife, Patricia, the very best in a well- earned retirement.                           Election System Concerns     Mr. Speaker, I want to talk a little bit about H.R. 1,  which passed the House of Representatives last week.   Speaker Pelosi and the Democrats made clear what their top priority  in this new Congress would be: a swamp takeover of America's elections.   At its heart, this radical legislation is a massive Federal takeover  that enables ballot harvesting, requires mass mail-in voting, and uses  taxpayer money to fund political campaigns. This bill, mistakenly named  the ``For the People Act,'' is targeted toward helping politicians, not  the people. At a time when the American people are struggling, why is  helping politicians, like herself, Speaker Pelosi's top priority?   Whenever Washington gets involved, chaos and dysfunction follow  closely behind. If somehow signed into law, H.R. 1 will follow in that  familiar pattern.   Mr. Speaker, 2020 brought to light serious concerns with our election  system. We saw dramatic delays, uncertainty, and chaos from policies  like universal mail-in voting and allowing votes to be counted for days  after the election--and in the case of New York, weeks and months after  the election.   These concerns are real and present the need for fundamental reforms,  but these reforms should be addressed by States, not Congress. And they  should be the exact opposite of the disastrous H.R. 1.   Mr. Speaker, this legislation sanctions the very practices that  created chaos and uncertainty in the 2020 election and sowed widespread  voter distrust. Banning voter ID laws and taking other actions to  prevent States from promoting a safe and secure election is a massive  Washington power grab.    The legislation allows absentee ballots to come in up to 10 days--10  days--after the election date. Does anyone in this body think that is a  good idea?   Mr. Speaker, I would invite anyone in America to come to my home  community of Monroe County, Kentucky, and come down on election night  in 2022--the primary election because it is a pretty Republican county,  91 percent Republican, to be exact. I would invite anyone to come to my  community on election day when all the people who voted in person,  which would be about 95 percent of the voters, voted. Let's say a  magistrate, a constable, or a jailer candidate gets the most votes on  that primary election day. Then, 10 days later, a wad of absentees  comes in the mail to the clerk, and lo and behold, that person loses.   I would invite anyone in America to come tell that magistrate  candidate, constable candidate, or jailer candidate, ``I am sorry. I  know you won on election day, but 10 days later, these ballots came in  and you lost.''   That is what H.R. 1 would do. It makes no sense. This bill is nothing  but a Democrat attempt to consolidate power. It places Washington in  control of elections and enables voter fraud. And like every other  priority bill we have seen from this body, it is a disgrace for the  taxpayers.   Mr. Speaker, I proudly voted against H.R. 1, as did every Republican  in this body. Let's hope, when that bill makes its way to the Senate,  that there are some Senators with some common sense on the Democrat  side, like Joe Manchin, who will stand up for not just the American  taxpayer but the American citizen and reject H.R. 1.                                time  2130                      Honoring Paducah Community Kitchen     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Paducah Community  Kitchen for the outsized role they have played in helping the city of  Paducah weather some of our storms of this past year.   This Christ-centered nonprofit provides crucial services, like free  meals and housing, along with laundry and shower services. Their  efforts to care for the needy have been instrumental in helping  individuals and families facing hardships. In 2020 alone, they  dramatically increased the number of meals served daily, a critical  need due to the economic fallout from the COVID pandemic.   The Paducah Community Kitchen would not be what it is without the  caring and dedicated volunteers who spend a significant amount of time  serving their community. These humble volunteers share love and  compassion by lending a helping hand to their friends and neighbors.  The Paducah Community Kitchen's volunteers, sponsors, and donors should  be commended for all they have done to support their friends and  neighbors.   Mr. Speaker, on behalf of everyone in Kentucky's First Congressional  District, I want to thank them for all of their compassionate work to  help so many families in need.                               Anti-Gun Control     Mr. Speaker, I want to talk about something very important  to the people of Kentucky, and that is the Second Amendment.   With President Biden taking office, there are renewed concerns with  the safety of Second Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens and  Americans. Given his longtime record of pushing extreme gun control  measures through Congress, and given his stated intent to enact those  very policies, my constituents have every right to be concerned.   This is especially true given that House Democrats are putting bills  on the floor this week that are the first step in rolling back our  basic constitutional rights. These proposals come in addition to the  bills which implement new registration requirements for firearms and  ammunition, and disallow adults under 21 from owning firearms.   So you can join the United States military and fight, and even die on  the battlefield when you are 18, but you can't own firearms until you  are 21. Seriously?   These radical proposals coming from the Democrat majority infringe on  the basic rights and privacy of gun owners, and should be stopped in  their tracks.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly oppose these measures, which are extremely  radical and the opposite of what Kentuckians sent me to Congress to do.  Instead, I will continue to work to support and promote legislation  that upholds the fundamental rights found in the Second Amendment.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank all of the law-abiding gun owners in  Kentucky, whose continued advocacy makes a real difference in the fight  against gun control.  [[Page H1105]]                               Recognizing Sarah Bridges     Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Sarah Bridges of  Reidland, Kentucky, a Marshal County High School student who is using  her talent at sewing to provide swaddling blankets for infants at the  ICU.   According to recent reporting from the Paducah Sun, Sarah has been  busy crafting swaddling blankets for Baptist Health Paducah's neonatal  intensive care unit. She rose to this challenge and produced over 20  blankets in the last 2 months, which are used by nurses at Baptist  Health Paducah to meet the comfort needs of local infants.   Sarah's drive to use her talents to fill a vital need reflect her  high character and desire to positively impact her community and  region. Given her extensive track record of community service and  school involvement, it is no surprise that she is now giving back in  this admirable way.   On behalf of the entire First Congressional District of Kentucky, I  thank Sarah Bridges for this outstanding and caring project she has  taken on.                   Honoring Ocie Key on her 100th Birthday     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Mrs. Ocie Key of the  First District of Kentucky, who is turning 100 years old on March 18.   Mrs. Key was born in Burkesville, Kentucky, and continues to reside  in Cumberland County.   In 1939, Mrs. Key married Paul, and together they have three  daughters, six grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren.   She is a lover of quilting, sewing, and basket-making, and enjoys  spending time with family and friends.   Mrs. Key is a woman of faith and a member of the Christian Chapel  Church of Christ in Burkesville, Kentucky. She is also the queen of the  Cumberland County Red Hat Society and has been a member of the  Cumberland County Homemakers for over 50 years.   Mr. Speaker, I am honored to represent Mrs. Ocie Key, and I join with  everyone in Cumberland County and throughout the Commonwealth in  wishing her a very happy 100th birthday.                      Need for Transparency in Spending     Mr. Speaker, I would like to talk about transparency in  government spending. That is one of the main objectives of the House  Oversight and Reform Committee. Not only do we ensure the prevention of  waste, fraud, abuse, and mismanagement in government, we also want and  expect government transparency, just like the people who send us here  to be their voice in Washington.   There is no greater disgrace to the taxpayers than the nearly $28  trillion in debt we are facing as a nation. But instead of taking this  burden we are leaving to our children and grandchildren seriously,  Democrats are barreling through a partisan $2 trillion package through  Congress, $2 trillion of deficit spending.   Congress has already spent $4 trillion to fight the coronavirus in a  bipartisan manner. And $1 trillion of that $4 trillion we have already  appropriated is unspent. That is why I introduced a resolution with  Budget Committee Ranking Member Jason Smith requiring President Biden  to provide this body with information about the $1 trillion in unspent  funds.    Congress should have the information before we spend more taxpayer  money. The American people must have transparency and accountability  for how their money is spent.   People find that hard to believe, that 25 percent of the last COVID  relief bill hasn't been spent, and we don't have a full accounting of  where that money is, where the unspent funds are, where it is going,  why it hasn't been spent.   But we are going to appropriate another $2 trillion?   We are not. You all are. Two trillion dollars more of deficit  spending.   Transparency and responsibility weren't on the minds of the House  last week when the Democrats passed in a partisan manner $2 trillion  additional deficit spending.   This is not responsible governing, especially in light of concerns  from economists that the Democrats' massive spending bill most likely  will cause an economic crash. It is definitely causing inflation.   If you have gone to fill up gas, if you have gone to Lowe's or Home  Depot or anywhere for home improvements, or if you tried to buy any  commodities, you have gone to refinance your house, you are starting to  see inflation.   And with the $2 trillion in that fund, along with the $1 trillion  that still hasn't been spent, you are going to create the kind of  inflation that I studied about in the 1970s.   This bill wasn't about relief for Americans. I have supported  targeted relief, including the direct stimulus checks supported by  President Trump. I voted for the $2,000. I was one of the few  Republicans that voted for the $2,000 in direct stimulus to the  individuals who qualified economically. That is called targeted relief.   I also support funding to help with vaccine distribution and actually  win the fight against COVID-19, but only 9 percent of Nancy Pelosi's  and Joe Biden's so-called relief bill went toward fighting COVID, and  less than 1 percent went towards vaccines. Instead, the focus was on  satisfying the far left political agenda.   This relief measure inserted unrelated pork projects in Nancy  Pelosi's backyard and bailed out blue States, which chose lockdowns  over recovery. In other words, that COVID bill rewarded the States that  kept their economies locked down, the States that have the highest  unemployment rate, and they got rewarded with this blue State bailout  bill.   The no-strings attached, $350 billion in State bailout money comes at  a time when, collectively, State revenues have hardly budged.   For example, California has a $15 billion budget surplus. We played a  video in the House Oversight Committee where California Governor Gavin  Newsom was bragging about his $10 billion budget surplus. But you want  to send more money to California.   My home State of Kentucky saw a higher tax revenue during the  pandemic months of 2020 than they did during the same period of 2019.  That is because we had a strong economy. If you take COVID away, it was  the strongest economy in my lifetime. The biggest impediment to the  economy over the past year has been mayors and governors who have  locked their cities and States down.   The truth is, Congress has already provided States with funding for  COVID expenses through the CARES Act. Now we must look out for our  taxpayers. This includes our senior citizens. Instead of helping our  citizens who are most vulnerable to the virus, Biden's bailout bill  smacks Kentucky seniors with a $6.4 billion Medicare cut over the next  10 years. That is not an America-first proposal.   Before Democrats even attempt to spend another dime of taxpayer  dollars, Congress needs to act to prevent government waste, fraud, and  abuse; and we need to refocus our attention on actually helping the  American people.   I hope to see the United States Senate exercise the due diligence  that taxpayers deserve, and that the House did not provide, in only  passing funding that is targeted directly to the pandemic.                        Honoring Veteran Thomas Bruzan     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the life and legacy  of Thomas Bruzan, who passed away in December at his home in Cadiz,  Kentucky, at the age of 71, after a lifetime of service to his country.   Tom was a decorated Marine Corps veteran, who received a Purple Heart  for his service in Operation Meade during the Vietnam war. After his  military service, Tom assisted combat veterans as a volunteer at  Pennyroyal Veterans Center in Christian County.   Tom was also a member of the American Legion and a charitable giver  to Nonnie's Place, a nonprofit in Lyon County, Kentucky, which supports  women and mothers going through hard times.   Mr. Speaker, I join Tom's family, friends, and all impacted by his  sacrifice, in celebrating his life of devoted service to our country  and the First Congressional District of Kentucky. Tom was a true  American patriot, and his bravery and kindness will not be forgotten.                                time  2145                                   Earmarks     Mr. Speaker, I want to conclude my remarks with mentioning  an issue that will be debated by my colleagues over the next few days.   I want to make clear to the people I represent, not just in the First  Congressional District but the entire State of Kentucky and America,  for that  [[Page H1106]]  matter, where I stand on this issue, and that is the issue of earmarks  and whether or not to end the ban on congressional earmarks.   I am opposed to that for many reasons. First of all, I have learned  this over the 4 years I have served in Congress: Congress is not a  democratic place, especially when it comes to money. We are going to  have a debate--and it is going to be in the press--about whether or not  to bring back earmarks.   But, in fact, there have always been earmarks. This last COVID bill  had earmarks in there for Speaker Pelosi. The CARES Act had earmarks  for legislative leaders on both sides, Democrats and Republicans.   Bringing back earmarks will only give certain people the ability to  spend more money at the expense of a majority of Members, and I can't  believe that Republicans would put a whole lot of consideration into  supporting the bringing back of congressional earmarks.   Another reason why I oppose earmarks is common sense. We have to get  serious about deficit spending. We are $28 trillion in Federal debt.   Congress has to set the example. And the example is standing up and  saying that we are going to do more earmarks, bring earmarks back,  bring back pork?   More pork?   That is a terrible example, and somebody has to stand up for the  American taxpayer. Somebody has to stand up for the children and  grandchildren who are going to inherit this $28 trillion in debt, and I  want to stand up for those people and oppose earmarks.   Lastly, as the top Republican on the House Oversight and Reform  Committee, one thing I have studied in oversight, not just in Congress,  but in my time in the Kentucky General Assembly and in my study of  history and American politics, is that there is always a direct  correlation between earmarks and corruption.   I said that to some Members, and they said: Oh, no, my earmarks won't  be corrupt, they are going to go to building projects.   The corruption is seldom with the municipalities. The corruption is  with the contractors and the subcontractors in the pork projects. There  is usually a direct correlation between earmarks and campaign  contributions.   At a time when we have got too many special interests with their paws  in the pot in Washington, bringing back earmarks is a bad idea.   I want everyone in Kentucky to know exactly where I stand on that  issue.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
