 MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, pursuant to House  Resolution 838, I call up the bill  [[Page H7563]]  (H.R. 5314) to protect our democracy by preventing abuses of  presidential power, restoring checks and balances and accountability  and transparency in government, and defending elections against foreign  interference, and for other purposes, and ask for its immediate  consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous  consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise  and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on H.R. 5314,  the Protecting Our Democracy Act.    MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I yield myself  such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 5314, the  Protecting Our Democracy Act. This sweeping package of reforms would  restore integrity, accountability, and transparency to our government.   The landmark reforms in this bill would protect against future  abuses, no matter who is President. This includes preventing abuses of  the President's pardon power and requiring the President and Vice  President to disclose their tax returns.   This bill includes many provisions that have bipartisan support. For  example, the bill includes a provision based on a bill previously  introduced by Representative Darrell Issa to make it easier for  Congress to enforce subpoenas.   The bill would strengthen protections for inspectors general by only  allowing an IG to be removed for specific documented causes. This  reform passed the House with a bipartisan vote in June as part of a  bill I introduced to increase the independence of inspectors general,  and it passed the House with overwhelming bipartisan support in 2007.   This bill also includes the bipartisan Whistleblower Protection  Improvement Act, which I was proud to introduce. These provisions would  strengthen protections for whistleblowers who are retaliated against  for reporting waste, fraud, and abuse.   These reforms would provide whistleblowers the long overdue right to  challenge retaliation in court. It would also prohibit agencies from  launching retaliatory investigations and disclosing a whistleblower's  identity; and it would make clear that no Federal employee, including  the President or Vice President of the United States, may interfere  with or retaliate against a whistleblower for sharing information with  Congress.   The Protecting Our Democracy Act would also protect the government  from political interference by strengthening the Hatch Act.   Just last month, the independent Office of Special Counsel found that  13 senior Trump administration officials, including top White House  aides and Cabinet members, broke the law by using their official  government position to campaign for President Trump.   This legislation would also limit who can be named an acting official  and for how long. I thank Representative Katie Porter for her  leadership on these reforms which are included in her bill, the  Accountability for Acting Officials Act.   The reforms in this bill have broad support from over 150 groups,  including the Brennan Center For Justice and the Project On Government  Oversight.   My colleagues from across the aisle continue to claim that this bill  is about punishing former President Trump, but this is simply not true.   While this bill addresses issues that were highlighted by past  abuses, it is not about the past. It is about the future of our  democracy, and it will strengthen our democracy.   Madam Speaker, I strongly urge all of my colleagues, both Democrats  and Republicans, to vote for the Protecting Our Democracy Act, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\  minutes to the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro), the  distinguished chair of the Committee on Appropriations.    MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\  minutes to the gentleman from the great State of Oregon (Mr. DeFazio),  the distinguished chair of the Committee on Transportation and  Infrastructure.    MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\  minutes to the gentlewoman from the great State of California (Ms.  Lofgren), the distinguished chairwoman of the Committee on House  Administration.    MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes  to the gentleman from the great State of California (Mr. Schiff), the  distinguished chair of the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.    MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\  minutes to the gentleman from the great Commonwealth of Kentucky (Mr.  Yarmuth), the distinguished chairman of the Committee on the Budget.    MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes  to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Nadler), the distinguished chairman  of the Committee on the Judiciary.    MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I yield myself  such time as I may consume.   I include in the Record a letter of support for the Protecting Our  Democracy Act listing over 150 organizations supporting this important  legislation. We have widespread support across this Nation.                                                   October 6, 2021.   Over 150 Organizations Send Joint Letter Urging Congress To Pass the                        Protecting Our Democracy Act         Dear Members of Congress: The undersigned organizations, on       behalf of the millions of Americans our groups collectively       represent, write to urge you to support and pass the       Protecting Our Democracy Act.        For decades, congressional authority has been undermined by       the executive branch, diminishing the ability of Congress to       fulfill its constitutional duties, to protect the rule of       law, and to hold all presidents accountable for overreaches       and abuses of power. The last time Congress passed       significant reform to protect our democracy from abuses of       executive power was after the Watergate scandal. The time has       come for new guardrails to reassert Congress' role as a       coequal branch of government.        Today, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle and in both       chambers have an interest in restoring the checks and       balances entrusted to them in our Constitution. The       Protecting Our Democracy Act would do just that by restoring       the powers the Founders vested in the legislative branch to       serve as a check on the executive without infringing upon the       president's constitutional powers.        Among other reforms, this historic bill would:        Strengthen Congress's ability to oversee the executive       branch by fortifying congressional subpoena power by       providing expedited consideration of subpoena enforcement by       courts, so the executive branch cannot run out the clock on       congressional oversight;        Ensure inspectors general are qualified and empowered to       hold federal agencies accountable without fear of reprisal by       requiring the  [[Page H7588]]       president to have ``good cause'' for removing an inspector       general and enhancing reporting requirements when there is a       vacancy;        Ensure whistleblowers can continue shining light on       corruption and abuses of power that betray the public trust       by enhancing protections against retaliation, providing legal       defenses for whistleblowers against civil and criminal       liability, and allowing whistleblowers to have their day in       court;        Reinforce Congress's constitutional powers over spending       and the power of the purse by requiring the Office of       Management and Budget to make public basic information about       the management of federal funds, and reporting to Congress to       ensure those funds are spent in accordance with the law;        Prevent political interference with the U.S. Department of       Justice by putting a permanent, statutory requirement in       place that will ensure transparency and accountability       related to their communications with the White House;        Strengthen the Hatch Act to protect federal agencies from       being used for political purposes and ensure senior political       appointees are held accountable under the law the same way       other federal employees are.        Prevent abuse of the president's pardon power by increasing       transparency of the pardon process, prohibiting self-pardons       by the president, and clarifying that pardons are ``official       acts'' for the purposes of federal bribery statute;        Provide for enforcement of the domestic and foreign       Emoluments Clauses of the Constitution, to prevent a       president from profiting from payments by foreign or domestic       governments; and        Secure our elections from foreign interference, by ensuring       political campaigns are informed of the laws banning foreign       interference and are prepared to comply and report any       attempts of foreign interference.        In this perilous moment for our republic, we believe it       should be a top priority for this Congress to repair our       democracy, including ensuring that no future president is       permitted to abuse the power of their office.        If enacted, the Protecting Our Democracy Act would protect       against future presidential abuses of power, restore the       integrity of our democratic institutions, and ensure       transparency from the chief executive.        Given the urgency of this crisis and for these reasons, we       call on you to swiftly pass this critical legislation.

We came to Congress together, and I thank her for her  outstanding leadership in this body and her beautiful statement today.   Madam Speaker, may I inquire how much time remains.    MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I have no further  speakers. I am prepared to close, and I reserve the balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I yield myself  the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, I would like to point out to my very good friend and  colleague, Mr. Comer, that President Trump is no longer President. This  bill is not about President Trump. If anyone, it is about President  Biden and our future Presidents and having more oversight,  accountability, and transparency.   Now, addressed in this bill are past abuses that have occurred. This  is not about the past; it is about the future. It is about the future  of our democracy and the strength of our democracy.   Democrats are not standing alone. The reforms in this bill have broad  support from over 150 outstanding groups, including the Brennan Center  for Justice, the Project On Government Oversight, and many others. I  have included that list in the Record.   Madam Speaker, the Protecting Our Democracy Act is a historic package  of prodemocracy reforms to create or strengthen guardrails and prevent  the abuse of executive power. Many of the provisions in our bill have  broad bipartisan support and have literally been authored by  Republicans.   You yourself at the Rules Committee said that the President should  release his taxes. You said that.   These are issues that both sides of the aisle should be supporting.  It is time for Congress to restore our authorities as a coequal branch  of power.   Madam Speaker, this is about the future, the strengthening of our  democracy, and I urge strong support from all of my colleagues. I urge  my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to join us in  strengthening democracy and urge them to vote with Republicans for this  very important reform bill.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, pursuant to House  Resolution 838, I offer amendments en bloc.    MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, several  amendments offered would increase transparency of White House  operations and personnel.   The amendment offered by Congressman   Mike Quigley would require the  President to publicly release White House visitor logs with certain  exceptions.   The amendment offered by Congressman   David Cicilline would require  the White House to publicly release salary information and financial  disclosure statements for White House employees.   The amendment offered by Congressman Bill Pascrell would further  strengthen the Hatch Act by increasing penalties for employees who  knowingly break the law and use their position for partisan political  activity. This amendment would also allow the Office of Special Counsel  to continue investigations into former political employees after they  leave Federal office.   The amendment offered by Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez would  direct the Office of Government Ethics to establish ethics requirements  on the establishment or use of legal expense funds for the President,  Vice President, or any political appointee.   The amendment offered by Congressman Gerry Connolly would protect the  civil service by preventing any position in the Federal competitive  service from being reclassified outside of merit system principles.  Employment in the Federal workforce should be based on an individual's  knowledge, skills, and abilities, not political connections.   This package of amendments will bring accountability and transparency  to our government. These reforms are critical for preserving and  strengthening our democratic institutions.   Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle  to vote ``yes'' on this package of amendments, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\  minutes to the gentleman from the great State of California (Mr.  Correa), who is the distinguished chairman of the Committee on Homeland  Security Subcommittee on Oversight, Management, and Accountability.    MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\  minutes to the gentleman from the great State of Tennessee (Mr. Cohen),  who is the distinguished chair of the Committee on the Judiciary  Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights, and Civil Liberties.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\  minutes to the gentlewoman from the great State of North Carolina (Ms.  Adams). Dr. Alma Adams is the distinguished chairwoman of the Committee  on Education and Labor Subcommittee on Workforce Protections.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\  minutes to the gentlewoman from the great Commonwealth of Pennsylvania  (Ms. Scanlon), the distinguished vice chair of the Committee on House  Administration.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to  the gentlewoman from the great State of California (Ms. Pelosi), the  distinguished and effective Speaker of the House.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, the amendments  contained in this package will help ensure that the executive branch is  accountable to the American people. This package includes amendments  that were offered by both Democrats and Republicans.   These amendments bolster the many reforms in the Protecting Our  Democracy Act that will protect against future abuses by the executive  branch. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote ``yes''  on this package of amendments, and I yield back the balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House  Resolution 838, I offer amendments en bloc.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise in  opposition to these amendments.   Together, these amendments would gut the bill and strike everything  in this important package of reforms.   The Protecting Our Democracy Act would make the government more  transparent and accountable to the American people.   Provisions in this bill have been supported by both Democrats and  Republicans. For example, my Whistleblower Protection Improvement Act  in Title VII is a bipartisan bill. Many of the reforms in this bill  stem from efforts by prior administrations of both parties to enhance  executive power.   Democrats and Republicans in Congress should unite in reasserting  congressional authority.   Representative Burgess' amendment would strike important reforms in  the bill which would ensure that Presidents and Vice Presidents can be  held accountable for criminal conduct just like every other American.   Representative Comer's amendment would strike every section of the  bill, including reforms to strengthen whistleblower laws that encourage  Federal employees to report government waste, fraud, and abuse.   The amendment would strike protections against Federal agencies'  misuse of government funds. The amendment would strike the provision in  the bill that would require the President and Vice President to  disclose their tax returns.   The sponsor of this amendment, Representative Comer, said at the  Rules Committee recently, just 2 days ago, that he supports that very  reform. Yet, his amendment would remove it from the bill.   These amendments are not a serious attempt at addressing the  protections in this bill. They are simply a messaging tool that will  gut the Protecting Our Democracy Act.   My colleagues from across the aisle continue to claim that this bill  is about punishing former President Trump. But Joe Biden is our  President now, and these bold, good-government reforms will impact his  administration as well as future Presidents of both parties.   It is not about the past. It is about the future and the  strengthening of our democracy. I strongly urge a ``no'' vote on this  package of amendments, and I reserve the balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes  to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Nadler), the distinguished chair of  the Committee on the Judiciary.    MALONEY of New York. I yield as much time as he may  consume to the gentleman.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to  close, and I reserve the balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume for closing.   The underlying bill is about the future, the future of our democracy.  It is about strengthening our democracy. These amendments would gut the  underlying bill, the Protecting Our Democracy Act.   I support the bill, because it includes reforms, such as curbing the  abuse of the pardon power, increasing penalties for political  appointees who violate the Hatch Act, strengthening whistleblower  protections and IG protections, and it would require the President and  Vice President to reveal their taxes, among other reforms.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this package of  amendments, and I yield back the balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support  of this amendment and thank the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Ocasio- Cortez) for her leadership in offering it. This amendment would clarify  the Government Accountability Office's authority to investigate the  intelligence community.   As Congress' watchdog, GAO helps to improve Federal Government  performance and ensure accountability for the American people. GAO has  the tools and expertise to ensure that classified information is  treated with appropriate care and confidentiality. They have been doing  that for decades.   For example, as part of its audit work, GAO is authorized to examine  highly sensitive tax return information. Strict protocols are followed  to protect that information while still enabling GAO to carry out its  important legislative and oversight responsibilities.   This amendment includes important safeguards to balance the  protection of sensitive information with the need for oversight of the  intelligence community.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a strong ``yes'' vote on this amendment.
