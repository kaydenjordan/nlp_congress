 I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call  be rescinded.    The murder of Mr. Floyd at the hands of law enforcement  officers was an outrageous crime that has shocked this Nation, but it  would be a mistake to conclude that the unrest of the last 2 weeks are  only about his death or are only about relations with the police.   At its core, what this unrest is about is the question of what kind  of society we are and what kind of society do we want to be.   A society is a voluntary agreement, by people, to live together. For  a society to thrive, those in it must believe that their interests are  protected and their voices are heard, but when a substantial number of  people in a society come to believe that they are not valued; that they  do not matter; or that they are not wanted, then that society will have  big problems.   For decades, African Americans have complained that they feel their  voices are being ignored, their problems not being addressed, and their  lives not valued.   Given our Nation's history with race, this is an uncomfortable  grievance--one many would rather avoid. Like a bad debt that must  eventually be paid, it is a grievance we can no longer ignore.   Like before, the latest unrest has given rise to voices arguing that  the foundations of our Republic are built on systemic racism and must,  therefore, be brought down. The only difference is that, this time,  claims like these don't just come from the fringes of our politics.  Like before, we also have voices that say that, today, race is only a  factor in individual cases, distinct from our society at large. Both of  these views are wrong.   The foundations of our country are not irredeemably racist.  Abolition, women's suffrage, desegregation, the civil rights movement-- these were not appeals to overthrow our values; these were demands that  we fulfill them.   The Constitution that once considered slaves three-fifths of a human  being was ultimately the vehicle that was used to free them and,  eventually, to secure their most basic rights.   It is also true that we have made tremendous progress on racial  equality over the last 50 years, but there remain shocking racial  disparities on health, on education, on housing, on economics, and on  criminal justice, and there remains the fundamental truth that any  society in which a substantial percentage of the people believe that  they are treated unjustly is a society that has a problem, a society  that can never fulfill its full potential unless those grievances are  addressed.   None of this excuses radical, violent extremists setting fires,  looting buildings, and hurting innocent people, but it also shouldn't  lead us to stupid ideas like defunding the police.   And this is not going to be fixed by endless emails from corporation  after corporation trying to prove how woke they are, even as they  outsource your job to China.   It is also not going to be fixed by pretending that race is no longer  an issue and by accusing everyone who disagrees and says it is of  hating America. Yes, there are still vile racists among us, although  few of them will ever openly admit it, but in 21st century America, few  people consider themselves racist.   The primary reason why race remains relevant today is that the  African-American community faces a unique set of challenges that far  too few people in positions of power and politics fully understand.   If a child is raised in a stable home, in a safe neighborhood,  attends a good school, and they have a private tutor to help them with  the SAT, while another child 2 miles away is raised by one parent, or  maybe even a grandparent, they live in substandard housing, in a  dangerous neighborhood, they attend a school that is failing, or  failing them, and they don't have a private tutor for the SAT--on most  days they don't have access to Wi-Fi--do these two kids really have an  equal opportunity to go to the same college?   If one college student has the connections or the money to do unpaid  internships in the summer or to study abroad and another student has to  work in the summer just so they can afford to go back to school in the  fall, do they really have an equal opportunity to get hired when they  graduate?   If one young adult does something stupid and gets arrested, but his  parents hire good lawyers, and he is able to avoid having a criminal  record, but another young adult who does the exact same thing has to  use a public defender, pleads guilty to a lesser charge but now has a  criminal record, do they really have an equal opportunity when they  apply for the same job?   When policymakers encourage sending manufacturing jobs that once  employed African-American men overseas in an effort to benefit those  employed in technology and finance, how can we truly expect widespread  prosperity for all Americans?   When a disproportionate number of those with these disadvantages  comes from one race while a disproportionate number of those with the  advantages comes from another, the result is a racial disparity.  [[Page S2792]]    Some suggest that these disparities are the result of  institutionalized racism or of a deliberate effort designed to harm  African Americans.   What I truly believe is that it is the product of something far less  sinister but sometimes equally damaging. It is the result of racial  indifference, of the fact that many in positions of power and influence  are oblivious--are unaware--of the unique challenges that  disproportionately face African-American communities across this  country.   We must now acknowledge these challenges and address these  disparities that they create because, when disparities go unaddressed,  they become grievances. When grievances are ignored, it leads to  friction and division and, ultimately, unrest.   By no means do these disparities alone fully capture the entirety of  the challenge before us. There still remain points of friction, more  reminiscent of a different and shameful era in our history.   Here, too, we can also suffer from indifference because the vast  majority of Americans simply do not personally know the sting that  comes from implicit and sometimes explicit reactions to the color of  your skin, which is why true progress requires that we listen to the  viewpoints of those who do.   Listen to the young man I know who sees reports of a young man who  looks like him--like his uncles, like his grandfather--being murdered  by vigilantes in a case of mistaken identity. Who knows, had they had  not taken video of themselves doing this, they would have gotten away  with it.   Listen, and he will tell you that he feels his life wouldn't matter  either if it wasn't because he played professional football.   Listen to the police officer I know who was pulled over while off  duty at least seven times by his own department for no reason, and he  will tell you of the humiliation of having to explain this to his  teenage son.   Listen to what it feels like to see on the news that, when a mother  in Miami recently drowned her own autistic son in a terrible tragedy-- do you know how she tried to cover it up? By falsely telling the police  that he had been abducted by two African-American men demanding drugs.   Listen to what it feels like to read about the indictment of the  chief of police of Biscayne Park, FL, who, in an effort to brag about  having a perfect crime-solving record, ordered his officers to arrest  anybody Black walking through their streets and, if they had any kind  of criminal record, pin one of their unsolved crimes on them.   Listen not because it is your fault, not because you are to blame;  listen because this is what people who want to live together in harmony  must do.   This is the respect we owe one another as colleagues, as coworkers.  This is the empathy that is required of us as neighbors, as friends,  and as children of the same God.   This may not be your fault, but this is our problem because, until we  heal this divide, we will never ever have the kind of society we want,  and we will never fulfill the full promise of our Nation.   There is reason for hope, even in a deeply divided country where the  political and cultural lines that divide us continue to harden.   A clear consensus has emerged that we can no longer ignore matters of  race in America, but it is a fragile consensus, already being tested by  loud voices appealing to our most basic fears or those who see the  opportunity to advance divisiveness and extreme ideas.   If this is the path we choose, we will all look back at this time  with profound regret, and we will be left with a society that is even  angrier and more divided than it is now. We will be left with an  America that no longer resembles the one we honor when we stand during  the National Anthem.   Ironically, we will ultimately be left with an America even further  away from the one some kneel to demand.   The only way forward is to treat each other with the empathy and  respect required of the people who have decided to share a nation and a  future.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, as chairman of the Senate  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize  a small business that exemplifies the American entrepreneurial spirit  at the heart of our country. It is my privilege to recognize a family- owned small business that is not only a Miami staple, but has helped  feed thousands of Floridians impacted by the coronavirus pandemic. This  week, it is my pleasure to honor Pinecrest Bakery, of Pinecrest, FL, as  the Senate Small Business of the Week.   In 2012, Efrain Valdes and Joel Rodriguez founded Pinecrest Bakery.  Years earlier, these longtime friends met in Miami's Little Havana and  formed a bond over their shared Cuban heritage and love for its  cuisine. When Efrain's family moved to Pinecrest, he noticed a lack of  Cuban restaurants in their new neighborhood. Seeing this as an  opportunity, Efrain and Joel opened the original Pinecrest Bakery in  December 2012. Their welcoming atmosphere and delicious food proved a  hit, with lines regularly forming out the door. Soon, Pinecrest Bakery  expanded its hours to become Miami's premier 24-hour Cuban bakery.   Eight years later, Pinecrest Bakery expanded to 17 locations, with 3  more on the way. Their original menu of Cuban coffee and pastries now  includes meal and catering menus and a food truck. Pinecrest Bakery is  earning accolades for its delicious cuisine and emerging as a leader in  the local business community. The business remains family-owned, with  several members of the Valdes and Rodriguez families serving in key  leadership and food production roles. Additionally, their strong sense  of family has built a tight-knit and supportive team.   Like many other small businesses, Pinecrest Bakery stepped up to help  their community during the coronavirus pandemic. The shortage of  essential goods in stores prompted them to sell their bulk supplies of  milk and eggs directly to customers. In mid-March, Pinecrest Bakery  ramped up their existing partnership with Farm Share, a nonprofit  organization that connects Floridian farmers with surplus produce to  local businesses and organizations for distribution. Using its  Pinecrest location as a distribution center, Pinecrest Bakery provided  approximately 200,000 pounds of free food to nearly 10,000 families in  south Florida. The American Legion recognized Pinecrest for donating  hot meals to healthcare workers and first responders.   When the U.S. Small Business Administration launched the Paycheck  Protection Program--PPP--Efrain and Joel applied immediately. The PPP  provides forgivable loans to impacted small businesses and nonprofits  who maintain their payroll during the COVID-19 pandemic. Recently,  Pinecrest Bakery received their PPP loan, which has enabled them to  keep their employees paid and continue their work to feed south  Florida.   Pinecrest Bakery is a remarkable example of how small businesses can  leverage local connections to support their communities in times of  crisis. I commend their work with Farm Share and leadership in the  Miami area.   Congratulations to Efrain, Joel, and the entire team at Pinecrest  Bakery. I look forward to watching your continued growth and success in  south Florida.                            ____________________
