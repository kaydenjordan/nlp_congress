 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4468,  the Choice in Automotive Retail Sales Act.   A few months ago, the EPA proposed a new rule that would effectively  require the vast majority of automobiles sold in the United States to  be electric within just a few years.   Now, Mr. Speaker, I have nothing against electric vehicles, but I  feel very strongly that American families should be empowered to choose  the vehicle that best meets their needs rather than having their  government make that decision for them.   Mr. Speaker, I represent over 100,000 people who commute from my  rural California district back and forth into Los Angeles every single  day. For those people, an electric vehicle is not only unaffordable, it  is also impractical.   Preserving their ability to make their own choice on this issue also  preserves the market forces that incentivize manufacturers to continue  to lower the cost of electric vehicles and increase their quality.   Mr. Speaker, that is good not only for families, but also for the  environment. That is why I am proud to be a cosponsor of this  legislation, and I urge my colleagues to support it.
