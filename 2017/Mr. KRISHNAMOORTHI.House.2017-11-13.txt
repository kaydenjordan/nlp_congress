 Mr. Speaker, the tax plan that has been proposed  by the House Republican leadership fails to support working families  while making them foot a $1.5 trillion bill.   Nonpartisan research projects that this legislation would raise taxes  on 38 million hardworking Americans. The impact would be far and wide  as the tax plan would end deductions for seniors facing growing medical  expenses, young adults working to shrink their student debt, and  families paying State income and sales taxes.   This legislation would also have enormously damaging economic  consequences as it would leave our children to pay off its $1.5  trillion price tag. We need tax reform that puts working families  first, but this clearly isn't it.   For the sake of our economy, seniors, students, and working families,  as well as the middle class, we must defeat this bill.                            ____________________
