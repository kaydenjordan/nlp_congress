 Mr. Speaker, if I may call your attention to this poster  here to my right. This is a photo of brave Americans out of Orange  County who have made the ultimate sacrifice since 9/11. Among them are  Navy SEAL Michael Monsoor, Army Ranger Sergeant Tyler Holtz, and right  here in the middle is a picture of Corporal Jose Angel Garibay, a  Dreamer and a marine without status who joined the Marine Corps and  made the ultimate sacrifice in 2003. Later on, he was given American  citizenship posthumously. This is a Dreamer, Jose Angel Garibay.   I want to also take a moment to talk about another Dreamer, Police  Officer Germain Martinez Garcia, who grew up in southern Illinois. In  the words of his police chief:         Germain is a part of our community. He's a good citizen.       He's a good person, and we need him.    He is a Dreamer.   Two other Dreamers are two brothers, John and James, who both grew up  in L.A. They are both Dreamers. They joined the U.S. Army last year,  and they are out in basic training right now. These two want nothing  more than to defend our country, and today's legislation will ensure  that these bothers, John and James, can come home to the United States  after serving our country.    Another Dreamer, Gloria, grew up in the center of my district, Santa  Ana. She is a Dreamer who attended Harvard and is now getting her Ph.D.  at Claremont University.   All these are Dreamers, and for the life of me, I don't understand  how these individuals do not add to the greatness of America.   Dreamers have been vetted. Dreamers are hardworking. They pay taxes;  they follow the law; and many, many of them are defending our country  all over the world.   Mr. Speaker, let's give Dreamers the opportunity to earn the American  Dream. I ask for a vote of ``aye'' on H.R. 6.
