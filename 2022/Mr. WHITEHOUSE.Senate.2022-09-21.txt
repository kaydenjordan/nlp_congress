 Mr. President, I wanted to come to the floor and kick  off the process that will culminate tomorrow with our vote on the  DISCLOSE Act.   The DISCLOSE Act will get rid of dark money in our politics.  President Biden gave a good speech about it yesterday to help stir  interests and progress in this area.   There are problems with dark money in and of itself. It contributes  to what has been called the tsunami of slime in our politics, because  when the slimy ad has a fake, phony front group's name on it and no  actual real entity or company or association is accountable for that,  well, then you can lie to your heart's content, you can smear to your  heart's content, and there is no accountability.   So there are reasons for getting dark money out of our elections on  their own: just giving disproportionate power to special interests,  sliming up our elections, allowing a lot of bad actors powers that they  don't deserve, and putting enormous power in the hands of people who  are, A, politically active enough to be willing to spend that kind of  money and have a motive in legislative outcomes to spend that kind of  money that regular citizens can't begin to match.    But there is a lot more to it than that. There is a lot more to it  than that, because, like corruption, dark money is used to achieve  other goals. And those other goals have had very important policy  effects in our country.   Climate change we are dealing with daily now in floods, in fires, in  droughts, in species moving about--particularly in Rhode Island, our  ocean fisheries are moving about. The oceans are acidifying. We are  putting essential operating systems of our planet in danger and onto a  course that mankind has never seen before in the entire history of  humankind.   When I got here in 2007, this was addressed as a bipartisan problem.  There were three different bipartisan Senate bills, all of which were  very consequential. It would have made a huge difference. Senator  McCain ran for President carrying the Republican Party banner with a  significant and serious climate platform, and it looked like democracy  was responding to this problem in a responsible way. All of that  activity came to an instant shuttering halt in January of 2010.   What happened in January of 2010? What happened in January of 2010  was that the U.S. Supreme Court let loose one of the worst decisions it  has ever rendered--the Citizens United decision--and that decision  allowed unlimited money to flow into politics.   Of course, if you can spend unlimited money in politics, you suddenly  have an unprecedented motive to hide it. If the most you can give is  $3,500 or $5,000 from your PAC, it is not worth putting a lot of effort  into hiding that; plus, nobody really cares. But if you can give $35  million, plus, let's say you are a polluting fossil fuel company and  you don't want people to know that, now it is worth putting quite a lot  of money into the apparatus of hiding who you are. It is an expensive  apparatus. It is a real apparatus. Senators have gone to the floor  before to describe it. We have used this graphic.   This is the web of climate denial that has been chronicled by  scientists who study as a phenomenon climate denial and how the money  flies around  [[Page S4892]]  through these different groups and how they use it to hide what they  are doing on climate.   Well, once that got launched, that was the end of bipartisanship on  climate. We lost a decade. I think history will show that the lost  decade from January 2010 until now is one that these pages and children  across the country will pay a very steep price for.   Why would they be willing to do it? Well, the fossil fuel industry  has an annual subsidy of $660 billion, basically, from being allowed to  pollute for free--$660 billion.   If you are protecting a $660 billion subsidy, how much would you be  willing to spend any given year to protect it? If you spent $6.6  billion a year, you would still be earning 100 times your investment.  Sure enough, we have seen dark money explode into expenditures by the  billion. And as that happened, climate progress ended.   Look at voter suppression. Across the country, there was a wave of  Republican State legislatures passing voter suppression laws. Was it an  amazing coincidence that they all happened to do that at the same time?  Evidently not, because there is actually a tape from Heritage Action-- one of the dark money groups behind those voter suppression campaigns-- where the person briefing the big donors admitted this:         We're working with these state legislators . . . in some       cases we actually draft [the bills] for them or we have a       sentinel on our behalf give them the model legislation so it       has that grassroots, you know, from-the-bottom-up type of       vibe.    The whole thing was a dark money fake fed into these State  legislatures by dark money and no small amount.         This is a $24 million investment--    The speaker said--         We . . . started . . . right after the November election. .       . . we've driven hundreds of 1000s of calls, emails, placed       letters to the editor, hosted events, and run television and       digital ads.    So voter suppression is an artifact of dark money.   And, last, Court capture. I have got a series of speeches that I have  given so far--18 of them. When I do, I put my ``Scheme'' poster up  because this was a scheme; indeed, a scheme and a half.   At this point, what we know is that at least $580 million was spent  on phony front groups using dark money out to capture the Court. We  don't know how much additionally went into political coffers to reward  people for their Court-packing enterprise or to threaten to punish  people if they didn't go along with the Court-packing enterprise, but  it was quite a show.   This is just one little node of that $580 million Court capture  enterprise. It shows two groups, which is the current, sort of, best  practices--worst practices, better to say--in political influence. You  have a 501(c)3 and a 501(c)4 side by side, same location, same staff,  indistinguishable in any real sense. And then in this case, they pushed  what they called fictitious names so that their phony front groups had  phony front groups that had names like Judicial Education Project and  Honest Elections Project Action. But here is one that was somewhat  significant, the Judicial Crisis Network, because Judicial Crisis  Network took $15 million checks, $17 million checks and turned that  money to TV ads to stop the confirmation of Justice Garland and to push  through the confirmation of Justices Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, and Barrett.  So dark money flows into all these other areas.   If you like climate denial, you love dark money. If you like voters  having their votes suppressed by partisan legislators, you love dark  money. And if you like a captured Court that dances to the tune of the  dark money donors who stocked it, you love dark money. And that is  before we even get to its pernicious, insidious, clandestine effect in  our elections.    With that, I see that my time has expired and that Senator Grassley  is here for his time, so I yield the floor to my friend Senator  Grassley.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that with  respect to the resolution of ratification, the motion to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table and the President be  immediately notified of the Senate's action.    Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent that the  Secretary of the Senate be authorized to make grammatical, technical  changes to the resolution of ratification with respect to Treaty  Document No. 117-1 in order to reflect the addition of material.    Mr. President, I am here today as we close in on the  vote on the DISCLOSE Act scheduled for tomorrow to urge my colleagues  to vote yes on that measure. I have introduced the DISCLOSE Act in  every Congress since Leader Schumer first unveiled it in 2010 on the  heels of the wretched Citizens United decision.   Every Congress, just about every time I have set foot in Washington,  I have sounded the alarm on the ever-growing tsunami of slime that  Citizens United unleashed into our elections. I rise once more today to  urge this Chamber to end the flood of dark money drowning our  democracy.   This is not inevitable. As late as 2006, the amount of dark money  sloshing around in our elections was only $5 million. In 2020, it had  crossed the billion-dollar threshold. Big special interests don't spend  a billion dollars without expecting return on investment, and that has  damaged our democracy.   Voting to clean up that mess presents clear choices: whether or not  billionaires and big corporations can purchase influence in secret,  whether or not Americans deserve to know who is buying that influence,  whether or not corruption has a place in our American democracy.   Twelve years after Citizens United, the evidence is in. Dark money  powers up corporations and megadonors to pump billions into phony front  groups. Those groups, often with soothing names like People for Puppies  and Prosperity, then spew bile and slime into our elections. We often  can't know exactly who paid for that bile and slime, but when  corporations and the ultrarich keep getting what they want from a dark  money-funded Congress, well, you see that over and over and over again;  and Americans' suspicions grow. Their gut tells them the corporations  and billionaires are behind the phony ads in an effort to rig our  political system.   And Americans' instincts are right. Academic studies show that  economic elites and business interests command huge influence in  government policy while regular people have statistically little or  none. Studies also show that politicians elected to Federal office with  the support of dark money are more likely to support legislation  aligned with big corporate interests. Regardless of what the American  people want, the big donor interests win time after time.   Dark money isn't limited to elections either. I have come to the  floor now 18 times to expose a decades-long, rightwing scheme to  capture the Federal judiciary and its crown jewel, our Supreme Court.  This scheme included a $580 million secretive campaign of dark money  and phony front groups to pack the courts with judges selected to  green-light donor-friendly policies, running multimillion-dollar ad  campaigns to keep the confirmations of those judges and Justices on  track.   Now, the result is the Court that dark money built is delivering big  for its donor puppeteers. In a matter of days, the FedSoc Six on the  Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, manufactured new polluter- friendly legal doctrines, and threw out centuries-old gun safety  regulations--all things big donors wanted; all things majorities of  Americans did not want. What is more, one rightwing donor just dumped  $1.6 billion to supercharge the dark money operation that captured the  Court and cement that dark money network's hold over the Federal  judiciary. And guess what. We wouldn't know who that donor is if  someone hadn't tipped off the press--ProPublica and the New York Times.  Think about that. We only know this because we get occasional little  glimpses of these megadonors' covert schemes. That means this is only  the tip of the iceberg. And where that $1.6 billion goes on its way out  into our political system will be obscured in dark money channels.    No wonder Americans' trust in the government is cratering. Fifty- eight percent of voters say our government needs major reforms or a  complete overhaul. Just a quarter of Americans say they have confidence  in the Supreme Court. That is down 11 percent just from last year.  Americans know something is deeply amiss in our democracy.   Mr. President, I believe to restore trust in government, we need to  flush dark money out of government. Year after year, poll after poll,  overwhelming majorities of Americans say: money in politics and wealthy  political donors are the root of Washington's dysfunction. Election  cycle after election cycle, even during COVID, voters listed political  corruption among their most important issues. Americans no longer trust  that their voices matter here, not as much as the dark money voices of  big corporations and billionaires. And it is time to listen to them. It  is time to rid our system of the corrupting influence of unlimited dark  money.   Even the Citizens United Justices recognized that unlimited political  spending without transparency would corrupt. Even the Justices who  opened the floodgates of unlimited political spending knew that if it  was not transparent, it would corrupt. They just wouldn't do anything  about it.   The DISCLOSE Act hinges on a very simple idea: that Americans deserve  to know who is spending to influence their vote. If you agree with that  simple idea, vote for the DISCLOSE Act. If you believe that  corporations and billionaires shouldn't hide behind phony front groups  while spending gobs of money on elections, you should vote for the  DISCLOSE Act. If you oppose corruption, you should vote for the  DISCLOSE Act. It is time for every Member of this body to go on record  about this poison in our system. And with any luck, with 10 Republicans  joining us, we can return to a Congress that serves America again, and  Americans deserve that.
