 Mr. Speaker, on Friday, President  Donald Trump addressed the nation during his inaugural address by  laying out his priorities for the new administration and his future  vision for our country. Among his priorities is to incentivize private  investments in infrastructure through tax incentives and public-private  partnerships.   Tax incentives and public-private partnerships are simply two  elements that I believe should be part of a larger, more comprehensive  infrastructure plan. A truly comprehensive plan will include direct  spending and invests real dollars in both rural and urban communities  So far, the only portions of President Trump's infrastructure plan that  have been made public include $100 billion in tax breaks to private  investors. I believe that President Trump is deeply misguided in  relying solely on tax breaks to miraculously spur investments in our  decaying transportation network. We need to include a healthy mix of  direct spending, tax incentives, public-private partnerships, and  sensible public policies if we are to sufficiently address the  infrastructure needs across the country.   Our highways, railways, and airways serve as the arteries that drive  the U.S. economy. As our nation's population continues to grow and  become more diverse, the growth of our transportation infrastructure  needs to keep pace. Texas is projected to account for nearly fifteen  percent of all the national population growth through 2030. Yet, it has  become increasingly difficult to make the investments that we need to  properly maintain and build up the state's infrastructure due to  dwindling federal funding for transportation projects. President  Trump's plan in its current form falls drastically short of the  necessary steps that we must take in order to modernize our crumbling  infrastructure.   Mr. Speaker, it has been and continues to be my intention to give  President Trump a fair chance at proving to the American people that he  is serious about bringing real solutions to our nation's problems to  the table. I strongly encourage this administration to present a well- rounded infrastructure plan that goes beyond merely hand-outs to  corporations, and also includes the direct spending that is so  desperately needed.                            ____________________
