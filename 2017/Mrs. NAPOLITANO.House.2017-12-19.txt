 Mr. Speaker, I was absent during rollcall votes No.  694 through 695 due to a death in my family. Had I been present, I  would have voted ``Nay'' on H.R. 3312, Systemic Risk Designation  Improvement Act of 2017, and ``Yea'' on S. 1536, Combating Human  Trafficking in Commercial Vehicles Act.                            ____________________
