 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from  Minnesota for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I was sitting in my office, and I couldn't help hearing  that this is kitchen table economics, so I just want to reduce it down  to what kitchen table economics actually is.   This is a country that has an income of about $3.5 trillion a year.  Meaning, if you were a regular family, that means you make about  $35,000 a year. Let's reduce it to kitchen table economics.   But we then turn around and spend $6.5 trillion, so that is telling  the average family back home: Mr. and Mrs. America, understand  something, you make $35,000 a year. You should be spending $65,000 a  year and just increasing your total debt.   We are at right now is between funded and unfunded liabilities.  America is on the hook for $130 trillion. This is a pathway to  destruction. Now we are going to point fingers back and forth: Well,  you guys raised it, and you should have raised it.   Mr. Speaker, you know what? There is no such thing as a debt ceiling  here. There is no debt ceiling here. This is a sunroof. All we do is  open it any time we want to irresponsibly spend money, and we just go  ahead and keep spending and spending.   It all falls on the backs of not only our grandchildren and our  children but also on this current generation. This is absolutely insane  and totally irresponsible.
