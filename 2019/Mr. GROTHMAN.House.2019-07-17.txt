 Madam Speaker, prior to talking about the Census, I  just want to make one brief point in response to some of the debate on  the other side. I will give some of the speakers a little bit of a  project here.   When we say the Pledge of Allegiance, we pledge allegiance to the  flag and the Republic for which it stands, and perhaps some of the  speakers on the other side can do a little research as to why we pledge  allegiance to the Republic.   Today, again, we are debating because of a potential question on the  Census. There are certain people who feel that it would be wrong to ask  about citizenship on the Census.   I can tell you, as a lawmaker, I would certainly like to know how  many people in this country are citizens. I would also like to know how  many people are legal or illegal, both of which may affect decisions we  make, formulas we make here.   I have a bill up--in the past; I already introduced it this year-- that says that people who are noncitizens shouldn't be eligible for  public benefits. If that bill were ever to become law, I can easily  imagine distributions of money from this place being affected by the  results on a Census like that.   Other countries do not have problems getting numbers if they ask  about citizenship. Canada doesn't have a problem. Mexico doesn't have a  problem. That is why the United Nations recommends we ask about  citizenship.   It didn't result in bad Censuses until 1950. It doesn't result in bad  results on the long form or bad results on the Community Survey. It  doesn't result in problems in the State of Wisconsin, where we have a  citizenship question that you have to answer prior to getting a  driver's license.   So I wish we would put away this resolution today. I don't think it  is right to spend more time debating the Census question.   I hope if this does not appear on this Census, that it is eventually  put on the Census for 2030.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss the current threat  coming out of Washington to work centers or community rehabilitation  programs.   So people understand, these are what used to be referred to as  sheltered workshops.   People born with disabilities that cause people to have different  abilities than most of the rest of us have, frequently now they work in  work centers, frequently packaging or other  [[Page H5994]]  light manufacturing sort of jobs. They sometimes make minimum wage,  they sometimes make less than minimum wage.   If you have not toured one of these facilities, you have really  missed out on one of the joys of life.   Here we find people working hard, earning their own paycheck, proud  to go to work each day with friends and a social network, sometimes  working in the same place for 20 or 25 years, who feel very good about  themselves, and, quite frankly, should make the rest of us ashamed if  we are ever unhappy in our own life, seeing people so happy with the  jobs they have.   However, friends of people with different abilities, be they family  members, be they guardians, be they just next-door neighbors, have to  wake up, because there are small, powerful forces who want to shut down  these work centers.   Why do they want to do so and how are they going to do it?   They are going to do it two ways. Tomorrow, or soon, in this place,  we are going to take up what will be publicly discussed as the increase  the minimum wage bill.   However, the increase the minimum wage bill is going to do something  more than just that. It is going to get rid of 14(c) waivers for  minimum wage, which allows people to work for less than minimum wage.   This is not an oversight. We tried, in something called the Rules  Committee, to amend the minimum wage bill.   There are people out there who feel it is below people's dignity to  ever work for less than minimum wage.   People familiar with the sheltered workshops and the abilities of the  people there know that already there are people who are not going to be  able to find employment at $7.50 an hour. There is no way these folks  are going to find employment, or many of these folks are going to find  employment, at $15 an hour.   What is going to happen when you lose the ability to grant waivers  and have somebody make $3 or $4 or $5 an hour? What happens when that  disappears?   People are no longer going to be able to work in the community, they  are no longer going to be able to work at the community rehabilitation  centers.   These folks are going to wind up sitting at home. They might wind up  in day services, but in day services, you don't get the pride of going  to work. You aren't going to work every day like your parents did or  like your siblings do or like your friends do. You will no longer have  the social network that comes with every job, in which you will be able  to have the same friends, which are so vital, because family members,  parents eventually pass away. It is so important to have this other  social network.   It is so important to have the self-satisfaction that comes with  getting your own paycheck, the self-satisfaction that comes with buying  your own clothes, maybe buying gifts for relatives, that people are  going to lose if there are no jobs at all.   The people who don't like community work centers are also on the  attack in the Department of Education. And there, they want to remove  the ability for folks in this situation to have competitive integrated  employment. They feel we are isolating people in these facilities.   First of all, I implore all of my colleagues and anybody who cares  about people born with different abilities, to tour facilities like  this. Folks in these facilities are not segregated away in some dark  corner.   Like I said, if you meet them, they are so happy and proud to show  visitors the work they are doing. They are more happy than even the  average citizen in our society to get their own paycheck and deposit it  in a bank and know that they are buying their own clothes or buying  things for other people.   Everybody should see what we have an opportunity to lose and  everybody should ponder what will happen when these facilities are  gone, because we are in a situation in which employers are not going to  be able to afford to spend $15 an hour for a lot of these folks, just  as right now employers are not able to spend $7.50 for these folks.   What they will also find is many folks like working in the work  centers and prefer working in the work centers to other places in  society.   Just as people with different abilities perhaps prefer participating  in Special Olympics or prefer going to special church services with  people in similar situations, folks like this frequently prefer working  with their friends in the sheltered workshop. They feel very good about  the situation.   When these radicals succeed in closing the local work center, it is  very difficult for folks like this. Even if you were able to find  another job in the community with a work coach, you are no longer  working with your friends, you no longer have the continuity of perhaps  working with the same people, both in management and on the floor, for  20 or 25 years.   If you get a job at a fast food restaurant, even if you are able to  work a few hours a week there, there is much more turnover. And  frequently people do not like the stress that comes with not working  with other people in their own situation.   It is time for the parents, the employees, just friends of people  with disabilities to stand up and tell Congress, ``Do not be swayed by  a loud minority.''   It bothers me when bossy people in Washington think they know what is  best for people around the country. It bothers me when they feel that  way about anybody, but it especially bothers me when they feel that way  about the most vulnerable members of society, because I am convinced  there is a loud majority of people, both the people with disabilities  and relatives of people with disabilities, who just think that the work  centers are going to be there forever.   The time has come to fight for the work centers, because there is a  radical group who philosophically, apparently, thinks that when the  minimum wage is $15 an hour, that jobs are going to spring up for these  folks, and that they can shut down the work centers, and that employers  are going to say, Sure. We can afford--whatever that is--$600 a week to  have someone like this work for us.   Guess what? You are going to find almost no jobs. You may find a few  employers, kind of as a charity type of thing, will take people in for  3 or 4 hours a week, but that is not like having a job for 30 or 40  hours a week like everybody else in society has.   These folks do not want to feel different. They do not want to be  different than everybody else. They want to be like their siblings and  their friends and their parents and go to work 30 or 35 hours in a  week.   Just like the rest of us, they like to socialize and have friends who  have worked in the same offices or the same factories for years.   They do not want to be working 2 or 3 hours a week or not at all.  They do not want to be in a situation in which they are stuck with a  job coach.   Now, I happened to bring along some testimonials that have floated  onto my desk as examples, from either people who work in the work  centers or parents of people who work in the work centers, and this is  typical of what you will find, whether you talk to the parents or the  employees.   Here is a story, Yael Kerzan's story. And I will just read bits of  them.   ``Yael does not feel segregated at Northwoods''--which is the local  community rehabilitation work center--``because it is a community to  her. She values socializing with her longtime friends. The work she  does at her CRP helps her be more productive and appropriate'' at a job  outside of the work center. ``In addition, Yael's CRP provides a place  for her to work when she is not at her'' independent job.   ``She does not want to stay home, watch TV and do nothing. If she was  not working, she would be miserable. In fact, Yael happily gets up  every morning at 4:30a so she has plenty of time to be ready by 6:50a  for her ride to work.''   Which, by the way, is typical. I think folks like this have much more  pride with their job than a lot of people who at least appear to be  born with more.   ``Yael wants to work and feel valued. She takes great pride in  earning her paychecks and contributing to the household expenses. Yael  does not care if she earns minimum wage or not. She feels she is  compensated fairly by the special wage she is paid. She understands  that she does not work as fast as'' some other folks, ``and therefore  is paid according to her productivity.  [[Page H5995]]    ``Yael would rather be paid the special wage than participate in day  services'', which amounts to babysitting, whatever else they call it.   Next, another woman from Wisconsin.   I want to voice my opinion of passing the bill affecting 14(c).   ``I do not want to see sheltered workshops close. Workshops are a  meaningful way of life for many people born with disabilities.   ``I am not against rehabilitation for individuals that rehabilitation  may work for. But believe me, not all individuals born with  disabilities are able to work outside of sheltered employment.    ``My sister is one. She has been through DVR, has been employed  several times, at several different jobs, only to fail. All was well  when the job coach was present; not so when they weren't.   ``She was abused emotionally and physically by employers. She got the  jobs no one else wanted or would do. I could go on and on.''   This woman, again, says her sister would be incredibly damaged if  they got rid of the local sheltered workshop.   Another person, talking about his daughter. ``Save for 200 sight- words, she remains illiterate, unable to read or write at a level  commensurate with the rest of the adult world, unable to discern  character differences in others (which has led to others taking unfair  advantage of her time and again), unable to grasp complex subject  matter or multipart instruction, unable to understand numbers, let  alone grasp the concept of arithmetic,'' it makes it very difficult for  her to do normal independent employment.   ``Thankfully, the only positive light in her'' life ``has been the  Black Hills Works here in Rapid City, South Dakota . . .'', here again,  a community support provider.   Another example of a person with different abilities, whose joy in  life comes from working at the work center. And we have people who want  to shut down these work centers because they feel the people are  segregated there.                                time  2115    And we have people who want to shut down the work centers because  they feel, for some bizarre reason, that there is no dignity in working  for less than $7.50 an hour, or soon to say there is no dignity in  working for less than $15 an hour.   I realize this isn't primarily what the minimum wage bill is about.  But, again, I will emphasize, it is not accidental that they are  getting rid of the right to work for less than minimum wage. These  people know exactly what they are doing.   There were opportunities to amend this bill in committee and  opportunities to amend this bill in the Rules Committee, and we will  not have a chance to make exceptions for these people with different  abilities on the floor. There are radicals who believe it should be  against the law for them to work for less than $15 an hour, which  means, as a practical matter, it will be against the law for them to  work.   And what it will do is it means they will have to go back either to  sitting at home watching TV or going to work centers, which is, like I  said, tantamount to babysitting. Maybe nice babysitting. But they will  know very well they are no longer working like normal productive  people. They will know very well that now they are just being taken  care of and babysat.   These adult people should have the right to work. It is not up to  these people in Congress, or people in the Department of Education, or  the Department of Labor to tell them it is against the law to work for  $5 an hour, particularly given their situation.   Another testimonial:   ``My husband and I are parents of identical twin sons, 35 years of  age, who have autism, schizophrenia, seizure disorder, and they  stutter.   ``They have received services from Black Hills Works, a community  support provider, in Rapid City, South Dakota, since the end of the  fiscal year when they reached their 21st birthday.   ``Because of this sheltered work environment, they were able to learn  basic job skills, which have now enabled them to obtain employment in  the competitive work realm.   ``Because of their autism and mental health issues, it takes a long  time and a lot of patience to develop routines that help them adjust to  the rigors of a workplace . . . ''   They were only able to do this because of the 14(c) waivers, which  allow them to work for less than minimum wage.   ``My son Jonathan is a delightful, nonverbal, autistic 20-year-old  man. Powerfully built, he has a supercharged energy and a deep well of  affection for loved ones and his iTunes library.   ``But Jonny is also profoundly intellectually impaired. Accomplishing  even simple tasks requires vigorous prompting and continuous oversight,  and chances are that along the way he might bite, stand on, or even  throw his chair. As muscular and lovable though he may be, his chances  of landing a competitive job are exactly zero.''   But I am sure Jonathan, right now, is proud of the job he has. I am  sure, like all the people I see when I tour my workshops, they are so  proud to show me what they have accomplished, they are so proud to talk  about their paycheck, and they are so proud to talk about the new  Packers jersey they bought or whatever. You are taking that right away  from people by having people in Washington, who think they know better,  say: No, Jonathan, just go out in the community. Find your $15-an-hour  job.   Guess what? Jonathan ain't going to find a $15-an-hour job, and  Jonathan is going to lose the joy he has and the satisfaction he has in  the job he currently has.         I am Leslie and I am disabled. Eventually I will be able to       go in the community and make minimum wage, maybe, although       some people may not be able to work out in the community.        I think it would be sad if they do not have the option to       make less than minimum wage. These folks look out for each       other.        I started my first support employment program in 1985 and       strongly believe in the right to access employment and to       receive necessary accommodations.    The use of 14(c) is a necessity. Many people with significant  disabilities cannot successfully perform a job to industry standards.  14(c) opens the door to those who fit in this picture. It allows the  person to actually set his or her own standard and to increase pay as  their performance improves. We need a full range of services and to  recognize the reality of challenges many people have and then to  support their strengths through 14(c) and other accommodations.   I will also point out that people who are asked to work in the  community may be able to work in the community but don't like it  because of the stress it puts on them to do a job that is very  difficult for them to do. A lot of times what happens is some of these  folks find a job for maybe 4 or 5 hours a week in the community and 30  hours a week in the work center. Frequently, they prefer their job in  the work center because it is at a pace which they are more comfortable  handling. And they are working with people who are the same people they  have worked with over a period of years.   Another testimonial:         I like working here and I make less than minimum wage.       People should have the option to work at a company that pays       less than minimum wage or work in the community and make       minimum wage. I don't want to work in the community. I like       coming here and making friends also with my coworkers and       making money.    What these people are doing is they are taking away the freedom from  people. I think it is so arrogant for people who purport to be looking  out for the disabled people in our society to say, I am taking away an  option from you because I know best. Again and again you meet people  who are very happy in the work centers and it is horrible to take away  that option.         I had a job about 10 years ago, but I got very sick and I       lost it. I am here making boxes and palletizing and going       to class and stuff. I like to come to work and continue       making money every day.        I know I don't make minimum wage. It is okay I don't make       minimum wage. I am not as fast as I used to be. I like my       friends. I love my job. I don't like to stay at home. It is       boring.    I hope we don't take away this guy's option.         I work in the community at Publix, but I don't get very       many hours.        14(c) helps me supplement my hours so I have something to       do when I am not at the grocery store and can still make some       money.        If the workshop went away, I would have to find someplace       else. I like coming here and it gives me something to do and       helps my friend.   [[Page H5996]]     Here, I am going to make a point. A lot of these folks do find  something in the community for 4 or 5 hours a week. Now, I am going to  let people wonder when somebody works only 4 or 5 hours a week,  particularly in this employment, why that is. Some of these lack-of- common-sense advocates feel that if somebody is able to find a job for  4 hours a week at the local grocery store, they should be able to find  a job for 36 hours a week at the local grocery store.   I will tell you, if you talk to the owners of these places, which are  very nice people, frequently they are giving out jobs kind of as a  community service, which is why these folks are only working 4 to 6  hours a week at one of these places. They are not going to be able to  get jobs for 35 or 36 hours a week.   And when the sheltered workshop closes, it is not going to be  replaced with a job in the community. It is going to be hour after hour  sitting at home watching TV, or it is going to be at day services,  which amounts to babysitting.   They are going to lose the satisfaction and pride that comes with  work, and they are going to lose the independence of getting their own  paycheck and not being as dependent on government support.         I like getting a paycheck. I used to have a job in the       community, but I fell and couldn't keep up. I love working in       the workshop until I can get another job in the community. If       there was no workshop, I would just color all day. I like       having work to do.    Bingo. And there are people who would be happy to just have day  services and have somebody color all day and not have the satisfaction  of having a job.         I am a person with a disability who knows that not everyone       can work in a job in the community. It takes hard work in       being able to follow directions. Sometimes bosses are hard on       you and want you to do more than you can. It is not easy to       have a job and follow all the rules. I have friends who got       fired or quit because it is hard.        Why can't people with disabilities have choices?    Some people might say they want to work, but when they do leave a  sheltered workshop, they come back because it is hard out there in the  work world. Maybe there are some agencies holding people back who  really can work, bagging groceries or doing janitorial work. But there  are very good agencies out there who are giving people with significant  disabilities an opportunity to earn money because they can't work in  the community. Please, please, please consider people with IDD and low  IQ and not make this work go away.         I have many regular jobs, but I like my program because it       is not as stressful and more understanding. Staff are easy to       talk to and you don't have to worry if the place will be       staffed. Someone is there.        Regular jobs are a lot harder. Applications are online, and       that is not easy. Some people are not understanding in a       competitive job. Communication is hard. They don't understand       disabilities.        I don't get minimum wage, but it is not worth it. The more       work I do, my pay goes up. I am not forced to do anything I       can't do. Breaks and hours are better than at another job. I       feel like I work more on a team than I ever have. Other jobs       don't give you enough time. I think my program is cool and       gets people ready for regular jobs, if they want to.        Don't take away 14(c). It would hurt me. I get to be with       my friends and make money, too.    Again, this person is pointing out that frequently people in these  work centers are working with people with similar abilities, they enjoy  being with people with similar abilities, and it is more stressful not  being with people with these abilities. So even if other jobs are  available, you are sometimes hurting these people, and you should not  be telling them what they should be doing.         I work at a 14(c) program. Programs like mine perform a       valuable service by offering much-needed alternatives to       workplace environments that people with intellectual       disabilities may not be totally comfortable with. The staff       are much more tolerant and understanding of the difficulties       that people with disabilities have versus staff at a CI       environment.        Ever since I was a little kid, people such as teachers and       relatives have all tried to push me to be as normal as       possible, but with programs like this I can be myself.    I guess I will wrap it up. There are other testimonials that I can  read. I will wrap it up by saying that the silent majority has to speak  up.   And I would strongly encourage my colleagues to tour the local work  centers. It will make them feel better to see how these people are  working. It will make them feel better to see the pride that these  folks take in a job.   If they talk to them, they will tell them how much they enjoy working  in the work center. And then they can ask themselves, if this minimum  wage bill passes as is, if the new rules that are proposed in the  Department of Education go forward, they will ask themselves, What will  become of these folks?   They should feel very guilty when they charge ahead, not paying  attention to what the most vulnerable members of society will have  happen to them, because people in this institution, or bureaucrats a  few buildings away, have decided that they know best what is for people  other than themselves and have decided against all common sense that  everybody in our society is capable of making $15 an hour.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 9 o'clock and 28 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Thursday, July 18, 2019, at 9 a.m.                            ____________________
