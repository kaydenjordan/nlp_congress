 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the  passage of the Global Respect Act. I thank Congressman Cicilline for  sponsoring this legislation and also Chairman Meeks and the Speaker for  bringing it to the floor.   Human dignity is a basic human right, yet LGBTQ individuals are often  targets for harassment, violence, and even death, simply based on their  sexual orientation or gender identity.   As chair of the State, Foreign Operations Appropriations  Subcommittee, I am committed to protecting and promoting the human  rights and dignity of all people, especially those who are marginalized  and most vulnerable, such as LGBTQ individuals.   I am so proud that in the House FY22 SFOPS bill we provided $15  million for the Global Equality Fund at the State Department and $10  million for the protection of LGBTQ persons at USAID.   The Global Respect Act will ensure that the administration has the  tools it needs to advance the rights of all human beings, regardless of  who they are or who they love. This bill upholds our core values of  tolerance and compassion for our fellow human beings. I want to  congratulate this body for voting for this bill today.                            ____________________
