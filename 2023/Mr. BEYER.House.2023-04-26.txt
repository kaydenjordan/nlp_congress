 Mr. Speaker, I rise to oppose the default on America act.  America always pays its bills. It is important that we have serious  negotiations and that we take responsible action to address our  continuing deficits.   Mr. Speaker, $31 trillion in public debt is a frightening number, but  it is a debt we accumulated over Republican and Democratic Presidents,  Republican and Democratic Congresses, two unpaid for wars, major tax  cuts, and costly increases in healthcare.   It is reckless and irresponsible to use the alleged leverage of a  national default to address our debt--first, because the leverage is  imaginary. This bill is dead on arrival in the Senate.   Second, the leverage already exists. Kevin McCarthy is Speaker. The  Republicans have a 222-213 majority in the House.   The last thing we want to do is plunge our Nation into the threat of  a default or an actual default. The responsible thing to do is to pass  this clean debt ceiling relief and move on to the appropriations  process where the debt can be properly addressed.
