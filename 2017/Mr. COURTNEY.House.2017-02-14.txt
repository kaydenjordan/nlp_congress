 Mr. Speaker, at 11 p.m. last night, the UConn women's  basketball team once again stunned the sporting world and, really, the  Nation by winning their 100th straight win against a very good team,  the University of South Carolina.   Again, Mr. Speaker, the UConn women just continue to defy the laws of  gravity. They have won 11 NCAA titles, again, shattering all records  before them, and the 100th win was exceeding the last record which the  UConn women set a number of years ago in terms of consecutive wins.   Coach Geno Auriemma has an extraordinary program, which has almost a  perfect record of graduation. These are true student athletes. Last  night, Gabby Williams, Napheesa Collier, Kia Nurse, and Crystal  Dangerfield once again made us proud in the State of Connecticut to be  the home of real champions.   Again, congratulations. You are in unchartered waters now at 100 wins  and counting, and we look forward to more success in the future.   Go Huskies.  [[Page H1162]]                                ____________________
