 Madam Speaker, the facts are clear. To  quote the USA Today editorial board: ``Trump used your tax dollars to  shake down a vulnerable foreign government to interfere in a U.S.  election for his personal benefit.''   The rule of law is what gives our great country its strength.   The rule of law is what separates us from Third World countries,  where dictators reign for decades on end.   The rule of law is what makes us the envy of the world, the place  that other countries look to as they grow their own democracies.   It is the rule of law that brings us here today.   We never want to see the rule of law deteriorate or rampant  corruption take hold.   We never want to see the day when future generations flee for refuge  in another country, the way that others are seeking refuge on our  southern border right now.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.'' American values  and our Constitution are worth fighting for.
