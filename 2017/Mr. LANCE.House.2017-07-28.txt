 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of permanently  authorizing the E-Verify system and requiring U.S. employers to use the  system to ensure their employees are eligible to be working in the  United States.   I am proud to be a partner with United States Senator Grassley of  Iowa in offering legislation to do so, entitled ``The Accountability  Through Electronic Verification Act.''   E-Verify is a proven system for making sure job opportunities are for  American workers. E-Verify is a deterrent against illegal immigration.  Expanding it to new workplaces will make sure legal American workers  are not shut out of employment.   There are 700,000 American businesses that successfully use the E- Verify system. There is no cost for the employer or employee to use E- Verify, and our legislation will make sure that there are no costs  passed onto businesses, their employees, or to customers.   We should be considering practical solutions that remove incentives  for illegal migration into the United States. We need E-Verify up and  running, and we need all employers to participate to make it effective.   I urge cosponsorship and collaborations from both sides of the aisle  to implement this effective policy.                            ____________________
