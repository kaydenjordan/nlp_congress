 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from North Carolina  (Mr. McHenry) for the work that he has done on H.R. 1219, the  Supporting America's Innovators Act, and the entire Financial Services  Committee for their work on this important topic.   As chairman of the House Small Business Committee--and I would note  that you have here not only the Republican chair, but we just heard  speak the ranking member of the Small Business Committee, Ms.  Velazquez; both in support of this legislation. It is bipartisan,  which, as Patrick McHenry mentioned, doesn't happen around here often  enough, but it did in this case.   I often hear from entrepreneurs and small-business folks that the  process to obtain capital is too rigid for them to expand and create  jobs. Access to capital is a major issue that we need to address, and  that is what we are doing here.   When it comes to helping small businesses get off the ground, no  effort we can make is too small. The Supporting America's Innovators  Act could make all the difference for an entrepreneur, and that is why,  again, we are here to support it.   Commonsense reforms like this one, which raises the cap on the number  of people who can invest in a venture fund, can go a long way for the  Nation's entrepreneurs, startups, and small businesses. With 28 small  businesses in the United States and nearly half of all private sector  workers employed by one, the Nation's economic future lies squarely  with this Nation's smallest companies and firms.   Those who risk everything and sacrifice much to take a shot at  building the next great American company should be operating in a  business environment that is free from overly burdensome rules and  regulations. They should be able to concentrate on expanding their  companies, gaining more customers, and job creation, not compliance  issues and outdated capital formation rules that prevent the largest  pool of investors from investing in these companies.   As this economic recovery continues to take shape, let's stand with  our small businesses and create an environment for growth. This bill is  another important step in that direction.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  support this very good legislation.
