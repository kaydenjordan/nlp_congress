 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Madam Speaker, this is a great day for us. We worked with Chairman  Neal on this and   Joe Courtney. I don't normally go out on a limb, but  it is nice to see a bunch of Irish guys get together--I am not sure you  can say that anymore in the people's House--to make sure that we are  protecting so many people who have earned healthcare through their  employer.   I think the last couple days, if you were to look at what happened  here in the House and you were to go back home and talk to people back  home, they would ask, ``Can't you guys get along on anything? Can't you  put away these things you fight over and actually start to talk about  the things that help us? Can't you do things like that?''   We have watched it, Madam Speaker, and I am sure people are back home  saying, ``They can't do anything.''   Well, I am here to tell you today that is just not true. You are  going to see a bipartisan effort today on a bipartisan bill to make  sure that hardworking Americans get to keep their employer-sponsored  healthcare.   Those are people in labor unions. Those are people in everyday  businesses: small businesses, big businesses, all across the board.   What we are doing today is a move in the right direction. What we are  doing today is truly bipartisan, and we hope it becomes bicameral.   Today you are going to see both Republicans and Democrats come  together to do the right thing for the right reasons, and good things  are going to come of that.   It just doesn't get any better than this, especially at a time when  you go back home and people just look at us and say, ``Holy smokes. On  the floor of the people's House, you guys can't get along on  anything?''   Well, we are. We are going to get along on something. And we are  going to do something that is really big, and we are going to pass H.R.  748, the Middle Class Health Benefits Tax Repeal Act. It is also known  as the Cadillac tax.   I happen to be a Cadillac dealer. Cadillac has forever been described  as the standard of the world.   The healthcare piece we are talking about is a standard of the world.  And so many times in the past it was described as, this is just too  darn generous for generations of people who  [[Page H5960]]  went to the bargaining table and negotiated, as part of their labor  agreements, healthcare.                                time  1630    Too generous? Too good?   For all those who thought that was a good statement or a good idea,  that is just too bad because it was terrible. It made no sense.   Today, we are going to change that. We are going to take the time we  have today on the floor to talk about it, to talk to our colleagues and  say we all need to be on board with this.   By the way, the gentleman knows this because we have been working on  it for a long time. It is the gentleman's bill this session, but it has  gone back and forth, depending on who the majority is.   This is the end of today's talking when it comes to partisan gridlock  because it is not going to happen. Much like Mark Twain when he was  overseas one time, in London, and somebody printed in the paper that  Mark Twain was not only ill but that he had died. Mark Twain replied,  ``The reports of my death are greatly exaggerated.''   Let's use that today when we talk about the fact that we can't get  along here in the people's House.   The gentleman and I have worked hard on this. Last Congress, we had  304 cosponsors. This Congress, our legislation has more than 370  cosponsors. That is the majority of both parties, Democratic and  Republican.   Our bill is going to repeal this onerous tax, originally passed as  part of the Affordable Care Act, that would have been assessed on any  health plan that would provide more than $10,200 for individual  coverage, $27,500 for family coverage.   I deplore the fact that it was called too generous for hardworking  Americans who get up every day and go off to work to make sure they can  put a roof over the head of their family, food on the table, clothes on  the backs of their kids, and somehow plan for the future. If that is a  bad benefit, I want to see what a good one looks like.   According to researchers, it is projected--I think Chairman Neal just  went over some of these numbers--that 75 percent of employer-sponsored  health plans would be affected if we allow this tax to stand.   That was put in the Affordable Care Act, but it was never enforced.  Today, we have a chance to do away with it fully, just repeal it. That  is what we are trying to get to.   The groups that support this legislation go across the board. There  are millions of workers waiting for us to do something today to act in  their best interests. More than 665 organizations have weighed in, in  support of repealing this tax.   It is absolutely an incredible effort that is going to take place  today. I can't say this enough: It is a bipartisan effort by the  majority of both parties to get this done for hardworking Americans, to  protect not only themselves but their families.   It is a benefit of generational negotiations. It is an incredible  piece of legislation that we are going to get through today.   I could keep talking about this forever. I can't wait to get back  home again to tell people we got it done. Keep in mind, I am going to  say that ``we got it done,'' not that ``I got it done.''   I have never seen another place where people take credit for  legislation that they had nothing to do with, that they kind of  inherited from previous sessions and say, ``Well, this is my bill.''   This is not my bill. This is a bill that we have been trying to pull  off for many, many years, not just me, not just   Joe Courtney, but  together, all of us, Republicans and Democrats, acting in the best  interests of the people we represent here on the floor of the people's  House.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Nunes).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Estes).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Banks).    Madam Chair, may I inquire how much time  is left.    I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance  of my time.   I want to thank my colleagues on the other side.   There is an old saying in life that sometimes you get a second chance  to do the right thing. Eight years ago when the Affordable Care Act was  passed, I am sure it was an oversight or an undersight or just not  actually understanding what was taking place that day, my colleagues on  the other side at that point were looking to pass the Affordable Care  Act, and one of the victims in that was employer-sponsored insurance.   We referred to it today as the ``Cadillac tax,'' and I am glad we  used that term, quite frankly. I told you earlier I am a Cadillac  dealer, so I am really happy to hear it. Any time anybody thinks  something is outstanding, they call it a Cadillac.   But what we are going to do today has nothing to do with fancy cars.  It has nothing to do with extravagant health plans, but it does have  everything to do with punishing hardworking Americans and their  families. What we are doing today is a crucial step toward protecting  employer-sponsored health insurance for all Americans.   Again, as I said earlier, we are doing the right things for the right  reasons for the right people, not just Republicans, not just Democrats,  but every single American out there who gets his or her health  insurance through their employer.   It is a remarkable thing to see happen here on the people's floor,  the people's House, where we come together and agree that we can fix a  wrong, we can right a wrong, we can make things right that we maybe had  a different look at 8 years ago but we decided today that it just  really makes sense to do that.   I want to give a special thank-you, though, to my good friends   Tom  Reed and Josh Gottheimer for forming the Problem Solvers Caucus. In the  rules package this year, they were able to bring up a rule that says if  you get 290 sponsors or cosponsors on a piece of legislation, that  needs to come forward.     Joe Courtney has worked on this for many years, and we have already  talked about the number of people who were already on board and ready  to see this come forward, but it just couldn't get through the  procedures to get to the floor. And I think when I go back home, people  would say to me, if you have so many people that agree on the same  thing and are doing the right thing for the right reasons, why can't  you get it done? And then you have to say: Well, you know what? Not  only do you not understand it, I don't either.                                time  1700    If we are acting in the best interests of the people we represent,  then we should be able to do these things. So sometimes you take a look  at what is holding you back from doing the right thing and you say  there is something in the rules that needs to change, and that has  taken place today.   But the really great part of it is--the really great part, is that  Republicans and Democrats are coming together in the peoples' House and  doing the right thing, ensuring, at least from our part of the  Congress, that we can repeal this onerous tax on hardworking Americans.   So I am so glad to be here today and I am so thankful. Working with    Joe Courtney has been absolutely marvelous. The gentleman has really  had staying power. He has never given up on this. He has stayed on it  and stayed on it and stayed on it. There is an old saying: Play through  the whistle.   I have got to tell you, Madam Speaker, in this case,   Joe Courtney  played through the echo of the whistle. He never gave up.   So to be here with my colleagues today and coming to a conclusion  that this is the right thing for us to do is really good.   Madam Speaker, I want to thank my friends that came here and spoke  today on behalf of our side of the aisle for supporting this.   We have had an opportunity this afternoon to do something, to do  something not for ourselves, but for the people who sent us here to  represent them.   Madam Speaker, having said that, I would urge all of my colleagues to  vote in support of this piece of legislation and pass it and send it on  to the Senate, where we would hope they would understand that at this  end of the Capitol, there is overwhelming support for hardworking  Americans and their healthcare.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas  and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
