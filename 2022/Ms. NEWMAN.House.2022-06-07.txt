 Madam Speaker, I thank Chairwoman Velazquez for all her  great work on the Small Business Committee.   I rise in strong support of my bipartisan bill, the HUBZone Price  Evaluation Preference Clarification Act. This legislation is designed  to expand contracting opportunities to millions of small businesses  located in historically underutilized business zones.   More specifically, it would clarify the program's price evaluation  language to ensure adequate spending toward HUBZone small businesses,  giving more communities the resources they need to build vibrantly. We  must ensure that small business in every community is and can benefit  from Federal contracting.   By passing this legislation, we will take a crucial step toward a  more equitable distribution of resources to small businesses throughout  our country. I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this legislation.
