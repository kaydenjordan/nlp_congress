 Madam Speaker, as dean of the Texas  Congressional delegation, I rise to express my condolences on the  passing of Congressman Ron Wright of Arlington. In his death, Congress  has lost a statesman, Texas has lost a dedicated Representative, and I  have lost a dear friend.   Congressman Wright was an energetic and bright presence in our  delegation. He had a passion for public service, and was willing to  work with anyone, regardless of party or politics, to get things done.   He leaves behind a legacy that will inspire future generations of  Texans to commit themselves to public service. Though his presence will  certainly be missed, we will find comfort in knowing that his memory  will always be with us.   Madam Speaker, I now yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Brady),  my colleague and ranking member of the House Ways and Means Committee.    Madam Speaker, I ask that we all rise for a  moment of silence.    Mr. Speaker, I offer a privileged resolution  and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution as follows:                                 H. Res. 155         Resolved, That the House has heard with profound sorrow of       the death of the Honorable Ronald J. Wright, a Representative       from the State of Texas.        Resolved, That the Clerk communicate these resolutions to       the Senate and transmit a copy thereof to the family of the       deceased.        Resolved, That when the House adjourns today, it adjourn as       a further mark of respect to the memory of the deceased.   The resolution was agreed to.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________
