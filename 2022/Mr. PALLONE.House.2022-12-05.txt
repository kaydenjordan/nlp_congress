 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 198) to require the Federal Communications Commission to  incorporate data on maternal health outcomes into its broadband health  maps, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                   S. 198         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Data Mapping to Save Moms'       Lives Act''.       SEC. 2. MAPPING BROADBAND CONNECTIVITY AND MATERNAL HEALTH                     OUTCOMES.         (a) Incorporation of Maternal Mortality and Severe Maternal       Morbidity Data.--Not later than 180 days after the date of       the enactment of this Act, the Federal Communications       Commission shall incorporate publicly available data on       maternal mortality and severe maternal morbidity, including       for not less than 1 year postpartum, into the Mapping       Broadband Health in America platform of the Commission.        (b) Consultation With CDC.--The Federal Communications       Commission shall consult with the Director of the Centers for       Disease Control and Prevention regarding the maternal       mortality and severe maternal morbidity data that should be       incorporated under subsection (a).     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on S. 198.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in strong support of S. 198, the Data Mapping to Save Moms'  Lives Act.   The United States has the highest rate of maternal mortality across  developed nations. And while maternal mortality and morbidity are  problems that affect women throughout the country, these concerns are  especially pronounced in Black and Native American communities.   Maternal mortality rates for Black women are three times higher than  those of White women, and the rate of death for American Indians and  Alaska Native women is two times higher. This is simply unacceptable,  and we should be taking action to reverse these disturbing numbers.   Technology, Mr. Speaker, has a role to play but requires modern  connectivity like high-speed broadband to provide the most potential.  For instance, access to telehealth services like routine checkups,  health monitoring, and updated prescriptions can go a long way in  ensuring the health and safety of both the mother and child.   This legislation before us today seeks to help lawmakers, public  health officials, and the public at large to consider issues of  connectivity and maternal health outcomes in tandem. Once implemented,  it will provide a better idea for how connectivity and health data  intersect. This will help us better target telehealth services to  vulnerable populations in communities at risk of maternal mortality and  morbidity.   Specifically, Mr. Speaker, it will require the FCC to integrate  publicly available data related to maternal health, including mortality  and severe morbidity, into its Mapping Broadband Health in America  platform. The FCC will be required to consult with the Centers for  Disease Control and Prevention to determine the right data to include  for this effort.   We have worked closely with our Senate colleagues to get this  legislation enacted, and I want to acknowledge and thank Senators Rosen  and Fischer for their leadership on the bill. This bipartisan Senate  bill incorporates the text of the House-passed version championed by  Representatives Butterfield, Bilirakis, and Lisa Blunt Rochester.   This initiative, Mr. Speaker, combined with other good work that we  in the executive branch have done, will help us better understand the  communications barriers that some pregnant women face so that we can  explore connectivity policies that help keep these women safe and  healthy.   Mr. Speaker, for these reasons, I urge my colleagues to support S.  198, the Data Mapping to Save Moms' Lives Act in a bipartisan manner,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I, once again, urge that we support this  bill on a bipartisan basis, and I urge all my colleagues to support it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 4052) to reauthorize a program for early detection, diagnosis,  and treatment regarding deaf and hard-of-hearing newborns, infants, and  young children, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 4052         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Early Hearing Detection and       Intervention Act of 2022''.       SEC. 2. REAUTHORIZATION OF PROGRAM FOR EARLY DETECTION,                     DIAGNOSIS, AND TREATMENT REGARDING DEAF AND                     HARD-OF-HEARING NEWBORNS, INFANTS, AND YOUNG                     CHILDREN.         Section 399M of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C.       280g-1) is amended--        (1) in subsection (e), by inserting ``(3)'' before ``The       term `medical evaluation' ''; and        (2) in subsection (f)--        (A) in paragraph (1), by striking ``$17,818,000 for fiscal       year 2018, $18,173,800 for fiscal year 2019, $18,628,145 for       fiscal year 2020, $19,056,592 for fiscal year 2021, and       $19,522,758 for fiscal year 2022'' and inserting       ``$17,818,000 for each of fiscal years 2023 through 2027'';       and        (B) in paragraph (2), by striking ``$10,800,000 for fiscal       year 2018, $11,026,800 for fiscal year 2019, $11,302,470 for       fiscal year 2020, $11,562,427 for fiscal year 2021, and       $11,851,488 for fiscal year 2022'' and inserting       ``$10,760,000 for each of fiscal years 2023 through 2027''.       SEC. 3. GAO STUDY ON STATE EARLY HEARING DETECTION AND                     INTERVENTION PROGRAMS.         (a) In General.--The Comptroller General of the United       States shall conduct a study reviewing State early hearing       detection and intervention (in this section referred to as       ``EHDI'') programs. Such study shall--        (1) analyze how information collected through such programs       informs what is known about EHDI activities to ensure that       newborns, infants, and young children have access to timely       hearing screenings and early interventions, including       information on any disparities in such access;        (2) analyze what is known about how parents use State EHDI       websites to seek health and programmatic guidance related to       their child's hearing loss diagnosis; and        (3) identify efforts and any promising practices of the       Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Health       Resources and Services Administration, the National Institute       on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders, and State EHDI       programs--        (A) to address disparities in outreach for, or access to,       timely hearing screenings and early interventions; and        (B) to ensure that EHDI follow-up services are communicated       and made available to medically underserved populations,       including racial and ethnic minorities.        (b) Report.--Not later than 2 years after the date of the       enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General shall--        (1) complete the study under subsection (a) and submit a       report on the results of the study to--        (A) the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of       Representatives; and        (B) the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions       of the Senate; and        (2) make such report publicly available.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on S. 4052.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of S. 4052, the Early Hearing  Detection and Intervention Act. Last year, we passed the House version  of this bill, H.R. 5561, which was sponsored by Health Subcommittee  Ranking Member Guthrie and Representative Matsui. I thank both of them  for their leadership on this issue.   Over the last 20 years, Mr. Speaker, we have been very successful in  addressing one of the most common birth defects affecting America's  children: congenital hearing loss. Children with this condition are  born with hearing loss and are at risk for delays in speech, language,  social, and emotional development.   Fortunately, early detection and intervention is highly effective in  preventing these adverse effects.   Since 2000, Congress has passed and subsequently reauthorized Early  Hearing Detection and Intervention programs, also known as EHDI  programs. These programs support State and territory programs and  systems of care to identify and support children who are deaf or hard  of hearing. Thanks to these programs, early hearing loss screening,  diagnosis, and treatment services have greatly increased over the last  two decades.   Consider that before 1993, only 1 in 10 newborns were screened for  hearing loss. Today, according to data from the Centers for Disease and  Prevention, 97 percent of all infants are screened within the first  month of their lives. Furthermore, 60 percent of infants receive  audiological evaluations and diagnosis by 3 months of age, and 72  percent of infants were enrolled in early intervention services before  they are 6 months old. These are remarkable achievements that help  ensure all children with hearing loss have the same opportunities as  children who can hear.   Today, we are considering a bill that will help us build on these  achievements. S. 4052, the Early Hearing Detection and Intervention  Act, would extend critical funding for EHDI programs for 5 years  through fiscal year 2027. This legislation will ensure that these  services continue to be available for children who are deaf or hard of  hearing.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support this bipartisan  bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, again, I urge all Members to vote for this  on a bipartisan basis and mention that when it passes today that it  will go to the President's desk.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and concur in  the Senate amendment to the bill (H.R. 1193) to amend title IV of the  Public Health Service Act to direct the Director of the National  Institutes of Health, in consultation with the Director of the National  Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, to establish a program under which  the Director of the National Institutes of Health shall support or  conduct research on valvular heart disease, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the Senate amendment is as follows:   Senate amendment:          Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the       following:       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Cardiovascular Advances in       Research and Opportunities Legacy Act''.       SEC. 2. HHS VALVULAR HEART DISEASE ACTIVITIES.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 1193.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, 1 year ago, the House passed the CAROL Act by voice  vote. I am pleased the Senate finally considered the legislation and  worked to keep it in a bipartisan bill.   Valvular heart disease is a growing issue in our country. It is a  condition where one of the heart's four valves is damaged and does not  regulate blood properly. Nearly 25,000 Americans die each year from  complications caused by valvular heart disease. Yet, we do not know  much about it. This bill will bring us closer to finding answers.   The CAROL Act expands research on valvular heart disease at the  National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute with the goal of generating  data and assessing potential risk factors associated with valvular  heart disease. This bill convenes a workshop of experts to collaborate  and develop recommendations for the identification and treatment of  individuals who are at risk of sudden cardiac death caused by valvular  heart disease. The bill also supports education efforts at the Centers  for Disease Control and Prevention to increase awareness of valvular  heart disease and reduce the risk of sudden cardiac death.   I commend our colleague, Representative Barr, for leading this  legislation in honor of his late wife, Carol, who passed unexpectedly  due to an underlying valvular heart disease condition. I hope that this  legislation will help avoid similar tragedies for other families across  the Nation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and  join us in honoring the life of Carol Barr.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge all of our colleagues to support  this bill, the legacy of Carol Barr, which will go to the President  once it is adopted today.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
