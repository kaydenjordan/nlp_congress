 Madam Speaker, the great Maya Angelou summarized  the very essence of my being when she proclaimed `` . . . the gifts my  ancestors gave, I am the dream and hope of the slave.'' I am proud to  say tonight that I am a descendent of enslaved people.   I also want to acknowledge tonight a couple of righteous allies of  enslaved people. Mr. Steny Hoyer, the majority leader of the House. Mr.  Hoyer and I worked closely to bring the Slavery Remembrance Day  resolution to the floor. I am very proud of what he has done to help  us. I consider him a righteous ally of enslaved people.   President Joe Biden: President Biden issued a press statement that I  will be eternally grateful for as it relates to enslaved people. In  fact, I would like to read from the statement that the President  actually issued. Of course, it is the President's statement, Joe Biden,  marking Slavery Remembrance Day. He issued this on August 20, 2022.   It reads:         More than 400 years ago, 20 enslaved Africans were forcibly       brought to the shores of what would become the United States.       Millions more were stolen and sold in the centuries that       followed, part of a system of slavery that is America's       original sin.        Great Nation's don't hide from their history. They       acknowledge their past, both the triumphs and the tragedies.       Today is a day--    He is talking about August 20.         Today is a day to reflect on the terrible toll of slavery,       and our Nation's profound ability to heal and emerge       stronger.    He goes on to say:         Despite the horrors they faced, these men and women and       their descendants have made countless contributions to the       building of this Nation and the continuous effort to realize       the American ideal. I was honored last year to declare       Juneteenth a national holiday, another moment to reflect and       rededicate ourselves to becoming a more perfect union. And it       is why my administration will continue the hard, ongoing work       to bring true equity and racial justice to our country.        I am grateful for the efforts of Congress--in particular,       Representative Al Green and Senator Elizabeth Warren--to       recognize the significance of this day.    Madam Speaker, I mention the President because this day was many  years in the making, many years. In fact, it was on August 20 of 1619  that the White Lion, a slave ship, a ship with enslaved human beings on  it, docked at Point Comfort, near what we now call Norfolk, Virginia,  and it had these 20 human beings on it from Africa. They were traded  for materials and goods and left there.                                time  1915    This was a seminal moment in our history, August 20, 1619, some 246  years, 108 days ago. From August 20, 1619, to January 31, 1865, when  the 13th Amendment was ratified, we considered these the years and days  that this country had lawful slavery.   It is interesting to note that over this entire period of time, there  were persons who were very helpful to those who were enslaved. I shall  talk about them later on in this half hour.   The value of that 246 years of labor, unpaid labor, unpaid slave  labor, has been estimated to be such as $14.2 trillion. That is in 2009  dollars. So it is important for us to realize that these persons who  were enslaved over these 246 years, 108 days, these persons gave  America a foundation, an economic foundation that has persisted to this  [[Page H8062]]  day--246 years, 108 days of free labor, some $14.2 trillion.   In fact, these persons are the greatest contributors to the American  economy, the greatest contributors ever to the American economy,  because of 246 years, 108 days of free labor.   Here are some of the well-known landmarks and buildings built by  enslaved human beings. I will talk about them. This is according to an  article styled ``15 American landmarks that were built by slaves,''  published in the publication known as the Business Insider and by James  Pasley. Let me now start.   The first is the White House. According to the White House Historical  Association, enslaved human beings were likely involved in all aspects  of the construction, including the carpentry, masonry, cording,  rafting, plastering, glazing, and painting.   The task force reported this. Slaves appeared to have shouldered  alone all the grueling work of sawing logs and stones.   The White House: Constructed by slaves.   The U.S. Capitol Building: Enslaved human beings quarried the stone  used for the floors, walls, and columns of the Capitol. They shaped  that stone. They laid the brick foundations of the buildings.   Enslaved human beings, in large part, also completed the carpentry as  they framed the roof and installed its shingles and its coverings.  Enslaved human beings were responsible for more skilled labor like  plastering and painting.   The White House and the Capitol.   The Statue of Freedom atop the Capitol: If you have been to  Washington, D.C., you have seen the Statue of Freedom atop the Capitol.  An enslaved human being created the Statue of Freedom.   This is remarkable and almost painful to say, knowing that a person  who was enslaved created the Statue of Freedom that is atop the  Capitol. It was done so because Philip Reid was the only person  available with the skill to make a bronze statue out of the plaster  cast.   The Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C.: Although enslaved  individuals did not work on the actual building, they were the ones who  quarried the iconic red sandstone that still adorns the building to  this day.   Wall Street in New York: Enslaved human beings built the titular wall  for which the street is named. In addition, Wall Street was the  location of one of the largest slave markets in the country in the  1700s.   Trinity Church in New York: Enslaved human beings helped to build the  original Trinity Church on Wall Street, which stood from 1698 until  1776.   Fraunces Tavern in New York: Although few specific details still  exist on the process, enslaved human beings built one of the oldest  buildings in Manhattan.   Faneuil Hall in Boston: Enslaved human beings helped build the cradle  of liberty indirectly by working for Peter Faneuil, who helped fund the  building with funds made from slavery.   Fort Sumter in South Carolina: Enslaved human beings helped build the  fort where the Civil War began. They were forced to help create the  bricks that made up the structure, as well as forced to repair the fort  while it was under attack. As many as 20 slaves died during the attack  on the fort.   Harvard Law School in Massachusetts: Enslaved human beings helped  build the Harvard Law School through the wealth of the slave owner  Isaac Royall, Jr., whose wealth came from his sugar plantations and  farms.   Castillo de San Marcos fort in Florida: The oldest missionary fort in  the United States was built by enslaved human beings who toiled for  around 25 years under the Spanish to build the fort.   Georgetown University: Enslaved human beings were sold in order to  raise $3.3 million in funds, in today's money, to finance the  construction of the Georgetown campus.   The University of North Carolina: Enslaved human beings helped build  the oldest public university in the country. Many of the University of  North Carolina structures were built and maintained by slaves.   Monticello in Virginia: Thomas Jefferson's home had its bricks and  limestone quarried, built, and placed by enslaved human beings.   Montpelier in Virginia: President James Madison's family had their  homes cleared, created, and constructed by enslaved human beings.   Mount Vernon in Virginia: President George Washington's home, Mount  Vernon, was built by enslaved human beings who were forced to quarry  the materials, as well as build and maintain the home.   In summary, enslaved human beings built some of the most well-known  structures in our country. To recap, they built the White House in  Washington, D.C., or helped to--there were others involved--the U.S.  Capitol in Washington, D.C., the Statue of Freedom atop the Capitol,  the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., Wall Street in New  York, Trinity Church in New York, Fraunces Tavern in New York, Faneuil  Hall in Boston, Fort Sumter in South Carolina, Harvard Law School in  Massachusetts, Castillo de San Marcos fort in Florida, Georgetown  University in Washington, D.C., the University of North Carolina,  Monticello in Virginia, and Montpelier in Virginia.   It should be noted also that these structures are among those that  are known to us. The list does not include the untold number of roads,  bridges, and water wells, as well as houses and more, that were  constructed by enslaved human beings. It also does not include the many  crops planted and harvested in the agrarian economy built on the backs  of enslaved human beings.   All told, the total value of labor of every hour toiled under the  whip of slavers in this country has been estimated to be between $5.9  and $14.2 trillion, 2009 dollars. This is why I say that the enslaved  human beings are the greatest contributors to the American economy.   As a group, as a lot, as a people, the enslaved human beings  contributed upward of around $14.2 trillion of free labor to this  country. They were the foundational mothers and fathers of this  country.   This is a widely cited number, and it was calculated by the  University of Connecticut researcher Thomas Craemer using the number of  unremunerated work hours multiplied with historical free market labor  wages. This is wealth that was stolen from human beings who have seen  little to none of it repaid.   The American economy had hundreds of years of free labor that gave it  a start, that allowed it to compete and, in a sense, to have a  competitive edge that many other countries did not have simply because  of enslaved human beings.   I am honored to say that I am proud to be a descendant of enslaved  human beings, the persons who built this country, the foundation of it,  who gave it its start, its place in the economic order as a world  power--enslaved human beings.   So, now, let's look at some of the people who were the enslavers.   John L. Manning owned at least two plantations holding 670 human  beings against their will, one in South Carolina and another in  Louisiana--a slave owner.   Meredith Calhoun held more than 700 enslaved people and produced  cotton, more cotton than any other property in Louisiana.   William Aiken was one of the State's wealthiest citizens, the owner  of the largest rice plantation in the State, with over 700 enslaved on  1,500 acres under cultivation, almost twice the acreage of the next  largest plantation.   This is, for many of the persons who have inherited wealth, how that  wealth was initially brought into being. Enslaved human beings gave  them their start with free labor--John Manning, Meredith Calhoun,  William Aiken.   Another, John Burnside, was the largest sugar producer in the country  during his time. Before he died, he owned 10 different plantations and  enslaved 753 people at his peak.   Joshua Ward, also known as the king of the rice planters, had 1,130  enslaved people.   Stephen Duncan was a businessman who collectively enslaved more than  2,000 human beings. He was one of the largest cotton producers, not in  this country but in the world.                                time  1930    The most that he enslaved that one time was 858.  [[Page H8063]]    These were the people who had the opportunity to acquire great wealth  at the expense of the lives of other people, many of whom lived their  entire lives in bondage and died as enslaved human beings.   And what is unfortunate about all of this is we in this country have  come to glorify those who were the enslavers. We glorify the  Confederate military. We glorify, and to a certain extent, we deify  many of the Confederate generals. These were the people that were  fighting to maintain slavery. They get all of the honors, until as of  late when we started to change that. But they have been given the  honors.   The persons who were the liberators were demeaned and portrayed as  insane, portrayed as murderers. But these were the people who were the  liberators. We have vilified the liberators and have glorified the  enslavers.   It is with great difficulty that we try to change this, but the  difficulty is such that people don't really want to hear about the  slaves. They have been so indoctrinated with the glory of the enslavers  that they can't accept--many people--the fact that the slaves are the  persons who were the foundational mothers and fathers of this country.   The slaves should be honored and they should be memorialized. They  should be placed in the same position, not for having done the same  thing that persons have done on Memorial Day, those that we memorialize  in the wars, but they should be given the same dignity and respect  because they died for this country. They died in bondage for this  country. They were born into slavery. They lived as slaves, and they  died as slaves. They ought to be honored and memorialized to the same  extent as we honor and memorialize those who died in the wars. That is  hard for some people to accept.   Many don't want to hear that said. But they should be given the honor  that they deserve for living and dying for this country, because they  did. But not only did they live and die for this country, their  children lived and died for this country. Their children were taken  away from them, sold at the auction block. Their children and  grandchildren lived and died as well.   Why wouldn't we honor the people who lived and died in bondage and  gave this country its economic foundation to the same extent that we  honor the people who died in the wars? We should. They made America  great. They deserve the honor and dignity, the same honor and dignity  that those who died in wars have been given.   So let's talk for a minute about the liberators.   John Brown. I remember when I was in high school--or I don't know if  it was high school, maybe it was junior high. We studied our history.  And I remember the indication to us was that John Brown was a crazy  man, just out to murder people senselessly.   John Brown was a liberator. He was fighting to liberate the people  who were enslaved. He has never been given the honor that he deserves.  John Brown ought to be honored to the same extent that we honor other  persons who were liberators in wars. He was a liberator in this  country.   The difficulty associated with honoring John Brown is this: When we  honor others who liberated people from injustice, we are looking  through a window into the world of other people. But if we honor John  Brown, we have to look into the mirror and we see ourselves and our  transgressions.   We have a lot that we have to do to atone for slavery: for taking  people, selling their children, raping their women. We have a lot to  atone for. And it is difficult for us to accept the fact that atonement  is still something that we have not achieved.   Madam Speaker, I appreciate this President because he has  acknowledged our history. This President, in my opinion, will be among  the pantheon of the greatest Presidents this country has had because he  has fought injustice that others wouldn't speak of.   He put a Black woman on the Supreme Court. Others could have done it;  they didn't. President Biden did it.   He acknowledged Slavery Remembrance Day. Others could have; they  didn't. President Biden did.   He will be seen by those in the distant future as one of the greatest  Presidents this country has had, especially as it relates to addressing  injustices.   Sojourner Truth, abolitionist. She became the first Black woman to  win a case against a White man in this country. It is amazing how  people like Sojourner Truth are now starting to be recognized, but for  years, have been denied their rightful place in history as persons who  fought for the liberation of Black people.   Nat Turner, a preacher. A preacher who rebelled. He led a 4-day  rebellion of enslaved people to free Black people. This was in 1841.  When I studied this in high school or junior high--I am not sure  which--Nat Turner was portrayed as a traitor, as someone who attacked  this country.   Nat Turner was a liberator. Nat Turner was trying to free people who  were in bondage.   Robert E. Lee, on the other hand, was trying to maintain slavery.  Yet, we have had Lee high schools across this country. I know of no Nat  Turner high school in this country. There may be one, but I know of no  Nat Turner high school.   There ought to be Nat Turner high schools across the country to the  same extent that we have had Lee high schools because Nat Turner was  the liberator. Lee was the enslaver. He was the person who would  maintain slavery. Why would we honor Lee to the exclusion of Nat  Turner, who was a liberator?   I know this is difficult for some people to manage because we have  always been told that the liberators were people who were working  against our country. They were working to free people. The Confederate  soldiers were working and killing to maintain people in bondage.   Madam Speaker, I speak the truth. No one can deny the truth of what I  say. You can deny wanting to see and hear that truth, but it is the  truth.   Harriet Tubman, abolitionist, who sought to free slaves as well. She  made 13 missions and rescued some 70 enslaved people.    Madam Speaker, there are many more. I know that my time is nearing  its end, but there are many more.   Madam Speaker, I will just say this about Harriet Tubman. It has been  said that she said she could have freed many more ``if they had known  they were slaves.''   William Still, Elijah Anderson, Frederick Douglass, and, of course,  the great Abraham Lincoln: All persons who worked as liberators.   I will be saying more about this. If you missed out on some portion  of it tonight, I will present it in a similar fashion at a later time.   Madam Speaker, I thank the majority leader, Mr. Hoyer, for being a  righteous ally of enslaved people. I will be eternally grateful to the  President for being a righteous ally and a person who issued the  statement recognizing Slavery Remembrance Day on August 23 of each  year.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
