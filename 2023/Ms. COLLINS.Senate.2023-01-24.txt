 Mr. President, Foxcroft Academy in Dover-Foxcroft, ME,  was established on January 30, 1823, with a mission of bringing quality  education to pioneer families in our new State. On this 200th  anniversary, it is a pleasure to congratulate this outstanding school  for its dedication to excellence and opportunity.   The history of Foxcroft Academy demonstrates that commitment. It was  the first school chartered in Maine after we achieved statehood 3 years  earlier. It is one of the oldest private day and boarding preparatory  high schools in America.   That charter was the result of extraordinary vision. The school's  namesake, Colonel John Foxcroft, born to a prominent Massachusetts  family, was successful in business and amassed a considerable fortune.  His wealth enabled him to acquire thousands of acres of prime  timberland in the wilderness of Maine. With the growing cities of early  America nearby, he could have exploited this natural resource and added  greatly to his fortune.   Instead, he chose to offer opportunity. He opened his land up to  those less fortunate; he encouraged settlers to come to clear farmland,  construct mills, start businesses, and build their homes and their  futures. The people of the fledgling settlement raised $100 to build a  wood frame building to create a school and a true community.   Today, Foxcroft Academy sits upon a beautiful 125-acre campus with a  full array of state-of-the-art academic, athletic, and residential  facilities. More than 350 day students live in Dover-Foxcroft and  neighboring towns, and an additional 100 international students come  from 20 countries around the world.   Foxcroft Academy is renowned for high achievement in academics,  athletics, and the arts. Its designation as an Apple Distinguished  School recognizes its successful integration of technology into  education, and its inclusion in the International Baccalaureate Program  acknowledges its commitment to helping students become good global  citizens.   The school's motto is ``Knowledge is Power.'' Whether graduates go on  to college, the workforce, or the military, they leave Foxcroft Academy  empowered to succeed.   Foxcroft Academy was founded with a pioneering, innovative spirit  that is carried on today by students, faculty, administrators, and  supporters. This bicentennial year is a time to celebrate a school that  holds a special place in Maine's history and in its future.                            ____________________
