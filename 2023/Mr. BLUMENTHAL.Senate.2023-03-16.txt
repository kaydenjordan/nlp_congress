 Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart  to pay tribute to Elan Ganeles, a beloved son, brother, and friend to  so many. Tragically, Elan was killed in Israel on February 27, at the  age of 26.   Raised in West Hartford, Elan was one of Connecticut's own, a  remarkable young man with unlimited potential. He was visiting Israel  last month to attend a friend's wedding, when he was senselessly  murdered by a gunman outside of Jericho, a beautiful life cut  tragically short by violence and hate.   Born in the Bronx, NY, Elan moved with his family as an infant to  West Hartford, CT, where he spent most of his young life. The Ganeles  family are members of the Young Israel of West Hartford, and Elan  attended the Hebrew High School of New England, where he graduated in  2014.   After graduating high school, Elan spent several years in Israel as a  kibbutz volunteer and a member of the Israeli Defense Forces--IDF-- working as a computer programmer. Following 3 years of IDF service,  Elan returned to the United States to attend Columbia University where  he was an admired member of the campus community. He graduated in 2022  with a double major in sustainable development and neuroscience and  behavior.   At Columbia, Elan was very active in the Jewish community on campus.  He participated in the First Year Leadership Fellowship and was  involved in the TAMID Consulting Group, the Wednesday Night Learning  Program, and Yavneh, the Orthodox student community on campus. Elan was  also a dean's list student and a valued friend to all who knew him. His  former roommate described him as the ``best friend you could ask for.''   Indeed, Elan's zeal for friendship--his gift for relating and  loving--may be his enduring legacy. He touched so many lives in such  meaningful ways. He will be remembered by countless friends, deeply  impressive for their diversity as well as number. Elan would do  anything for others. His huge capacity for kindness and generosity  created lasting gratitude.   Elan is recalled as a deeply intelligent and intellectually curious  person, relishing time with family. Elan's mother, Dr. Carolyn Ganeles,  remembers her son's never-ending inquisitiveness. His father, Dr.  Andrew Ganeles, speaks of Elan's strong sense of independence and the  exciting lifetime ahead.   Recently, I met with Elan's grieving family and friends sitting Shiva  at the Ganeles' home in West Hartford. I heard firsthand about this  amazing young man, and I am heartbroken for his family and their tragic  loss--indeed, for all who might have known him. May Elan's memory be a  blessing.   My wife Cynthia and I extend our deepest sympathies to Elan's family  during this difficult time, particularly to his parents Andrew and  Carolyn, and his brothers Simon and Gabriel. I hope my colleagues will  join me in honoring Elan's life and legacy, both large and  lasting.                            ____________________
