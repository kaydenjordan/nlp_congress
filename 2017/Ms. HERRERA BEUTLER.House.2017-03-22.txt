 Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairwoman Foxx and the  Committee on Education and the Workforce for their work on this  important bill that will benefit small businesses and the families who  work for them.   My amendment to the Small Business Health Fairness Act provides a  straightforward clarification to ensure that existing association  health plans can continue to operate and provide high-quality,  affordable care to as many people as possible.   This amendment safeguards association health plans that have been  successfully operating under State and Federal law--many of them for  decades. We will be making certain that they would not inadvertently be  disadvantaged by new Federal legislation or regulation or vulnerable to  efforts to restrict access and limit choices.   Why do we need this amendment?   Because I fear what happened in my State will happen in others, where  the insurance commissioner attempted to reject 42 out of about 60  association health plans. His office interpreted ObamaCare as giving  him a mandate as justification for attempting to eliminate virtually  all of these popular plans. By adopting my amendment, it will make  crystal clear in the underlying bill that this won't be tolerated, and  it will support both existing and future association health plans.   Talk to one of the nearly 400,000 individuals in my home State of  Washington who get their care from an association plan, and you will  find out why so many Washington businesses renew their plans every  year.   Our State has been fortunate to have a robust AHP market that has  become essential to providing cost-effective choices to small-business  employers, thanks to bipartisan legislation enacted in the mid-1990s.  In the case of one association plan operating in my State, roughly 40  percent of participating small-business employers did not previously  offer health coverage.   My amendment is supported by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. In its  letter to me, which I include in the Record, the U.S. Chamber indicated  that it shares my interest in making sure that State-based association  health plans that currently exist are able to continue operating in  accordance with existing State and Federal law. My amendment is also  supported by the Association of Washington Business.                                          Chamber of Commerce of the                                        United States of America,                                     Washington, DC, March 20, 2017.      Hon. Jaime Herrera Beutler,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Congresswoman Herrera Beutler: Thank you for your       attention to the concerns raised by the Association of       Washington Businesses regarding H.R. 1101, the ``Small       Business Health Fairness Act.'' The U.S. Chamber of Commerce       has several state chambers of commerce members that provide       state-based quality health care coverage to their member       companies. The Chamber shares your interest in making sure       that the state-based Association Health Plans that currently       exist are able to continue to operate in accordance with       existing state and federal law without being disadvantaged by       this new federal legislation.        The Chamber appreciates your commitment to small businesses       and to ensuring that current affordable coverage options       continue to be available alongside new options in a       nondiscriminatory and fair environment. Thank you for your       dedication and efforts, and we look forward to continuing to       work with you to advance the priorities and interest of       business.            Sincerely,                                                 Randel K. Johnson.     Mr. Speaker, I am confident that the underlying  legislation before us today will improve the ability of small  businesses to access affordable, high-quality health coverage in every  State across the country. However, first, this body should, as clearly  as possible, ensure that those States that already have successfully  operating association health plans are not disrupted, which is what my  amendment would do.   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I thank the  chairwoman for her work on this.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I would just like to say that part  of the reason this underlying bill is so critical is because we just  don't believe one size fits all. When it comes to health coverage, we  need to make sure that there are many different options for families,  individuals, and businesses. We are clarifying basically a technical  change here that allows continued existing plans to operate.   Who can be opposed to existing plans operating and offering more  options and more plans?   This is exactly what Republicans are doing right now. We are fighting  to make sure that the families and the people we represent have those  options and their choices, that they can keep their doctor, that their  health premiums will come down, that they can maybe get a plan through  their work, or maybe they will be able to get into the individual  market and self-insure--options--because one size does not fit all,  which is why this bill is crucial and why my amendment to this bill  makes it better. That is why we are going to move forward and make sure  that more Americans have access to care--not just on paper--but care  that gets them to in to the doctor, that gets them the care that they  need, whether it is a specialist or a primary care doctor.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
