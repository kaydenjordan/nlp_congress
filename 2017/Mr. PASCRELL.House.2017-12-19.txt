 Mr. Speaker, all on a postcard, simple as that. I say  it is a postage stamp mentality. Many of them need counseling in  economics. If they want to keep it simple, let's keep it simple. Very  simple.   How about that couple that wants to send their kids to college and  put a second mortgage on their house. You can't do that anymore. You  cannot do that. That is not a middle class legislation. That is the  stick it to the middle class.   Mr. Speaker, this is serious business. I will tell you what is  simple. If you are born in a family with an estate worth more than $11  million, this Republican Congress is coming to your aid with a $3  million average windfall.   And if this Congress actually still practiced oversight, we would  know from his tax returns that Donald Trump and his family will see  cuts worth millions of dollars per family.   This is not good policy, Mr. Speaker--not at all--and it is  dangerous.
