 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, last week, President Trump nominated  Judge Brett Kavanaugh to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court. People have  begun looking over his extensive record, and he has been getting rave  reviews around the country. Just look at a few of the headlines we have  seen across the country.   The New York Times, July 10: ``A conservative stalwart wins praise  for his intellect and civility.'' The New York Times--it is  astonishing.   The Wall Street Journal said: ``Trump's nominee will be an  intellectual leader on the bench.''   The Detroit News said his record suggests that ``he will maintain a  commitment to interpreting the law as it is written, and not how he may  wish it had been crafted.'' That is exactly what Americans should be  looking for in a Supreme Court Justice because a judge's job is to  apply the law, not to rewrite it.   People looking at Judge Kavanaugh's record and reaching the  conclusion that he knows the right way to approach this very important  job.   It is not just newspapers that are saying wonderful things and  singing the praise of Judge Kavanaugh; legal scholars are lining up to  commend his independence and his wisdom as a judge. Some of them are  extremely liberal people he has worked with over the years. They just  respect him that much as a judge who they find has been devoted to the  law and the Constitution. Imagine that. That is what we  [[Page S5039]]  should expect in anybody who serves as a Justice on the Supreme Court.   A law professor from Yale wrote an op-ed for the New York Times last  week titled ``A liberal's case for Brett Kavanaugh.'' The professor  called Judge Kavanaugh ``a superb nominee'' and said that ``it is hard  to name anyone with judicial credentials as strong as those of Judge  Kavanaugh.''   Another liberal law professor called him a ``highly qualified  mainstream conservative judge.'' He cited Judge Kavanaugh's reasoning  as ``an example of the judging ideal, setting aside ideology and party  politics, and just trying to get the law right.'' That is a liberal  former law professor. He said Judge Kavanaugh gives ``an independent  judiciary the job it is supposed to do: Interpret the law.''   There are lawyers who have appeared before Judge Kavanaugh who said  the same things. I am not a lawyer, I haven't done these sorts of  things, but I understand there are surveys of lawyers who appear before  judges in court, people who have won cases and people who have lost  cases. They put up their ideas about what they thought about the judge  afterward.   Across the board, they called him ``an excellent judge.'' They said  that he ``has a history of excellent legal argument and analysis,''  someone who can think intellectually, think clearly, and come up with a  legal argument and analysis to make the assessment, to apply the law as  written. One lawyer actually said: ``It is daunting and humbling to be  in front of that brainpower.'' This was an anonymous survey of lawyers  who appear before Judge Kavanaugh. I don't know if they won or lost,  but people get to put in their opinions, winners and losers, after  cases in anonymous surveys. ``It is daunting and humbling to be in  front of that brainpower.'' This wasn't people just trying to kiss up  to the judge to win favor in a case; these are results from people  after the case who were just telling it like it is. ``Excellent legal  judgment,'' they say.   If you look beyond the courtroom, people are just as willing to talk  about Judge Kavanaugh's character as a person, not just a judge. That  is part of it--to look at somebody's legal philosophy, their intellect,  and their character--when trying to assess a judge who has been  nominated, to say: Is this person the right person to be a Justice on  the Supreme Court?   The Washington Post even ran a piece by a woman who knows Judge  Kavanaugh because he coaches her daughter's basketball team. She wrote  that she was impressed by ``his traits of personal kindness,  leadership, and willingness to help when called on.''    There are three things I look for in a nominee for the Supreme Court:  judicial philosophy, a strong intellect, and a solid character. What we  are hearing is overwhelming evidence from people who know him that  Judge Kavanaugh has all of these qualities. He is someone who takes the  law and the Constitution at face value.   The Constitution is a legal document, not a living document, and it  was built for certainty. He knows that a judge's job is to ``interpret  the law,'' not to legislate from the bench, ``not to make the law or  make policy.'' That is what he actually said in a speech last year.   He has an extremely strong intellect, and I can't imagine there is  anyone out there who can deny that. ``It is daunting and humbling to be  in front of that brainpower''--this is what one of the lawyers who  appeared before him said. And he is a person of solid character. That  is what we are hearing from people who have known him over the years  from being extremely active in the community. The New York Times  summarized it: ``A conservative stalwart wins praise for his intellect  and civility.''   So what is there for Democrats to come to the floor and object to?  Why are they objecting to all of this? Why are some Democrats already  saying they oppose a judge known for his intellect and civility? They  were actually saying it before he was even named by President Trump.  Whomever President Trump names, they are going to vote no. It is  astonishing to see Democrats making that decision. Then they are asking  for reams and reams of documents after they have already said they are  against Judge Kavanaugh. What are they looking for? It is amazing.   That is what I believe the big difference is between Republicans and  Democrats in Washington: Republican Presidents choose judges and  justices to follow the law; Democratic Presidents seem to pick judges  and justices who are guaranteed to push liberal policies and liberal  agendas, preconceived notions of how they should rule on a case before  they hear the facts. They know the way they are going to go, maybe  using things like emotion, sympathy, and empathy. The Constitution is a  legal document.   Even though you have legal experts from around the political world  and around the spectrum of all sides of the aisle who praise his  intellect and civility, it is not good enough for the liberal activists  in this country. They don't even want to consider Judge Kavanaugh's  qualifications, and they have said it here on the floor of the Senate  and on television, if you listen. They are already making opposition to  his nomination a liberal litmus test for Democrats in this Senate, and  I am sorry to say that more than a few Democrats seem to be playing  along. We have seen Democrats in the Senate who have already said that  they don't care about Judge Kavanaugh's intellect; they don't care that  he is ``just trying to get the law right''; they don't care that, as  one lawyer said, ``it is hard to name anyone with judicial credentials  as strong as those of Judge Kavanaugh.''   When you have someone with these qualifications, Senators ought to be  looking at his record. They should look at the 300 decisions he has  written in 12 years on the bench. It is absolutely the right thing to  look at. They should meet him and talk with him.   We have just begun this confirmation hearing process. I hope that  more Democrats in the Senate will have an open mind about this nominee.  I hope they will consider the kind of person we should have on the  Supreme Court and then make their decisions about whether Judge  Kavanaugh has those qualities. From what I have seen, he absolutely  does.    I plan to continue to look into his record and listen to people who  know him best. I plan to sit down and talk with him. Everything I have  seen so far tells me that this is someone who is exactly the kind of  Justice we need on the Supreme Court.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, last week, President Trump was in Europe  meeting with other NATO leaders. One of the major issues he raised was  the need to bolster energy security throughout NATO. He specifically  talked about a natural gas pipeline that the Russians are building  between Russia and Germany. It is called the Nord Stream II Pipeline. I  have been talking about this pipeline for years.   President Trump was absolutely right to bring up this important  subject. Here is how the Boston Herald put it in an editorial over the  weekend: ``Trump's testy, tough talk to NATO on point.'' They say the  President's tough talk was absolutely on point.   The President pointed out that Germany relies on natural gas for a  substantial amount of its energy needs.  [[Page S5068]]  More than half of Germany's natural gas imports come from Russia. With  this new pipeline, Germany will actually increase its dependence on  Russian gas. Russia will have more of an influence on Germany.   Germany and other countries are members of NATO, and the reason they  are members of NATO is to protect themselves against Russian  aggression. So if you are Germany, why would you want to become more  dependent on Russia when you joined NATO and have been a member of NATO  for years to protect against Russia aggression? It seems that Germany  has turned around now and given Russia influence over its energy  security.   President Trump pointed out how strange it seems. I think it seems  strange to other members of NATO, and it seems strange to people all  across the country. No one who understands the facts can say that  President Trump is wrong. President Trump is right. His tough talk to  NATO was on point. Even the Obama administration knew it. The rest of  NATO knows it. Even Germany knows it. When one country allows another  aggressive, opportunistic country like Russia to have that kind of  influence over its energy security, I believe it is asking for trouble.  Germany seems to be betting that increasing its economic ties to the  Kremlin will have no effect on the political manipulations that Russia  wants to play on Europe. I think it is a sucker's bet.   Energy security is national security. Energy security is called the  master resource for a reason. It powers our country. It powers our  economy. It is an instrument of power. It is a force multiplier. It is  important for the United States and our allies around the world to have  that correct understanding of energy and the impact that it has  globally as a geopolitical weapon. We have seen Russia in the past use  its natural gas as a geopolitical weapon. Russia threatens other  countries. It extorts money from them. It bullies them. Russians then  can tell their customers: Do what we say, or we turn off the tap and we  shut off your gas. They have done it in the past.   It also means a lot of money going from our NATO allies straight into  the Kremlin's pocket. That is money they could be using instead to fund  aggression in Europe and other parts of the world. That is what Russia  wants to do with the money, if they get that money from Germany, from  the energy. They use the money against us and against our NATO allies.   This new pipeline, I believe, was all the desire of the Russian  people--and specifically of Vladimir Putin--to put our NATO allies much  more under Russia's control. With the new pipeline, Russia is seeking  to make Germany and the rest of Europe even more dependent and even  more susceptible to this kind of Russian coercion.   The Wall Street Journal had an editorial on the subject last week.  They wrote that ``the embarrassment for Berlin and NATO is that Germany  is so happy to help Vladimir Putin execute this plan.'' That is the  embarrassment for Berlin and the embarrassment for NATO. They said:  ``Usually hostages need to be taken, instead of volunteering.'' But  that is what Germany is doing right now--volunteering to be Russia's  hostage. That is exactly right.   Europe needs new energy, new energy security, and a new energy  source. They need diversity. That is what the European Union needs.  They need diversity in both the types of energy--that is what our NATO  allies need--diversity in the types of energy that they use and where  they get their energy from. That is how countries ensure that their own  long-term economic health and independence is sound.   Russia has a right to compete in the world market for energy. The  trouble starts when Russia gets so much of the market in some of these  European countries that they become a monopoly in terms of the way they  act. Russia is the largest supplier of natural gas to Europe. Across  Europe, nearly 40 percent of the natural gas imports come from Russia.  So Russia has incredible control. In some countries, it is virtually  100 percent.   Countries like Germany should be reducing the amount of natural gas  they buy from Russia, not increasing it, but that is what this Nord  Stream II Pipeline between Russia and Germany does. It increases the  amount of natural gas Germany will be buying from Russia.   Germany should absolutely reject the Nord Stream II Pipeline as part  of their reduction of dependence on Russia. That would help shrink the  influence and the threat Russia continually poses to our NATO allies.  It would also help our other allies in the region because, right now, a  lot of Russian gas travels through pipelines that cross Ukraine and  other countries into Central Europe. These countries make money from  the gas crossing their territory, and they get a lot of their energy  through these pipelines as well. But remember, Russia has invaded parts  of eastern Ukraine. Russia has taken over Crimea. If Russia has their  other new pipeline to help export its natural gas, it can shut off the  revenue for countries, such as Ukraine, and shut off their energy  completely.    Remember, one of the things President Trump has done, which I think  has been helpful and which I had been calling for for years during the  Obama administration, is actually provide lethal weapons to Ukraine to  deal with the incursions coming from Russia to eastern Ukraine.  Vladimir Putin actually cut off natural gas supplies to Ukraine in  2006, 2009, and 2014. He invaded Ukraine and annexed Crimea in part to  cut off access to the natural gas and oil resources.   This is a pattern Vladimir Putin has of using energy as a weapon, and  the best defense against this weapon is for these countries in Europe  to have the kind of energy diversity and energy security that I have  recommended.   In March, I wrote a letter to the Treasury and State Departments  encouraging the Trump administration to look at ways to stop the  construction of the Nord Stream II Pipeline. That is what we need to  do--stop the construction of the pipeline. It was a bipartisan effort,  and 39 Senators from both parties signed on to the letter to express  our concerns to President Trump about what was happening between Russia  and Germany.   Today, I take the next concrete step and introduce legislation to do  four very important things.   First, the legislation directs our representatives in NATO to work to  achieve energy security for our partners throughout Europe and Eurasia.   Second, it calls for a comprehensive strategy that involves  increasing American energy exports to these countries being held  hostage by Russia.   Third, it requires the Energy Secretary to speed up approvals of  American natural gas exports to our NATO allies and other countries.   Finally, it authorizes mandatory U.S. sanctions on the development of  Russian energy pipelines like Nord Stream II.   It is in the national security interests of our country to help our  allies reduce their dependence on Russian energy. Where those countries  don't see it for themselves, we need to show them how important it is  for their own security. Our NATO alliance is strong. A robust energy  security strategy will make it even stronger.   When Vladimir Putin looks at natural gas, he doesn't think natural  gas; he thinks politics, he thinks money, and he thinks power, because  that is how he equates the energy he supplies to these countries, on  which they have become so dependent--money, power, politics.   Germany and other countries in Europe and NATO should be doing all  they can to diversify their sources of energy so they can help reduce  the threat Russia poses to them. The United States should do all we can  by exporting our abundant natural gas to our allies as quickly as  possible. We have more than enough natural gas to meet our own needs  and to export to our friends around the world. We can boost the  security of our NATO allies and our friends around the world, and we  should be doing it. We can do it through a peaceful process and a  peaceful means without spending tax dollars, while at the same time  growing our American economy with the production of American energy.   When President Trump came to office, he said: It is no longer about  energy security or energy independence; it is about energy dominance.  Given what we have been blessed with in this country and the amount of  energy and resources we have, we have an opportunity and, I believe, an  obligation to use that energy wisely and productively.  [[Page S5069]]    Vladimir Putin thinks about energy as money, as power, and as  politics, and I think that what we need to do with the resources we  have, as I am introducing in this legislation today, is a very  commonsense approach.                                  ______                                         By Mr. KAINE:   S. 3234.
