 Madam Speaker, in March, the House passed  and President Biden signed into law the American Rescue Plan. This bill  expanded the child tax credit in an unprecedented way. Experts predict  that this expansion will cut childhood poverty in this country by one  half.   Thanks to the efforts of the American Rescue Plan and the Biden  administration's rollout of the vaccine, we are finally starting to see  light at the end of the tunnel for this pandemic. But vaccines alone  will not be enough to end the economic crisis caused by this virus.   This pandemic exposed and worsened longstanding economic issues in  our society, wages that are too low, childcare that is inaccessible,  and a lack of paid leave to allow workers the ability to properly care  for themselves and their families.   Policies like the expanded child tax credit are essential to our  economic recovery to help working parents, especially mothers, reenter  the workforce knowing their children are safe and cared for.                            ____________________
