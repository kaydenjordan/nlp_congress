 Mr. President, the Stronger Enforcement of Civil Penalties  Act, which I reintroduce today with Senator Grassley, Senator Heitkamp,  and Senator Leahy, will enhance the ability of securities regulators to  protect investors and demand greater accountability from market  players. Even after the financial crisis that crippled the economy, we  continue to see calculated wrongdoing by some on Wall Street, and  without the consequence of meaningful penalties to serve as an  effective deterrent, I fear this disturbing culture of misconduct will  persist.   Today, the amount of penalties the Securities and Exchange  Commission, or SEC can fine an institution or individual is limited by  statute. During hearings I held in 2011 in the Securities, Insurance,  and Investment Banking Subcommittee, I learned how this limitation  significantly interferes with the SEC's ability to perform its  enforcement duties. At that time, the agency had been criticized by a  Federal judge for not obtaining a larger settlement against Citigroup,  a major player in the financial crisis that settled with the SEC in an  amount that was a fraction of the cost the bank had inflicted on  investors. The SEC explained that the reason for the low settlement  amount was a statutory prohibition against levying a larger penalty.  Indeed, then SEC Chairman Mary L. Schapiro in 2011 also explained that  ``the Commission's statutory authority to obtain civil monetary  penalties with appropriate deterrent effect is limited in many  circumstances.''   The bipartisan bill Senator Grassley and I are reintroducing finally  updates the SEC's civil penalties statute. This bill strives to make  potential and current offenders think twice before engaging in  misconduct by increasing the maximum civil monetary penalties permitted  by statute, directly linking the size of the maximum penalties to the  amount of losses suffered by victims of a violation and substantially  raising the financial stakes for repeat offenders of our Nation's  securities laws.   Specifically, our bill would give the SEC more options to tailor  penalties to the specific circumstances of a given violation. In  addition to raising the per violation caps for severe, or ``tier  [[Page S2154]]  three,'' violations to $1 million per offense for individuals and $10  million per offense for entities, the legislation would also give the  SEC additional options to obtain greater penalties based on the ill- gotten gains of the violator or on the financial harm to investors.   Our bill also addresses the disturbing trend of repeat offenders on  Wall Street through two provisions. The first would allow the SEC to  triple the penalty cap applicable to recidivists who have been held  either criminally or civilly liable for securities fraud within the  previous 5 years. The second would allow the SEC to seek a civil  penalty against those that violate existing Federal court or SEC  orders, an approach that would be more efficient, effective, and  flexible than the current civil contempt remedy. Both of these changes  would substantially improve the ability of the SEC's enforcement  program to ratchet up penalties for recidivists.   Slightly more than half of all U.S. households are invested in the  stock market. They deserve a strong cop on the beat that has the tools  it needs to go after fraudsters and pursue the difficult cases arising  from our increasingly complex financial markets. The Stronger  Enforcement of Civil Penalties Act will give the SEC more tools to  demand meaningful accountability from Wall Street, which in turn will  increase transparency and confidence in our financial system. I urge  our colleagues to support this important bipartisan legislation to  enhance the SEC's ability to protect investors and to deter and crack  down on fraud.                                  ______                                         By Mr. CORNYN (for himself, Mr. Blumenthal, Mr. Heller, and Ms.          Klobuchar):   S. 782.
