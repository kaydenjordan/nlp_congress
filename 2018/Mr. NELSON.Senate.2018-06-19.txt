 Mr. President, I would like to recognize today,  June 19, as Juneteenth Independence Day. We are celebrating the 153rd  anniversary of the date on which slavery legally came to an end in the  United States. On January 1, 1863, President Lincoln issued the  Emancipation Proclamation to end slavery in the United States, but it  still took 2 and a half years for this news to spread throughout all  the Southern States. Today, we honor the faith and strength  demonstrated by former slaves and the descendants of these individuals,  who remain an example for all people of the United States, no matter  their background, religion, or race. It is my hope that Juneteenth and  the Emancipation Proclamation serve as a reminder of the progress the  United States has made towards equality and the ways in which we can  still improve.
