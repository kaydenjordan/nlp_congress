 Mr. Speaker, is anyone else tired of hearing the  insurrectionist in Chief continue to lie about the 2020 election?   Over the weekend, once again, the former, twice-impeached, disgraced,  so-called President of the United States of America, falsely claimed  that he actually won the election, and that it was stolen from him by  Joe Biden.   Something is really wrong with this guy. And I need some help in  trying to figure it out.   Is Donald Trump, A, a pathological liar;   B, a sociopath;   C, a malignant narcissist; or   D, all of the above?   I will be around all week. Look forward to hearing from you.                            ____________________
