 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge National  Police Week.   There have been 124 police officers killed in the line of duty this  year, unfortunately, including two of my constituents, Deputy Michael  Magli and Master Patrol Officer Jesse Madsen.   I went to the funeral services of our heroes, Mr. Speaker, and shared  the anguish of their loved ones. They leave behind a distinguished  legacy of service and sacrifice that deserves to be honored.   This week, I was proud to cosponsor legislation that would increase  penalties for crimes targeting law enforcement and strengthen funding  for law enforcement programs.   Law enforcement has faced unrelenting political attacks as part of  the defund the police movement. This is a dangerous proposition that  has already proven to leave communities less safe. I respect, of  course, the service and sacrifices of our first responders, and I will  continue to support them.                            ____________________
