 Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak in  opposition to the underlying legislation, H. Res. 965.   The process that led to this debate is unacceptable. After a previous  failed attempt to bring a similar rules-change package to the floor  last month, I was hopeful that the work of the bipartisan task force to  reopen the House would result in a genuine willingness toward  bipartisan solutions. I was optimistic that our Democratic majority  would partner with us to help this body adapt to the coronavirus  pandemic.   We Republicans on that task force offered a realistic framework to  make responsible, measured, and thorough reforms to get the whole House  working again. That plan was dismissed out of hand by the  Democratic majority, with no alternative.    It was not until Wednesday morning, just two days ago, with the  release of H. Res. 965, that we saw any semblance of a plan, and in no  way was it a product of bipartisanship or greater Member input.   The majority's unwillingness to work in a collaborative way was  reinforced yesterday at the Rules Committee hearing when not one  commonsense amendment offered by the minority was accepted.   Commonsense amendments like: Requiring the technology used by the  House to be certified by the CAO; rejected.   Requiring technical support during virtual committee activity;  rejected.   Allowing the entire House of Representatives to weigh in on the type  of remote voting this body follows; rejected.   Not only is this resolution completely partisan, it is being rushed  to the floor while there is still an unacceptable amount of unanswered  questions, both on the specifics of the processes authorized in the  rules changes and the technology to support it.   I know that this morning, at 6 a.m., we were provided a copy of the  regulations that the Rules Committee plans on issuing. Is that the same  type of consultation that we can expect for the remote hearing changes  that are left to one Member of the majority to decide?   The House is on the receiving end of 1.6 billion unauthorized scans  on our network per month. After broadcasting to the world that Members  are going to now be able to cast their vote or operate in this  institution remotely, I don't know about you, Madam Speaker, but I  expect those to increase.   What further reduces my confidence in these sweeping changes that  will not have their stated effect is the feedback from virtual  committee roundtables that have already been attempted by every  committee. There have been instances of the majority staff kicking  participants off video conferences because they had not RSVP'd.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a list of the concerns that  our ranking members have provided me on the House Administration  Committee.    [From Committee on House Administration Ranking Member Rodney Davis]  Republican Ranking Members Express Significant Concerns With Democrats            Proposal To Allow for Virtual Committee Proceedings    Virtual Committee Proceedings inhibit the ability of Members to fully                                participate         Remote platforms give the majority, typically in the hands       of a junior technical staffer not even co-located with the       Chairman, the ability to control who can speak or even be       heard by other participants.        Other potential inhibitors could include a member's lack of       familiarity with the platform, lack of training, inadequate       resources (i.e., hardware, software, reception and       connectivity especially in rural areas), and user errors like       inadvertently pressing the mute button.        Virtual proceedings create an inability of Members to be       able to effectively interact and have conversations in person       with each other and with staff. Members won't have the same       opportunity to interact with each other in real-time that       they do with in person hearings. This puts the minority at a       distinct disadvantage because the majority controls the       content and the schedule. Minority strategy is always a last-      minute engagement and often is still forming as the hearing       begins.        Remote proceedings depend on the reliability various       technology elements. If anyone fails, members can't fully       participate.        Pre and post hearing engagement with witnesses, other       members, staff, and press will be lost. A lot of work is done       immediately before or after hearings in terms of connecting       with people. All of that time, connection, relationship       building will be gone.        Every Ranking Member who responded to a recent survey       expressed some level of concern over their members ability to       fully participate.        Virtual Committee Proceedings Raise Many Parliamentary Issues         Many rules aren't self-executing, and members may have       limited time to raise objections. Once the time has passed,       the opportunity is lost.        For example, a point of order regarding the germaneness of       an amendment must be made when the amendment is offered.       After reading the amendment is dispensed with, the       opportunity to object is lost.        The Majority already has demonstrated a great capacity to       ignore points of order, parliamentary inquiries, and       privileged motions. Since they will be controlling the       technology, how will Minority members ever get a chance to       even raise these procedural points?        It is unclear if current technologies have the capability       to have a clearly visible timer which will create challenges       enforcing time limits in a clear and transparent way.        Issues will arise without parliamentarians and counsels in       the room to advise on amendments, motions, objections, and       points of order.    Virtual Committee Proceedings Increase the Risk of the Politicization                       of Official Committee Business         Traditionally, there is a clear separation between official       business and campaign work. This is particularly the case       immediately before the general election, when the House       generally takes about a month off to go campaign. This       creates an important break between official hearings and       legislative activity. With remote proceedings, there's less       reasons the majority couldn't respond to some less than       positive polling results by marking up newly introduced       legislation that could make an impact in key districts       leading up to an election.    Virtual Committee Proceedings Jeopardize the Integrity of Proceedings                   and Raise Major Cybersecurity Concerns         Requiring Members to be present to vote ensure Members are       fully and transparently voting on their own volition. There       is no question of technological/cybersecurity problems       interfering with Members votes and there is no question as to       whether the vote was cast by the Member or by a third party.       Remote proceedings do not guarantee the same level of       transparency and accountability.   Experiences of Committees with Unofficial Virtual Committee Meetings so                    far Lend Credence to these Concerns.         Over 80 percent of Committees who responded to a survey       responded that their committee had held unofficial committee       meetings virtually over the past couple of months. Those       meetings experienced numerous issues including:        People getting dropped or unable to unmute themselves in a       timely manner.        Majority staff kicking people off if their numbers were not       RSVP'd. This could be a concern in the future if Members or       staff call in from an unrecognizable or un-RSVP'd phone       number.        Members personal information almost released publicly due       to platforms displaying the phone numbers of people on the       call.        A Member who couldn't participate because of inadequate       internet connection.        Unauthorized individuals accessing a meeting.        One committee attempted to hold a roundtable and       experienced such significant technical glitches that called       into question whether the bipartisan roundtable could even       occur. It took some participants up to 30 minutes to join the       Cisco Webex video chat while others could join with only with       audio or never participate at all. Once connected, many       participants could not tell who was speaking or even       controlling the video or microphone settings. A third-party       moderator was unaware until the end of the call that typed       questions were being submitted by users throughout the       conference for speakers to answer.  [[Page H2014]]         For another committee, the technical issues have been so       bad that Member participation in recent calls has steadily       declined with less than 30 percent of the Committee's members       participating in the most recent virtual meeting.    Safeguards Must be Adopted to Ensure Minority Rights and Security of              any Official Committee Proceeding Held Virtually         There needs to be a backup method of communication,       independent of the primary platform, so that members can       contact the Chair directly in the event the platform fails.        There must be clear rules and conditions developed in a bi-      partisan way on control of audio/visual with respect to       rights of minority. An independent IT operator should be       mandatory for any remote proceedings. Video feeds should be       equally accessible by both parties to ensure that no one can       censor or edit official proceedings after the fact.        Members should not be forced to participate in committee       activity over a technology platform when they are capable and       willing to attend in person. Committees should always allow       Members to participate by simply showing up to a hearing room       in one of the House Office buildings.        All other House Rules should remain in effect. If       committees are unable to guarantee procedural safeguards in       the rules, they should not be permitted to use technology to       deny Members procedural protections.        Technology should permit staff work. Committee staff engage       in a lot of real-time work during hearings and markups. The       technology should facilitate some ability for committee staff       to continue to assist Members in ``real-time.''        There needs to be additional information on the security of       the platform to be used and assurances that each Member has       the connectivity needed to support the meetings.     Madam Speaker, Members' personal  information on these roundtables has already been viewed publicly;  Members being dropped from platforms because of poor connections;  Members being unable to participate in web-based events due to poor  internet connections in rural areas. And the list goes on.   I mention these examples not to say that all virtual proceedings  cannot or should not be authorized, but I share these issues as further  proof that the ``crawl, walk, run'' approach is necessary to make sure  that virtual proceedings are done successfully.   In closing, I would like to reiterate what I shared at the Rules  Committee hearing yesterday. I want to encourage all of us to take a  step back. I want to make sure that we don't have a precedent set that  will create a brand-new process.   We are not here simply debating an outdated rule, Madam Speaker. We  are here debating what kind of institution we want the people's House  to be and the example that we want to set for the American people and  the rest of the world.   If we vote to adopt H. Res. 965, we are setting a new precedent that  will forever change the processes that are used in the House of  Representatives. It opens a Pandora's box, and it provides  constitutional risks. And in times of crisis, Americans should trust  their leaders. Vote ``no'' on H. Res. 965.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   House Democrats are once again taking advantage of a national  emergency to push their own political agenda. We shouldn't be  surprised, as we have seen them push their wish list at every turn.   We saw their attempts to federalize elections in H.R. 1; we saw it  during the last coronavirus relief package negotiation; and we are  seeing it again now. They are using the HEROES Act to nationalize  election policy, not to help Americans vote, but to serve their own  interests on election day.   This entire package would cost taxpayers $3 trillion, and at least  $23 million of that would be going toward their federal elections  takeover. Congress has already given $1.25 billion to States since  2018, $400 million alone to help States prepare for their elections  amid this pandemic.   What the Democrats are proposing is outrageous. They are also  requiring all States to adopt ballot harvesting. Ballot harvesting, in  the way House Democrats are trying to use it, is when any individual  can pick up any voter's ballot for any reason and deliver it to the  polling place, completely unchecked. They don't have to provide their  name. They don't have to show their ID. They don't have to be a  resident of the State. They don't have to be an American citizen.   Why would we force States to allow for people who aren't even  eligible to vote to then handle their voters' ballots?   This practice is so wrought with fraud that I released a report this  week, before consideration of this bill, to highlight how ballot  harvesting is being misused. It is a summary of 18 months of work by  the House Administration Republicans on this issue. We found that this  practice is one of the greatest threats to our ballot integrity.   In addition to this bill jeopardizing ballot integrity, it would also  jeopardize people's health. How will ballot harvesting follow social  distancing practices? Not to mention, allowing political operatives to  pick up ballots is not necessary when mail ballots may have prepaid  postage. Why does a ballot broker need to go door to door to pick up a  ballot when you can mail it in for free?    One can only assume, Mr. Speaker, that  this is only for political gain.   That is only one of the egregious provisions. The bottom line is,  election day is less than 6 months away. States don't have enough time  to implement these egregious election rules.   Last week, I received a letter from over 800 professors telling me to  vote for this bill. A little research showed that 400 of them are  donors to Democrats.   This is why this bill is politically motivated. It is a takeover of  the elections at the national level. We need to vote ``no'' on this.  [[Page H2228]]
