 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to be a voice for my rural  community and celebrate the passage of the Wind River Administrative  Site Conveyance Act.   Before being sworn into Congress, I acted with my predecessor, Jaime  Herrera Beutler, Senator Cantwell, and members of the Skamania County  Commission to pass the Wind River Administrative Site Conveyance Act in  the fiscal year 2023 spending bill.   As a Skamania County resident, I know that only 1.8 percent of our  land is fully taxable for generating necessary revenue for community  services. The Wind River Administrative Site Conveyance Act transfers  24 acres back into the county land base and increases opportunity for  small businesses in our community.   I thank my predecessor, Jaime Herrera Beutler, and Senator Cantwell  for leading this effort. I look forward to working with my colleagues  on both sides of the aisle to pass similarly important legislation.                       Recognizing Repair Clark County     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to be a voice for my community  and share with you the importance of Repair Clark County.   Repair Clark County is a nonprofit organization that rejects the  premise that when things break, we just throw them out, that we are  helpless consumers reliant on an endless cycle of cheap goods.   I was lucky to attend one of their events on January 21, and I saw a  little girl light up when her favorite night-light was fixed instead of  being thrown away. What an amazing gift to teach this child that we can  have a relationship of stewardship with our belongings, not just  consumerism.   These volunteers uphold our values of stewardship and self- sufficiency because, in America, DIY is in our DNA.   I thank Terra Heilman, the head of Repair Clark County, for  spearheading this effort.   I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the  aisle to work on Federal legislation that ensures all consumers have  the right and the ability to maintain and fix their own stuff.                           Recognizing iUrban Teen     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the iUrban Teen  organization for creating an incredibly diverse talent pipeline in my  district.   IUrban Teen provides skills training for teens and young adults and  gives them access to career pathways and alternatives that they need to  be successful and have more opportunities.   For example, the Future Teachers Pathway program brings together  Vancouver Public Schools, Washington State University Vancouver, and  Clark College to mentor students and give them the training they need  to succeed in their chosen career paths.   This is so critical for young people who face challenges and gives  them the support they deserve in their efforts to become critical  members of our community.   For the past 13 years, iUrban Teen has hosted a breakfast on Martin  Luther King Jr. Day. I was honored to attend their event.   I thank the iUrban Teen team for bridging the gap for students and  inspiring all of us to keep working for change.                           Honoring Mikhail Pavenko     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Mikhail Pavenko, a  resident of Vancouver, Washington.   In 1996, Mikhail emigrated from Ukraine to Vancouver, and he has  proudly worked as a lineman for the Clark County Public Utilities since  2014, literally keeping the lights on in my district.    Mr. Pavenko has recently taken on a new role. Since the conflict  between Ukraine and Russia began, he has returned to Ukraine more than  a dozen times to serve as a volunteer military chaplain.   Mikhail is and continues to be a beacon of light for many during  times of untold suffering. He inspires Ukrainians on the front line to  keep the faith and keep up the fight, and he simultaneously reminds all  of us that democracy is worth fighting for.   I cannot thank Mr. Pavenko enough for his service to the people of  Ukraine as they stand together against authoritarianism.        Congratulating the Columbia River Rapids Girls Volleyball Team     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to give a big shout-out to the  Columbia River Rapids girls volleyball team. They are doing an  incredible job. I am so excited to share this on the House floor.   The Rapids girls volleyball team won the 2A State title in three  sets, finishing an amazing season for the volleyball team. The entire  tournament, they only lost one set. What makes this even more notable  is they were a No. 6 seed, and they defeated three higher seeds to  attain this title.   These incredible young women played an impressive season and have  made me and our whole community very proud.   Congratulations to the Columbia River Rapids girls volleyball team on  their amazing accomplishments. I am so excited to see what they will do  next season.                            ____________________
