 Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the 250th  birthday of the town of Winslow, ME. Winslow is a town with a  fascinating history and a bright future, connected by generations of  hard-working and caring people.   Winslow was incorporated in 1771, but its story began long before.  For thousands of years, the land along the great Kennebec River was the  home of the Abenaki Tribe, who hunted, fished, and tilled the fertile  soil. The reverence the Abenaki had for the natural beauty and  resources of the region is upheld by the people of Winslow today.   Winslow's roots run deep into American history. It originally was a  Native American settlement called Taconock, meaning ``in the trees.''  Located in central Maine along the mighty Kennebec River, the village  was settled by colonists from Plymouth Colony.   Winslow is home to important historical sites. One of those sites,  Fort Halifax, the oldest blockhouse in the United States, was  constructed by the town's namesake, General John Winslow, in 1754 and  named after the Earl of Halifax, Secretary of State of Great Britain.  Fort Halifax was designated as a National Historic Landmark in 1968.   Today, visitors and residents enjoy this historic site at what is now  Fort Halifax Park. This land was once home to industrial and commercial  use after a railroad line was built in the 1840s to transport goods  from local mills. Years later, the site was developed into a park which  is now enjoyed for recreation, picnics, and holiday festivities.   Winslow's Ticonic Footbridge, known by locals as the Two Cent Bridge,  is one of the oldest footbridges and the last known toll footbridge in  the United States. The bridge, built in 1903, connects the two  communities of Winslow and Waterville. For several generations,  residents of Winslow crossed the bridge daily to work at the Waterville  mills.   Winslow honors the men and women who defend our freedom. Central  Maine Veterans Memorial Park was the dream of a group of veterans led  by WWII Navy veteran Daniel DeRoch. With the collaboration of town  officials, schools, residents, and veterans organizations, this park  pays tribute to all who served in the U.S. Army, Marine Corps, Navy,  Air Force, Coast Guard, National Guard, and Merchant Marine.   Mr. President, Winslow has played an important role in Maine history,  and it continues to exemplify the best of our great State today. I  congratulate to the people of Winslow on this landmark anniversary and  wish them all the best in the years to come.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the 250th  birthday of the town of Winthrop, ME. This landmark anniversary is a  time to celebrate the generations of hard-working and caring people who  have made it  [[Page S2197]]  such a wonderful place to live, work, and raise families.   Originally known as Pondtown Plantation, Winthrop was home to the  Abenaki, who thrived along its many lakes and ponds. Those same lakes  and ponds would propel Winthrop throughout history, including the  historic Winthrop Mills Company's woolen textile mill, and serve as a  beautiful backdrop for recreation.   Winthrop's roots run deep into American history. BG Henry Clay Wood,  who played a key role in the Battle of Wilson's Creek in Missouri  during the Civil War, was born in Winthrop. The philanthropist Charles  M. Bailey was also a resident of Winthrop and was very generous to the  town, adding to its rich history. Mr. Bailey donated the historic  Bailey Public Library, constructed in 1916.   Winthrop is also home to the Cobbossee Lighthouse. When it was  constructed in 1908, it was the only inland lighthouse east of the  Mississippi.   Maine is known as Vacationland, and Winthrop fits perfectly into that  picture. With all of the beautiful ponds and lakes, as well as the 807- foot Mount Pisgah, there is always something to do in Winthrop. The  energy and planning going into the town's 250th anniversary celebration  demonstrates the pride the townspeople have in their town.   Mr. President, Winthrop's 250th year is a time to celebrate the  people who, for longer than America has been a nation, have pulled  together, cared for one another, and built a great community. It is a  pleasure to offer my congratulations and best wishes.                            ____________________
