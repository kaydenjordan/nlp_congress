 Mr. Speaker, the number one concern that I  continue to hear from my constituents is the high cost of healthcare,  especially the skyrocketing prices of prescription drugs.   From Kendall to Key West, I have heard stories of patients that are  forced to choose between putting food on the table or paying for  lifesaving drugs. Meanwhile, Big Pharma continues to collect hundreds  of billions of dollars in profits each year.   This cannot continue. We must pass H.R. 3, the Elijah E. Cummings  Lower Drug Costs Now Act of 2019, which will save Floridians thousands  in drug costs each year.   This bill would cut Medicare spending by over $400 billion, and  reinvest these savings to combat the opioid epidemic, fund research for  new groundbreaking cures; it would expand Medicare benefits, and it  would also be used to strengthen community health centers.   As the past Dean of the Medical School at Florida International  University, I have worked directly with these centers and I have seen  firsthand the impact that they have had on our community.   In my district, Community Health of South Florida, or CHI, plays a  crucial role in providing care to the uninsured and underinsured.   In 2018 alone, CHI provided care for over 82,000 patients, including  primary care services, behavioral health, OB/GYN procedures, and free  HIV screenings.   These health centers serve everyone in the community, regardless of  their ability to pay. They expand quality, affordable healthcare for  everyone.   The time to act is now. We have to pass H.R. 3 to lower prescription  drug prices and strengthen the healthcare centers that thousands in my  district depend on for care.                            ____________________
