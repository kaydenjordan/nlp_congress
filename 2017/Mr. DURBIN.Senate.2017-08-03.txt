 Mr. President, I want to start this morning's  presentation on the floor of the Senate with a question. What is the  most heavily subsidized private business in America--the for-profit  business that receives more Federal subsidies than any other? Is it a  defense contractor? No. Is it some farming operation? No.   The most heavily subsidized for-profit, private business in America  today is for-profit colleges and universities. Why? Because the revenue  they receive from the Federal Government accounts for 85, 90, 95  percent or more of all of the revenue they take in. How can that  possibly be? How could you run a private for-profit business and have a  Federal subsidy of 98 percent? How is that possible?   Here is how it works. A student graduates from high school. The  student applies to a for-profit college or university. The for-profit  college or university accepts the student on the condition that the  student sign over Pell grants--Federal money--and the student's Federal  Government loan. The student signs over the Pell grant, signs over the  loan, and is enrolled in the school.   This for-profit school now is home free. They admitted the student.  They received all the money from the student, and the student is headed  for classes. It works only if the student, at the end of the day, ends  up with some value in their education--some experience that helps them  go on to get a job to pay off their student loans.   It turns out that, in too many instances, for-profit colleges and  universities entice these young people into signing up for classes that  are worthless. They end up not preparing them for any job. Now they are  in a terrible fix. If they finish the course, they have a heavy, large  student debt and they end up in a position where they can't get a job  and pay it off.   How often does this happen? Think of three numbers. So 9 percent of  students graduating from high school today in America go to for-profit  colleges and universities. What am I talking about--for-profit? There  is the University of Phoenix, DeVry, Rasmussen, and the list goes on  and on. So 9 percent of high school students go to these schools, and  20 percent or more of Federal aid to education goes to these schools.  Why? Because the tuition they charge is so high. But here is the  kicker: 35 percent, one out of three students in America who defaults  on their student loans has attended these for-profit colleges and  universities.   We decided under the previous administration, the Obama  administration, to start asking some hard questions. How are these for- profit colleges and universities enticing these students in? What are  they saying to them to bring them in to sign up for classes and for  their student loans?   Secondly, if the students finish their degrees at these for-profit  colleges and universities, how likely are they to end up with a job  that is worth something--a job that allows them to pay back their  student loan? Those are legitimate questions; aren't they? If you were  the parent of a child who said: Dad, I just heard about the University  of Phoenix, and I want to go to school there, you would obviously say:  Well, what are you interested in taking? Is it a good course? How much  does it cost? What will be your debt when you are finished? What is  your likelihood of finding a job? Those are obvious questions. We put  all those questions into something called the gainful employment rule.  At the end of graduating from for-profit colleges and universities,  will you be gainfully employed as a graduated student into a job that  gives you a chance to pay off your student loan and really keeps the  promise that the for-profit school made to you?   Just weeks ago, the new Secretary of Education, Betsy DeVos,  announced that our U.S. Department of Education was going to rewrite  the gainful employment rule. The rule, as I said, was written by the  Obama administration after years of contentious debate with the  industry. It was designed to ensure that career training programs that  receive Federal student aid are meeting their statutory obligation to  prepare the students for a job--for gainful employment.   Don't forget that a lot of young people applying for college are in  families that have limited college experience. Mom and Dad may have  never gone to college. So when you say DeVry or University of Phoenix,  Mom and Dad may say: Is it any good, Son? Is it any good,  [[Page S4783]]  Daughter? The son or daughter can say: Dad, the Federal Government will  loan me the money to go there. It must be a good school. They wouldn't  loan me the money to go to a place that is bad. That is a natural  reaction. We are, in fact, condoning, endorsing this industry by  saying: If you go to these schools, you get taxpayer-funded student  loans.    I don't think it is too much to ask the programs promising to train  students for specific jobs that actually lead to students being able to  get those jobs and, in the process, repay their loans.   The gainful employment rule cuts off Federal student aid if programs  where graduates' ratio of student debt to earnings is too high during  any 2 years of a 3-year period. We look at the jobs of the graduate of  the for-profit schools, we look at the income of the students, and then  ask: What is the likelihood that student can make their student loan  repayment based on their employment? Is it, in fact, gainful  employment?   So prior to leaving office, the Obama Department of Education  released gainful employment data for the year 2016. It showed that  graduates of public undergraduate certificate programs--now that is  those who go to community colleges, different colleges altogether--earn  $9,000 more than those who went to for-profit colleges and  universities. Do you know what the difference is?   If you decide to go to a community college in my home State of  Illinois, in my hometown of Springfield, and go to Lincoln Land  Community College--a great community college like most of those in our  State--you are going to get an education, a good one, and it will not  cost you much. Let me give you the kicker. All of your hours can be  transferred to upper level colleges and universities, but if you make a  bad decision and go to a for-profit college, different things happen.  You end up with a real debt for that first year out of high school and  guess what. Virtually none of the credit hours you take at that for- profit school can be transferred to any other college or university.  That is the reality of what students face.   Of the programs that saddled students with too much debt compared to  the income students receive after the program--listen to this--when we  looked at all of the student debt and all of the jobs of all of the  graduates across the United States, it turns out, 98 percent of the  students who couldn't pay off their student loans after graduating went  to for-profit colleges and universities. That was the 2016 analysis.  That is what led to the gainful employment rule.   This is cruel to take a young person who is doing just what they were  told to do--go to college, get a degree, don't quit with high school-- saddle them with debt, make an empty promise about what is going to  happen after they graduate, and then they find themselves in a job they  can't pay off their student loan. Let me give you a specific example so  you can really understand what we have run into.   The digital photography program at the Illinois Institute of Art in  Schaumburg, IL--now, let me quickly add, the folks who put this  together were pretty smart. We have an outstanding college in Chicago  called the Art Institute of Illinois. My daughter graduated from there.  However, this bunch, the for-profit group, decided to call their  operation the Illinois Institute of Art, instead of the Art Institute  of Chicago.   They are owned by a for-profit giant, the Education Management  Corporation. They failed the gainful employment rule in the year 2016.  Listen to what it wrote on their website for students who wanted to  enroll:         There's a market for people who constantly find innovative       ways to fill the world with their ideas, impressions, and       insights. And Digital Photography can help you make a       positive impression when you're ready to match your talents       against the competition. From the very start, we'll guide       your development, both creatively and technically . . . it's       a step-by-step process that's all about preparing you for a       future when you can do what you love.    That is what is on the website for the high school student who likes  the idea of majoring in digital photography at the Illinois Institute  of Art in Schaumburg. Boy, doesn't that sound good?   So let's contrast that with what the gainful employment rule found  about that particular program. Get ready. Do you know what the total  cost of the digital photography course was at the Illinois Institute of  Art, the for-profit school--total cost of tuition, fees, books, and  supplies to prepare you to be a digital photographer? It is $88,000-- $88,000. It gets better. That is if you live off campus.   Do you want to live on campus? The company helps you find an  apartment nearby. Over the 4 years, it is an additional $56,000.   Let's do the quick math here. That is $144,000 in debt, finishing 4  years, majoring in digital photography at the Illinois Institute of  Art. How many students have to borrow money to do that? Eighty four  percent of the students who went to that school and took digital  photography had to borrow the money--84 percent.   Guess what the typical graduate of the Illinois Institute of Art in  Schaumburg, IL, in the digital photography course earns after leaving  the program. Do you remember that promise on their website? How much do  they earn? On average, it is $20,493--$20,493.   Here is a quick calculation. What if I am being paid the minimum wage  in America? In Illinois, it is $9.25 an hour. Well, I would be making  right around $18,500 a year in a minimum-wage job. I have gone to the  Illinois Institute of Art in Schaumburg to take the digital photography  course and instead of making $18,500 a year, I am making $20,493. That  is almost $2,000 more a year. Oh, I forget. I forgot $144,000 in debt  that I also have. Let's do the math. How many years of an additional  $2,000 to pay off $144,000? It is only 72 years, and you would be able  to pay off your student debt. What a rip-off. These people ought to be  ashamed of themselves, and we ought to be ashamed of ourselves that we  are supporting this kind of fraudulent activity at the expense of  students who were just trying to get a better education.   That is why we wrote this gainful employment rule, to say to the  Illinois Institute of Art and those just like them: Stop it. Stop  fleecing these kids, stop burying them in debt. Incidentally, many  times parents and even grandparents sign on for that debt too.   You know something else you ought to remember? Of all the debts you  could incur in life, there are only a handful of them that can never be  discharged in bankruptcy. Student loans would happen to be in that  category. Do you know what that means? No matter how bad it gets--and  it could get to the point where you have no income whatsoever--no  matter how bad it gets, you can't go to the courts and say: Please,  turn me free. Discharge this debt in bankruptcy. Give me a chance to  start all over again.   You can do it with your home mortgage. You can do it with an auto  loan. You can do it if you have a loan for a boat but not with student  loans. It is with you for a lifetime.   We have had cases where Grandma decided to help her granddaughter by  cosigning the note at one of these miserable schools. The granddaughter  couldn't pay back the student loan, and they went after Grandma's  Social Security payments. That is what this is all about. That is how  serious this can become.   There is no way students leaving that digital photography program at  this for-profit college in Schaumburg will ever repay their loans  making that money. Under the gainful employment rule, if the Illinois  Institute of Art doesn't change its program or lower its price or help  its students get better jobs, we would stop providing student loans to  the students who are engaged in that program. We are not going to be  complicit--we shouldn't be--in this fraud. The rule requires schools to  post their gainful employment data online using a new, easy-to-read  disclosure so students can read what happened to students who took the  digital photography course. Did they get jobs? How much did they earn?   That is also one of the requirements of the gainful employment rule.  It requires schools to provide warnings to students in advertising and  marketing materials about failing programs so they know before they  sign up--they know before they go in debt.   Think about what these disclosures and warnings might have meant to  Ami Schneider from Hoffman Estates, IL. Ami went to this notorious art  institute--the Illinois Institute of Art--  [[Page S4784]]  the Schaumburg digital photography program from 2007 to 2010. She wrote  me a letter and told me her story.   Ami said she moved out of her parents' house at age 19, and after a  few years, realized she couldn't have the life she wanted with the job  she was working. She was getting 50-cent-an-hour raises every year. She  said: I wanted to pursue a career, and I really was serious. I was  passionate about it. She visited this Illinois Institute of Art campus  in Schaumburg. ``I went into [the school],'' she wrote me, ``and they  fed me all these success stories. They told me they had [an] excellent  placement'' program.   What do you think would have happened if they would have told Ami  that at the end of the day, she would have been making slightly more  than minimum wage after taking all these courses and incurring all this  debt? What if they had been required to tell Ami that employers  wouldn't accept her degree and she would never pay off her student  loan?   Well, Ami and tens of thousands of students like her across the  country would have been spared from a hardship that can change their  lives. Ami says her time at the Illinois Institute of Art ``ended up  ruining my life.'' In her twenties, she made a decision to go to  college, got so deeply in debt, and can't pay it back.   The program culminated in a portfolio show where the students  displayed their best work. Do you know how many employers--after Ami  finished the course and did her display--do you know how many employers  showed up for Ami's class portfolio show at the Illinois Institute of  Art? None. Not one.   Ami and her family who took out the loans to help her now hold more  than $100,000 in student loan debt from her time at the Illinois  Institute of Art. She is stuck with a degree which, as she said, she  ``considered a joke.''   Using the questionable legal authority, which she claims she has, the  new Secretary of Education, Betsy DeVos, has decided to delay for a  year the requirement that schools warn students like Ami about these  failing programs--delayed it for a year. That is another year that for- profit education companies will be able to hide the truth about their  miserable results. It means students are going to be defrauded because  Education Secretary Betsy DeVos has decided to let it happen.   It means more students like Ami and more Federal dollars in the  pockets of these greedy, for-profit college executives. You wouldn't  believe what these people pay themselves who head up these for-profit  colleges and universities. Take the most successful basketball coach in  the United States of America at the college level, take the most  successful football coach in a State like Alabama, take a look at what  they get paid--and I am sure in Alabama they would pay them even more  if they could--and then compare it to what these CEOs pay themselves  off these poor students. It is disgraceful. For the sake of the  students and taxpayers who immediately would benefit from real  warnings, it is time for us in Congress to speak up.   We also know Secretary DeVos intends to eventually rewrite the  gainful employment rule, what she called a ``regulatory reset.'' What  does that mean?   We hear a lot of speeches on the floor about too much government  regulation. If you were Ami Schneider or her parents, would you  consider a disclosure to students about the real results of their  education, a disclosure to students about the debt they are going to  incur and the income they are likely to earn overregulation by the  Federal Government?   We are putting a lot of money on the line to give $100,000, at least,  of the Federal taxpayers' dollars to Ami to go to school, but she has  to promise to pay it back. If she defaults, that money isn't paid back  into the Treasury. For the good of the taxpayers as well as for her  family, we should have some basic regulations, some basic  accountability.   While Secretary DeVos says the rule is unfair and arbitrary, the  Department of Education Inspector General agreed with the assertion  that it was a good rule in terms of protecting kids and protecting  taxpayers. I am proud to say the rule is supported by many State  Attorneys General, including Lisa Madigan in my home State of Illinois,  veterans groups, and student advocates.   Secretary DeVos said the gainful employment rule has been  ``repeatedly . . . overturned by the courts'' Wrong. In effect, since  it went into effect in 2015, every Federal court it has been in front  of has upheld the underlying rule. The Secretary is just plain wrong.   It is time for Secretary DeVos and the Trump administration to stop  aiding and abetting for-profit colleges that defraud students and bilk  taxpayers.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.                      Recognition of the Minority Leader
