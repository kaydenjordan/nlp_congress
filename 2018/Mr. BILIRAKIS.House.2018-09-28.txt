 Mr. Speaker, the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities  Act is the product of a year of hearings and investigations into  America's opioid crisis.   This thoughtful bipartisan legislation will provide more tools to our  communities to help them. I am proud that we included my legislative  efforts to help Medicare beneficiaries, begin reforms to the sober home  industry, and address the problem of patient brokering.   We need to pass this bill and give our constituents the help they  need.
