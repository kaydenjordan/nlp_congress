 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate and  celebrate the accomplishments of the Young Harris College men's soccer  team.   As an alumnus of Young Harris College, I am honored to recognize the  hard work and resiliency of the entire staff and team.   On October 20, the team rallied together to win the 2021 Peach Belt  Conference title. Scoring twice in the last 5 minutes, the Mountain  Lions were able to secure a 2-1 win over Georgia Southwestern State  University for the title. This victory marks the sixth Peach Belt  Conference title in program history.   Beyond the soccer field, these student athletes are to be commended  for their academic success and commitment to the Young Harris College  Community.   I, along with the entire Mountain Lion community, will be cheering  the team on as they continue their season. Congratulations to the  players, coaches, and parents on an incredible season and a well- deserved win.   Go Mountain Lions.                            ____________________
