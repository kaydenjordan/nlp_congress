 Madam President, it hardly seemed possible that the  reports and images from Ukraine could grow even more horrifying, but  they actually have.   In recent days, Ukrainian troops have reclaimed the town of Bucha  from the illegal and illegitimate Russian invasion. And in the wake of  the retreating Russians, the Ukrainians and the press have reported  evidence of evil, wanton torture, rape, and murder of civilians. There  are reports of mass graves, of people executed with their hands bound  behind their backs. The photographs and reports are sickening and  appalling.   Since before Putin even began his escalation, I have spent months  pushing the Biden administration and our allies and partners to get as  much lethal assistance possible to the Ukrainians as quickly as  possible. I have supported  [[Page S1929]]  many of the steps our President has gotten around to taking, but in  almost every case, I wish he had acted sooner and more boldly.   We know of the horrors committed by Russian forces in Bucha because  the Ukrainian military reclaimed the town after pushing back the  Russians. These latest revelations must only strengthen and intensify  our resolve to get the Ukrainians what they need, on the timeframe they  need, to liberate more towns currently under Russian control, to  prevent Russia from committing new atrocities, to fight and to actually  win this war.   This also further reinforces what I wish more of our European friends  realize: This is a time for choosing. This is not a time for business  as usual, and there can be no return to business as usual whenever and  however the dust settles.   Europe must move more urgently to decouple from Russia. Yes, this  will entail some short-term economic pain. Yes, their own shortsighted  energy policies have left their countries entirely too dependent. But  there are times when geopolitical realities and moral imperatives must  outweigh short-term financial costs. Our partners should recognize that  such a time is staring them right in the face, so should our own  American private sector.   Internationally, I am sure there will be much virtue-signaling  rhetoric over the atrocities committed on Ukrainian soil by Russia. Let  us be honest that referrals to the International Criminal Court or  invocations of the U.N. Human Rights Council may make people's  consciences feel better but will not curtail the atrocities or stop the  violence. Only victory in Ukraine can do that.   Finally, the outpouring of outrage at these atrocities should prompt  a second look at other terrible actions that the world has come to  simply shrug and accept.   The Biden administration is right to ask the U.N. to expel Russia  from the Human Rights Council, but they shouldn't stop there. The world  that rightly recoils in horror at the photographs from Ukraine should  not look the other way past Xi's concentration camps for the Uighur  people. The modern totalitarianism of the People's Republic of China is  no less abhorrent because it is sanitized and it is organized. The  world's worst abusers of human rights do not deserve to sit on such a  Council.                               Border Security    Madam President, now on another matter, our southern border is  already in crisis on Democrats' watch. And on Friday, the Biden  administration announced they are going to throw open the floodgates  even wider.   In December 2020, right before President Biden took office, he said  it would be ``the last thing we need'' if we were to ``end up with two  million people on our border.'' But in 2021, on his watch, under his  policies, that is exactly what America got.   Last year saw a record-shattering 2 million arrests on our southern  border; 2 million people--more than the population of 13 whole States-- from at least 160 different countries. And those are just the people  who actually got caught. And 2022 is already on track to be even worse.  As we speak, border officials are encountering roughly 7,000 persons  each day, and the Department of Homeland Security predicts this pace  could more than double.   The Biden administration's own officials say they are contingency  planning for 18,000 encounters every single day. For perspective, that  pace would be equivalent to 6.6 million--6.6 million--per year, a  population larger than all but 17 of our States.   Now, thus far, the Biden administration kept using a legal tool  called title 42, which they inherited from the prior administration  because of the COVID pandemic.   Title 42 provides a shortcut for swift border enforcement. It has  given the administration a fast track to turn people around as they  arrive.   In February, more than 91,000 people were immediately turned around  under title 42. Another 73,000 were allowed to stay and navigate our  system.   So, without title 42, instead of adding 73,000 illegal immigrants to  our system alone, we would have added more than double that--160,000-- in just 1 month. But, on Friday, the Biden administration announced an  unbelievably bad decision. They are going to further cave to the far  left that wants open borders. They are going to cancel title 42 this  spring with no real border security plan to replace it.   This is such an absurd decision, such an unforced gaffe, that even  some of our Senate Democratic colleagues have come out swinging. Our  colleague from West Virginia correctly described this as ``a  frightening decision'' to abandon ``an essential tool'' when ``we are  already facing an unprecedented increase in migrants.'' Another Senate  Democrat said, ``This is the wrong decision.'' A third said it ``shows  a lack of understanding about the crisis at our border.'' A fourth said  the move ``will likely lead to a migrant surge that the administration  does not appear to be ready for.''   The problem is that these same Senate Democrats have backed this far- left administration over and over again on immigration. Every single  Democratic Senator supported both Secretaries Mayorkas and Becerra.  Every single Democrat Senator voted against preserving ``Remain in  Mexico,'' voted against defunding sanctuary cities, and voted against  an amendment that would have funded the full enforcement of all  immigration laws.   Later this week, we expect every Democratic Senator to vote to  confirm a Supreme Court nominee who is a proven judicial activist on  this very issue. Judge Jackson has gone beyond the judicial role to  rewrite immigration policy from the bench and make it even more  liberal. In one case, she ignored the plain text of the law to reach a  more liberal outcome. She even tried to force a nationwide injunction  on the entire country. Judge Jackson went so far beyond the law to  remake immigration policy that even the liberal DC Circuit had to  overturn her mistaken ruling. An Obama appointee wrote the decision  that overturned Judge Jackson.   So I am glad to see our Democratic colleagues belatedly waking up to  the border crisis and beginning to pressure the administration.  Fourteen months late is better than never. But votes speak louder than  press releases. The measure of a Senator's position isn't our rhetoric;  it is actually our votes.   If our colleagues who have stood in lockstep with President Biden's  border crisis thus far are serious about turning over a new leaf, they  can start with the Supreme Court vote later this week.
