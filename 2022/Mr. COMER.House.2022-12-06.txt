 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 1-year  anniversary of the devastating tornadoes that struck my district.   On December 10 and 11, 2021, communities from Fulton to Taylor County  endured a fierce, long-track tornado that leveled numerous communities.  The damage sustained during the relentless storm was unimaginable, and  our prayers are still with the families who lost loved ones.   In the aftermath of this disaster, Kentuckians across the  Commonwealth came together to offer help, provide support, and deliver  aid when many needed it most.   As the communities continue to rebuild and recover, I want to  recognize the local servant leaders and citizens who are helping get  our communities back on their feet. As we continue to move forward, I  am inspired by their courageous efforts to restore our local  communities.   Serving the people of Kentucky's First Congressional District is an  honor, and my office remains committed to assisting their recovery  efforts in every way.                     Dawson Springs Tornado Relief Effort     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the selfless  efforts of local Kentuckians who served their community in a time of  need.   Todd Marshall, Larry Cavanah, Kent Workman, Zach Willett, Paulette  Gray,  [[Page H8797]]  Brandon Godbey, Tamara Rice, Abby Garrett, and Gabe Workman answered  the call to aid their fellow Kentuckians after the devastating tornado  on December 10, 2021.   With their assistance, Dawson Springs Independent school was  transformed overnight into the Dawson Springs tornado relief center. As  the community began to rebuild and recover, thousands walked through  the school's front doors in need of aid.   This group of Kentuckians dedicated their time to help sort over  29,000 pounds of clothing, prepare warm meals each day, and provide  families with a Christmas by converting classrooms into departments for  women's clothing, men's clothing, baby equipment, and toys.   On behalf of Kentucky's First Congressional District, I express my  heartfelt thanks to this group of extraordinary administrators, staff,  faculty, and students. Their compassion for our communities did not go  unnoticed.                Honoring Judge John Phelps Upon His Retirement     Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor Judge John Phelps on his  retirement as judge executive of Cumberland County, Kentucky.   A native of Cumberland County, John has dedicated his life to  bettering his local community and State. After graduating from  Cumberland County High School, John married his high school sweetheart,  Leslie, and raised a family of four children and four grandchildren in  his hometown of Burkesville.   In addition to being a dedicated family man, John served south  central Kentucky in various ways throughout his career, including as a  well-respected loan officer and realtor before becoming Cumberland  County judge executive in 2011.   For over a decade, John served his constituents with honor and  humility. In 2020, he was elected president of the Kentucky County  Judge/Executive Association. In this role, he led the association in  helping judge executives work together to solve common issues and  improve their local governments.   I am proud to have worked with Judge John Phelps throughout his  career and wish him the very best in a well-deserved retirement.                 Honoring Judge Wade White on His Retirement     Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to honor Judge Wade White of  Lyon County, Kentucky, who is retiring at the end of the year.   Judge White's dedication to the community has not gone unnoticed. He  was first elected to the position in 2010 and then reelected in 2014  and 2018.   In recognition of his service, Judge White has received multiple  awards as Lyon County judge executive, including the Keep the Tennessee  River Beautiful group's Kentucky Elected Official Ripple Effect award.   He was also inducted into the Freshwater Fishing Hall of Fame in 2016  and 2018.   Before taking on his responsibilities as judge executive, he worked  for 14 years in several roles for State Farm and Progressive Insurance  companies. In fact, President Biden nominated Judge White to serve on  the Tennessee Valley Authority board of directors in June of this year.   Judge White has been a passionate advocate for issues impacting our  local communities, including Land Between the Lakes, rural broadband  access, and our effort to rid local waterways of Asian carp.   When people say the squeaky wheel gets the grease, as the Congressman  for Lyon County over the past 6 years, I can tell you that Judge White  is the squeaky wheel.   On behalf of Kentucky's First Congressional District, I thank Judge  White for his dedicated service to improving our communities.             Honoring Judge Hollis Alexander Upon His Retirement     Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to honor Judge Executive Hollis  Alexander of Trigg County, Kentucky, who is retiring at the end of the  year.   Judge Alexander has been a leader and public servant in Trigg County  and Cadiz for over three decades.   He has served in various capacities, including working for the Cadiz  Fire and Police Departments, the Trigg County Ambulance Service and  Sheriff's Office, and the Pennyrile Narcotics Task Force.   Before serving in his current position, Judge Alexander was the chief  of the Cadiz Police Department for 16 years, from 1996 to 2012. After  being appointed Trigg County judge in 2012, he was reelected in 2014  and 2018.    Judge Alexander has been a vocal advocate for Land Between the Lakes  National Recreation Area and important issues concerning rural  Kentucky.   On behalf of Kentucky's First Congressional District, I thank Judge  Alexander for his commitment to and passion for improving our  communities.                 Recognizing Bart Rowland Upon His Retirement     Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize my good friend, Bart  Rowland, upon his retirement from the Kentucky House of  Representatives.   Bart served Monroe, Cumberland, Metcalfe, Green, Hart, and Hardin  Counties as their voice in Frankfort for 10 years.   Bart was a very well-respected member of the Kentucky General  Assembly who quickly rose the ranks to become chairman of the Kentucky  House Banking and Insurance Committee. As chairman, Bart passed many  bills that improved the entire financial services industry in Kentucky.   Bart was elected for the first time in 2012 during a special  election, which happened as a result of his predecessor being elected  Kentucky Commissioner of Agriculture. Mr. Speaker, I was Bart's  predecessor, and I can say with confidence that the people of my home  area never had a better State representative than Bart Rowland.   Bart and his wife, Jerri, and their three kids reside in  Tompkinsville, Kentucky. On behalf of everyone who Bart has represented  so well over the past decade, I wish him and his family the very best  in the next chapter of their lives.                 Role of House Oversight and Reform Committee     Mr. Speaker, I would like to discuss an issue today that  has been in the news a lot over the last few weeks, and it pertains to  the role of the House Oversight and Reform Committee. God willing,  January 3, I will take command as chairman of the House Oversight and  Reform Committee.   My goal, as I have said to just about every media outlet that has  asked about it, I want to bring the House Oversight and Reform  Committee back to its original intent. The intent of the House  Oversight and Reform Committee is to eliminate waste, fraud, abuse, and  mismanagement in the Federal Government, and I believe when we look  around in the Federal Government, we see a whole lot of waste, fraud,  abuse, and mismanagement.   When asked about my priorities as the next chairman of the House  Oversight and Reform Committee, I want to talk about my first priority,  and that is to get the backs of the taxpayers of the United States of  America.   Just in the name of COVID, over the past 3 years, Mr. Speaker, so  that spans two administrations, this body has been reckless in its  spending in the name of COVID. When you look at all the stimulus bills,  all the stimulus programs, all the giveaways, those dollar amounts run  into the trillions of dollars.   Now, we can talk about all the money and go down line by line, and we  will see a lot of success stories. Take the PPP loan program, for  example. There are some great success stories in there. I don't think  anyone in this body, regardless of their ideology, regardless of  whether we are rural, urban, suburban, whatever, wouldn't argue that,  during COVID, there were industries that suffered far worse than other  industries.   For example, anything in the tourism or travel industry, obviously,  was devastated, whether they be the airline companies, whether they be  hotels, whether they be anything pertaining to leisure travel. The PPP  loan program was a lifesaver for many of those businesses.   When we had the very brief debate on the PPP loan program, the goal  was to help businesses keep people working during the government  shutdown by supplementing and subsidizing their payrolls, which was  noble because if you look at it, the government was going to pay for it  one way or the other, either in the form of PPP loans or in the form of  unemployment insurance.  [[Page H8798]]    So, we had to step up in this body. But, like this body does time  after time after time, there were not sufficient guardrails on that  program. We have stories coming in every day by various media outlets,  by various investigative reporters, by various oversight mainly and  almost exclusively by Republican committees in this body that will show  that there were fraudulent businesses that didn't even exist that got  millions and millions of dollars alone.   We will find that there were businesses that had record years during  COVID. They never missed a beat. They never had a layoff. They had  record years. They got millions and millions of dollars.   We even read just this week how many law firms in America that never  missed a beat during COVID got huge PPP loans. We even read that Hunter  Biden's former law firm got over $10 million in PPP loans despite never  missing a beat.   So, in this congressional body, in this House of Representatives, who  in the majority has been providing oversight over the PPP loan program?  It has not been the House Oversight and Reform Committee.                                time  1945    We have been investigating the Washington Commanders. We have been  investigating what the world would look like if the United States  passed the Equal Rights Amendment. We have had bills on white  supremacy. We have had bills on abortion.   What we haven't had bills on is oversight.   During the prior 2 years when the House flipped the last time and the  Democrats took the majority in the House Oversight Committee, there  were dozens and dozens of high-level Trump cabinet secretaries and  appointees that testified before the House Oversight Committee. Dozens  and dozens. I want to say in the upper thirties.   Fast forward to the last 2 years of the Biden administration. Do you  know how many cabinet secretaries and undersecretaries have testified  in front of the House Oversight Committee?   Zero. Zero. That is going to change on January 3.   Back to COVID, which is what I want to have as the first hearing of  the Oversight Committee. We have had programs that have gone unchecked.  We have made mistakes in this body, like this body always does,  especially when we rush bills, and we don't read bills and we must pass  bills.   Then you look at the unemployment insurance extension. Most of these  programs were administered by the States. But the States were getting  money and mandates from the Federal Government.   And now guess what we are learning, Mr. Speaker?   We are learning that there were hundreds of thousands of fraudulent  unemployment claims, maybe millions. It is estimated that as many as 25  percent of all the extended unemployment that this body continued to  approve went by the way of fraud; many to foreign countries.   Who has been looking into that in the House of Representatives over  the past year and a half?   Not the House Oversight Committee. I haven't seen a committee in here  that has been checking into that. So that is going to be our role.   Then you look at the stimulus money. The hospitals. I love hospitals.  I have 29 hospitals in my Congressional District; I would say as many  as anybody in this body. Hospitals received a lot of money. The list  goes on and on and on. State and local money.   We had jurisdiction on the House Oversight Committee. $350 billion  with no guardrails. That is what we kept saying, no guardrails on the  State and local money.   Who has been looking into that?   Not the House Oversight Committee. But that is going to change on  January 3.   So we have a lot of challenges in our quest to get the backs of the  American taxpayers. We want to identify waste. We want to identify  fraud. We want to identify abuse. We want to hold people accountable  for abuse and fraud.   We would love to try to claw some of this money back. And in some  instances Secret Service with some of the fraud has been able to claw  some of the money back that was spent fraudulently in the name of  COVID.   So all the COVID money that was spent is going to be a priority for  the House Oversight Committee.   We are also going to have a huge interest in the debacle at the  southern border, Mr. Speaker. When you look at what is going on on the  border--and there has been no shortage of floor speeches on this side  of the aisle in the past 2 years about that--we are concerned about  some of the decisions that have been made at the top. We have been to  the border, the Republicans on the House Oversight Committee, many  times. I have several members of the committee that represent border  States. We have heard from Border Patrol agents. And I will tell you,  Mr. Speaker, what we have heard from Border Patrol agents is very  concerning, especially about conversations they have had with Secretary  Mayorkas.   In a recent trip to the southern border, about a week or so ago,  Leader McCarthy announced that investigating the potential wrongdoing  at the southern border would be a priority in the next Congress and  that Mr. Jordan and Mr. Comer would oversee the investigation. We are  going to do that. We are going to do that on day one.   Then we look at other hearings that have been in the news that--I  don't think it is any secret, and I will conclude with this one, Mr.  Speaker--we talk about the Biden family influence-pedaling  investigation.   Now, there are some media outlets that have done a very good job of  reporting accurately what the purpose of this investigation is.   And then there are a whole lot of media outlets that have blown this  off, and they say this is the Hunter Biden laptop investigation.   That is not true and let me be very clear. This is an investigation  of the President of the United States to determine whether or not he  and his administration is compromised because of the millions and  millions of dollars that they have received from our adversaries in  China, Russia, Ukraine, and even the Middle East.   We look at all the decisions that this administration has made that  we scratch our heads and say, Why would they do this? Why would they do  that? Why would they cancel the Keystone pipeline? Why would they cut  off drilling? Why would they make it harder to get permits? Why are  they going to Saudi Arabia begging for more oil? Why are we trying to  force electric vehicles on the Postal Service fleet and the government.  And why are we doing all of this stuff?   Then you look at some of the business dealings that the President's  family was involved in, and the one that strikes me as the most  concerning, Mr. Speaker, was the one with CEFC China Energy, which was  a Chinese energy company.   Then Hudson West, which was the company that the President's son was  involved with, a company that the President's son also asked for keys  to be made because of his partner coming in, which happened to be the  current President of the United States.   But regardless, there was a map of the United States of America on  that laptop. It was in Chinese, and it had all these major natural gas  suppliers listed. The objective was to help this Chinese energy company  not only purchase American liquefied natural gas, but also, to help  this Chinese company start taking ownership in the drillers of natural  gas in the United States.    Now, let's think about that. There is outrage in this body, there is  outrage in America over China buying farmland in the Dakotas. Here we  have an effort by the Biden family to help China take ownership of an  American energy industry. I find that concerning, Mr. Speaker.   We have been criticized for wanting to investigate this by many in  the mainstream media, and I find that ironic, considering that in the  last administration there were many investigations. In fact, they are  still investigating the last administration.   Now, I am not going to comment on the last administration, whether  these investigations are warranted or not. It is not up to me to  decide.   What I will say is we are going to investigate any potential  wrongdoing in this White House. And at the very least, we are going to  let the American people know exactly what was going on within this  family. It is not just the President's son, it is the President's  [[Page H8799]]  brothers, as well. This was a family business. They didn't manufacture  anything. They weren't licensed to sell anything. They don't own any  real estate. They don't have any employees.   What was the business? I would argue it is influence pedaling. But we  are going to investigate that and see.   So the one challenge I have, and that we will have providing  oversight from this side of the aisle on, is to restore confidence in  congressional oversight, because let's just be honest, Mr. Speaker--and  I blame both parties for this--congressional oversight doesn't have a  lot of credibility.   We have had a lot of high-profile hearings over the past decade that  really haven't, unfortunately, amounted to a whole lot. There has been  a lot of fishing, a lot of hearings, a lot of outrage, a lot of tax  dollars spent. Some pretty good information has been recovered, but at  the end of the day, not a lot has happened.   I blame, again, both parties, particularly the current chairman of  the House Intelligence Committee because many of his investigations  were based on things that we now know, like the Steele dossier, were  not true.   So this investigation with the President of the United States is  based on interviews that we have already had. This is based on  documents that we have, many in that laptop, which by the way, The  Washington Post has confirmed is a legitimate laptop. Then when the  White House and the Democratic National Committee came out and said,  oh, well, that may be the President's son's laptop, but it has been  compromised; there has been a folder added. CBS News did a forensic  audit and proved that that is a legitimate hard drive that has not--and  I repeat--has not been tampered with.   Now, we find out from Elon Musk that there were people involved in  the President's campaign, involved in the Democratic National  Committee, and I fear involved in high levels of the Government--we  haven't gotten to that yet, but stay tuned--that were telling everyone,  especially in the social media companies, oh, that is not true, that is  Russian disinformation. Very concerning because one must ask oneself:  Why were they doing that? What is on that computer?   And don't tell me, Mr. Speaker, it is a bunch of pictures and videos.  I don't care about the pictures and videos. It is the data on there  about the Biden family influence pedaling with our adversaries across  the globe.   That, Mr. Speaker, is why the House Oversight Committee will  investigate the President of the United States for any potential  wrongdoing and try to determine whether or not this administration is  compromised.   Mr. Speaker, I thank you for the time today. I thank you for the  opportunity to tell the American people a little bit about what the  House Oversight Committee's goals and objectives are in the next  Congress.   We have a big job. Not only do we have trillions of dollars to try to  account for what has been misappropriated, misspent, abused in this  body, we also have a lot of investigations to conduct while at the same  time trying to restore credibility for congressional investigation.   I look forward to working with every Member of this body, Mr.  Speaker, and I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
