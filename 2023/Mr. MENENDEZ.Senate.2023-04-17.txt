 Madam President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export  Control Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of  certain proposed arms sales as defined by that statute. Upon such  notification, the Congress has 30 calendar days during which the sale  may be reviewed. The provision stipulates that, in the Senate, the  notification of proposed sales shall be sent to the chairman of the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee.   In keeping with the committee's intention to see that relevant  information is available to the full Senate, I ask unanimous consent to  have printed in the Record the notifications which have been received.  If the cover letter references a classified annex, then such annex is  available to all Senators in the office of the Foreign Relations  Committee, room SD-423.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                    Defense Security                                              Cooperation Agency,                                                     Washington, DC.

POLICY JUSTIFICATION          Morocco--High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS)         The Government of Morocco has requested to buy eighteen       (18) M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS)       launchers; forty (40) M57 Army Tactical Missile Systems       (ATACMS); thirty-six (36) M31A2 Guided Multiple Launch Rocket       Systems (GMLRS) Unitary; thirty-six (36) M30A2 Guided       Multiple Launch Rocket Systems (GMLRS) Alternative Warhead;       nine (9) M1152A1 High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles       (HMMWV); and eighteen (18) International Field Artillery       Tactical Data Systems (IFATDS).

The       estimated total cost is $524.2 million.        This proposed sale will support the foreign policy and       national security of the United States by helping to improve       the security of a Major Non-NATO Ally that continues to be an       important force for political stability and economic progress       in North Africa.        The proposed sale will improve Morocco's capability to meet       current and future threats and will contribute to Morocco's       ability to detect threats and control its borders,       contributing to the maintenance of regional stability and       security. It will also enhance the interoperability of the       Royal Armed Forces (FAR), which routinely exercises with U.S.       forces, focusing on countering terrorism and Violent       Extremist Organizations (VEOs) in the Maghreb and Sahel       region. Morocco will have no difficulty absorbing these       articles into its armed forces.        The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not       alter the military balance in the region.        The principal contractors will be Lockheed Martin Missiles       and Fire Control, Camden, AK; L3 Harris Communications, Inc.,       Rochester, NY; Raytheon, Waltham, MA; COBHAM Aerospace       Connectivity, Buckinghamshire, UK; Oshkosh Defense, LLC,       Oshkosh, WI; AAR Corporation AAR Manufacturing, Inc.,       Cadillac, MI; and AM General LLC, South Bend, IN. There are       no known offset agreements proposed in connection with this       potential sale.        Implementation of this proposed sale will require the       assignment of U.S. Government and U.S. contractor       representatives in Country: one (1) Contractor Field Service       Representative (HIMARS) for a period of two years; two (2)       U.S. Government personnel;  [[Page S1130]]       and seven (7) U.S. contractor representatives (13M HIMARS       Crewmember Training) for a period of five (5) months; one (1)       Contractor Field Service Representative (IFATDS) for a period       of one year; one (1) Contractor Field Service Representative       (FMTV) for a period of one year; and one (1) Contractor Field       Service Representative (HMMWV) for a period of one year.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.                            Transmittal No. 21-27       Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to           Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act                             Annex Item No. vii         (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:        The M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS)       launcher is a C-130 transportable wheeled version of the M270       Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) launcher. It integrates       the launch system on a five-ton Family of Medium Tactical       Vehicles (FMTV) chassis. The system is capable of firing all       of the MLRS Family of Munitions. The Universal Fire Control       System (UFCS) provides the command and control interface,       man-machine interface, weapon interface, launcher interface       and embedded training, the UFCS enables the launcher to       inter-operate with compatible national fire direction systems       to navigate to specific fire and reload points, compute the       technical firing solution, and orient the Launcher Module on       the target to deliver the weapon accurately and effectively.       The UFCS also provides position navigation and processing       necessary to direct and maintain control of the launcher       system to allow for accurate firing and loading of weapons.        2. The Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System--Unitary       (GMLRS-U) is a solid propellant artillery rocket fires from       the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS). GMLRS       uses GPS-aided inertial guidance to accurately and quickly       deliver a single high-explosive blast fragmentation warhead       to targets. The GMLRS-U has an operational range of 15-70km.        3. The Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System--Alternative       Warhead (GMLRS-AW) is a Department of Defense alternative       munition for a ``cluster-type'' effect of the GMLRS munition,       which is in compliance with cluster munitions statute and       policy. The AW carries a 200-pound fragmentation assembly       filled with high explosives which, upon detonation,       accelerates two layers of preformed tungsten penetrators       toward a target location. This provides an effective       capability against imprecisely located targets over a wide       area without the risk of leaving behind the unexploded       ordinance associated with legacy cluster munitions. The       GMLRS-AW is a material change to the GMLRS-U, but the two       systems share a greater than 90% commonality.        4. The M57 Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS)--Unitary       is a conventional, semi-ballistic missile which utilizes a       500-pound high explosive warhead which can be fired from the       HIMARS. ATACMS is a guided by GPS-aided inertial navigation       systems to provide precise targeting over ranges of up to       270km.        5. The highest level of classification of defense articles,       components, and services included in this potential sale is       SECRET.        6. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain       knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements, the       information could be used to develop countermeasures that       might reduce weapon system effectiveness or be used in the       development of a system with similar or advanced       capabilities.        7. A determination has been made that Morocco can provide       substantially the same degree of protection for the sensitive       technology being released as the U.S. Government. This sale       is necessary in furtherance of the U.S. foreign policy and       national security objectives outlined in the Policy       Justification.        8. All defense articles and services listed in this       transmittal are authorized for release and export to the       Government of Morocco.                            ____________________     Madam President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export  Control Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of  certain proposed arms sales as defined by that statute.

The proposed sale will improve Morocco's capability to meet       current and future threats. Morocco intends to use the       missiles on its F-16, multi-role fighter aircraft and will       provide enhanced capabilities in effective defense of       critical sea lanes. The proposed sale of these missiles and       support will increase the Royal Moroccan Air Force's maritime       partnership potential and align its capabilities with       existing regional baselines. Morocco will have no difficulty       absorbing these weapons into its armed forces.        The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not       alter the basic military balance in the region.        The principal contractor will be Raytheon Missiles &       Defense Company, Tucson, Arizona. There are no known offset       agreements proposed in connection with this potential sale.
