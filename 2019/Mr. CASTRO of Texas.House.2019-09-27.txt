 Mr. Speaker, in February, I authored a  resolution to reject the President's emergency declaration at the  border. Both Chambers of Congress, a Democratic House and a Republican  Senate, rejected that sham declaration by passing the resolution.  Today, we consider a similar resolution to terminate the President's  emergency declaration.   A border wall does nothing to make us safer or address the real  humanitarian crisis at our border. This time around, the President is  raiding actual national security priorities to build his wall. He is  stealing millions of dollars reserved for important projects that range  from training sites for our servicemembers to the schools for their  children, to our military readiness projects.                                time  0945    It is shameful that our servicemen and -women are collateral damage  in his quest to build this racist wall. It is a disgrace that money is  being stolen from over two dozen States and territories, ensuring that  American taxpayers--not Mexico, as the President repeatedly promised-- are actually paying for the wall.   For example, in my district alone, we are losing out on $18.5 million  in military construction funds. In the State of Texas, that number is  $38.5 million. The total impact for the entire country is over $1  billion.   This should be shameful to all of my colleagues that this  administration would leave our military families out to dry. I ask all  of my colleagues to vote their conscience and to vote their district.   I would also add that the heavy burden of this wall will be felt by  the people in the Rio Grande Valley and in south Texas. Miles and miles  of private property, Texans' land, will be taken to build Donald  Trump's wall.   There have been stories about how people's property will be split;  some of it in front of the wall, some of it behind the wall. Some  people, there will be the wall in front of them, and they will have to  drive and use a clicker to open the wall to come into what would be  considered the United States. Those are American citizens who are  literally going to be behind the wall in Texas because of Donald Trump.   This is a shame. This was a simple campaign promise. This doesn't do  anything to keep us safer. I hope, as we did last time, that this House  of Representatives, Republicans and Democrats, will vote overwhelmingly  to terminate the President's emergency declaration.
