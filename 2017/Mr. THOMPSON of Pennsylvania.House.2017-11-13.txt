 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  Hank Yeagley on 20 years of service to the Central Pennsylvania  Institute of Science and Technology.   Hank began his service as chairperson of CPI's Joint Operating  Committee in December of 1997. Serving 20 consecutive years at the  helm, he will retire next month. Friends and colleagues will gather  this week to celebrate Hank's years of dedication.   Under Hank's leadership, enrollment in CPI's secondary career and  technical education programs have grown significantly. CPI became an  approved and accredited Associate in Specialized  [[Page H9159]]  Technology degree-granting institution.   CPI is recognized throughout Pennsylvania as a premier provider of  postsecondary career and technical education programs. Scores of  students in the Commonwealth have earned a career in technical  education thanks to Hank's vision to grow CPI into the institution it  is today.    Mr. Speaker, there has been no greater champion for CPI than Hank  Yeagley for the past two decades, earning him the title of Mr. CPI  among faculty, staff, administrators, as well as past and present  students alike. I wholeheartedly congratulate Hank Yeagley on a well  deserved retirement and wish him the best.                            ____________________
