 Madam President, I learned a long time ago, I never want  to give a speech after that, but certainly I agree with what Senator  Warnock said, and the Senate schedule kind of made me do this.   I want to thank Senator Warnock, who is one of the principals in our  legislation, Senator Bennet, Senator Booker, and Senator Kaine for  their leadership and their work to deliver what is, pure and simple,  the largest tax cut for working families ever.   Tomorrow, for the sixth month in a row--July 15, August 15,  September, October, November. Tomorrow is the sixth month in a row that  Ohio parents, 92 percent of parents in Ohio with children under 18,  will again see $250 or $300 in their bank accounts or in their mailbox  per child. If they have two infant children, they will get $600.   This is the most consequential thing we have done in decades to make  people's hard work pay off. We know how hard parents work at their  jobs, at raising kids. Any parent knows how much work it is to take  care of children, especially young children. It has only gotten harder  over the last couple of years. Often, that hard work doesn't pay off  like it should. We have seen what has happened over the past decades.  Productivity has gone up; the stock market has soared; executive  compensation is stratospheric; but wages have been flat.   Workers' paychecks are finally--finally, during this administration  and this Senate, this Congress--finally, because of the work we are  doing, workers' paychecks are starting to go up. But after decades of  stagnation, we have a long way to go.   Meanwhile, parents know how expensive it is to raise kids.  Healthcare, school lunches, diapers, clothes, school supplies, braces,  sports fees, camp fees--the list never seems to end.   Of course, one of the biggest, if not the biggest expense for so many  families is childcare. Parents feel like they are trapped. They can't  keep up no matter how hard they work. They work more hours to provide  for their family. They have to put their money right back into  childcare. Sometimes the extra money in their paycheck doesn't even  cover the extra daycare costs.  [[Page S9139]]    That is why Senators Booker and Kaine and Bennet and Warnock worked  so hard to enact the child tax credit. As I said, the largest--it is a  $3,000 tax cut so 92 percent of the families in my State with children  get at least a $3,000 tax cut. It is the same in Virginia, same in New  Jersey, the same in Georgia. It is about finally--finally--making  parents' hard work pay off so they can keep up with the costs of  raising a family.   I was talking to Senator Kaine, and I know he is going to say some of  the same things. Let me share a handful of some really quick stories or  comments that people have gone on our website and posted at the 15th of  the month.   Kristen from Columbus says she is using this money to pay for  ``daycare. For two kids it is $600 a week.''   Alex in Cleveland:         Every penny is going to daycare. 4 kids in daycare is       around $800/week.    CeCe said her tax cut helps her pay for daycare. She said:         Daycare is the same amount as my mortgage payment for 4       days a week! So this is so, so helpful!    Courtney from Southeast Ohio in Athens:         [S]lightly more than half the cost of part time daycare       tuition per month here in Athens--much appreciated help       getting kiddo back into childcare . . . keeping me and my       husband in the workforce.    Brittany said:         Daycare.    Ellie said:         Daycare.    They also mean parents can afford to work and can afford to keep up  with all the extra costs of raising kids.   Katie in Akron:         Help[s] [to] pay for school supplies.    Caitlin:         Pay for preschool for my son.    Lyndsay:         Back to school clothes.    Fern:         It will pay for preschool for both of them and the rest is       going in a savings account for them.    Jennifer:         Put away for college tuition.    Melissa:         I used part of it to buy school uniform pieces for my 4-      year-old.    Maia:         Food and school supplies.    These parents are all working hard to provide for their families and  raise their kids. They are working a whole lot harder than the CEOs and  the hedge fund managers who it looks like, under Build Back Better, may  continue to get some of their tax cuts--their tax preference, if you  will. It is a lot harder for these workers than the CEOs and the hedge  fund managers and the Swiss bank account holders who are always getting  tax cuts from politicians in this building.   We all remember what happened. We can look down the hall. We have  done that before and seen the lobbyists line up in front of Leader  McConnell's office and line up in front of the politicians who always  do their bidding with their tax cuts for the wealthy and for  corporations that outsource jobs. You know what they told us 4 years  ago, when those tax cuts for the rich passed. They said: It is going to  trickle down and help everybody else. We will hire more people, raise  wages.   Of course, corporations didn't spend the money to raise wages. Of  course, they didn't spend the money to lower prices. And then they  blame everybody else for inflation. Of course, they spent it--no  surprise here--with stock buybacks, and they are still at it today.   This year, without a single vote, not a single vote from Republicans  in Congress--twice, every Democrat voting for it, a 51-to-50 vote-- twice we passed the child tax credit. It is a simple contrast: Whose  side are you on? Do you want tax cuts for billionaires and corporations  or tax cuts for working families?   We want tax cuts for working families, Americans from all over the  country, from all kinds of backgrounds. Let's deliver that for them.  Let's keep the largest tax cut for working families ever so that  parents can have that peace of mind, can relieve some of their anxiety  they face every month to pay the rent and pay the bills. They can have  the peace of mind that the child tax credit will keep delivering money  in their pockets through the holidays this year, into next year, into  next year's holiday.   I yield the floor to Senator Booker.
