 Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate and pay  tribute to an outstanding citizen of the United States, and I am  pleased to add that she is a member of my family, the Glass family.  [[Page H2559]]    Before my mother married my father, her maiden name was Glass. The  lady that we celebrate today and acknowledge as she celebrates her  100th birthday is Mrs. Vernetta Jordan Glass.                                time  1130    I am pleased to wish her a happy birthday and to wish all of my Glass  relatives well as we celebrate a family reunion in Detroit, Michigan.   Vernetta Jordan Glass was born on May 27, 1923, in the historic town  of Mound Bayou, Mississippi.   Mound Bayou traces its origin to the 1820s to a White planter, Joseph  Davis, the older brother of Jefferson Davis, who was President of the  Confederate States, which left the Union and formed the Confederacy,  which led to the Civil War.   After the war, Joseph Davis sold his land to a former slave, Benjamin  Montgomery, and it was Isaiah T. Montgomery who led the founding of  Mound Bayou in 1887.   Vernetta was born on May 27, 1923, in Mound Bayou, Mississippi, and  grew up in this all-Black town. She went to school and church,  participated in community activities, and was taught values by her  parents that have guided her life to this day.   She married Winston L. Glass, and she and her late husband migrated  from Mississippi to Detroit, Michigan, in 1947, where they created for  themselves very productive lives and raised seven highly educated and  accomplished children.   After retiring from her nursing career, Vernetta increased her  volunteer activities at her church, the community center, the Charles  H. Wright Museum of African American History, the Detroit Symphony  Orchestra Hall, senior citizens centers, and other community places of  interest.   Understanding the value of electoral politics and the civil rights  movement, for many years, Vernetta worked as a judge of elections.   She is grandmother to more than 50 grandchildren and great- grandchildren and enjoys visits from friends and family. She also loves  music and gardening and is a superb Scrabble player.   As she reaches the ripe age of 100, I am pleased to wish this dynamic  lady, who has accomplished so much, a happy birthday. By the way, I am  extraordinarily pleased that she is my cousin.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I oppose this legislation that  will harm 43 million student loan borrowers who need debt relief so  that the Republicans can spend trillions of dollars in just a few weeks  on tax cuts for the wealthiest 1 percent.   Over 100,000 borrowers in my congressional district alone and over  1.5 million Illinoisans will lose and be affected if the relief is  denied. The maliciousness of this legislation is appalling. The bill  would ban relief for 43 million borrowers and also drawback relief that  millions of borrowers already receive.   This heartless bill would force public servants like firefighters,  teachers, social service providers, legal aid attorneys, and nonprofit  workers to make additional payments. The callousness of this bill is  heightened because the Republicans are bragging that they will spend  trillions of dollars in just a few weeks to give trillions in tax  breaks to the wealthy 1 percent while inflicting economic harm on  Americans struggling with student loan debt. I reject this bill.    Mr. Speaker, solar energy is one form of  electricity generation that is growing in the United States, yet we do  not have the economy of scale in manufacturing solar systems to meet  supply and demand for industry and consumers.   Solar energy accounted for 3.9 percent of total electricity  generation in 2021 compared to 0.7 percent in 2014.   Currently, domestic solar production is sold out for the next 2 to 3  years. In order to continue to address China's unfair trading practices  and allow America's solar industry to grow, President Biden's  proclamation 10414 declared an emergency with respect to U.S.  electricity generation capacity by implementing a final rule that  permits the importation of select cells or modules without the payment  of antidumping and countervailing duty temporary for 24 months.   I urge my colleagues to stand with our President, who has shown such  great wisdom and leadership. Vote ``no'' on H.J. Res. 39.
