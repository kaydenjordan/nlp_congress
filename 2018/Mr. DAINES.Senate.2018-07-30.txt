 Mr. President, the Vietnam War spanned twenty years with  nearly 60,000 American soldiers' lives lost. Many others served in this  war and either came back wounded or were changed forever. Simply put,  this war shaped an entire generation. It is imperative that we honor  and commemorate this generation of American service members who  sacrificed their livelihood, and in some cases their lives, for the  sake of their Nation.   I firmly believe that history is our greatest teacher. In an attempt  to venerate and educate the American public of the sacrifices American  soldiers made in Vietnam, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund was  founded. Dedicated in 1982, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial spans over  493 feet with the names of fallen servicemen and women inscribed into  the black granite. Each year millions come to pay their respects at The  Wall.   To further commemorate the sacrifices made by American soldiers, the  Education Center at The Wall will be added as an addition to the  Memorial. It will aid in the continual education of the sacrifices made  in the Vietnam War, so that all who visit may learn from this period of  history and pass it on to the generations to come.   The Education Center at The Wall will be an underground center,  located near The Wall. The proposed center will show the faces of each  soldier whose name is on the wall, showcase some of the artifacts left  behind at The Wall, and highlight the inspiration of the monument  designer Maya Lin.   In 2003, Congress authorized the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund  (VVMF) to raise funds to construct a visitor and education center. The  funds needed to complete this project must be completely raised by  private donations. The project is estimated to cost approximately $130  million and after fifteen years of fundraising, the VVMF still needs a  few extra years to raise the needed capital.   I am proud to introduce the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Visitor Center  Extension Act along with my colleague, Senator Duckworth. This bill  will extend the authorization for an additional four years until 2022,  to allow VVMF the time they need to complete this important project to  honor those who served and died in Vietnam.   It is imperative that we continually educate the American public and  all who visit about those who served and sacrificed for their country  during the Vietnam War. The Education Center at The Wall will allow for  this unique educational opportunity. I ask my colleagues to join  Senator Duckworth and me in supporting this bipartisan effort.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 3298         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Vietnam Veterans Memorial       Visitor Center Extension Act''.       SEC. 2. EXTENSION OF AUTHORITY TO ESTABLISH VIETNAM VETERANS                     MEMORIAL VISITOR CENTER.         Section 6(b)(5) of Public Law 96-297 (54 U.S.C. 320301       note; 94 Stat. 827; 117 Stat. 1348; 124 Stat. 2851; 127 Stat.       490) is amended by striking ``2018'' and inserting ``2022''.                            ____________________     Mr. President, the Vietnam War spanned twenty years with  nearly 60,000 American soldiers' lives lost.
