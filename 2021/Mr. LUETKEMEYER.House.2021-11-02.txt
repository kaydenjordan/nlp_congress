 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3469, the Veteran  Entrepreneurship Training Act of 2021.   Mr. Speaker, this week is National Veterans Small Business Week. This  is a time to honor and recognize the men and women who have served our  Nation proudly in uniform. Many of these brave veterans go on to start  and run successful businesses. This week and every week, we must  recognize their resiliency and determination.   I would like to thank all our veterans who have dedicated their lives  to keeping the United States safe and preserving our freedoms.   Importantly, today we are considering the Veteran Entrepreneurship  Training Act of 2021, which codifies the Small Business  Administration's successful Boots to Business Program. The Boots to  Business Program offers veterans, servicemembers, and military  [[Page H6086]]  spouses entrepreneurship resources that provide the business skills and  knowledge to launch and run a successful business. The program uniquely  delivers results for those who have honed their skills in the military.   I am proud that we are focusing on veteran-owned businesses, and I  believe this legislation will continue to provide important and  valuable resources as our veterans return home and transition into  providing goods and services to their communities.   I would like to thank Mr. Schneider from Illinois and Mr. Williams  from Texas, who is the vice ranking member of our committee, for  working diligently on this legislation. I would also like to thank the  chair for her efforts on this legislation and for working with me in a  bipartisan manner to advance all the commonsense small business bills  before us today. I look forward to working with the chairwoman on  several issues moving forward.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support H.R. 3469, which  was passed favorably out of our committee via voice vote, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Williams), who is the vice ranking member  of the committee.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I yield  myself the balance of my time to close.   The Boots to Business Program is critical in assisting our veterans  during their entrepreneurial business journey. I, once again, want to  thank all of our friends and colleagues along the way here for their  help putting this bill together, as well as our brave men and women who  have served in the military on our behalf of our great country. We are  better off with their unwavering commitment to American safety and  security.   Mr. Speaker, as we celebrate and honor National Veterans Small  Business Week, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3469, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4256, the Investing in Main  Street Act, as amended.   Just last week, the Subcommittee on Economic Growth, Tax and Capital  Access held a hearing on the Small Business Investment Company program,  also known as the SBIC program. This program, which increases the  amount of private equity into small businesses, has successfully  assisted thousands of small businesses.   The SBIC program is currently running on zero cost to the American  taxpayer due to the fees built into the program.   To enhance the program, H.R. 4256 increases the amount of capital and  surplus that can be invested into an SBIC from a financial institution  from 5 percent to 15 percent, which is currently the percentage  requirement of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.   This important change will not only bring parity between the SBA and  Federal financial rules, but it can also jump-start the program for our  Nation's smallest firms.   I would like to thank the chair for advancing this bill, and Ms. Chu  from California and Mr. Garbarino from New York for working in a  bipartisan manner to ensure this bill reached the House floor.   I encourage all of my colleagues to support H.R. 4256, which was  unanimously reported out of our committee and has been passed on the  House floor in recent congressional sessions, as well.  [[Page H6088]]    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from New York (Mr. Garbarino).    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, as well, so  I will close. The SBIC program has delivered for small businesses for  many years. It is time we update the program to match other Federal  Rules and ensure the program continues to serve our communities in the  future. This is a commonsense step to increase the amount of investment  that an SBIC can receive.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4256, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3462, the SBA Cyber Awareness  Act.   Mr. Speaker, the importance of being cyber ready cannot be  overstated. This goes for individuals, businesses, and even our Federal  Government.   H.R. 3462 takes important strides to ensure the agency that was  created to assist and aid the Nation's smallest firms, the Small  Business Administration, has the ability to access its own  cybersecurity framework.   Additionally, H.R. 3462 requires the SBA to report to Congress on its  cyber infrastructure.   Unfortunately, cyberattacks are too common in today's world.  Vulnerabilities will be used and taken advantage of by criminals.   We must take steps now to enhance and protect our Federal Government.  H.R. 3462 does just that.   I want to thank the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Crow) and the  gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Kim) for having the foresight to work  on such an important measure. I also thank the chair for pushing  forward this legislation. H.R. 3462 was favorably reported out of the  Committee on Small Business in July.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to pass the bill today on the House  floor, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to  the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Kim).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume for the purpose of closing.   Mr. Speaker, I believe now is the time to act to prepare our  financial institutions for cyber intrusions. Requiring the SBA to  assess its own cyber infrastructure is an important step to ensure the  agency can continue to serve as a leader for our Nation's 31 million  small businesses.   Congress should make certain that the Federal Government is cyber  prepared on behalf of the Nation's small businesses, entrepreneurs, and  start-ups.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support H.R. 3462, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.  [[Page H6091]]    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4481, the Small Business 7(a)  Loan Agent Transparency Act.   I want to congratulate you, Mr. Speaker. Not many people can  pronounce my last name, Luetkemeyer, but you did a great job today.  Thank you very much.   While small businesses across the Nation are bearing the burden of  rising costs, supply chain issues, and labor shortages, they also  continue to be challenged when accessing capital to build and grow  their businesses.   This committee remains committed to examining issues surrounding  access to capital.   The SBA's largest government guaranteed loan tool is the 7(a) loan  program, which serves small businesses of all types throughout the  Nation.   Over the years, the role of loan agents within this program has ebbed  and flowed. However, along the way, the SBA has not had a firm grasp on  how these middlemen operate in the program.   H.R. 4481 corrects this program by requiring more transparency within  the program about loan agents who often connect small businesses to  lenders and vice versa.   I commend the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Phillips) and the  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Meuser) for working in tandem to bring  this issue to the forefront, as well as Ms. Tenney. I also would like  to thank the Chair for working on this issue as well.   H.R. 4481 will reinforce the integrity of the program and ensure that  it continues to be a useful tool for small businesses moving forward.   H.R. 4481 passed out of committee via voice vote. I urge all Members  to support this legislation, Mr. Speaker, and I reserve the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Meuser).    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to  the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Tenney).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time  to close.   Mr. Speaker, we have an oversight duty to ensure programs are  operating effectively and efficiently. Congress must also ensure  taxpayer dollars are protected and safeguarded against waste, fraud and  abuse.   Loan agents within the 7(a) program require more transparency, and  this bill delivers on this important topic.   I can assure you that as a result of IG reports, this is a necessary  part of our process, and we must continue to provide the kind of  oversight that is necessary. Loan agents can be very helpful, but there  are always a few bad apples. We need this transparency to be able to  protect the integrity of this program and taxpayer dollars.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4481, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume and rise in support of H.R. 4531, the 7(a) Loan Agent Oversight  Act.   On October 15, 2021, the SBA's inspector general published a report  titled ``Top Management and Performance Challenges Facing the Small  Business Administration in Fiscal Year 2022.''   In this report, the inspector general listed increased risks  introduced by loan agents as one of the top issues the agency faces.  Specifically, the report outlines approximately $335 million in  documented and confirmed loan agent fraud within the program. This is  unacceptable, Mr. Speaker, and Members of Congress must have more  visibility into this program.   H.R. 4531, the 7(a) Loan Agent Oversight Act, requires the SBA to  perform a portfolio risk analysis on loans associated with agents. When  this risk analysis is completed, Members will have more visibility into  how loan agents interact with a government guaranteed loan program.  American tax dollars must be protected, and H.R. 4531 makes important  improvements to be able to do just that.   I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Meuser) and the  gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Phillips) for tackling this legislation  head on.   With my support and the Chair's support, H.R. 4531 was favorably  reported out of our committee, and I encourage all Members to support  this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Meuser).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time  to close.   Continued and ongoing fraud within any government program is  unacceptable and must be addressed immediately. H.R. 4531 is a step in  the right direction and will provide crucial information for Members of  Congress as well as committee members as they continue to exercise  necessary oversight of programs directed at small businesses and  entrepreneurs.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4531, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume, and I rise in support of H.R. 4515, the Small Business  Development Center Cyber Training Act of 2021.   Small Business Development Centers, or SBDCs, perform numerous  important roles for small businesses and aspiring entrepreneurs. They  are also  [[Page H6094]]  on the front lines, assisting small business owners with business plans  and questions regarding access to capital.   Unfortunately, cyberattacks are on the rise, and small businesses  remain vulnerable. H.R. 4515 requires SBDCs to be better equipped and  trained to assist small businesses with their cybersecurity needs.   More attention needs to be given to small businesses and how they  deal with cyber intrusions. Empowering SBDCs is one way to do this.   I thank the gentleman from New York (Mr. Garbarino), the gentleman  from Pennsylvania (Mr. Evans), the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Chabot),  and the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. Houlahan) for their work on  this bill. I also thank the chair for continuing to act on legislation  dealing with cybersecurity, one of the most critical issues facing us  today.   Overall, these are crucial and important issues facing small  businesses, and I am grateful for the gentlewoman's partnership on this  bill.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support H.R. 4515, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from New York (Mr. Garbarino).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, we must take a serious look at how businesses are  impacted by cyberattacks. Small businesses operate on thin margins.  Thus, a cyber intrusion could be a lethal blow to them.   SBDCs must be ready to assist all small businesses where cyber  questions arise. This is a smart and commonsense bill that should move  forward.   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4515 and all the small business  bills that have been before us today. Each bill tackles important  issues facing American job creators.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include any extraneous material on the subject of this Special Order.    Madam Speaker, I come to the floor this evening with  a number of my Republican colleagues to speak about the small business  economy.   Small business owners have been devastated by the COVID-19 pandemic  as they are still reeling from the Democrat-induced State and local  shutdowns and economic downturn. At a time when Main Street USA has  been focused on recovering from the health and economic effects of the  pandemic, they are facing multiple challenges created by the Biden  administration and congressional Democrats.   Given our country's unprecedented labor shortage, skyrocketing  inflation, and supply chain crisis, small businesses, entrepreneurs,  and startups alike are forced to bear the brunt of the Democrats'  failed economic policies. In the midst of this economic storm, small  businesses should be given the tools to recover, but now they are also  being threatened with major tax increases and more burdensome  regulations.   Since President Biden took office, we have seen multiple Democratic  proposals that include increasing taxes on small businesses. Make no  mistake: Tax hikes, no matter their form and fashion, will negatively  impact Main Street USA.  [[Page H6105]]    A survey by the Small Business and Entrepreneurship Council found a  majority of small business owners believe new taxes will significantly  hurt their ability to recover from the pandemic. Simply put, this is  unacceptable.   While the Democrats' socialist scam reconciliation bill continues to  change week after week, many of these proposals would slash the 20  percent small business deduction enacted by President Trump's Tax Cuts  and Jobs Act of 2017. According to IRS data, millions of small business  owners claimed the 20 percent deduction on qualified business income  during the 2020 tax filing season. This provision created more than $66  billion in savings for small business owners in 2019. The Democrats  want to do away with this.   Other reckless proposals will have nearly doubled the long-term  capital gains rate from 23.8 percent to the top ordinary capital gains  rate of 39.6 percent. According to U.S. Census Bureau data, two-thirds  of small business owners plan to sell their business, and eliminating  the current long-term rate would have enormous implications for any  sale of a small business.   Knowing this information, I must ask: Why would the Democrats propose  such drastic tax rate increases knowing they will crush American  businesses?   As the days evolve, we will see what the Democrats will concoct next  to pay for their outrageous spending, but Republicans refuse to stand  by and allow them to pay for it at the expense of small business  prosperity. We will continue to monitor very closely.   At a time when small businesses are trying to get back on their feet,  they are also absorbing the impact of other damage. As ``Help Wanted''  signs become a common sight on the doors of small businesses across the  country and store shelves become increasingly bare, it remains clear  that the Biden administration's labor crisis is a key contributing  factor to the rising costs of goods and empty shelves.   For months, the Biden administration has paid Americans to stay home  through extended Federal benefits instead of incentivizing these  individuals to return to work. Our country's labor shortages have  hindered the ability to get cargo to shore, unpack these much-needed  goods, and find truck drivers to transport the products throughout the  Nation. U.S. employers across all industries are struggling to fill  more than 10.4 million job openings to meet the rising consumer demand.   Madam Speaker, in October, NFIB reported that 51 percent of small  business owners have unfilled job openings, a 48-year high for the  third consecutive month. Sadly, the historical average is only 22  percent.   As small business owners are bearing the burden of these extreme  challenges due to the Democrats' failed economic policies, they are  also facing regulatory uncertainty. During the previous administration,  we cut burdensome red tape for small firms. However, we are already  seeing an increasing regulatory trend with the Biden administration,  which will hinder small businesses while they are already down.   We know that regulatory burdens deflate small businesses, yet this  administration continues to plow forward with new restrictions and  mandates. From the latest climate rules to the overreaching vaccine  mandate, small business owners should be given the opportunity to  recover from the pandemic and service their customers, not deal with  even more bureaucratic red tape from the Democrats.   Beyond these economic headwinds, American taxpayer dollars have been  wasted and abused by Federal Government agencies throughout the  pandemic. According to the Small Business Administration's inspector  general, $78 billion in Economic Injury Disaster Loans have been  fraudulent.   This program is a direct loan and grant program, as small businesses  apply directly with the SBA for funding. Instead of developing serious  oversight controls, congressional Democrats want to expand the Federal  Government's ability to make additional direct loans through the SBA.  This is dangerous and puts taxpayer dollars at extreme risk. These  proposals are irresponsibly opening the door for enhanced fraud.   My Republican colleagues and I will continue to fight for lower taxes  and deregulation on behalf of small businesses across the Nation while  also safeguarding taxpayer dollars every step of the way. We must  legislate responsibly, and we will. Americans must get back to work,  and that can only happen when Democrats cease their war on Main Street.    Congressional Republicans refuse to stand by and allow the Democrats  to force through this socialist scam reconciliation bill at the expense  of small business prosperity.   I appreciate that a number of my Republican colleagues are here today  to add to this conversation.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Williams),  who is the vice ranking member of the Small Business Committee.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas for  his insights. Being a businessman himself, he understands full well the  problems that they have, the concerns about the bill being proposed,  and the impact of all the decisions that this administration has made  so far.   The key to economic success is economic freedom. That is a keyword,  and you are going to hear a theme of that this evening, Madam Speaker.                                time  1800    Next, I would like to introduce the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr.  Barr),  [[Page H6106]]  the ranking member of the Financial Services Subcommittee on National  Security, International Development and Monetary Policy. I look forward  to his commentary and his insights. He is instrumental in a lot of the  different things we do there, as well the former chairman of the  Oversight Committee, if I am not mistaken.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Barr).    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Kentucky.  As you can see and hear from him, his very insightful explanation of  the bill and its provisions, its effects on small businesses and  consumers, he gave a very, very thoughtful explanation of it, and we  appreciate his insights and concerns.   There are lots of problems with the bill, and I appreciate Mr. Barr's  comments.   Next, we have the gentleman from Louisiana, (Mr. Johnson). Mike is  going to be with us here. He is vice-chairman of the Republican  Conference. He is going to continue to explain some of the problems and  pitfalls with this tax proposal that is an unwieldy and, frankly,  harmful bill to our people, our consumers, and especially the small  businesses in this country.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Johnson).    Madam Speaker, I would like to have a minor  discussion with the gentleman here.   You made a couple of points here with regards to some of the  discussions you had with regards to amnesty. Did one of the questions  that you posed deal with the $450,000 payment that the President is  proposing to all of the folks who come here illegally? Was that voted  on or talked about at all in your discussion?    I yield to the gentleman from Louisiana.    So we could be giving a $450,000 payment to a MS-13  gang member; is what you are saying?    It doesn't seem to bother them that they are going  to spend their own constituents' hard-earned tax dollars and give to a  MS-13 gang member up to $450,000. Holy smokes. It blows you away.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his  insightful discussion and presentation. I am glad he pointed out that  the socialist agenda of this administration is being rejected by the  people of this country. Probably very, very likely, today, we are  seeing the first reaction to that at the polling places. I also  appreciate his talking about the increase in taxes, the negative effect  to small businesses, and the regulations as well.   It is concerning that the comment he made is quite true, because at  this point, we have seen no text and it changes on a daily basis. Yet,  we are going to be asked to vote for that thing, perhaps before we even  get to see what is in it. Seems like I have heard that somewhere  before.   Anyway, let's move on. We are excited to have the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Meuser) next to give us his thoughts on the  monstrosity of a bill here and the tax and spending actions of the  administration. Mr. Meuser is the ranking member of the Small Business  Subcommittee on Economic Growth, Tax and Capital Access. I thank him  for being here this evening.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.  Meuser).    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Pennsylvania for his insightful remarks, and I appreciate him  quantifying that this is a $420 billion hit to small businesses.   His comment about working harder and making less, we understand the  pandemic caused a lot of dislocation, but we should be past that now.  We should be helping businesses get back on their feet, not kicking  their feet out from underneath them and adding to the uncertainty with  additional rules and regulations.   I am excited now to have one of the newest members of our conference,  Congresswoman Young Kim from California, who is the ranking member of  the Small Business Subcommittee on Innovation, Entrepreneurship, and  Workforce Development. She herself has been a small businesswoman in  the past, and I look forward to her insightful remarks.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Kim).    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from  California for her remarks, and we certainly appreciate her comments.  She made a comment with regards to entrepreneurs. The small business  folks are the entrepreneurs that make our country work. They are  willing to take the risk and invest their own dollars, work long hours,  and wind up being paid last, if at all sometimes.   I am glad she pointed out the lesson that we should be learning from  California. A lot of times we look to California to see what the latest  trends are. Right now, the latest trend is whoever is the last one out,  turn the lights off. So I think we need to be looking at that and  listening to those citizens, those businesspeople, who are leaving the  State due to the high cost of taxes and regulations, just to be able to  work there.   I am excited now to have another new member to our conference, who  also is a member of the Small Business Committee, former State senator  from the State of Wisconsin, Congressman Scott Fitzgerald.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr.  Fitzgerald).    I thank the gentleman for his comments and  insightful remarks. I really appreciate him pointing out something,  that this is the biggest tax increase in 50 years on small businesses.  Let me say that again, the biggest tax increase in 50 years on small  businesses.   In our committee recently we had the Small Business Administration  Director, and one of the members from our committee asked the Director  if she had been advising the administration on the tax policy in this  bill and had done any studies as to the effect of those taxes on small  businesses? We couldn't get a response.   She said, well, it really wasn't something she would be concerned  about. Here is the Director of the Small Business Administration, whose  prime duty is to work this agency for the benefit of small businesses  in this country, and she was not going to think that this bill was  important enough with the taxes and other extraneous things in there to  even think about working on it and advising the administration about  what could happen to small businesses?   There is a huge disconnect within this administration about what is  going on in the real world and the utopian view of how they would like  to have things be in the future under a socialist regime. This is nuts.   How in the world can you put a bill together like this that has this  kind of effect on small business and not even study the effect of it?  Absolutely breathtaking.   I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Van Drew), a small  business person himself. He has experienced some of these hardships and  problems, and he is going to tell us all about what his views are on  this bill and how it can impact his business.    I certainly thank the gentleman from New Jersey for  his remarks and reminding us that inflation is a tax as well. I think  we need to remember that when we go to the gas pump. Last January I was  able to get it for $1.89. On Monday I filled up my tank and it was  $3.19. I got nothing more. I got the same amount of gas. The only  difference is it was $1 and some higher. Inflation is a tax.   I appreciate him reminding us of the work ethic and values that our  small business folks display and have to work  [[Page H6110]]  with every day to make their business work and the effects of mandates.  I appreciate his comments.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.  Keller), who has a great personal story himself. I look forward to his  remarks and his concerns about this monstrosity of a bill, socialist  reconciliation bill.    I thank the gentleman for his insightful remarks. I  really appreciate his comments. Pouring more money into the economy  just adds to inflation. If we go back and look at the comments by the  CBO when they scored the bill back in February, a $1.9 trillion bill,  they said we didn't need it, that we would have 5 percent growth by the  end of this year if we did nothing. And yet we spent $1.9 trillion and  look at what has happened. We have runaway inflation going on right  now, and we want more money to be spent again. This is nuts.   Government control. I appreciate his comments with regard to that.  This is about government control. It is about controlling the economy  and controlling individuals and controlling businesses. Again, it is  about the belief that the other side seems to believe in the goodness  and greatness of government, and we believe in the goodness and  greatness of our people. I certainly appreciate his comments with  regard to that and reminding us of those salient facts.   Madam Speaker, how much time is remaining?    Thank you very much. I shouldn't be too long. We  have rolled this around quite a bit, and we have hit on the high  points, but I do want to make a few closing remarks.   The American people deserve better than this. We are here to be able  to help them, not to harm them. We are here to be able to lift them up  and empower them instead of take power away. We are here to give them  hope, not destroy hope. You do all these things on the positive side, I  think, by empowering them and letting them be who they are rather than  take that away from them and try from the government side to control  what they are doing and who they want to be.   I have the opportunity with one of the positions that I hold here in  Congress to meet with a lot of foreign finance ministers from around  the world, and it is always interesting to talk to them because they  are very jealous of what we have. We have something most countries in  the world don't have, and that is economic freedom. The freedom to be  able to go somewhere tomorrow; if you want to change jobs, go change  jobs. If you want to start a new business tomorrow, go start a new  business. If you want to start another one next week, start another new  business next week. Most places in the world you can't do that, and  that is a huge difference. That economic freedom, that entrepreneurial  spirit that we have in this country makes us different from everybody  else.   This monstrosity of a socialist reconciliation bill is a dagger in  the heart to the entrepreneurs and the small business people in this  country who have built this country. The big businesses, where did they  start from? They started as a small business. They didn't start as a  big, major business to begin with. They started in somebody's garage or  in a university research lab somewhere or as an idea that somebody  scratches on the back of a napkin in a restaurant somewhere. These  people, the entrepreneurs who are willing to put their ideas on the  table, their money, and their beliefs and risk everything to make this  work.   This bill that we are talking about this evening is a dagger in the  heart to those people who are willing to take those kinds of risks and  drive our country forward and provide the jobs.   As a reminder, when we unleashed the power of the people with the tax  cut bill of 2017, we wound up before the pandemic of having 1.2 million  more jobs in this country than we had people to fill them. The first  time in history that we had those sorts of job openings for people to  apply for.   The fundamentals are still there if we don't destroy them, and that  is the key. This bill will destroy those fundamentals. Add to that the  uncertainty that a lot of our good friends and small businesses that  drive this country are concerned about, the taxes will be the burden  that will have to be overcome, and probably will drive a lot of them  out of business.   They are very concerned about the direction of this administration.  They seem to believe, again, in the goodness and greatness of  government. Our side believes in the goodness and greatness of our  people, and we want to empower them and continue to protect them and  work with them.   Madam Speaker, thank you for the opportunity to be here this evening  and for allowing us to have this Special Order. I yield back the  balance of my time.                            ____________________
