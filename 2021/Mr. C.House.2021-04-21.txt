 SCOTT FRANKLIN of Florida asked and was given permission to  address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)    SCOTT FRANKLIN of Florida. Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition  to the $2\1/4\ trillion boondoggle my colleagues across the aisle are  trying to pass off as an infrastructure bill.   Sadly, this bill is a socialist wish list. Less than 8 percent of  President Biden's infrastructure plan goes to roads, bridges,  waterways, ports, and airports.   What it does include is $400 billion for home-based caregivers. While  that may be a good issue for review, it is not infrastructure.   This comes as no surprise, considering D.C. Democrats are trying to  lump a radical, progressive agenda into a so-called infrastructure  bill. Still, the leftist fringe that has highjacked what used to be the  Democratic Party doesn't think it goes far enough.   Madam Speaker, we spent trillions of dollars on COVID recovery and  unrelated measures. Now is not the time for a socialist wish list.  Americans need a strong economy and real infrastructure, and they need  it now.                            ____________________     Scott Franklin of               Florida, Mr. Fitzgerald, Mrs. Fischbach, Mr. Palmer,               Mr. Stauber, Ms. Malliotakis, Mr. Feenstra, Mr.               Latta, Mr. Roy, Mr. Palazzo, Mr. Burgess, Mr.               Huizenga, Mr. Hagedorn, Mr. Meuser, Mr. Baird, Ms.               Cheney, Mr. Duncan, and Ms. Foxx):        H.R. 2718.
