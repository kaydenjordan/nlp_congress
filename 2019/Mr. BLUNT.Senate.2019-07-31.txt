 Mr. President, over the past several weeks, we have seen  numerous attempts by our colleagues on the other side of the aisle to  take a serious issue and, frankly, I think, turn it into a political  football. It is an issue on which the Presiding Officer and I have  spent a lot of time looking at what we need to do, in our having served  on the Committee on Intelligence and, in my case, on the Committee on  Rules and Administration, to be sure that people have the maximum  confidence that what happens on election day is exactly reflected in  the results.   Our friends came to the floor last week and sought unanimous consent  to make sweeping changes to the election laws of the country. Then they  somehow suggested there was a conspiracy that anybody would say no to  that. Unanimous consent means exactly that. It is what we do when we  name a post office. It is what we do when we make decisions that are  unanimously agreed to. It is usually all it takes to get that issue  settled. It is not how we shape the laws that are at the heart of our  democracy. It is also not what we do, in my opinion, when we try to  make a point about that. In fact, one of the bills on which they sought  unanimous consent had passed the House. It had received exactly one  Republican vote in the House. So, clearly, it was not unanimously  consented to over there and would not be unanimously consented to here.   This is about press releases, not policy. In fact, today, the  President called for us to pass voter ID laws that would require voter  ID in every State and a law that would have a paper trail in every  State. Right now, I suppose, if I were to draft that bill and call for  unanimous consent under the same standard, I should expect my friends  on the other side to say: Oh, that is something that others say would  help elections, so I should just be for that and be for that  immediately. Of course, that would not be the case.   These attempts have all been brought to the floor on the basis of  saving democracy--that this is what we need to do to save our  elections. This is in the name of election security, but it is really  not what it is about at all. Three of the bills were about campaign  committees, which are managed by lots of laws and may need to be  managed by more, but how you run a campaign committee is not how you  secure what happens at the voting place on election day.   One of the proposals was for the Federal Government to secure the  personal devices of Members of Congress and their employees. As the  Presiding Officer and I know, one of the things we do on the Committee  on Intelligence is to put a Fitbit, like this one, on the shelf before  we go into a meeting. If you have a phone like this one, you put it on  a shelf before you go into a meeting.   This law would say that the Federal Government should secure those  personal devices of mine so there would be absolute security so that if  they were to interact with a Federal system, there would be no damage  done to that system. I guess it would also mean that if one of my  children were to call me on his personal device, whether he lives at  home or not--and I would, of course, take that call immediately--he  would then have gotten into my personal device. Would the Federal  Government need to secure that as well?   Even if it were appropriate for the Federal Government to do that for  Members and their extended immediate networks, I am not sure it is  possible.  [[Page S5219]]  I am certainly sure that it has nothing to do with election security.  It might have something to do with the security of our system here in  the Senate. Frankly, I think it might make it less secure, which is why  I have chosen not to bring that bill up before our committee until I  know more about it. I think it might make it less secure if everybody,  without hesitation, thinks, well, somebody has looked at this personal  device of mine and has secured it, so I can go into any of the secure  systems in the Senate that I want to with this device and not have any  sense that I might endanger that Senate system.   This doesn't protect the elections. There have been numerous UC  attempts we have seen on plenty of other bills that have claimed to  secure elections. One included a provision that would take away the  authority of the States to determine their own processes for voter  registration. I am not for that. I also think it is hard to make the  case that it would secure elections.   In case you think it would, another one was to require every State to  have online voter registration. I am pretty sure that this would make  elections less secure.   We have talked about all of the infiltration of bad information out  there on the internet, and one of these provisions to secure elections  would require States to have online registration.   One was for there to be automatic voter registration, and another was  for there to be same-day registration.   In the nonurban part of our State of Missouri, we didn't have voter  registration in all elections until 1975 or so. The view was, well, in  small towns and school district elections and all, they are going to  know everybody, so they really don't need to have registration. Yet,  finally, it occurred to somebody that one might just think one knows  five people, and the bond issue might be decided by five people, so we  would have voter registration. In fact, not only would we have it, but  we would have it enough in advance that anybody could look at those  voter rolls 28 days in advance and see if there were any question as to  whether one were registered or not.   Other States have decided to have same-day registration, but one of  these bills that would secure our elections would allow anybody to  register to vote that day who would walk up to vote. If you think that  works in your State, I am not really arguing you shouldn't do it,  because if that is what the voters of that State believe to be the  case, maybe it does. I am pretty sure it wouldn't work in every State.  In revisiting that online voter registration again, I am sure that  doesn't secure elections.   There was one proposal that was rejected in these bills to secure  elections, that being, for every $1 contributed at a certain level,  there would be $6 given to that campaign by the Federal Government.  That is one of the secure election things that was rejected, that  wasn't accepted by unanimous consent.   At this point, it does seem to me, if you are not willing to accept  all of these things--there was sort of this ``hair on fire'' moment--or  are not willing to accept anything somebody else says will secure  elections, then somehow you are undermining the elections system. Yet  we really undermine the system when we say this kind of thing helps it.  Frankly, I have been watching this for a while, and that list of things  I gave you has been on every Democratic wish list for about 20 years of  what would be of advantage to them in the elections. Never before have  they purported that these things have made elections more secure. They  have just said it was a better system and more fair. It was obvious to  them it would help them, and it was obvious to us it would help them.  We haven't done it, and we are probably not going to do it right now.   There are people in this building who simply will not accept the fact  that there is not a Federal solution to every problem. Sometimes if  there is a Federal solution, it is not the best solution. Frankly, I  think the diversity of the election system that we have is one of the  strengths of the system. I may get back to that later, but that is what  President Obama said in October of 2016. In fact, he said that we  didn't have a Federal structure and that it made it really more  difficult to impact our elections than if we had.   I believe everybody here clearly knows that State and local officials  faced a significant threat from the Russians, particularly in 2016,  that they had not faced before. One could probably add that the  Russians, the Chinese, the North Koreans, and the Iranians could do  very disruptive things for not much money. There is no question that  the Russians affected our elections, but they have been trying to  impact elections in Eastern and Western Europe for well over a decade.  Why this would be a surprise to us is shocking to me and why, in 2016,  we acted like we were totally flatfooted that, oh, the Russians would  actually interfere with the elections just because they interfered in  elections in a couple handful of countries in the previous decade. The  world is pretty small when you get to that internet world we live in  now.   A critical infrastructure declaration came from the Obama  administration in October whereby, frankly, it terrified most State  election officials that, suddenly, the Federal Government, with about 2  weeks left before the election, was going to Federalize a system that  they were personally responsible for.   As for the Intelligence Committee that started this process--the  Presiding Officer and I were both on it, and I am still on it--it  released some key findings about what the Russians had done. The  committee found that the Russians had worked hard to find the seams  between which the Federal Government could be helpful to State and  local governments. They found that the FBI's and Department of Homeland  Security's warnings to local officials came way too late in the process  and were not well thought out. It scared the wrong people and confused  more people when the FBI and the DHS did what they did. While there is  no question that both of those agencies have redoubled their efforts to  build trust with the States and deploy resources to help secure  elections, we have to remain vigilant to see they continue to do that.  Even when the Presiding Officer and I worked on a bill together last  year, the local officials continued to have some problems with it. I  know I said at the time that I had believed we had been doing  everything this bill would do. I am not sure we would still be doing it  10 years from now, so we need to memorialize that. I haven't  significantly changed my view on that, but I haven't changed my view,  more importantly, that we are doing what we need to do now.   Congress needs to be vigilant. We have to insist that State and local  officials have the clearance levels they need. Frankly, let me say this  too. On that topic, I am not sure you can legislate that. I am not sure  you can legislate ``here is what you have to be willing to tell State  and local officials.'' I am not sure you can ever put that in writing,  but you can ask them what they are telling people. I talked to one of  our State election officials just last week.   I asked: How is this going?   He said: Well, everything we request seems to be one level above the  security clearance I have.   Too many of the things we ask meet that criteria. We are going to  have to insist that this not be the case. While this is not likely to  be solved by legislation, I think it can be solved by congressional  oversight and inquiry.   The Intelligence Committee also found that Russian activities demand  renewed attention to vulnerabilities in the U.S. voting infrastructure.  I certainly agree with that. We even said in that report we should  replace out-of-date machines with improved ways to vote and improved  cybersecurity. I think that is happening.   Election officials have been taking this threat very seriously. DHS,  the Department of Homeland Security, has reported that all 50 States  and more than 1,400 local jurisdictions have signed up for the cyber  threat information sharing program. We have had reports to the Senate  on that, and the Committee on Rules and Administration has had hearings  on that. The Committee on Intelligence has asked repeatedly about that.  The monitoring sensors that help to detect malicious activity have been  deployed to election infrastructure in most States.   Remember that, in 2016, we had a cyber defense, but we didn't have a  cyber offense. Early in the Trump administration, I remember people  being asked in an open hearing: Do you have  [[Page S5220]]  any direction now to be fighting out there--to have a cyber offense?  That was about 5 months into the Trump administration.   The person said: No.   You would think that, somehow, the old cyber offense had been turned  off. In fact, there had been no cyber offense.   Sometime in 2017, the cyber fighters were given what they needed, and  they are out there helping. They are fighting back too. We had a report  on that just recently of which all of the Senators are aware.   One of the chief State election officials in terms of that cyber war  said that in their system there are about 100,000 attempts every day to  scam the voter registration system and see if you could possibly get  in.   I don't know how many thousands of those might be from foreign  actors. I suspect a majority of them are from people who just say:  Let's see if I can get into the system. But we should assume all  100,000 are from somebody who wants to do something wrong, and I think  the States are getting the help they need to fight that back.   We have seen States use equipment that didn't have a backup so that  when the election was over, you could count something individually and  that the voter would have been able to look at and get their hands on  and recount. As a matter of fact, if you ask me, the best proof you can  have is a backup, a ballot that could be counted--a ballot where if I  vote in Missouri, my voting machine generates something that I look at  and then I put that in the ballot box and it is counted at the polling  place. But if it ever had to be counted again, if there was any  question about that precinct counter, they can go back and open that  ballot box and count them again.   On election day in 2016, and even in 2018, there were still four  States that didn't have that system anywhere in their States. There are  a couple of other States that have a partial system and four States  that didn't have it. Delaware has it in place for this year's election.  Georgia announced just last week that they had awarded a contract to  replace their equipment that will be in place for the 2020 elections  and have an auditable ballot trail. South Carolina made a similar  announcement last month. The fourth State, Louisiana, is working  through a contracting bidding process right now. Whether they are in  place by 2020 or not in Louisiana I don't know, but I know they will be  in as soon as they can reasonably be in and not confuse voters.   Congress has to continue to move States to do that. We need to look  and see what happened with the States that were given $380 million. In  2018, 49 States took the money immediately. One State, Minnesota, has  some glitch with their legislature so they don't have their money yet.  But of the $380 million that States have, they have only spent 25  percent of it. So there is still $285 million for which States have to  do the kinds of things that the Congress thinks States should be doing.   Now, there may be some States that have already spent all of their  money and need more. That is something that, in the appropriations  process, I am sure we will look at again, just like that $380 million  came through the appropriations process.   As I recall, the Presiding Officer was pretty involved in that  discussion at the time.   The Federal Government's role isn't to run elections for the State,  but it certainly has a place in trying to be a valued partner, ensuring  that the States have all the help they need.   In fact, I believe that a larger Federal role requiring a one-size- fits-all approach to the election would be a big mistake. I am not for  federalizing the elections.   I spent 20 years as an elections official, either as the individual  responsible for elections in the third-most populous county in our  State or the chief elections official as the secretary of State. In 20  years of doing this, I guarantee you that the person on the ground,  generally elected by the voters for whom he or she is trying to secure  the election that day, is intensely interested in that election going  well and people's having confidence in it.   There is very little kicking the buck up to some Federal official in  a faraway place and saying: Well, we can't prepare for that because we  haven't been told we could prepare for that.   Public confidence in elections is fundamental. It is the central  thread in the fabric of democracy. Elected officials take it seriously  when they are elected to do this job or supervise this job, just like  appointed officials and boards of elections or election commissioners  do.   That system would not be improved if it was directed from Washington,  DC, in a one-size-fits-all world.   These public servants undertake an important job, and they understand  it is an important job. We need to support them. We are supporting  them.   We need to have oversight. There may be a time when that oversight  has produced a system that is so finely honed that we are ready to make  it permanent, but every time you put something in law permanently, you  reduce a lot of your flexibility to insist that something be done  differently that needs to be done right now.   Both the Intel Committee report--and both Senator Warner and Senator  Burr have done a good job at keeping our committee on a bipartisan,  nonpartisan track in this report--and former FBI Director Mueller  focused on the insidious efforts to confuse voters. This is a much  bigger question than what we could do at the government level about  elections security.   Let's not confuse that certain fight about bad information that is  out there with a fight about whether our elections are secure and what  happens on election day.   Frankly, much more attention on what we can do about information is  out there. Put people on alert. You know, sometimes even your political  opponent says things that aren't true, and they don't have to be  Russian to do that. People need to be on alert about information that  is out there, but they also don't need to be scared to death that  somehow we are not taking seriously the important moment of democracy  when people decide.   I believe we are doing that. I am committed to it. I believe the  Senate is committed to it. I think this effort to make everything that  might advantage one side on an election security issue is something  that people need to be thoughtful about, and it needs to stop.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, first of all, I wanted to talk about  everything you could be doing in Missouri in the next month or so with  your family, and then I was told I have 5 minutes. That seems to be an  impossible restriction for me. So let me see how many things I can talk  about here as we end the summer travel season. But there are other  people traveling after the summer. Some families still have their  summer vacation. Some schools start after Labor Day, some before. I am  sure I will be leaving things out that I will be glad to talk about at  a later time. Let me first just mention a couple of our national parks.   If you leave my hometown of Springfield, MO, and you head west,  pretty quickly you get to the Wilson's Creek National Battlefield park.  There was a battle in August of 1861. Several thousand people fought  who really weren't prepared to fight. They weren't trained. They  weren't ready. It was a big battle that made a big difference in what  happened in Missouri in the war.   Not too far from there, you get to Diamond, MO, where there is the  George Washington Carver National Monument. It is a 240-acre park on  the farm where George Washington Carver grew up. He was born as a slave  but was quickly freed and raised by the older White couple who lived  there. He managed to get to school there a little bit and in those  years after the Civil War became a leading scientist and spokesman for  agriculture in the country. This monument was established in 1943, and  it was the first national park dedicated to an African American.   I have to circle back a little bit to get to Branson. With 50  theaters in Branson, there are more theater seats than Broadway. It is  never too early to find a show you want to see in Branson.   In Silver Dollar City, in the summer of last year, their great park  was named the No. 1 Christmas venue in America to visit.   Now back to my hometown of Springfield, which is the way this comes  up on my list. It is the home of Bass Pro Shops. The Wonders of  Wildlife National Museum and Aquarium right there by Bass Pro was named  ``America's Best Aquarium'' by USA TODAY Travel last year. That museum  has 3,000 fish, birds, mammals, reptiles, and amphibious animals there.   A park we just added to our National Park System--I will pop right up  to almost St. Louis, to St. Genevieve, where you have French  architecture that dates back to the 1700s. This is the first summer  that there has been a full-time park person there. This park is rising  out of what the community has preserved so well for so long. There are  a number of houses there that reflect that early French architecture  along the Mississippi River.   South of there, at Perryville, is the full-sized replica of the  Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall. There have been some traveling  memorials, and there are a couple of memorials that are miniature in  some way, but in Perryville, MO, you can see a full-sized replica on a  47-acre family farm that Jim Eddleman and his family made possible,  along with other donations. I was there not too long ago, and I was at  the Vietnam Wall here not too long ago. They are in different places,  but they are the same wall, exactly the same size, with the same names,  and are the same in every way.   On the other side of our State, in Kansas City, is the Negro Leagues  Baseball Museum. Just this week, Senator Kaine and I introduced  legislation for a memorial coin to benefit the Negro Leagues Baseball  Museum in Kansas City. Congressmen Cleaver and Stivers in the House did  the same thing.   While you are in Kansas City here at the end of the centennial of  World War I, the World War I Museum in Kansas City was the World War I  Memorial dedicated in the 1920s. It is the No. 1 place in America to  visit and think about the war and the impact of that war in the 100  years that have passed since then.   If you want to go north to St. Joseph, you, of course, pass some  baseball stadiums and football fields that are good places to visit if  you are there at the right time. In St. Joseph, there is the Pony  Express Museum. The Pony Express didn't last very long, but it became a  very important part of the lore of the West, these young riders--before  the telegraph--taking a message as quickly as they could ride and  changing from one rider to another to go from St. Joe to California.   I wouldn't want to leave out the Mark Twain Boyhood Home in Hannibal.  There was a time when Mark Twain was by far the best-read American  author anywhere in the world. Hannibal is the setting for the classic  American novel ``The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.''   We will circle right back down to the Gateway Arch in St. Louis. More  than 135 million people have visited the arch since 1963. It just went  through a major overhaul and a 60-year renewal of the facility, better  connecting it to downtown. It is the first example of what the National  Park Service hopes will be the next century of the park, a true public- private partnership.   In going to all these places, we drove by lots of lakes and lots of  fishing and boating. There are a lot of things to do in our State. Like  many States, tourism is our second biggest industry. We look forward to  people visiting us this summer and next year and the years after that.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for the Legislative  Activities Report of the Committee of Rules and Administration during  the 115th Congress be printed into the Congressional Record.

Additional       meetings of the Committee may be called by the Chairman as he       may deem necessary or pursuant to the provision of paragraph       3 of rule XXVI of the Standing Rules of the Senate.        2. Meetings of the committee, including meetings to conduct       hearings, shall be open to the public, except that a meeting       or series of meetings by the committee on the same subject       for a period of no more than 14 calendar days may be closed       to the public on a motion made and seconded to go into closed       session to discuss only whether the matters enumerated in       subparagraphs (a) through (f) would require the meeting to be       closed followed immediately by a recorded vote in open       session by a majority of the Members of the committee when it       is determined that the matters to be discussed or the       testimony to be taken at such meeting or meetings:        (A) will disclose matters necessary to be kept secret in       the interests of national defense or the confidential conduct       of the foreign relations of the United States;        (B) will relate solely to matters of the committee staff       personnel or internal staff management or procedure;        (C) will tend to charge an individual with crime or       misconduct, to disgrace or injure the professional standing       of an individual, or otherwise to expose an individual to       public contempt or obloquy, or will represent a clearly       unwarranted invasion of the privacy of an individual;        (D) will disclose the identity of any informer or law       enforcement agent or will disclose any information relating       to the investigation or prosecution of a criminal offense       that is required to be kept secret in the interests of       effective law enforcement;        (E) will disclose information relating to the trade secrets       or financial or commercial information pertaining       specifically to a given person if:        (1) an Act of Congress requires the information to be kept       confidential by Government officers and employees; or        (2) the information has been obtained by the Government on       a confidential basis, other than through an application by       such person for a specific Government financial or other       benefit, and is required to be kept secret in order to       prevent undue injury to the competitive position of such       person; or        (F) may divulge matters required to be kept confidential       under the provisions of law or Government regulations.

In addition, the       committee staff will telephone or e-mail reminders of       committee meetings to all Members of the committee or to the       appropriate assistants in their offices.        4. A copy of the committee's intended agenda enumerating       separate items of legislative business and committee business       will normally be sent to all Members of the committee and       released to the public at least 1 day in advance of all       meetings. This does not preclude any Member of the committee       from discussing appropriate non-agenda topics.        5. After the Chairman and the Ranking Minority Member,       speaking order shall be based on order of arrival,       alternating between Majority and Minority Members, unless       otherwise directed by the Chairman.        6.

In general, testimony will be restricted to 5 minutes       for each witness. The time may be extended by the Chairman,       upon the Chair's own direction or at the request of a Member.       Each round of questions by Members will also be limited to 5       minutes.                              TITLE II--QUORUMS         1.

Pursuant to paragraph 7(a)(2) of rule XXVI of the       Standing Rules, 2 Members of the committee shall constitute a       quorum for the purpose of taking testimony under oath and 1       Member of the committee shall constitute a quorum for the       purpose of taking testimony not under oath; provided,       however, that in either instance, once a quorum is       established, any one Member can continue to take such       testimony.        4. Under no circumstances may proxies be considered for the       establishment of a quorum.                              TITLE III--VOTING         1.

The results of roll call votes taken in any meeting upon       any measure, or any amendment thereto, shall be stated in the       committee report on that measure unless previously announced       by the committee, and such report or announcement shall       include a tabulation of the votes cast in favor of and the       votes cast in opposition to each such measure and amendment       by each Member of the committee.

However, the vote of the       committee to report a measure or matter shall require the       concurrence of a majority of the Members of the committee who       are physically present at the time of the vote. Proxies will       be allowed in such cases solely for the purpose of recording       a Member's position on the question and then only in those       instances when the absentee committee Member has been       informed of the question and has affirmatively requested that       he be recorded. (Paragraph 7(a)(3) of rule XXVI of the       Standing Rules.)                             TITLE IV--AMENDMENTS         1. Provided at least five business days' notice of the       agenda is given, and the text of  [[Page S5240]]       the proposed bill or resolution has been made available at       least five business calendar days in advance, it shall not be       in order for the Committee to consider any amendment in the       first degree proposed to any measure under consideration by       the Committee unless such amendment has been delivered to the       office of the Committee and circulated via e-mail to each of       the offices by at least 5:00 p.m. the day prior to the       scheduled start of the meeting.        2. In the event the Chairman introduces a substitute       amendment or a Chairman's mark, the requirements set forth in       Paragraph 1 of this Title shall be considered waived unless       such substitute amendment or Chairman's mark has been made       available at least five business days in advance of the       scheduled meeting.        3. It shall be in order, without prior notice, for a Member       to offer a motion to strike a single section of any bill,       resolution, or amendment under consideration.        4. This section of the rule may be waived by agreement of       the Chairman and the Ranking Minority Member.            TITLE V--DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY TO COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN         1.
