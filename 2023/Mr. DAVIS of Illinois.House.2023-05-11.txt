 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Democrats strongly agree that those who took advantage of the COVID  crisis to commit fraud must be held accountable. Indeed, Democrats put  $2 billion in the American Rescue Plan Act to fight fraud, and every  House Republican voted against these investments to prevent fraud and  hold criminals accountable.   These Democratic anti-fraud dollars helped the Department of Labor  create an important cross-checking system to catch fraudsters who apply  for unemployment in one State while receiving income in another, a  practice for which a Republican House Member reportedly was indicted  earlier this week.   Republicans are playing a dangerous game by cutting ongoing  successful work by the Federal Government to fight fraud and leaving  States to pick up the pieces.   The Department of Labor expressed deep concern about how H.R. 1163  will ``throttle essential, ongoing efforts to strengthen and protect  the UI program.''   Instead of punishing organized crime, the Republican H.R. 1163 guts  Federal funding to fight fraud, weakens State unemployment systems,  privatizes American public service jobs, and sends cruel surprise bills  to innocent workers who were unemployed during the pandemic.   We enacted bipartisan pandemic unemployment benefits that kept an  estimated 5 million people a year from falling into poverty.                                time  1445    This assistance meant revenue and customers for businesses and helps  spur our economic recovery. Unfortunately, when disaster struck, State  unemployment systems were not prepared. Mistakes were made and  thousands of workers were overpaid.   Again, we worked in bipartisan fashion to encourage States to waive  overpayments to protect unemployed workers. Now, Republicans want to  force States to claw back accidental overpayments from workers up to 10  years later.   When my GOP colleagues incorrectly assert that the bill limits the  claw back of overpayments to fraud, they are only referring to a very  narrow limit on the ability of States to keep portions of recovered  fraud payments.   My Democratic colleagues and I offered many amendments to invest in  antifraud efforts, protect workers, and strengthen State unemployment  systems. The Republicans rejected every amendment.   Instead, the GOP careens ahead with H.R. 1163 that the CBO estimates  is a net cut in Federal investment in fighting unemployment fraud and  strengthening unemployment systems.   That is why so many organizations oppose H.R. 1163, including the  AFL-CIO; the American Federation of State, County and Municipal  Employees; the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities; the  Communications Workers of America; the National Employment Law Project;  and the Service Employees International Union.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this dangerous bill, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 90 seconds to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Doggett).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from California (Mr. Thompson).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer).                                time  1500     Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from New Jersey (Mr. Pascrell).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Pennsylvania (Mr. Evans).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Illinois (Mr. Schneider), my home State.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds  to the gentleman from Illinois.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Illinois (Mr. Foster).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Virginia (Mr. Beyer).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Nevada (Mr. Horsford).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to  the gentleman from Nevada.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time  is remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Kamlager-Dove).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Chu).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs. Sykes).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Mr. Speaker, Democrats strongly agree that those who took advantage  of the COVID crisis to commit fraud must be held accountable. That is  why Democrats put $2 billion in the American Rescue Plan Act to fight  fraud. Every House Republican voted against it.   According to the Department of Labor's trust fund, only 16 States met  the required solvency standard for unemployment systems. Instead of  punishing organized crime and instead of addressing the fragility of  State unemployment systems, the Republican H.R. 1163 guts Federal  funding to fight fraud, weakens State unemployment systems, privatizes  American public service jobs, and claws back overpayments for workers  who were unemployed during the pandemic and received overpayments  through no fault of their own.   Mr. Speaker, I am shocked that the Republican leadership is advancing  this bill that guts Federal investment in stopping unemployment fraud  the same week when one of its own is indicted for such crimes.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill that punishes  America's families while stunting accountability for actual crimes.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote, and I yield back the balance of my  time.
