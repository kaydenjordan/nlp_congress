 Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in opposition to certain  PFAS-related provisions that are included in the National Defense  Authorization Act.   While it is important to provide funding for cleanup, it is also  critical that efforts to regulate PFAS do so in a way that defines the  chemicals consistently, adequately, and properly as supported by sound  science. In this current version of the NDAA, what is defined as PFAS  is left open to interpretation or defined under an extremely broad  definition.   Broad definition risks subjecting thousands of chemicals to  unnecessary restrictions and create regulatory uncertainty for numerous  products. A few products that could fall under this overly broad  definition include lithium ion batteries, semiconductors, refrigerants,  and medical devices. These products that could be impacted, provide  critical benefits to our military  [[Page H4571]]  and our broader society and should be manufactured in the United  States.   In the NDAA and with all legislation it is essential that we properly  define PFAS up front so that implementing regulations can focus on  materials such as PFOA and PFOS where there is scientific consensus for  regulation. Throughout bicameral negotiations, I urge the careful  consideration of drafting PFAS definitions that are properly focused,  targeted, and supported by sound science.
