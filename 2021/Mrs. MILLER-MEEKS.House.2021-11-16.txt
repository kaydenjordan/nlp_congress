 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and  legacy of a wonderful woman from my district who dedicated her life to  the betterment of her community by educating the next generation.   On November 2, 2021, Fairfield lost a beloved member of their  community, Nohema Graber. Born in Mexico, Nohema later moved to Iowa,  where her love for education drove her to pursue a career in teaching.  She would eventually go on to teach Spanish at Fairfield High School.   When reading stories about Nohema's kind and caring spirit, I came  across one that really warmed my heart, and I would like to share it.   When a dear friend of Nohema's son was diagnosed with a brain tumor  12 years ago, Nohema would pray with her friend every single day. Her  son, now healthy, was among the countless members of the Fairfield  community to attend Nohema's vigil.   I send my prayers out to the friends and family of Nohema Graber, as  well as the students and faculty of Fairfield High School, as they  mourn this tragic loss.                            ____________________
