 Mr. President, few people have advocated for their home  States as tirelessly and as effectively as Paul Costello has advocated  for Vermont. After 21 years at the helm of the Vermont Council for  Rural Development, Paul is retiring from his post, but I know he will  never retire from his steadfast support for Vermont.   Paul has dedicated his entire career to fostering dialogue and  embracing civic engagement to move our communities forward by bringing  people together to inspire constructive change. His decades of service  deserve special recognition. As I was as well, Paul was born and raised  in Vermont. He grew up in Burlington and spent his undergraduate years  at the University of Vermont. He later crossed the border to earn a  Ph.D. in intellectual history from Montreal's McGill University. After  completing his education, Paul lectured at his alma maters and at Saint  Michael's College, and he served as an adviser at Sterling College in  Craftsbury. He served for 5 years at Central Vermont Basic Adult  Education, bringing literacy instruction to teens and adults in rural  Vermont counties, before stepping into his longtime role as executive  director at the Vermont Council on Rural Development--VCRD--in 2000.   The VCRD is truly a Vermont institution. The council does important  work to help strengthen our rural communities. Known for their  community visits, VCRD travels to towns throughout the State, where  leaders from different sectors in Vermont listen to community members  identify and acknowledge the challenges and opportunities they have  before them. Sticking to Paul's dedication to a locally driven process,  the visiting VCRD team reflects on the community discussion and offers  guidance and potential resources to help the community meet their needs  and goals. The VCRD has facilitated community visits in over 75 Vermont  towns, and success from these events is seen in the form of new  projects, grants, job creation, implementation of green energy, and so  much more. These visits also have the effect of bringing our rural  communities together and adding to the sense of unity that is already  so strong in our small towns.   Through Paul's leadership, the VCRD has followed through with  initiatives that have a lasting positive influence on our State as a  whole. The council's Working Lands Enterprise Initiative has created  hundreds of new jobs and generated more than $35 million for Vermont's  economy. Under Paul's steady hand, the VCRD has also helped to improve  and expand Vermont's digital economy, something which our State  continues to expand to make ours a competitive economy, locally,  regionally, and internationally.   Paul has lived by his mantra of ``listening, learning and helping,''  and the benefits can be seen across rural Vermont. He is a Vermonter  through and through, and I am proud to call him a dear friend.   In honor of Paul's retirement and 21 years of exceptional service to  Vermont, I ask unanimous consent that the article ``Moved the Needle,''  by Steve Pappas, published in the Barre Montpelier Times Argus, be  printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:           [From the Barre Montpelier Times Argus, June 3, 2021]                              Moved the Needle                             (By Steve Pappas)         Paul Costello is too humble to say it, so we will: As the       21-year director of the Vermont Council on Rural Development       he has probably done more for Vermont than most lawmakers or       governors.        It's a bold statement, we understand. But consider that       Costello has worked for a nonpartisan nonprofit agency that       has influenced most of the major public policy initiatives in       this state during these two decades. Only our three members       in the congressional delegation--and they are definitely       partisan--have had that much sway for any similar length of       time. Less than a week after hosting the Summit for the       Future of Vermont, which brought together hundreds of       Vermonters to tackle head-on some of the most difficult       challenges facing our state, the announcement that Costello       is stepping down stunned the state.        Costello says he will step down Sept. 30.        Through his work, Costello has led efforts through VCRD's       talented staff to facilitate some of the hardest       conversations out there: economy, workforce, climate change,       education, community development, broadband, digital economy,       social equity . . . the list goes on.        From these conversations, whether they happened in town       halls or large lecture halls or virtually, Costello, in his       even-keeled, thoughtful manner, has facilitated strategies       aimed at setting priorities, and charting paths toward       progress. Many of those decisions frame our quality of life       today.        According to the news release issued by VCRD this week,       ``Over these years Paul has engaged communities throughout       the state to help them set priorities and connect to       resources, led a dozen policy council efforts to advance       local opportunities, developed a score of statewide summits       to build unity and common purpose to answer key rural needs,       and worked in myriad ways to bring people together for the       common good of their communities and for Vermont.''        Being the person who coordinates, directs and often       moderates those methods of communication and openness is       powerful. In the same release, Costello noted, ``In so many       ways this is the best job in Vermont. At VCRD we have a       window into communities like no other. Our role of listening,       learning, and helping to move ideas toward action in       communities and in policy circles is endlessly interesting       and rewarding. I want to thank all the incredible people I've       been able to work with in this role, from board members to       state, federal and nonprofit leaders, experts in all aspects       of rural issues and especially the local leaders who do the       hard work of lifting up their communities and building       progress. Working with you all has been the greatest honor.''        Julie Moore, chair of the VCRD board of directors noted,       ``Paul Costello is a Vermont treasure. Our state has       benefited beyond measure from his wise counsel to everyone       from governors to select board members to community leaders.       We look forward to celebrating all of his accomplishments.''        But here's the thing about Paul Costello: He is committed       to Vermont because he loves it. To him, the work is not a       paycheck. It is about making our communities stronger. It is       about making our policies supportive of those communities. It       is about preservation and conversation when needed, but with       an eye toward answers. It is about being a part of this       magnificent state.        He knows every corner of the state. He has been at the       select board meetings and talked to residents about what they       want, and he has been hiking and experiencing Vermont. His       love for the place is real. He grew up here, in a large       family, with a great appreciation that goes back decades. He       hears what others want for Vermont, and he knows what he       wants for Vermont. And he's so flipping nice about it all.       There have to be individuals out there who don't want Paul       Costello coming around and getting people thinking about how       to implement change. But even those people can't point to the       man and say, ``I didn't like that guy.'' They did.        Costello listens. Even in the most serious conversation, he       can find humor and a laugh. He makes every person he speaks       to feel as if they are the most important person, because in       that moment, they are. He is mild-mannered and kind. He goes       out of his way to ask how people's days are going, even when       he knows they are strapped and swamped. He treats governors       and citizens with the same respect. Opinions and solutions do       not require titles and doctorates and years of service. They       need common ground on which to build, and that was what       Costello has practiced and mentored his staff to find for       more than 20 years now.        Ted Brady, who used to work with Costello and now runs the       Vermont League of Cities and Towns, posted online yesterday,       ``I can count on one hand the number of people I have met as       selfless, thoughtful and kind as Paul Costello. He's given so       much to Vermont . . . and deserves a chance to play in his       favorite spots in the woods and mountains of the communities       he has helped to strengthen and empower. Buy him a beer if       you see him.''        Costello may never have to buy his own beer again. Each one       of us owes him a great debt of gratitude for the Vermont he       has given everyone.                            ____________________
