 Madam Speaker, I want to talk about the  administration's move to cut hundreds of thousands of people from SNAP,  our Nation's safety net for those faced with food insecurity.   By the USDA's own estimates, nearly 700,000 people will be hurt by  this policy. 700,000, that is appalling. That is 700,000 people who  will struggle to feed themselves while they work towards getting back  on their feet. That is 700,000 people who will have to decide whether  to pay their bills or go hungry.   But this doesn't just affect those who will be cut from the food  assistance program, this affects everyone. SNAP dollars are spent in  local small businesses and help bring money to struggling communities.  Simply put, this rule will make more people go hungry and hurt our  communities in the process.   In Congress, we worked together on this issue. We reached a  consensus, and we passed bipartisan legislation. So this policy is not  what we passed, and it is not what the American people want. I am  calling on this administration to stop this cruel policy.                            ____________________
