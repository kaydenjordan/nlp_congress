 Mr. President, I come to the floor to talk about the  Children's Health Insurance Program and Community Health Centers, but I  do want to take a moment to respond to my friend and colleague, the  distinguished Senator on the Republican side.   I can speak for myself and others, I know, on this side who very much  want to see tax reform, very much want to close loopholes that take  jobs overseas and support small businesses, but what is in front of us  and what was voted on was a bill that, when fully implemented, would  raise taxes on something like 87 million middle-class Americans. That  doesn't make any sense at all.   All of the rosy estimates on economic growth were not backed up in  legislative language. As to the $4,000 wage increase that had been  talked about as a minimum for people across the country to receive  based on economic growth, I suggested we write that into law; that if,  in fact, folks don't get their $4,000, the tax breaks would stop--and  folks aren't willing to do that.   I want to make sure folks in Michigan get their $4,000 wage increase,  and we don't get another bunch of promises with trickle-down economics,  where everything goes to the top 1 percent, and folks in Michigan are  still waiting for it to trickle down.
