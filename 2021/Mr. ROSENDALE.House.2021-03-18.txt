 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the open  border policies of the Biden administration, which have created the  worst border crisis in recent memory.   After the surge in 2019, the Trump administration built the wall  system to secure our border, ended ``catch and release,'' and, most  importantly, actually enforced our Nations' laws, making it harder and  less desirable to come to our country illegally. And it worked. Illegal  border crossings fell to record lows.   Unfortunately, on his first day in office, in an act of spiteful  partisanship, President Biden undid all of that with the stroke of a  pen. The results are clear and disturbing. February border  apprehensions were tripled what they were last year under President  Trump, with a number of accompanied children in custody already  shattering a record.  [[Page H1575]]    This truly is a humanitarian crisis of our time. On the treacherous  trip to our country, illegal aliens are subject to abuse, rape, gang  violence, and harsh weather and terrain. Once they arrive, often they  are forced into sex slavery or indentured servitude to pay off their  debts to coyotes or the cartel. Open borders and amnesty are not  compassionate. They are heartless. The level of human suffering taking  place on the border due to President Biden's policies is truly tragic.  The result of these policies was completely predictable.   When I visited the border just over a month ago, agents told me  troubling stories of illegal aliens, specifically citing President  Biden's immigration policies as the reason they decided to come to  America. And this week, House Democrats passed amnesty measures that  will only make the situation worse.   Mr. Speaker, I urge President Biden and House Democrats to  reconsider, set aside partisanship, and work with us to secure our  border, enforce our laws, and address the humanitarian crisis at the  border before it is too late.
