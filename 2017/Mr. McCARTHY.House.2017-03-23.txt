 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Members are advised that votes are now expected in the House  tomorrow, March 24, 2017. I know this is a change from our previously  announced schedule. Members should be prepared for multiple vote  series, the first of which will be as early as 10 a.m.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   The Rules Committee will meet tomorrow morning. I anticipate a short  amendment will be posted as early as tonight. It is our expectation the  Rules Committee will meet tomorrow morning to report the rule providing  for consideration of H.R. 1628, the American Health Care Act.   Upon adoption of that rule, the House will proceed with general  debate on the measure and final passage.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I anticipate the Rules Committee meeting earlier than 9 a.m.  tomorrow.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   It is our anticipation to be done in the afternoon, but the gentleman  may know better how long it will take based upon as we move through  during the day.    Mr. Speaker, I don't want to grab the exact time, but  it is our anticipation, after the Rules Committee meets, that we come  down and have a rules vote. We will have hours of debate, and then we  will proceed with the vote, and as orderly as we can get done, we will  get done by the afternoon as early as possible.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
