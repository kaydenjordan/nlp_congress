 Madam Speaker, in preparation for reauthorizing the farm  bill in 2023, I rise today to deliver the tenth installment of my farm  bill impact series where I am highlighting various aspects of the farm  bill that deserve this Congress' awareness and support.   Rural Development programs exist within the farm bill because the  people of rural America, many of whom work to feed, fuel, and clothe us  all, must remain connected to their families, local communities, and  the world to do their jobs.   Communities are made up of families, and families in rural areas need  well-built affordable housing in order to thrive. USDA Rural  Development's Single Family Housing Programs enable families and  individuals to buy, build, or repair affordable homes located in rural  America. Through these programs, qualifying individuals can finance a  new home with no money down or get financial assistance to repair their  wells, hookups to rural water, septic, plumbing, heating, air- conditioning, and electrical systems, insulation, and storm shelters or  safe rooms.   USDA Rural Development is also committed to helping improve the  economy and quality of life in rural America, and every strong  community needs strong local businesses. The Business and Industry Loan  Guarantee program improves the economic health of rural communities by  increasing access to business capital through loan guarantees, as well  as enabling commercial lenders to provide affordable financing to rural  businesses.   In Healy, Kansas, the Sharp Brothers Seed Company has sold native  grass seeds since 1958. They needed additional working capital to build  up their inventory for a Conservation Reserve Program enrollment, so  they used the USDA Rural Development Business and Industry program to  secure a $5 million guaranteed loan for additional working capital.  This program helped make their operation stronger than ever before,  which is good for rural Kansas.   Finally, strengthening rural broadband will help ensure that rural  Americans, agricultural producers included, can keep pace with an  increasingly tech-driven society and international marketplace. I  believe that taxpayer dollars must be spent judiciously on existing  broadband programs, and the goals set by the USDA and the FCC must be  realistic.   Last summer, the House Agriculture Committee advanced the Broadband  Internet Connections for Rural America Act out of committee, which  authorizes $43 billion toward critical infrastructure in rural  communities. I also joined several of my House Republican colleagues  and introduced legislation that would leverage the ReConnect program  with some of the 2018 rural broadband investments in rural areas with  little or no internet access.   The ReConnect program is an example of a successful public-private  partnership. Its matching grants help cover the cost of cable,  implementation, and installment for broadband in rural  [[Page H5344]]  communities. I support whatever directly benefits the resilient people  of rural America, because they are the lifeblood of this country. That  is why I support the Rural Development programs within the farm bill,  and why I am bringing awareness to them now to ensure that these  programs remain strong in the 2023 farm bill.   I will be back to the floor soon to deliver another installment of my  farm bill impact series and highlight more programs and titles within  the bill that I believe Congress must understand and support to ensure  that agriculture and rural America thrives in this country.                 Congratulating Dale Moore on his Retirement     Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize a great Kansan,  Dale Moore, and to congratulate him on his retirement from a career of  dedicated service to farmers, ranchers, and agricultural producers.   Dale grew up on a livestock, hay, and grain farm in Copeland, Kansas,  which lies in my district, the Big First of Kansas. He went to Fort  Hays State University, worked for Kansas Pork Producers Council, the  National Cattlemen's Beef Association, and Senator Pat Roberts.   In 2001, President Bush appointed Dale to serve as chief of staff at  USDA, after which he served as legislative director for the House  Agriculture Committee. Most recently, Dale has been serving as  executive vice president at the American Farm Bureau Federation where  his presence will be deeply missed.   Dale has tirelessly advocated for agriculture for more than 40 years,  and he never forgot his southwest Kansas roots or the values he learned  there: hard work, others before self, and personal responsibility.   I am grateful for Dale's leadership and service, and I offer him, his  wife, Faith, and their entire family my best wishes as they begin this  new adventure.   Congratulations, Dale.                            ____________________
