 Madam Speaker, we have seen how climate change has made  natural disasters, such as hurricanes and tornadoes, more frequent and  much more severe.   This is not the time to debate climate change. This is the time to  act on it. And the best time to act, the best time to prepare for  natural disasters is before they occur.   September is National Preparedness Month. It is the perfect time to  celebrate the brave men and women who respond when a crisis happens and  the perfect time to coordinate our emergency response efforts.   We need to be ready for the next emergency before it strikes. As  chairman of the Emergency Preparedness, Response and Recovery  Subcommittee of the Committee on Homeland Security, I want FEMA and  other Federal agencies to have the power and resources to coordinate  relief efforts before, during, and after an emergency happens.   We do not have to relive the horrors of Hurricanes Andrew, Katrina,  and Maria. Let us be proactive about the next disaster instead of  waiting until it strikes.                            ____________________
