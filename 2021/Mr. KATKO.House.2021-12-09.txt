 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the renowned 37-year  career of NewsChannel 9 anchor Dan Cummings.   For nearly four decades, Dan Cummings has been one of the most  trusted names in local news and has earned a well-deserved reputation  for his integrity and investigative prowess.   A native of Cayuga County, Dan Cummings grew up in central New York  and got his start in journalism working at local radio stations. In  1984, Dan Cummings joined the NewsChannel 9 team and, in 2008, began  anchoring the morning news. Notably, Dan was the driving force behind  ``Newsmakers,'' a weekly public affairs program.   In these prominent roles, Dan Cummings has been celebrated for his  ability to conduct smart, original reporting and communicate even the  most difficult stories in a calm and straightforward manner.   I have known Dan Cummings for many years. I can unequivocally say he  is one of the most fair and genuine news professionals and is an  extremely generous man who is actively involved in multiple charities.   Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues in the House join me in  honoring Dan Cummings for an incredible  [[Page H7561]]  career in broadcast journalism and wishing him the best in his  retirement.                            ____________________
