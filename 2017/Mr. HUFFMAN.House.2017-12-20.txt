 Mr. Speaker, June 9, 2016, was the date of the infamous  Trump Tower meeting with at least five Russians with Kremlin ties. That  date is about the only constant in a tangled web of lies we have heard  from Team Trump.   When Donald Trump, Jr., was first asked about this meeting, he said  it was just about adoption, not a campaign issue. But he changed his  tune when the New York Times revealed emails showing it was all about  the campaign; in fact, an offer to get damning information on Hillary  Clinton as ``part of Russia and its government's support for Mr. Trump.  . . .''   Now, Donald Trump, Jr.'s, response to this illegal offer says it all:  ``. . . if it is what you say, I love it. . . . ''   We may never know how much collusion was set in motion at this  meeting, but we do know two things:   First, Team Trump has repeatedly misled us, concealing it from  security clearance forms, issuing a false statement dictated by  President Trump himself.   Second, the Russians did go on to produce a massive cache of stolen  emails and helped the Trump campaign in other ways.   These are damning facts, Mr. Speaker, and there are many more to  come. We need to find out what else they lied about and what else they  are hiding.
