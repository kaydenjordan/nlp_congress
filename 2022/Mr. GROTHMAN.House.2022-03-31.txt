 Madam Speaker, it is a good-sounding bill. Everyone  knows drug costs in general are too high, and insulin costs in  particular are way too high. But it is a bill with a simple answer.   We look at a problem and solve the problem by having the Federal  Reserve eventually print more money, $15.5 billion over 10 years.   I realize you feel you have a pay-for here, but it is just by  delaying another program by another year. And as a practical matter,  this bill spends $15.5 billion more over 10 years than we would without  the bill.   We are already told this source of funds--we already used this type  or source of funds in the infrastructure bill. It is just grabbing  another year.   Why don't we just require PBMs to pass on their rebates to the  patients as intended? That is something that would cost the Federal  Government, in my mind, no new money. It would be a significant  reduction in cost for the individual.   I appreciate that so many people on the majority side of the aisle  would like to work together with us, and it shouldn't be difficult to  find a solution to this problem that is fair to all concerned.
