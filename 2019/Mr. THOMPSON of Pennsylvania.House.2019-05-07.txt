 Mr. Speaker, next week is National  Skilled Nursing Care Week, and hundreds of nursing home administrators  will gather at State College, Pennsylvania, for the 2019 Spring Health  Care Conference.   Hosted by Central Pennsylvania Educational Resources, the conference  will allow nursing home administrators the opportunity to exchange  ideas and gain information from knowledgeable speakers.   This year's theme for National Skilled Nursing Care Week is ``Live  Soulfully,'' which will celebrate skilled nursing centers and their  residents and staff by showcasing how they achieve happy minds and  healthy souls.   Whether it is planting, cooking, reading, or listening to music,  these centers pay it forward by helping individuals find happiness to  improve quality of life.   Mr. Speaker, before coming to Congress, I worked nearly three decades  as a recreational therapist, a rehab services manager, and a licensed  nursing home administrator. I know firsthand how important quality of  life is and how each and every person at a nursing home can impact the  lives of residents.   National Skilled Nursing Care Week thanks and celebrates caregivers  for their tireless work to care for others. They truly make an impact.                            ____________________
