 Madam Speaker, President Biden and his  fellow Democrats have said that they want to fundamentally change this  country.   If this country is so bad, why do we lead the world in technological  advances?   If this country is so bad, why have millions of immigrants risked  life and limb to get into this country?   If this country is so bad, why are we the international example of  religious tolerance?   If this country is so bad, why is the dollar the standard currency  throughout the world?   If this country is so bad, why do we lead the world in aiding the  impoverished countries around the globe?   If this country is so bad, how could American scientists have  developed a vaccine in record time that has saved millions of lives  around the globe?   If this country is so bad, how could someone like Dr. Ben Carson  overcome the most insurmountable of odds to become one of the great  neurosurgeons in the world?   If this country is so bad, how is it possible that Americans of every  background can uniquely succeed here if they are determined to do so?   If this country is so bad, why do so many think it is so good?   If this country is so good, why are so many Democrats so hellbent on  tearing it apart?                            ____________________
