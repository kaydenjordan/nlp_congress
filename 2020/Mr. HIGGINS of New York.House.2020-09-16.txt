 Madam Speaker, natural disasters ripping  through the Nation today are urgent reminders that we must be better  stewards of the natural environment, including the Great Lakes.   Yet, recent actions of the Trump administration's Environmental  Protection Agency do just the opposite.   In August, the EPA issued a rule allowing the release of toxic  metals, like arsenic and mercury, into lakes, rivers, and streams near  power plants that use them.   This is the wrong strategy and is bad for America and bad for  Americans. For decades, communities across western New York have been  working together to bring back waterways, like the Buffalo River, that  were once declared ecologically dead due to toxic industrial pollution.   Successful efforts like the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative  solidified the Federal role to improve water quality in the Great  Lakes, restore aquatic habitat, and provide new recreational  opportunities for all.   Madam Speaker, I strongly oppose the EPA's destructive policies, and  I urge my colleagues to recommit themselves to prioritizing long-term  sustainability of the natural environment.                            ____________________
