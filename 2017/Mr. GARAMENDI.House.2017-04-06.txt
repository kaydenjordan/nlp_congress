 Mr. Speaker, I remember well the investigations that  Congress undertook in the Nixon period--the Watergate investigations.   Frankly, I am appalled at the way in which this House is conducting  its investigations. It is high time that we have an independent  investigation.  [[Page H2769]]    The reality has changed since the sixties and seventies. We now have  24-7 cable TV, and everything seems to be momentarily disclosed. We  can't continue. We need an independent investigation of this extremely  important issue of Russia's involvement in our national elections.                            ____________________
