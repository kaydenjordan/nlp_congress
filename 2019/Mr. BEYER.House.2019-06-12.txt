 Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, my amendment would allocate funds for a  feasibility study on the adoption of geolocation for the Suicide  Lifeline.   Suicide is a leading cause of death across all groups. The Centers  for Disease Control recently reported the age-adjusted suicide rate had  increased 33 percent from 1999 through 2017. In 2017, the last year for  which we have statistics, 47,000 Americans took their own life.   The Suicide Lifeline is a one-stop, anonymous, toll-free means for  any person in the United States who is in emotional distress, who is  thinking about killing themselves, to be connected to a trained  counselor for assistance at anytime, anywhere in the U.S.   The Lifeline routes calls to a network of certified local crisis  centers. In northern Virginia, it will call somebody in northern  Virginia. They can then intervene with support and link them to the  resources they need: mental health, social services, sometimes police,  sometimes emergency rooms.   Last year, 2 million people used the Lifeline, and we are tracking  2.5 million in 2019.   What is relevant now is that 80 percent of callers are using their  cellphones, not their land lines. The Lifeline network routes the call  based on the area code. If it is a northern Virginia area code, it is  going to send it to a northern Virginia call center.   The problem with wireless devices, as we all know, is that people are  moving all the time and, often, their cellphone follows them. As I call  most of the young people on my staff, I am calling cellphone numbers in  Massachusetts, California, Texas, and Maryland.  [[Page H4608]]    So, what we need is geolocation, which is what we already use for the  911 calls. Geolocation means that, when they make that call to the  suicide hotline, it is going to be allocated not based on their area  code but based on where the call is actually made from.   When you figure that 25 percent of the callers are determined to be  in imminent risk of suicide, that they are thinking about it right then  and now, the counselor needs to be able to engage rescue services,  police, emergency rooms; and accurate location information makes all  the difference in the world.   This knowledge--this timely, reliable knowledge--really can be the  difference between life and death. So, implementing geolocation for  Lifeline could result in crucial gains for people in distress.   SAMHSA, the Federal agency in charge of mental health, when they  reported on Representative Stewart's bill to modernize the Lifeline,  reported very positively on geolocation as a piece of that.   So, what we are simply calling for is a study, with money moved from  one program to another program, to study this and to make sure that it  works.   Suicide is now the 10th leading cause of death in the United States  and rising, so this is a very worthwhile amendment, and we hope that it  will save many lives in the years to come.   Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Connecticut  (Ms. DeLauro), the chair of the subcommittee.    Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  0130     Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, my amendment would require the Office of  Refugee Resettlement, ORR, to disclose to committees of jurisdiction  and to legal orientation providers a monthly census of the  unaccompanied children in their custody, and to do that broken down by  gender and by age.   This amendment arose from our personal experience last year when,  during the height of the family separation, we couldn't find out where  the kids were being held in Virginia. In fact, when we did find out, we  found out from the media, from newspaper reporters and television  reporters.   I recognize the need to respect these minors' privacy, but there has  to be an exception for the individuals who are in a position to help  them, people on the congressional committees that have the oversight  and the legal counsel. They have got to know where they are.   This is especially true now that we are learning that ORR is using  unlicensed facilities like Homestead and Carizzo Springs.   Increased transparency around the unlicensed facilities is necessary  in order for legal advocates to effectively monitor the conditions and  to track violations of the Flores settlement.   The legal orientation providers can't serve these kids if they don't  know where they are. Neither they nor the legal help of the kids nor  the leaders in Congress should be learning about the shelters through  the media.   The second piece of the amendment is the monthly census broken down  by age and gender. Right now, we don't know whether the kids are 17  years old or a baby or a 17-year-old with a baby.   Now, ORR is under statutory mandate to reunite these kids as quickly  as possible, and tracking gender and age will help tell us whether they  are doing it or not. We need to know where the kids are and for how  long they are there.   Beyond that, that sense of duration, we need a much more accurate  count. We don't want to hear one number from the agencies and a  different, perhaps more accurate, number from the media. We just want  thoughtful transparency. We are dealing with kids.   I have visited a couple of these facilities in Virginia. They  desperately need our help, and we need to be able to help them, and  knowing where they are will really do that.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield such time as she may consume to the  gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro).    Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, may I ask how much time I have left.    Madam Chair, in 30 quick seconds, I would like to point  out there is a difference between apprehended and offering yourself at  the border to Customs and Border Patrol for asylum. There is an  enormous difference.   I would also like to point out that there is not a single person on  this side of the aisle who doesn't want to bring this humanitarian aid  to the children. We have to be able to find something that the White  House will also accept.   I am not in the room when this happens with our distinguished leaders  of appropriations, but I know they are working very hard to make that  happen.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
