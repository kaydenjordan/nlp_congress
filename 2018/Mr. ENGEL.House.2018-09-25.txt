 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this measure. Let me first  thank our chairman on the Foreign Affairs Committee, Ed Royce, who has  done great work to get this bill to the finish line.   I want to especially thank my dear friend and colleague, Ileana Ros- Lehtinen, who was so instrumental in crafting this bill and then  getting it passed, like so many other things she has done for so many  years on the Foreign Affairs Committee. It has just been an honor and a  pleasure to work with her, and we are going to miss her. But she has  done some great work, and people's lives will be saved because of the  work that Ileana Ros-Lehtinen has done, so I want to thank her.   I am also grateful to the Members of the other body who have helped  push this measure forward. This bill is the product of a good,  bipartisan effort aimed at a clear goal to isolate Hezbollah, one of  the world's most dangerous terrorist organizations.   With hundreds of thousands of rockets pointed at Israel and fighters  returning home, battle-hardened from years fighting alongside the Assad  regime in Syria, Hezbollah has become more sophisticated and more  lethal.   Hezbollah, with support from Iran, has served as a lifeline to Assad,  allowing his regime to butcher the Syrian people. Without Hezbollah's  support, Assad would have been swept out of power years ago.   When he was losing, Hezbollah came in. Iran unleashed Hezbollah, and  they turned the tide in the war. Birds of a feather flock together,  unfortunately, and Hezbollah has also gained from this relationship.   The war in Syria bound Hezbollah and Russia together. The result was  deeper coordination and training between the two. Russia talks a good  game about fighting terrorism, but its partnership with Hezbollah has  shown that Moscow is eager to collaborate with a group that has  American blood on its hands.   Now is the time to choke Hezbollah off from its patrons. This bill  would give the administration every tool it needs to confront this  dangerous group. With this measure, we build on a 2015 law by imposing  sanctions on anyone who knowingly supports Hezbollah's fundraising and  recruitment efforts.   As terrorist groups, including Hezbollah, rely more and more on  online crowd sourcing and social media to spread their message, we need  to be one step ahead.   This bipartisan legislation also imposes sanctions on any part of a  foreign government that supplies material support or arms to Hezbollah.                                time  2230    That could include Russia and Iran for the training and assistance  they provide to Hezbollah in Syria.   This measure would also ramp up oversight on the administration's  strategies when it comes to diplomatic engagement to shut off  Hezbollah's networks and safe havens. This legislation is meant to  signal to anyone who supports Hezbollah: Your time is up.   Let me add a final note about Hezbollah as it concerns Lebanon. I  have been a friend of Lebanon for many years. Back in 2003, I wrote the  Syria Accountability and Lebanese Sovereignty Restoration Act with my  friend Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen. We pressed Syria to get out  of Lebanon and allow Lebanon to secure its own independence, free from  Syria's outside influence.   Unfortunately, Hezbollah has, so far, endured as a fact of life in  Lebanese politics. The Lebanese people deserve better. Hezbollah should  stop holding the Lebanese people hostage to its radical agenda.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, Hezbollah is a threat to peace and stability  across the Middle East. This group is emerging from the Syrian civil  war even more dangerous and determined to spread its hatred and  violence. Their tactics have grown more sophisticated, and we need to  give the administration every tool we can to crack down on this group.  This bill is a strong move in that direction. It is a great example of  what we can produce when we work  [[Page H8878]]  across the aisle on national security issues.   Let me say, I never hesitate to say how proud I am of the Foreign  Affairs Committee and Chairman Ed Royce and the leadership of the  committee on both sides of the aisle for what we think as being the  most bipartisan committee in Congress. It is important when we are  talking about foreign policy that America speak with one voice, and it  is important when we talk about foreign policy that politics stops at  the water's edge.   This bill is a very important bill. It is a great example of what we  can produce when we work across the aisle, and I am glad we are getting  it across the finish line before we wrap up our work this month.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote, and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this measure.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Lieu of southern California, a  very valued member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, for his hard  work on this bill.   It is important, Mr. Speaker, that we modernize our agencies across  government to better deal with 21st century challenges.   The State Department is under constant threat of cyberattacks from  foreign actors bent on stealing our secrets, disrupting our foreign  policy, and undermining our security.   Just 8 days ago, it was reported that the State Department's email  system was breached. This time, whoever was behind the attack got ahold  of private information about State Department personnel. Who knows what  they will get their hands on next time.   Mr. Lieu's bill will help shore up the State Department against this  sort of intrusion. First of all, it requires the Secretary of State to  get out ahead of this problem. Instead of waiting for the next attack  to happen, this bill would mandate a plan for researchers to actively  seek out and report vulnerabilities.   Secondly, this bill launches a new initiative, a so-called bug bounty  program. This seeks to tap the expertise of everyday Americans by  rewarding citizens who uncover and report security risks in the  Department's computer system. It will also allow security researchers  and friendly hackers to find the cracks in the system so that the  Department can patch them.   This effort is modeled after a very successful program at the Defense  Department, which got off the ground in 2016. Since then, 1,400 people  have registered to participate, and they have found roughly 140  vulnerabilities.   Our Federal agencies should learn from one another. It is just common  sense to put this tested practice to work at the State Department and  elsewhere.   Mr. Speaker, I commend Mr. Lieu. I am glad to support this bill, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to yield 5 minutes to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Ted Lieu), the author of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close.   In closing, I want to again thank Mr. Lieu and Chairman Royce.   It seems to me, Mr. Speaker, that we have been caught flatfooted  before a range of new threats, including cyber attacks. Our agencies  have not done enough to root out vulnerabilities, and, frankly,  Congress hasn't done enough either to make sure our agencies across the  government have the tools they need to tackle these challenges.   I hope going forward we will be able to take a comprehensive look at  cyber threats and make sure the State Department, and all our  departments and agencies, are up to the task.   For now, this bill is a good step in the right direction. It  replicates an approach that has worked well over the last few years.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support it, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
