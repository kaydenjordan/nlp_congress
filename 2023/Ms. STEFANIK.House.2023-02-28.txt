 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the  House adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 9 a.m. tomorrow.    Madam Speaker, by direction of the House Republican  Conference, I send to the desk a privileged resolution and ask for its  immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 179         Resolved, That the following named Members be, and are       hereby, elected to the following standing committees of the       House of Representatives:        Committee on Agriculture: Mr. Bost (to rank immediately       after Mr. Bacon).        Committee on Science, Space, and Technology: Mr.       Fleischmann (to rank immediately after Mr. Obernolte), Mr.       Zinke (to rank immediately after Ms. Tenney).    Ms. STEFANIK (during the reading). Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous  consent to dispense with the reading.    Madam Chair, I rise today to urge my colleagues to  support my REIN IN Act.   During the past 2 years of one party, far-left, radical, socialist  Democrat rule in Washington led by President Joe Biden, inflation has  skyrocketed to the highest level in my lifetime. You talk to any  family, any small business, any farmer, any manufacturer, and they will  say that the inflation that they are suffering from is crippling their  businesses, crippling their family budgets.   It is a painful tax on every American and Bidenflation continues to  be the number one concern I hear today across my district in upstate  New York in the North Country.   In House Republicans' ``Commitment to America,'' our new House  majority, the people's House majority, promised to deliver and support  policies to ensure our economy is strong.   In fact, one of the main reasons we have this Republican House  majority is because the American people are smart. They know that the  historic inflation, the highest rate of inflation in my lifetime, is a  direct result of Joe Biden's executive orders and the trillions and  trillions of reckless and wasteful spending from single-party Democrat  rule.   In fact, in Joe Biden's first year in office, he issued more  executive orders than any President in my lifetime. This reckless, far- left agenda cost hardworking families more than $1 trillion in taxpayer  dollars and even more in the added cost of inflation. Whether it was  canceling the Keystone XL pipeline on his first day in office to  pushing his out-of-touch and costly Green New Deal regulations, Joe  Biden has fueled this inflation crisis and caused this inflation crisis  working with the previous radical, socialist Democrat majority.   By passing the REIN IN Act, House Republicans will demand  transparency for the American people by revealing just how much Biden's  executive orders are costing hardworking families and the painful  impact that has on inflation.   What are the Democrats so afraid of?   This is about transparency for the American people, and it is long  past time for Joe Biden to take into account this harmful impact of his  failed, far-left agenda.    Today, House Republicans are laser-focused on  fulfilling our commitment to America by reining in historic inflation,  historic Bidenflation, on behalf of hardworking American families and  small businesses, not just in my district, but across this great  Nation.
