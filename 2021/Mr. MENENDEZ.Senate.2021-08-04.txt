Transmittal No. 21-44    Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to Section                  36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act                             Annex Item No. vii         (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:        1. The Paladin M109A6 howitzer is the fifth product       improvement to the original M109 self-propelled howitzer. It       features improvements in the areas of survivability;       reliability, availability, and maintainability (RAM);       responsiveness; and terminal effects. The M109A6 is an       armored, full tracked howitzer carrying 37 complete       conventional rounds and two Copperhead projectiles and is       operated by a crew of four. It is designed with a new turret       structure that facilitates integration of the various turret       improvements and vulnerability reduction measures. It       improves overall crew compartment layout and space. The       howitzer can travel at a maximum speed of 38 miles per hour       and has a maximum cruising range of 186 miles. The M109A6 can       operate independently, on the move, it can receive a fire       mission, compute firing data, select and take up its firing       position, automatically unlock and point its cannon, fire and       move--all without external technical assistance. Firing the       first round following a move in under 60 seconds, a ``shoot       and scoot'' capability protects the crew from counterbattery       fire. The M109A6 is capable of firing up to four rounds per       minute to ranges of 30 kilometers. The M109A6 features       increased survivability characteristics such as day/night       operability, Nuclear, Biological, Chemical (NBC) protection       with climate control and secure voice and digital       communications. The crew remains in the vehicle throughout       the mission.        2. The Inertial Navigation Unit (INU) component provides       the vehicle with its own position location utilizing sensors       that continuously calculates its direction and velocity       without the continuous dependency of a GPS; the INU receives       GPS data from an external GPS receiver as an input when       available to provide better precision. The INU allows the       vehicle to more precisely calculate  [[Page S5823]]       its position to other components in the vehicle to improve       its functions and safety of use; these functions include       movement and maneuver of the vehicle, movement of the turret,       and pointing of the gun tube.        3. The Electronic Fire Control System (EFCS) commonly       referred to as the Paladin Fire Control System (PFCS) is the       major change for the Paladin M109A6 Howitzer from the manual       fire control system used on the M109A5. This gives the       howitzer the ability to operate over a widely dispersed area       and to move and emplace using the on board fire control       navigation and GPS system. The M109A6 can move and position       within an assigned position area, process technical firing       data, and fire a mission without relying on aiming circles       and wire lines. The M109A6 can change position more       frequently, an advantage against enemy fire. Such       advancements give new meaning to the artillery's ability to       move, shoot and communicate. In addition, the EFCS with       embedded electronic diagnostics improves maintenance and       repair functions by assisting in pinpointing faults.        4. The Defense Advanced GPS (Global Positioning System)       Receiver (DAGR) is a lightweight (less than 2 pounds) hand-      held or host platform-mounted, dual frequency (L1/L2),       Selective Availability Anti-Spoofing Module (SAASM) based,       Precise Positioning Service (PPS) device that receives and       decodes the L1 and L2 signals-in-space which are transmitted       by the NAVSTAR GPS satellite constellation. The DAGR provides       real-time positioning, velocity (ground speed), navigation,       and timing (PVNT) information, in stand-alone (dismounted)       and mounted (ground facilities, sea, air, and land vehicles)       configurations. The DAGR can support missions involving land-      based war-fighting and non-war fighting operations. The DAGR       can also be used as a secondary or supplemental aid to       aviation-based missions which involve operations in low-      dynamic aircraft, and as an aid to navigation in water-borne       operations.        5. The M1156 Precision Guidance Kit (PGK) is a Global       Positioning System (GPS) Guidance Kit with fuzing functions       for the M795 and M549A1 155mm High Explosive (HE) Artillery       Projectiles. The PGK corrects the ballistic trajectory of the       projectile to reduce delivery errors and thus improves       projectile accuracy. The PGK will effectively reduce target       delivery error of conventional artillery munitions and reduce       the number of projectiles required to execute a fire mission.        6. The 155mm M232A1 Propelling Charge (DODIC DA13), will be       used in M109 series howitzers. The Modular Artillery Charge       System (MACS) consists of two propelling charge module types,       the M231 and the M232/ M232A1, and their associated       packaging. The system is compatible with all current and       planned 155mm field artillery weapons.        7. The M82 Percussion Primer (DODIC N523) will be used in       M109 series howitzers.        8. The International Field Artillery Tactical Data System       is the international export version of the Army's Advanced       Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS). It provides       networked and fully automated support for the planning,       coordination, control, and execution of fires and effects       such as mortars, field artillery, rockets and missiles, and       close air support. International versions are developed for       each customer unique to the weapon and targeting systems in       their inventory.        9. Field Artillery Ammunition Support Vehicle (FAASV)       M992A2 this ammunition vehicle has no turret, but has a       taller superstructure to store 95 rounds with a corresponding       number of powders and primers. Until recently, much of the       remaining internal crew space was taken up by a hydraulically       powered conveyor system designed to allow the quick uploading       of rounds or their transfer to the M109-series howitzer.        10. Heavy Equipment Recovery Combat Utility Lift and       Evacuation System (HERCULES) Improved Recovery Vehicle--M88A2       recovers tanks mired to different depths removes and replaces       tank turrets and power packs, and uprights overturned heavy       combat vehicles. The main winch of the M88A2 is capable of a       70-ton, single-line recovery, allowing the HERCULES to       provide recovery of the 70-Ton M1A2 Abrams Tank.        11. The A-frame boom and hoist winch of the M88A2 can lift       35 tons. The spade can be used to anchor the vehicle when       using the main winch and can be used for light earth moving       to prepare a recovery area. The M88A2 employs an auxiliary       power unit to provide auxiliary electrical and hydraulic       power when the main engine is not in operation. It can also       be used to slave start other vehicles, as well as a means to       refuel or defuel vehicles. The M88A2 can refuel Abrams tanks       from its own fuel tank.        12. The Browning M2 is an air-cooled, belt-fed machine gun.       The M2 fires from a closed bolt, operated on the short recoil       principle. The M2 fires the .50 BMG cartridge, which offers       long range, accuracy, and immense stopping power.        13. The highest level of classification of defense       articles, components, and services included in this potential       sale is SECRET.        14. In a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain       knowledge of the hardware and software elements, the       information could be used to develop countermeasures or       equivalent systems, which might reduce system effectiveness       or be used in the development of a system with similar or       advanced capabilities.        15. A determination has been made that the recipient can       provide substantially the same degree of protection for the       sensitive technology being released as the U.S. Government.
