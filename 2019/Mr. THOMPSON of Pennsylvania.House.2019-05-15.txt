 Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak  [[Page H3796]]  about an organization that is near and dear to my heart: the Lions  Clubs International.   I am a member of my hometown organization, the Howard Area Lions  Club. The Howard Area Lions Club has consistently earned the  recognition as the largest Lions Club in Pennsylvania.   There are probably many factors that have led them to this, but none  more significant than their commitment to the Lions Club motto, ``We  Serve.''   The members of my club served as the chartering organization for the  Howard Boy Scout Troop 353; and, in the past, I was proud to serve as  Scoutmaster of that unit.   Simply put, service is of the utmost importance to the Lions. The  clubs are places where individuals can join together to give their  valuable time and effort to improving their communities and the world.   Where there is a need, there is a Lion. There are 1.4 million Lions  around the world, 47,000 Lions Clubs in more than 200 countries. For  more than 100 years, Lions have been serving humanity.   The idea of the Lions Club began in 1917. A 38-year-old Chicago  business leader named Melvin Jones told members of his local business  club that they should reach beyond business issues and address the  betterment of their communities and the world. They agreed.   Three years later, Lions Clubs became an international organization.  Melvin Jones inspired generations of people to become civic-minded  individuals, dedicated to using their talents and ambitions to improve  their communities without financial reward.   Melvin Jones had a personal code: ``You can't get very far until you  start doing something for somebody else.''   Madam Speaker, service to others is what makes the Lions Clubs  International such a powerful force for good in the world.   There are nearly 70 Members of Congress who are involved in service  organizations, and that is why I am proud to be working with my  colleague Congressman   Jimmy Panetta to establish the Congressional  Service Organization Caucus. We plan to launch the caucus soon.   It will support the many operations that are dedicated to giving back  to their communities. I encourage my colleagues to join because there  are few gifts greater than the gift of time and service to others.   Madam Speaker, Lions Clubs International is on Capitol Hill today to  raise awareness about how helpful service organizations are to  communities across the Nation.   I am grateful that Lions Clubs around the globe serve millions  annually, and I am so proud to be a member of an organization that not  only lives up to its remarkable ideals but exceeds them time and time  again.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, today is Peace Officers  Memorial Day, when we pay tribute to local, State, and Federal law  enforcement officers who serve and protect our communities.   Today is an extra special day for one of my constituents and his  family: Sugarcreek Police Sergeant Anthony Gorman, who was shot April  4, 1997, while investigating a suspicious car in a parking lot in  Franklin, Pennsylvania. He never fully recovered from his injuries.   In October of 2014, Sergeant Gorman died at the age of 72, more than  17 years after that initial gunshot. While his death was a direct  consequence of the 1997 shooting, a doctor listed his cause of death as  natural, which prevented him from being honored at the National Law  Enforcement Officers Memorial here in Washington, D.C.   His son, Christopher, then embarked on a mission to have his dad's  name  [[Page H3801]]  memorialized. After years of research, petitions, and advocacy, it is  now engraved at the East Pathway of Remembrance at section 25, line 31.   Sergeant Gorman's family was here this week for the candlelight vigil  held Monday on The Mall, and thanks to Christopher Gorman's  determination, his dad's name is finally where he belongs.                            ____________________
