 Madam Speaker, I thank my fellow naval  aviator from Virginia for this precious time.   Madam Speaker, today I rise as a formal naval officer who is  concerned for our enlisted troops, and particularly our junior enlisted  troops within the Department of Defense, the soldiers, the sailors, the  airmen, the marines, the space guardians.   As a massive government rolls forward spending more and more and  gathering more and more debt, our enlisted troops continue to do the  tough  [[Page H1684]]  work of providing Americans their security blanket.   Just last night, we had nine Army soldiers killed in a tragic  training accident in a Black Hawk helicopter in Kentucky. They make  such great sacrifices on a daily basis, and our enlisted folks are  doing this work for almost no compensation.   When I reflect on just how little our junior enlisted ranks earn, I  am left begging the question, Madam Speaker, who is providing them with  their security? What lobbyist group is advocating for junior enlisted  personnel, who when they first join the military are making about  $23,000 a year?   Madam Speaker, I know you are familiar with this, having served your  country, but this is a pay table from the DOD for fiscal year 2023  showing what our enlisted troops make, and you can see when they first  join, they are actually making less than $21,000 a year. It is not  until they are actually above an E-3 with E-4 rank over 4 years, 5  years that they are actually above what we would consider minimum wage  of $15 an hour, or $32,000 a year.   It is about $11 per hour, what they are being paid right now for what  would be a normal 40-hour work week. In California, fast-food workers  start at $22 an hour. By the way, our troops, they are not usually  working 40-hour work weeks. As you know, they are working 60 to 80  hours per week, especially if they are on deployment.   I ask our fellow Americans and legislators to let that sink in. Let  it sink in that the starting wage of a McDonald's worker is twice that  of the starting wage of our junior enlisted troops. The McDonald's  worker, however, doesn't get his head shaved. He doesn't have some of  his rights and freedoms taken away. The McDonald's worker doesn't go on  deployments for 6 to 12 months at a time, and he doesn't put his life  on the line for his beautiful country during both peace time and  training operations. Twenty-two McDonald's workers a day don't take  their own lives by suicide each day. $11 per hour, that is what we pay  our troops.   A third of our troops, Madam Speaker, qualify for food stamps. Even  China is paying their enlisted troops more than we are.   Madam Speaker, who is making sure that our enlisted troops are  getting the resources that they need to provide for their family, not  just the financial resources but food, safe housing, daycare, schools  for their children, and jobs for their spouses? The DOD officers have  an organization called MOAA, or the Military Officers Association of  America.   The Pentagon has their top brass that come to the Hill and testify  asking to make sure that they get all the weapons they require to  maintain the pointy edge of the spear, but the sad fact remains that  the junior enlisted of our military remain largely unrepresented and  without a champion.   We wonder why we suffer from record-low recruitment, record-low  retention. Today's retention problem is tomorrow's recruiting crisis.  Pay and quality of life are the biggest drivers right now in our  challenges to retention.   Members of Congress--I have seen it for several years from both sides  of the aisle--have stood at these very podiums, thumping their chests  speaking about the 3 to 5 percent pay raises and they are taking care  of our troops. They say we are taking care of our troops. These are  record-high pay raises, they say. I guarantee you that is going to  happen again over the next several months. We are taking care of our  troops. We are giving them record-high pay.   It is a bunch of crap.   In the midst of 7 to 8 percent inflation, and when your base pay is  only $22,000 a year, a 5 percent increase is only about $90 a month.  That is easily swallowed up in your first trip to the gas station.  Politicians can thump their chest and try to make themselves feel  better about themselves, but don't stand here and tell us that you are  taking care of the troops because for far too long the welfare of our  enlisted troops has gone without a shepherd in Congress and without  leadership in the Pentagon and without a true champion.    There have been freebie talking points that are easy to see, but they  are being masked by anemic and hollow actions from flag officers and  politicians the same, and that ends now, Madam Speaker.   Last year, my Military Spouse Licensing Relief Act passed both  Chambers of Congress and was signed into law by the President in  January. I am grateful for that. It helped about 140,000 Active-Duty  families. This law requires all 50 States to recognize the professional  licenses of Active-Duty spouses. If they are a nurse, a teacher, a real  estate agent, cosmetologist, their licenses are now recognized across  State lines when our Active-Duty families get orders to a new State.   To our troops and their spouses throughout the Nation, if you are  currently having any push back from credentialing boards or licensing  boards in your State, wherever you are stationed, and they are not  recognizing your license and you are the spouse of an Active-Duty  member, please call my office. Work with your commanding officer, but  call my office, and we will help you to make sure that your rights are  adhered to and honored and that your license is honored, as well. This  is the law of the land, and you have rights now in this regard.   Madam Speaker, I am proud of that achievement from last session, but  this session has to be focused on base pay, especially for our junior  enlisted. I have introduced a bill that ensures that the DOD minimum  base pay salary is $31,200. This figure gets an E-1 up to parity with  every other industry in the Nation where $15 per hour is the generally  accepted minimum wage. This $31,200 represents about a 50 percent  increase to base pay for enlisted personnel. While that may sound high,  we have to remember how low the starting point is.   This will save us money by needing fewer recruitment bonuses and  fewer retention bonuses after they join the military.   Our Nation's most precious asset or our most potent weapon is our  troops, the Active-Duty men and women in uniform and, specifically, the  workhorses of our DOD forces, the enlisted personnel.   We can have Stealth bombers, nuclear submarines, intercontinental  ballistic missiles, sexy fighter jets, hypersonic weapons, and the most  advanced satellites up in space, but on our current recruitment and  retention trajectory, we will still lose a war against a peer threat  like China. We will still lose a two-front war against near-peer  adversaries.   With the most lethal arsenal in the world, we are still not secure  unless we take care of our troops. I will not stand at this podium or  any other and feign support for big bills that provide small support  for our troops. I won't do it. Our military, it begs for inspiration  and for a mission. It craves leadership and it thrives on patriotism.   Our enlisted troops, they will literally climb mountains, they will  move mountains, and they will give their life in defense of our way of  life, but they won't complain about their pay because they are noble  warriors. They are humble warriors.   As a Nation, we must reestablish our dominance on the global stage, a  position, frankly, that we lost in the wake of the Afghanistan debacle.   The gap between pay for our troops and their civilian counterparts  right now is at an all-time high. All the while, China has closed the  gap against the United States in several domains.   We need some wins under our belt when it comes to national security  and readiness and taking care of our troops. The men and women in fancy  suits in this Chamber and the Chamber just 600 feet north of here, they  need to do the right thing for our troops wearing the military  uniforms, not in 5 years, not in 1 year, but this year.   The Commander in Chief just 1.6 miles to the west should support us  in this endeavor. I am willing to provide him the tools necessary to do  it myself, if needed, but $31,000 is a doable do for base pay for our  enlisted, and it is necessary.   It is imperative that as we craft the National Defense Authorization  Act, or the NDAA, and also write the defense appropriation bills, that  we are adequately addressing the pay and the welfare of our troops and  that we do so very soon this year.   I commit to our enlisted personnel that I will remain your champion  in  [[Page H1685]]  Congress until we get this right. Your Nation has forgotten you and  neglected you for too long, and that ends this year.   God bless our troops.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
