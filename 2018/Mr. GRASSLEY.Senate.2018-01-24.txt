 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I come to the floor today to talk  about the Judiciary Committee, which I chair, about our important  oversight work, the investigative work, and to kind of concentrate on  the past year.   There are a lot of issues that need more sunlight and more scrutiny.  One of my key concerns is the loss of faith in the ability of the  Justice Department and the FBI to do their jobs free of partisan  political bias.   The American people are rightfully skeptical because of how the  Department and the FBI have handled the following subjects: on one  hand, Hillary Clinton, and on the second hand, Donald Trump and his  associates. Hiding from tough questions about these controversial cases  is no way to reassure the public. If the Department is afraid of  independent oversight, that just reinforces people's suspicion and  skepticism. The only real way to reassure people is to let the sunshine  in and let the chips fall where they may. In each of these cases, the  government should obviously find out what happened and hold people  accountable if there was any wrongdoing, but it also has to play by the  rules and be held accountable for its actions as well. We need to shine  the light of day on all of it.   As part of our investigation, we have requested documents and other  information from the Department of Justice and the FBI. Much of that  information is classified. The Department has provided very limited  access to those classified materials. It has limited the Judiciary  Committee's review to the chair, this Senator; the ranking member of  the full committee, and that would be Senator Feinstein; and the  Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism, and that would be Senator Graham  and Senator Whitehouse. The government has also tried to severely limit  the number of appropriately cleared staff who can review documents and  even take notes.   We have reviewed some information related to whether the FBI used a  so-called Trump dossier and the extent of its relationship with its  author, Christopher Steele. As we know now, Mr. Steele was hired by  Fusion GPS to research Mr. Trump's alleged ties to Russia. His work was  funded by the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign.  Now, remember, it took a subpoena and a court battle with the House  Intelligence Committee to force that fact out into the open. Lawyers  for the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign  officials denied it to the press for months. In other words, they lied.  The founder of Fusion GPS denied that his firm was ``Democratically  linked.'' That, too, was untrue.   When the news finally broke, New York Times reporters actually  complained that people who knew better had flat-out lied to them about  who funded Mr. Steele's dossier. But back before the 2016 election, it  is unclear who knew that Steele was gathering dirt on Trump for the  Democratic National Committee and for the Clinton campaign. Many of his  sources for claims about the Trump campaign are Russian Government  officials. So Steele, who was working for Fusion GPS, who in turn was  working for the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign,  was also working with the Russians. So who was actually colluding with  Russians? It is becoming more clear.   Mr. Steele shared his at least partially Russian-based allegations  far and wide. He shared them with the FBI. He shared them with the  media. According to public reports, he shared them with high-ranking  officials in the Justice Department and the State Department.   In the course of our review, Senator Graham of South Carolina and I  came across some information that just does not add up. We saw Mr.  Steele swearing one thing in a public libel suit against him in London,  England, and then we saw contradictory things in documents that I am  not going to talk about in an open setting here. I know everybody  understands that. From everything we have learned so far, Senator  Graham and I believe these discrepancies are significant. So we sent a  referral of Christopher Steele to the Justice Department and the FBI  for potential violations of 18 U.S.C. 1001.   I guess people are going to say whatever they want to say about this  whole matter no matter what the facts are, but it doesn't contribute  anything meaningful to the public debate to ignore those facts or to  speculate wrongly about Senator Graham's motivations, or mine.   First, despite all the hubbub, this is not all that unusual. Anyone  can ask for a criminal investigation. I have done it in the past when I  have come across potential crimes in the course of my oversight work,  and I have done so publicly. This situation is no different.   Second, as the special counsel has reminded us all recently, lying to  Federal officials is a crime. It doesn't matter who is doing the lying,  politics should have nothing to do with it.   I have said repeatedly that I support Mr. Mueller's work and I  respect his role. I still do. Nothing has changed. I think it ought to  be said again in case anyone missed it. The special counsel  [[Page S487]]  should be free to complete his work and to follow the facts wherever  they lead, but that doesn't mean that I can ignore what looks like  false statements. If an individual sees what might be evidence of a  crime, he or she should report that to law enforcement so it can be  fully investigated. That is exactly what Senator Graham and I did. That  does not mean that we have made up our minds about what happened. It is  possible that Mr. Steele told the truth and the other, contradictory  statements that we saw were wrong. But, just as any court would do, we  start by assuming that government documents are true until we see  evidence to the contrary. If those documents are not true and there are  serious discrepancies that are no fault of Mr. Steele's, then we have  another problem--an arguably more serious problem.    Of course, even aside from these inconsistencies, the public reports  about the way the FBI may have used the dossier should give everyone in  this Chamber pause. Director Comey testified in 2017 that the dossier  was ``salacious and unverified.'' If it was unverified in 2017, then it  had to be unverified in 2016 as well. So it was a collection of  unverified opposition research funded by a political opponent in an  election year. Would it be proper for the Obama administration--or, for  that matter, any administration--to use something like that to  authorize further investigation that intrudes on the privacy of people  associated with its political opponents? That should bother civil  libertarians of any political stripe.   Now, I wish I could speak more openly about the basis of our referral  and other concerns, but right now that information is largely  classified. That information is controlled by the Justice Department.  As I said, the Department has permitted only the chair and ranking  member of the full Judiciary Committee, the chair and ranking member of  the Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism of the Judiciary Committee, and  a limited number of their cleared staff to see the underlying  documents. I have been pushing for the Department to provide the same  access to other Judiciary Committee members and their appropriately  cleared staffs, but the Department refuses to provide that access or  even to brief the other members on the underlying information.   Fortunately, the Department has agreed that it has no business  objecting to our members reviewing our own work, so I have encouraged  our committee members and their appropriately cleared staff to do just  that--review that work. Look at the memo that Senator Graham and I sent  to the Deputy Attorney General and the FBI Director. Members can then  make up their own minds about what Senator Graham and I have concluded.   I have also encouraged them to review the committee's transcripts and  other unclassified materials that have been available to them and their  staffs for a long period of time now--many months.   Finally, I have encouraged them to let me know if they believe that  any of that information should be made public. I believe in  transparency. We may agree that certain information should be released  at the appropriate time, with care to preserve classified information  and the integrity of any investigation. I have already been pushing the  Department to review the classified referral memorandum to confirm the  memo's classification markings so that we can release the unclassified  portions as soon as possible. But now the Department has deferred to  the FBI, and the FBI is falsely claiming that three of our unclassified  paragraphs--each contains the same, single classified fact. Now, that  really surprised me because these particular paragraphs are based on  nongovernment sources and do not claim to repeat or confirm any  information from any government document.   Even if these portions of our referral did reference the allegedly  classified fact at issue, it is hard to understand why that fact should  be classified.   First, the Deputy Attorney General has discussed the fact at issue  with me more than once in an unsecure space and on an unsecure phone  line. That ought to tell us something.   Second, the FBI is not acting as if this information would harm  national security if released. The FBI never notified the entities  copied on the memo's transmittal--for example, including the inspector  general and the Intelligence Committees--to ensure that fact was  protected as classified. If the FBI really believed this fact was  classified, then the FBI and the Department should take better care to  act consistent with that belief.   Unfortunately, I suspect something else is really going on. It sure  looks like a bureaucratic game of hide the ball rather than a genuine  concern about national security.   I am pressing this issue with Director Wray, and I hope we can  provide this information to the public as soon as possible. In fact,  just this morning, I took a long period of time to handwrite a letter  to Christopher Wray, the Director of the FBI, to let him know these  very concerns. It has been scanned to him, and I hope people make sure  he gets it because I am not sure he always gets my letters, handwritten  or typed.   I also believe that the Department should carefully review the entire  memorandum and begin an orderly process to declassify as much of that  information as possible.   The Intelligence Committee in the House of Representatives recently  voted to allow all House Members to review a short memo summarizing  what it has learned. Senators are not allowed to see what the House  Members know. However, House Members who have seen it have been calling  for a vote to release that memo.   Here in the Senate, the Senate Judiciary Committee has access to the  same information that the House Intelligence Committee saw before  drafting its summary memo. Our committee does not have the same  authority to release classified information that the House committee  has. We have to rely on the agency to review and potentially declassify  our memo.   Based on what I know, I agree that as much of this information should  be made public as soon as possible through the appropriate process--and  I don't just mean the summary memos. The government should release the  underlying documents referenced in those memos after deleting any  national security information that needs to be protected.   But most of this story can be told, and the part that can be told  should be told. The American people deserve the truth. Stale, recycled  media spin from journalists and pundits who do not have all the facts  is not enough. The country is filled with frenzy and speculation, but  the people are very hungry for facts. However, I cannot release this  information on my own, and neither should anyone else. Classified  information is controlled by the executive branch. We should work  together to achieve the greater transparency while still protecting  legitimately sensitive national security information.   Madam President, I yield the floor.
