 Madam Speaker, I had the honor of hosting our  Vice President Kamala Harris in my district as part of the  Congressional Hispanic Caucus On the Road series just this week.   Together with our Caucus chair, Nanette Barragan, we delved into  critical issues, such as reproductive rights, mental health, gun  violence, small businesses, and the challenges ahead impacting Latinos  in Texas and across America.   This visit also provided a platform to discuss the remarkable  programs achieved under the leadership of the Biden-Harris  administration, emphasizing the positive impact on our Latino  community.   As we reflect on the progress achieved, we are reminded that there is  yet still so much work to do, and that every issue is a Latino issue.   Our commitment to advancing the well-being of the Latino community  remains steadfast, and we are determined to tackle the challenges  ahead, putting people over politics. As I always say, ``si se puede,''  ``yes, we can.''                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, the beginning of so many great  American stories is built around starting a small business in your  family name, becoming a foundation in your local community--making it  in America.   Small businesses are major drivers of wealth creation in our overall  economy. They account for two-thirds of net new jobs and nearly half of  our U.S. economic activity.   For many of them, that dream starts with going to a bank and getting  a small business loan. For many Americans, the sound of their name, the  color of their skin, the language that they speak or who they love can  doom that dream if a bank says that they are at risk.   This isn't hypothetical. I, too, was born and raised in south Texas.  I can tell you that when I go home and I see some businesses that have  closed, I ask my family whether it was due to the pandemic, or no  demand for the cost of services that they had. I am told that they just  had trouble with finances and they couldn't get a loan.   In some small rural areas, because I did grow up in rural south  Texas, there aren't credit unions everywhere like there are in the city  of Houston where I live now. In the city of Houston, many small  businesses during the pandemic in round one couldn't even get a PPP  loan. We had to go in and do a carve-out to literally force the banks  to provide loans to small businesses.   I am glad that one of my colleagues was openhearted and gave people a  lot of loans. I just hope that that included some to minority small  businesses.   Madam Speaker, this is real. It is not hypothetical. We know that  minority-owned small businesses were less likely to receive a loan  during the pandemic compared to White firms.    Regrettably, Madam Speaker, racism and  discrimination flourish in the darkness. We need to shine a light and  allow the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to make lending more  transparent.   Madam Speaker, a transparent market will be a competitive market.  With transparency in lending, banks are driven to compete and offer  better terms.   With this resolution, extreme MAGA Republicans are protecting the  secret discriminatory practice of banks and lenders. Repealing this  rule would harm all those who stand to benefit.   We want to put profits over people. We want to put light over  darkness.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote against this resolution.
