 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6411, as amended, the  Support The Resiliency of Our Nation's Great, STRONG, Veterans Act.   This bill would improve VA's mental health and suicide prevention  strategies by doing a number of things. It would expand the Vet Center  workforce, and it would also allow student veterans the opportunity to  seek counseling at Vet Centers during what can be yet another stressful  time in that period of transitioning into civilian life.                                time  1315    Additionally, the bill would allow family members of veterans who  died by suicide to seek bereavement counseling at Vet Centers. This  support, from counselors who know veterans and the challenges that  their families often face, would be a valuable resource for those in  mourning.   This bill would expand training, scholarship, and loan repayment  programs for the VA mental health providers. It would direct a series  of actions to improve the Veterans Crisis Line, including enhanced  training and oversight. It would codify an existing VA program that  reaches out to veterans in their first year out of the military to  provide them with information about relevant resources.   This bill would require VA to conduct numerous studies with the goals  of improving care for veterans with sleep disorders, refining inpatient  care for veterans struggling with addiction, identifying treatments for  veterans suffering from both mental health and substance use disorders,  and assessing the possible secondary impacts PTSD and depression may  have on veterans' families.   This bill is the product of bipartisan, bicameral negotiations  between the Veterans Affairs' Committee leaders. I thank Chairman  Takano for working with me to introduce this bill and move it forward  today.   I thank Senate colleagues Chairman Tester and Ranking Member Moran  for their work on this bill.   This bill contains many provisions that were in standalone bills  introduced by many of our other Members, and I recognize them today. I  send a particular thank-you to Dr. Murphy, Congressman Rouzer, and to  two of my fellow committee members, veterans themselves, Dr. Miller- Meeks and Congressman Ellzey. Each of them spearheaded vital pieces of  this legislation that will help veterans and their families thrive for  years to come.   I encourage any veteran listening to this who is struggling and in  need of support to contact the veterans hotline by calling 1-800-273- 8825 and pressing 1. Once again, that is 1-800-273-8825 and pressing 1.  Or you can also get there by texting 838255. That is 838255. Or you can  actually visit the Veterans Crisis Line at veteranscrisisline.net, all  one word.   There is absolutely no shame in asking for help if you need it.   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  North Carolina (Mr. Murphy), my good friend.    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 2 minutes to the  gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Murphy).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  North Carolina (Mr. Rouzer).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   First off, I say thank you to all the people who have worked on this  important piece of legislation for the support that it is has received.   The important thing is that we get the care, treatment, and support  for all the veterans who are considering suicide and the families who  suffer from the fact that they have done it.   Madam Speaker, I encourage all of my colleagues to support this bill,  and I yield back the balance of my time.
