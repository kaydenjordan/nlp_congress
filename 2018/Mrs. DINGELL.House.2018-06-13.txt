 Mr. Speaker, I rise to share with my colleagues the  crisis facing families across the country whose fear is growing daily  about their healthcare.   This week, I took John to the doctor, and so many people stopped us,  it ended up being an unscheduled town hall meeting.   A 50-year-old woman who had had a stroke last year, who was now  walking and talking, scared to death that she would lose her insurance  and about what she would do.   A mother of an 8-year-old who has juvenile diabetes crying and  saying: What am I going to do? I don't know how I will afford it, or if  her life could even end.   There were 10 more stories that morning. This isn't a war of words.  These are real people with real consequences, and, for some, it is a  matter of life and death. They are depending on all of us. We must come  together.   So many of my colleagues said: ``We will never go back to the days  that people would be denied insurance because of preexisting  conditions.'' Let's work together to help people who need us.                            ____________________
