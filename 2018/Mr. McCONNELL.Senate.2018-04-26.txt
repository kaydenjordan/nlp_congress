 Mr. President, this week we confirmed yet another  well-qualified nominee to the Federal bench. Now Kyle Duncan of  Louisiana can get to work serving on the Fifth Circuit Court of  Appeals. His qualifications are truly impressive, but his sterling  reputation among colleagues and peers was an even greater testament to  Mr. Duncan's fitness. I am glad that the Fifth Circuit will benefit  from his expertise.   Speaking of well-qualified nominees, the Senate will vote today on  the President's choice for Secretary of State. We will consider an  outstanding nominee. Fortunately, we have the votes, and later today we  will confirm Mike Pompeo as our Nation's 70th Secretary of State.   We have been discussing Director Pompeo's abundant qualifications all  week. In a little over a year, the Senate has had two opportunities to  assess his considerable qualifications.   Last January, a bipartisan supermajority of us saw fit to confirm him  as CIA Director, and his performance in that role--exemplary by all  accounts--has given us even more compelling cause to confirm him to  serve as our chief diplomat.   He has earned the trust and the confidence of the Commander in Chief  by providing top-notch counsel on critical issues and helping to lead  ongoing efforts to lay the groundwork for negotiations aimed at  denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula. Along the way, he deepened his  reputation for fairness and discernment.   I am glad President Trump has nominated this distinguished leader to  be America's chief diplomat, and I am glad a bipartisan majority of  Senators will vote to confirm him today.   It is just too bad that Director Pompeo's confirmation process has  offered such a prime example of the historic partisan obstruction that  my colleagues across the aisle are visiting on the Senate. All fair  observers agree that Mike is up to the job. Here is how the Washington  Post--not known as a bastion of Republican thinking--titled their  editorial, simply: ``Confirm Mike Pompeo.''   But despite all this, Democrats on the Foreign Relations Committee  almost took the unprecedented step of voting him out with an  unfavorable recommendation. That attempt to play politics with our  Nation's security fortunately failed. But even so, according to the  Senate Historian, he became just the second Secretary of State nominee  in recent memory to clear a committee by a margin of only one vote. The  only other time that has happened in all of the Senate's history was  also at the hands of Senate Democrats during the Trump administration.  Once they got here on the floor, they were also the only two Secretary  of State nominees in history who needed cloture to receive confirmation  votes.   Let me say that again. From the founding of the Republic until 2017,  the Senate never required cloture to confirm a Secretary of State. Now  we are at two, both in this administration. I guess Senate Democrats  are in a history-making mood, because over the past 15 months, they  have embarked on a partisan campaign to block, obstruct, and delay  President Trump's nominees that is, quite simply, without precedent in  American history.   Let's put things in perspective. In the first 2 years of the last 6  Presidencies combined--the first 2 years of the last 6 Presidencies  combined--the Senate subjected nominees to a total of 24 cloture votes  during the last 6 Presidencies during the first 2 years--24 cloture  votes.   Add up President Carter's first 2 years, President Reagan's first 2  years, and so on, through Presidents Bush, Clinton, Bush, and Obama and  there are 24 total cloture votes on nominees.   For President Trump? There are 88 and counting, just 15 months into  his term. By the end of the day, it will be 90--90 cloture votes on  nominees. This is partisan obstruction elevated to an art form, and  every one of us has seen it firsthand.   It is not just high-profile nominations. Scores of unobjectionable  choices for all kinds of posts have languished on the Senate calendar.  It took  [[Page S2448]]  months and months and several deadly accidents to persuade Senate  Democrats to stop obstructing a fully qualified nominee to lead the  Federal Railroad Administration.   Or take the example of district court judges. With only one  exception, we have had to file cloture on every single district court  nominee. It doesn't matter if every Democrat on the Judiciary Committee  supported the nominee. It doesn't matter if every Democrat in the whole  Senate supports the nominee. No matter what, our colleagues across the  aisle are insisting on obstruction, for no apparent reason.   Here are some of the final vote totals for these district judges: 96  to 1; 98 to 0; 97 to 3; 95 to 0; 96 to 0; 98 to 0, once again; 100 to  0.   Back in January, it took more than a week of the Senate's time to  confirm four district court judges, and not one Senator voted no on any  of them--a whole week to do four district judges, and not one Senator  voted no on any of them.   Our problem is not the qualified personnel before us. Our problem is  that nearly half of the Senate has decided that resisting for the sake  of resistance is more politically advantageous than doing right by this  institution or by our constituents. This, regrettably, is where we are:  Democrats chewing up hours of Senate time on nominees that literally no  Senator opposes.   I understand that my friends on the other side have a number of  disagreements with the President. That tends to happen in politics, but  that is no excuse at all for this historic obstruction of  noncontroversial nominees. It is bad for the Senate. It is unfair to  the American people.   That is why I support Senator Lankford's efforts to enact the very  same rules change--the very same rules change--that a large and  bipartisan majority agreed to back in 2013, when the Democrats were in  the majority here in the Senate. It would empower the Senate to process  nominations more quickly while preserving ample opportunity for debate.  It is precisely the rules change that my friend the Democratic leader  supported back in 2013. I joined in that bipartisan effort, along with  a number of my fellow Republicans. It passed 78 to 16--78 to 16. The  White House may have changed hands, but the last time I checked, fair  is still fair, and common sense is still common sense.   So Senator Lankford is giving my Democratic colleagues their very own  chance to show that principled convictions matter more than political  convenience. I am proud to back his proposal. I am glad to see the  Rules Committee advance it to the floor yesterday. There is no reason  why every Senator shouldn't be able to join us.   Otherwise, until our Democratic colleagues put aside their historic  obstruction, Republicans continue to do our duty and process the  President's nominations, one way or the other. Let me repeat that. We  are processing these nominations, one way or the other.   After Mike Pompeo, I filed cloture on Ric Grenell's nomination to  serve as Ambassador to Germany. We will vote on this confirmation later  this afternoon.   So why don't we turn over a new leaf together and start rebuilding  the comity and customs that ought to define our work here.   Just yesterday, the Rules Committee held a very productive meeting  that took a step in that direction. Colleagues from both sides of the  aisle took a serious look at what we can do as a body to more  efficiently fulfill our responsibilities in the appropriations process.  That follows on a productive meeting I had with the Democratic leader,  the Appropriations chairman, and the ranking member a few days ago.   So I am hopeful about the prospects of moving forward together. We  need to keep this momentum going and extend it--not just to  appropriations but to nominations. This Congress has already made great  progress implementing a pro-growth, pro-opportunity agenda for the  middle-class, including historic tax relief for families and small  businesses, but there is a lot more to do.   That is how the Senate should be spending our time--exchanging ideas  and fighting for the American public.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.

Mr. President, this resolution concerns a pro se civil action filed  in Maine Federal court against two employees of Senator King's office  regarding claims arising out of volunteer assistance the pro se  plaintiff provided to that office. The District Court, on its own  initiative, dismissed the lawsuit without needing to hear from the  defendants, and the plaintiff has filed a notice of appeal.   This resolution would authorize the Senate Legal Counsel to represent  the Senate employees in that appeal in order to seek dismissal of the  appeal or affirmance of the lower court's dismissal of this suit.                            ____________________     Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Judiciary Committee be discharged from further consideration of and the  Senate now proceed to the consideration of S.
