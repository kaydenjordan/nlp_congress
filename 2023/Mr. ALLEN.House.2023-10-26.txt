 Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment, which  would prohibit funding for plutonium pit production at the Savannah  River Site. I appreciate my friend from California's concern of cost.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment, which  would prohibit funding for plutonium pit production at the Savannah  River Site. My friend mentioned the cost overruns, and I appreciate his  concern with that.   Let me tell you. I spent 40 years in the construction business. In  the last 2 years, concrete has doubled in price, steel has doubled in  price, and there is a lot of concrete and steel in plutonium. We do  need to deal with the inflation we are seeing out there.   The Savannah River Site, also known as SRS, is a Department of Energy  site conducting important work to defend our national security, and  Georgia's 12th District is home to approximately 30 percent of the  workforce.    Currently under construction at the Savannah River Site is the  Savannah River Plutonium Processing Facility. Required by law, this is  part of a two-site strategy with Los Alamos National Laboratory and the  Savannah River Site tasked with producing plutonium pits to help  improve resiliency and mitigate risk in the United States' pit  production. Let me say that again: to mitigate risk in the United  States' pit production.   This shortsighted amendment would critically threaten this urgent  national security mission. The Savannah River Site is committed to  nuclear modernization to ensure America's nuclear  [[Page H5113]]  deterrent is safe and reliable. To say otherwise is simply not true.   Mr. Chair, I urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment.
