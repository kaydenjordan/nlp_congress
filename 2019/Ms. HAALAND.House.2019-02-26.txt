 Mr. Speaker, as a 35th-generation New Mexican, I rise  today in support of S. 47. This bill represents a major victory for  conservation, and I want to congratulate the chairman and his co- drafters on its success.   In my home State of New Mexico, new protections in the Organ  Mountains, the Cerros del Norte, and San Juan County will add over  250,000 acres of new wilderness, the highest conservation protection  this Congress can bestow.   These lands will preserve our ecosystems, protect access to clean,  consistent water flows, and help our State to begin to adapt to the  realities of climate change.   By permanently authorizing the Land and Water Conservation Fund, S.  47 will help my home State and every State in this Nation, and I  strongly encourage my colleagues to vote ``yes.''
