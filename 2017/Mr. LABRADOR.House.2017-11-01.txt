 Mr. Chairman, the Resilient Federal Forests Act  contains many provisions that will give the Forest Service additional  tools to better manage our national forests.   To keep our forests healthy and productive, we must ensure we have  skilled loggers to safely work in those forests. I thank Representative  Westerman for including my bill, the Future Logging Careers Act, in his  bill that is on the floor today.   My bill will allow 16- and 17-year-olds to learn the logging business  by working in family-owned mechanized logging operations under the  supervision of their parents. That will allow the next generation of  loggers to learn valuable skills, prepare to take over family  businesses, and provide the wood products needed to support our  economy.   I learned of the need for this bill after meeting two Idaho loggers  from third-generation logging families, Tim Christopherson from Idaho  County and Tom Mahon from Adams County.   Mahon's 16-year-old son, J.T., was working under his father's  supervision when a Forest Service employee sent him home. J.T. couldn't  work in the woods because logging doesn't have an exemption that has  long been enjoyed by family farms under the Fair Labor Standards Act.   The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.    With help from the families and the Associated Logging  Contractors of Idaho, we crafted a solution that is good for families,  good for rural America, and good for the American economy.   I am grateful for the bipartisan effort on this legislation, and I  urge my colleagues to support the bill.   Mr. Chairman, I include in the Record a letter from the National Wild  Turkey Federation and a letter from the National Association of  Counties, Western Interstate Region, in support of H.R. 2936.                                National Wild Turkey Federation,                                       Edgefield, SC, June 26, 2017.      Hon. Rob Bishop,      Chairman, Natural Resources Committee,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Raul Grijalva,      Ranking Democrat, Natural Resources Committee, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Bishop and Representative Grijalva: On behalf       of the National Wild Turkey Federation (NWTF) and its 230,000       members, we urge you to take swift Committee action on H.R.       2936 the Resilient Federal Forest Act of 2017. The NWTF is a       leader in wildlife habitat conservation in North America and       is dedicated to the conservation of the wild turkey and       preservation of our hunting heritage. We are currently       working towards our 10-year Save the Habitat. Save the Hunt       initiative in which we aim to conserve or enhance 4 million       acres of critical habitat, recruit 1.5 million hunters and       open 500,000 acres for outdoor enjoyment        Active forest management is crucial to establishing healthy       and sustainable forests and decisions for forest management       should be based on sound science. As such, the common sense       solutions offered in H.R. 2936 are imperative to the health       and future of our nation's forests and important to the NWTF       to help achieve our objectives. In total, H.R. 2936 has many       reasonable solutions to the challenges that the managing       agencies face to increase the pace and efficiency of active       forest management on our nation's federal lands. We take this       opportunity to highlight those solutions that we believe will       make the most immediate difference and offer recommendations       as to how we believe the bill can be further improved.        We support increased availability for Categorical       Exclusions (CE) in order to deal more effectively and       efficiently with threats like pests and disease and for       addressing urgent wildlife needs like critical habitat for       endangered species. We are especially supportive of the CE       that will allow for activities that enhance early       successional forests for wildlife habitat. Unlike some       critics of CEs who will suggest, they do not exempt the       action from the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA),       rather they apply the NEPA review to like or similar actions       to expedite the process. These are administered under Council       on Environmental Quality regulations and other guidance.       Increased use of CEs is one of the best opportunities we have       in the short term to increase the pace of active forest       management.        Funding the cost of fighting catastrophic wildfires outside       of the agency budget is paramount to the agency's ability to       deliver on other aspects of their mission. We are supportive       of a fix that will allow catastrophic wildfires to be       considered a disaster. Until agencies are freed from the       burden of fighting catastrophic wildfires through their       annual budgets we will be unable to make meaningful progress       towards proactive forest management. We recommend capping the       firefighting budget at the current 10-year average to protect       further erosion of the U.S. Forest Service budget in other       important mission delivery areas.        We support the bill's provisions for large scale       reforestation on fire-impacted lands. While public input and       review is essential to public lands management, currently it       can result in delayed action and result in an inability to       accomplish the necessary objectives. We believe the deadlines       set for plan development and public input, as well as the       prohibition on restraining orders and preliminary injunctions       strike a reasonable balance. We recommend that this provision       of the bill clarify that proper ecological restoration is       allowed as a mechanism to salvage forests post catastrophic       events as reforestation may not always be the best action for       the ecological good.        The NWTF strongly supports arbitration as an alternative to       litigation. This will conserve valuable U.S. Forest Service       resources and expedite work getting done on the ground.       Additionally, we support the provision that does not allow       plaintiffs challenging a forest management activity to       receive any award or payment obligated from the Claims and       Judgment Fund.        We support the approach for allowing evaluation of only       action/no-action alternatives for collaborative Forest Plans,       Resource Advisory Committee and Community Wildfire Protection       Plan projects. Limiting the number of alternatives will       expedite the development of environmental assessments and       allow work to get done on the ground more quickly. We also       support the requirement to look at consequences of a no-      action alternative as a no-action decision would still have       an impact on the resource.        We understand budget concerns counties face and are       supportive of a portion of retained receipts from stewardship       contracts going to the counties. Stewardship Contracting is       an important tool for active forest management. Ultimately       this change will remove one impediment to utilizing       Stewardship Contracting and help garner support from the       counties. We recommend modifying this section to reflect that       payment should come only from retained receipts on completed       projects, versus strictly from timber value within ongoing       projects. This will maintain the ``exchange of goods for       services'' function of Stewardship Contracting while also       preserving the balance of timber dollars and the investment       of matching funds from organizations like the NWTF to expand       the scope and scale of projects, thus accomplishing more       active management and fire protection across the landscape       and within counties.        We appreciate the recognition of the importance of funding       planning activities for forest management. We are concerned       that the provision could potentially provide justification       for the U.S. Forest Service staff to refrain from fully       utilizing product value and  [[Page H8332]]       partner match dollars for on the ground work. While we feel       the 25% threshold is too high, the provision of allowing some       of the stewardship project revenues to cover the costs of       planning additional projects could be beneficial and       incentivize project planning.        We also appreciate the common-sense amendments to the       Endangered Species Act (ESA) that will improve the process of       protecting endangered and threatened species and their       habitat. The bill overturns the ``Cottonwood'' court       decision, which directs that if additional critical habitat       is designated under an approved Forest Plan or Resource       Management Plan, a section 7 programmatic re-consultation of       the entire Forest Plan needs to be done. The U.S. Fish and       Wildlife Service and the Obama Administration argued that the       section 7 consultation needs only to be done on the portion       of the project covering the additionally designated acreage       of critical habitat. The remedy in this bill will greatly       reduce the debilitating process that the federal court       decision directs. The bill also affirms current U.S. Fish and       Wildlife Service policy that no ESA section 7 consultation is       required if the U.S. Forest Service or Bureau of Land       Management determines through informal consultation that the       proposed action will not likely have an adverse affect on       species or critical habitat. We further support the 90 day       threshold on a CE established by this bill because it will       conserve agency resources and expedite management activities       on the ground.        We commend Congressman Westerman, the co-sponsors, and       Chairman Bishop for their dedication to restoring and       maintaining our federal forests under management informed by       science, and offering the appropriate reforms to management       practices. We respectfully urge that you expeditiously report       H.R. 2936 out of Committee and to the House floor.            Sincerely,                                              Rebecca A. Humphries,      Chief Executive Officer.                                   ____                                                      June 21, 2017.      Hon. Bruce Westerman,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Congressman Westerman: On behalf of the National       Association of Counties (NACo) the only organization       representing the nation's 3,069 counties, parishes, and       boroughs, and the Western Interstate Region (WIR), we write       to express support for H.R. 2936, the Resilient Federal       Forests Act of 2017. Thank you for your leadership in       introducing legislation to promote the active management of       our nation's federal lands and forests, reduce the risk of       catastrophic wildfire and promote collaborative approaches to       address natural resource management challenges.        The legislation will improve the health and wellbeing of       forest lands and forest communities by: promoting       collaboration and streamlining regulations for forest health       projects, protecting communities through wildfire risk       reduction, improving flexibility and fairness in forest       revenue sharing, and delegating the authority for Resource       Advisory Committees (RAC) appointments.   Promoting Collaboration and Streamlining Regulations for Forest Health                                  Projects         Counties believe that active management of federal lands       and forests must be done in a sustainable manner that ensures       the health of our federal lands for generations to come. One       way to help ensure a balanced approach to address natural       resource management challenges is by promoting locally driven       collaborative processes that promote consensus driven       decision making. Counties across the United States have       engaged in collaborative efforts to address their natural       resources challenges. By bringing a broad cross-section of       local stakeholders into collaborative processes, counties,       industry, outdoorsmen, conservationists and federal and state       land managers have built consensus on some of the most       complex natural resource management challenges.        By authorizing limited and reasonable categorical       exclusions for projects that improve forest health and have       been developed through consensus based collaborative       processes, H.R. 2936 builds upon these successes and provides       additional tools to help ensure that collaborative efforts       continue to work, accelerate and expand. Streamlining the       regulatory review of proposed forestry projects will increase       project implementation and the number of acres that are       treated.            Protecting Communities through Wildfire Risk Reduction         For the 26 percent of counties across the United States       that are home to federal forest lands, the health of our       national forests has a direct impact on the health and safety       of county residents. Healthy forests are less prone to       disease, insect infestation, and wildfire. While the causes       of catastrophic wildfire are complex, the status quo of       inaction has exacerbated present forest conditions, which now       present a great risk to both communities and the environment.       Your legislation would help to correct this by requiring the       costs and benefits of a proposed forest project be weighed       against the costs and benefits of doing nothing to address       wildfire threats, disease and insect infestation, and their       impacts on local water supply and wildlife habitat.        Provisions of the legislation expediting regulatory       analysis for timber salvage after major wildfires are also       crucial, and will provide the Forest Service with the revenue       it needs to execute critical and time-sensitive post-fire       reforestation work.        Providing Flexibility and Equitable Sharing of Forest Revenues         In addition to improving forest health and reducing       wildfire risk for forest communities, increased active       management will generate more revenue for the federal       treasury and critical services provided by counties, and       promote job creation and economic growth in counties across       the nation. According to the American Forest and Paper       Association, forest products industries account for 4% of       U.S. manufacturing GDP and over $50 billion annually in wages       for approximately 900,000 employees. These jobs provide a       direct economic impact to many rural and forest counties       across the country.        The growth in stewardship contracting in recent years has       shown that a market-driven approach to forest management       projects can work to achieve both forest management goals and       increased forest production. Counties support and are active       partners in stewardship contracting initiatives across the       United States. NACo and WIR support provisions of H.R. 2936       that authorize the equitable sharing of stewardship       contracting revenues with counties consistent with historic       practices. Forest revenue sharing payments support critical       county services such as transportation infrastructure and       education. America's counties look forward to working with       Congress to further strengthen forest revenue sharing between       counties and the federal government.        Since 2000, due to sharp declines in forest revenues, the       federal government has provided payments to forest counties       through the Secure Rural Schools (SRS) program. The SRS       program provides a critical safety-net for forest counties       impacted by declines in forest production and the loss of       forest jobs and it will continue to be a critical program       until the declines in forest production can be fully       addressed. H.R. 2936 reforms Title III of SRS that provide       much needed flexibility for counties to use a portion of SRS       funding to support law enforcement patrols and ensure county       first-responders have the equipment and training they need to       provide high-quality emergency services on forest service       land to county residents and the millions of public lands       visitors each year.       Delegating the Authority for Resource Advisory Committee (RAC)                                Appointments         Finally, counties support legislation to ensure rural       counties can actively coordinate with federal agencies       through flexibility in RAC membership and appointments. NACo       and WIR support allowing the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture       and U.S. Secretary of the Interior to delegate the authority       for appointing RAC members to agency leaders, such as       Regional Foresters or Bureau of Land Management State       Directors. Counties should be included in the development and       implementation of public lands management plans, and RACs       allow county leaders to actively participate in this process.       Your legislation would allow the Secretary to delegate RAC       appointment authority, and ensure locally-driven efforts to       better manage federal lands can begin in a timely manner.        NACo and WIR stand ready to work with you to promote       locally supported, consensus-driven solutions to address       management challenges, reduce the risk of catastrophic       wildfire, and increase economic activity on our federal       lands. NACo and WIR encourage swift passage of the Resilient       Federal Forests Act of 2017.            Sincerely,      Matthew D. Chase,        Executive Director, National Association of Counties.      Joel Bousman,        President, Western Interstate Region.
