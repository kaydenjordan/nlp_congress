 Mr. Speaker, from the North Atlantic to the  North Pacific, to the Baltic Seas, the Russian people are standing up  to Vladimir Putin and his decades of egregious corruption. The protests  in Moscow are punctuated with chants that Putin is a thief. And, of  course, the anticorruption protest leaders have been jailed. And our  President, the United States President, the leader of the free world,  says that he admires Putin's strongman ways.  [[Page H2707]]    Here is the rub that every American of every political persuasion  should be concerned with, and that every American family, millions of  whom have lost a soldier in defense of our democracy, should be  concerned with: Putin is trying to discredit the exact democracy that  millions of our brothers and sisters have died for. Putin is a thug and  a street punk. His attempt to hijack our democracy needs an aggressive  and honest, independent investigation.                            ____________________
