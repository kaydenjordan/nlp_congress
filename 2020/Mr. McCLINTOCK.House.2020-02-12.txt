 Madam Chair, when the Republicans were in the  majority, we set three overarching objectives for our Federal lands  policy: to restore public access to the public lands, to restore good  management to the public lands, and to restore the Federal Government  as a good neighbor to those communities impacted by the public lands.  This bill is the very opposite of these three policies.   The purpose of America's public lands was to set aside our most  beautiful tracts, in the words of the original Yosemite Charter, ``for  public use, resort, and recreation . . . for all time.''   The bill before us does exactly the opposite: It imposes severe  restrictions on the public's use of 2.5 million acres of their own  lands; 1.5 million acres would be put off limits to such innocent  things as mountain bikes and strollers; and it would remove roads to  reach campsites or even allow emergency equipment to access. It also  designates 843 additional miles of our rivers as wild and scenic.   Does anybody think that sounds good?   I can tell my colleagues that that designation on the Merced River in  my district has been used to close many traditional tourist amenities  at Yosemite Park, including swimming pools, raft and bike rentals,  horseback riding stables, and ice skating and lodging facilities.   ``Public use, resort, and recreation'' becomes ``Look, but don't  touch.''   The health and vitality of our forests depends on active scientific  forest management. That means carefully tending our forests to protect  them from morbid overcrowding, which, in turn, makes them vulnerable to  disease, pestilence, drought, and, ultimately, catastrophic wildfire.   Excess timber comes out of the forest in one of two ways: It is  either burned out or it is carried out. This bill makes good forest  management impossible by forbidding our foresters from using their  science to protect and groom and care for our forests by assuring that  trees have room to grow strong.   Finally, this bill ignores and insults the communities directly  affected by this massive Federal land grab. In case after case, local  elected officials, local governments, local fire districts, and local  residents in the nearby communities have formally, vigorously, and  vocally protested the draconian restrictions imposed by this measure  because they imperil public safety from fire, and they do wanton harm  to the local economies.   This bill reverses the three objectives set by House Republicans:   Instead of restoring public access to public lands, the Democrats  restrict and deny it;   Instead of restoring good management to the public lands, the  Democrats forbid it;   Instead of restoring the Federal Government as a good neighbor to  those communities impacted by the public lands, the Democrats give  those communities the finger.   What Obama said about elections having consequences, here it is in  real life.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, the Federal Government owns just seven- tenths of 1 percent of the State of New York. It owns 1.1 percent of  the State of Illinois. It owns just 1.8 percent of the entire State of  Texas. In fact, the Federal Government only owns one-fourth of  Washington, D.C.   But then go farther west, and you will see the problem. The Federal  Government owns and controls 62 percent of the State of Alaska, two- thirds of Utah, and four-fifths of the State of Nevada. It owns nearly  half of my home State of California. In one county in my district,  Alpine County, the Federal Government owns 96 percent.   People from the East have no idea what that means. That is all lands  that is off the local tax rolls. That is all land that carries  increasingly severe restrictions on public use and access, which means  it is generating very little economic activity for those regions.  Often, Federal ownership means the Federal land-use policies are in  direct contravention to the wishes of the local communities that are  entangled with it.   Now, when we Republicans held the majority, one of our Federal lands  objectives was to restore the Federal Government as a good neighbor to  those communities directly impacted by the Federal lands. The bill  before us does exactly the opposite. This bill adds 1\1/2\ million  acres of Federal land to wilderness restrictions, meaning you can't  even bring a stroller on these lands.   This land grab is strongly opposed by the local communities it would  directly affect. The Mesa County commission and Garfield County,  Colorado, oppose this bill because of concerns it will further restrict  public access and increase the risk of fire. The Congressman  representing those areas opposes the legislation.   Mr. Chair, 80 percent of Del Norte County in California is already  owned by the State and Federal Governments,  [[Page H1091]]  and their board of supervisors is protesting the further restriction of  public access to these lands, noting that these lands don't even meet  wilderness criteria.   Trinity County has also formally opposed the bill, yet we are plowing  ahead anyway. The Monrovia City Council protests the enormous economic  burdens this bill would place on their city. So, too, the Grays Harbor  County Commission and the city councils of Aberdeen and Cosmopolis in  Washington State beg us not to impose these restrictions on their  communities, and I could go on.   Representing the Sierra Nevada of California, I can tell you there  are no more fierce or knowledgeable guardians of our forests than the  people who live among them. My amendment simply restores the good  neighbor policy the Republicans practiced for many years. It simply  provides that wilderness restrictions cannot be imposed until the  county on which the land is located approves of them.   Mr. Chair, I would ask my Democratic colleagues to show a little  humility and a little mercy in exercising their power by listening to  the people most affected by their decisions and adopt this amendment.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I would simply ask the gentlewoman, if  it is true that local people affected by this bill actually support it,  then what does she have to fear from getting their approval? Her  opposition to this amendment puts the lie to her claim that the local  people support it and tells us she doesn't believe her own rhetoric.   Gifford Pinchot, the father of the U.S. Forest Service, propounded  maxims for good behavior by foresters. He said, among other things:         A public official is there to serve the public and not run       them.        Public support of acts affecting public rights is       absolutely required.        It is more trouble to consult the public than to ignore       them, but that is what you were hired to do.        Get rid of an attitude of personal arrogance or pride of       attainment of superior knowledge.    Mr. Chairman, this bill turns these maxims upside down.                                time  1345    It says to local residents: We know what's best for you and your  communities; your opinions are unimportant to us, your wishes are  irrelevant, and your voices are unheard. We're in charge and we'll damn  well do as we please.   I ask my Democratic colleagues to step back and consider how you  would react to a government that takes such an attitude as that.   My amendment simply asks the people and trusts the people. If we are  still a government of, by, and for the people, that is the least we can  do.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, when the Wilderness Act was adopted in  1964, it designated about 9 million acres; that is a little larger than  the State of Maryland. Over the years, that has ballooned to 111  million acres, a land area the size of California. This bill adds 1\1/ 2\ million acres more. That is the size of Delaware and half of Rhode  Island combined.   The restrictions in the wilderness areas are severe. You can't bring  a bicycle on these lands. You can't drive to a campsite.   The Wilderness Act provides for wilderness designation only for those  lands that are--and listen to this carefully--``an area where the Earth  and community of life are untrammeled by man, where man himself is a  visitor who does not remain'' and ``an area of underdeveloped Federal  land retaining its primeval character and influence, without permanent  improvements or human habitation, which is protected and managed so as  to preserve its natural conditions.''   Well, much of the land in this bill doesn't begin to meet these  criteria. The Department of the Interior, and the local communities  directly affected by this bill, are warning us that this  [[Page H1092]]  new Federal land grab includes acreage on which there are buildings and  roads, grazing and off-road vehicle trails, bicycle trails,  communication towers, small businesses, mines and oil wells.   Moreover, motorized and mechanized firefighting and fire suppression  equipment is currently allowed on these lands but would be severely  restricted if the land is designated as wilderness. All you can use in  a wilderness area, without special permission, is a handsaw, a shovel,  and an axe to fight a fire.   To include such acreage under the Wilderness Act makes a mockery of  its original intent and poses a direct threat to the tourism,  livelihoods, jobs, safety, and quality of life of the communities  adjacent to them.   Abraham Lincoln once told of the farmer who said: ``I ain't greedy  for land. All I want is what's next to mine.'' That appears to be the  new motto of the Democrats, and it is having a devastating impact on  our mountain and rural communities.   The amendment I offer simply provides that the relevant Department  Secretary, either Agriculture or Interior, can exempt those lands  contained in this bill that do not meet the legal requirements of the  Wilderness Act or the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, restoring the  original intent of these laws.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, once again, I would ask the gentlewoman  that if what she says is true, that the lands in this bill meet the  legal requirements, she has nothing to fear from my amendment. Only  where the land does not meet legal requirements can a Secretary exempt  it.   One of the objectives we had set when we were in the majority was to  restore public access to the public lands. These lands are set aside  for the use, enjoyment, and recreation of the American people for all  time. And that includes a wide range of activities, most of which are  prohibited under wilderness or wild and scenic rivers designation. Such  severe restrictions on public access should be used very carefully and  sparingly.   My amendment simply says: That the lands affected by this bill must  meet the legal definitions contained in the Wilderness Act and the Wild  and Scenic Rivers Act. It doesn't modify those acts; it affirms them.    The despots of Great Britain early on set aside a third of the  countryside as the ``King's royal forests,'' the private preserves of  the royal court and their hangers-on. Commoners were severely  restricted from these lands under draconian penalties. They were so  resented by the British people that no fewer than five clauses in the  Magna Carta were devoted to redressing these grievances.   The American public lands were supposed to be exactly the opposite of  the King's forests. These are lands set aside for the common enjoyment  of the American people in all the many and varied outdoor activities  and pursuits that they cherish.   By ignoring the legal definitions of the Wilderness and Wild and  Scenic Rivers Acts and scooping up and putting off-limits to most  activities vast tracts of land held by and for the public, the  Democrats make a mockery of these laws and undermine public support for  them.   We have heard a lot recently that no one is above the law. Well, that  includes Congress. This amendment assures that the lands affected by  this bill meet the criteria of the original laws that they invoke.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.    Yes, in its current form.    Mr. Speaker, the question presented in this amendment  comes down to this: Are we willing to protect our wilderness areas from  catastrophic wildfire or are we content to stand by and watch them  burn?   The Wilderness Act of 1964 designates lands, ``for the use and  enjoyment of the American people in such manner as will leave them  unimpaired for future use and enjoyment as wilderness.''   Now, that is important because nothing impairs the future use and  enjoyment of our wilderness areas more than catastrophic fire.   Our pledge in the Wilderness Act is to, ``provide for the protection  of these areas.'' To provide for the protection of these areas.   Look at America's wilderness areas today, it is heartbreaking. We  have utterly failed to protect them from the scourge of wildfire that  is now consuming them.   An untended forest is no different than an untended garden. It will  grow and grow until it chokes itself to death, and as it becomes  morbidly overgrown, it falls victim to disease, pestilence, drought,  and ultimately catastrophic wildfire that incinerates everything in its  path.   Once a forest is cremated, scrub brush takes over, and the forest  won't regrow for a century or more, denying multiple generations of  Americans the use and enjoyment that the Wilderness Act promises. And  then the process of destruction will begin again.   Why? Because we have made it all but impossible for forest managers  to protect these habitats by removing excess timber before it can choke  off the forest. Without special permitting, land managers are  restricted to handsaws and axes, which consigns our wilderness forests  to a policy of benign neglect even as they die before our eyes and  await the inevitable wildfire.   And even when the conflagration is ravaging the forest, permission to  use mechanized equipment to fight the fires in wilderness areas is  often difficult and time consuming. Today's Panetta amendment does  nothing to change this dangerous situation.   The 2019 Decker fire in Colorado began in the Sangre de Cristo  wilderness where benign neglect had already decimated the forest.  Eighty percent of the trees had already perished in the overcrowded  conditions that made them vulnerable to pestilence and  [[Page H1111]]  drought. And when the fire came, firefighters were held back due to the  wilderness designation until the fire literally exploded. The same tale  is told over and over again throughout our national lands.   There are currently 111 million acres of Federal land designated as  wilderness. That is about the size of California. This bill would add  1.5 million more. That is the size of Delaware and half of Rhode Island  combined, much of it in areas where the Federal land managers are  warning us that it is not suitable for wilderness designation and it is  opposed by local governments because of the proximity to towns, homes,  and property.   My amendment simply allows for mechanized wildfire mitigation; that  is, something more than handsaws and axes for the express and sole  purpose of protecting life, property, or the environment in these newly  created wilderness areas under this bill.   This isn't a new policy. There are 29 instances where similar active  management activities are already written into specific wilderness  designations. This amendment would be the 30th time we have done so.   When Republicans were in the majority, we set three objectives for  our Federal lands: To restore public access to them; to restore good  management to them; and to restore the Federal Government as a good  neighbor to the communities directly impacted by them.   This bill reverses those objectives set by House Republicans. Instead  of restoring public access to public lands, the Democrats would  restrict it. Instead of restoring good management to the public lands,  the Democrats interfere with it. And instead of restoring the Federal  Government as a good neighbor to those communities impacted by the  public lands, the Democrats give those communities the finger.   But mark these words: If these wilderness restrictions are imposed on  acreage near people's homes, it is only a matter of time until the  forest succumbs to neglect and the inevitable cycle of overcrowding,  death, and fire. In the aftermath, people will have the right to ask  why their elected representatives refused to protect them, their  families, their homes and their forests when they had the chance to do  so today to allow our Nation's foresters to do their jobs and care for  this precious resource.   At this moment my Democratic colleagues, remember, only you can  prevent forest fires.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
