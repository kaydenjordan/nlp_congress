 Madam Speaker, H.R. 18 must be immediately brought to the  House floor for a vote.   The No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act would make the Hyde  amendment and other current abortion funding prohibitions permanent and  governmentwide.  [[Page H3313]]    The Hyde amendment was passed in 1976 and has shared bipartisan  support for over four decades, while saving at least 2.4 million lives.  But, now, my Democrat colleagues want to break with precedent and pave  the way for taxpayer-funded abortions.   This is wrong. It is in direct opposition to God's word and the will  of the American people.   Psalm 139:13 is clear: ``For You formed my inward parts; You knitted  me together in my mother's womb. I praise You, for I am fearfully and  wonderfully made.''   Polling shows that 60 percent of Americans oppose taxpayer funding of  abortion.   Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committees on Energy  and Commerce, Ways and Means, and the Judiciary be discharged from  further consideration of H.R. 18, and ask for its immediate  consideration in the House.
