 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the extraordinary  achievements of the NC State women's basketball team, who won their  third straight ACC championship this year.   On Monday night, the entire Wolfpack community watched an incredible  game as the women played their hearts out against UConn.   Our players fought until the very end, coming back in the second half  after trailing by double digits, scoring a 3 pointer that sent them  into double overtime.   It was no easy feat, playing UConn in their own territory, and NC  State never gave up.   Too often, women athletes don't get the attention they deserve. The  team was an example to all female athletes and all boys and girls  seeking to play at the collegiate level.   Congratulations to the Wolfpack on a fantastic season.                            ____________________
