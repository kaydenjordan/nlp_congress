 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New York for  yielding. And I also thank the ranking member. I very much appreciate  his comments that he will support this concurrent resolution.   Mr. Speaker, I will just observe, as a member of the Intelligence  Committee, that we have seen our politics twisted into almost  unrecognizable form by the unprecedented attacks of the President on  the Department of Justice, on the FBI, on the investigation as a whole.   This report must see the light of day and must be made available to  the American public for a catharsis that will allow us to start with  the facts, to understand what happened and to rebuild the faith that  the American people did and should have in the Department of Justice,  in the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and in the government in  general.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of Congress, in strong,  bipartisan fashion, passing this bill so that the American people will  understand that the truth will be out there and it will help fix our  politics.
