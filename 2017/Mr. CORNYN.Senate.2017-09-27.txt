 Mr. President, today I would like to talk about a topic  that most of us don't want to discuss, and that is taxes, except today  is different. This time, you don't have to groan over spreadsheets and  calculations or worry about how much of your hard-earned pay you are  going to have to send to Uncle Sam. Today, leaders in the House and in  the Senate will unveil their core principles for tax reform. The  President will travel with our colleague Senator Young to announce his  support for these core principles.   Taxes can be confounding and complicated and painful to deliberate,  but for folks back home, what I believe describes our tax principles is  to say more take-home pay, and that works for everybody. In other  words, you actually reduce your living costs because Uncle Sam takes  less of your paycheck, meaning you get to keep more of it and take that  home and spend it on things that you would prefer to spend it on. So  more take-home pay is our bottom line.   I look forward to working with the chairman of the Finance Committee,  on which I have the privilege of serving, and Speaker Ryan and Chairman  Kevin Brady of the House Ways and Means Committee--another good Texan-- on their ideas, which I know were born from many long hours and tough  conversations.   But this is going to be a national conversation, starting with the  President kicking this off this afternoon in Indiana. He is going to  invite the American people to express their views on what tax reform  should look like.   For me, in addition to more take-home pay, I am looking for a tax  code which is shorter, simpler, and which makes us more competitive in  the global economy.   It is a great relief, believe me, to have a President who understands  how taxes and the uncertainty they place on job creators stifles  economic growth. The reason economic growth is so important is that  when the economy grows, more jobs are created, and for the jobs that  exist, the people who have them will actually earn more money and be  able to pursue their dreams.   Just as importantly, though, this President understands that the job  creator is not the enemy. A former colleague of ours, Gordon Smith from  Oregon, once told me that the problem with some of our Democratic  friends is that they claim to love the worker, but they hate the job  creator. To me, that sort of summarized it pretty well. I know he  didn't mean ``hate'' in the traditional sense, but he did mean  Congress--and particularly our folks on the Democratic side--likes to  implement additional burdens, such as higher taxes or more regulation,  more obstacles in the way of our job creators, when we should be  tearing down those walls, reducing that regulation, and lowering taxes  so that they can be successful, and in the process, we can all succeed.  Well, this President understands that our economy, too, is crucial but  extremely fragile, and he joins all of us in wanting to do everything  he can, and everything we can, to ensure that we continue to be the  strongest economy in the world.   Here is why tax reform is so important in the first place. In the  words of Arthur Brooks of the American Enterprise Institute, the  American Founders promised not just happiness but the pursuit of  happiness. That is, of course, in the Declaration of Independence. I  think Arthur is onto something. I think that is a good way of putting  it. It means that all of us, based on our country's original vision,  should be free to follow our dreams without government getting in our  way or making our burdens heavy. We should be free to pursue happiness.   Average American citizens should not be numbed or stifled by  mandatory participation in a system that depletes their energy and  discourages them, and that is what our Tax Code does today. It exhausts  people when it comes to fully complying with our arcane and convoluted  and complex laws because they are so difficult. So many people simply  outsource that by hiring some lawyer or some accountant to prepare  their taxes because it is so complex. We can do better than that. We  can make it simpler and fairer and flatter.   Today, many of the obstacles that exist prevent the average American  from pursuing their dreams and reaching their full potential, which  ought to be what joins us all together. One of those is an outdated and  highly convoluted tax system that actually penalizes hard work, stymies  ingenuity, and enriches the lawyers and accountants that people have to  hire in order to just comply with all of its convoluted complexity--so- called compliance costs. Call this the terrible tedium of taxes. It  zaps our energy rather than unleashing it. It erodes our work ethic,  because if you work harder and harder only to see more and more money  go to the Federal Government, what does that do to incentivize people  to work harder? It erodes our work ethic, as we see less reason to  labor for what ultimately gets taken from us.    The mission of the so-called Big 6 committee, which has been asked to  put together a blueprint for reform, has been to protect American jobs  and make the Tax Code simpler, fairer, and lower for average American  families. In a sense, it is all about putting families first. Families  build individuals, and families mold character. We have to give every  opportunity to families who need to thrive. We have to keep the  uninvited guest of government away from the front door, constantly  begging for more money, more time, and more attention, and constantly  throwing a wrench into their plans.   I also believe we should provide tax relief for small businesses  because small businesses are literally the engine of our economy. It is  not the Fortune 500 that creates the vast percentage of jobs in this  country. It is small businesses, which often face an unyielding  regulatory state. We should lower taxes for all American businesses so  they can compete with foreign ones.   As the so-called Big 6 committee has said, the goal of any new plan  should  [[Page S6165]]  be, first and foremost, to reduce tax rates as much as possible. Let's  make sure this ``first cut is the deepest,'' as the song goes, but also  to place a priority on permanence, to create a system that encourages  American companies to bring jobs back from overseas, along with the  profits they will not bring back because they will be taxed twice, and  to put more money back in the pockets of all Americans.   As Ronald Reagan said, there is one simple fact you have to keep in  mind when it comes to taxes: ``The problem is not that the people are  taxed too little, the problem is that the Government spends too much.''   This is not just about sheer wealth we are after but about earned  success--the ability of mothers, fathers, and families to work a long  day and to keep more of their hard-earned paychecks to use as they  please--to save it for their retirement, to spend it on their house, or  even to dote on their children. When families get to keep more of the  money they earn, they are more inclined to take advantage of or to  create their own opportunities, including new businesses. Social  mobility increases and so does room for charity.   The United States is the most charitable and generous country in the  world. People don't just turn to government for help during times of  need. We saw that in Hurricane Harvey and in Hurricane Irma and now in  Hurricane Maria. Many, many Americans generously dip into their own  resources to help provide for their fellow human beings in need during  times of tragedy. It is our prosperity that comes from job creation-- getting to keep more of what you earn and pay the government less--that  makes that possible.   When Alexis de Tocqueville came to the United States, shortly after  our country's founding, in his book ``Democracy in America,'' he  pointed out that one of the unique things about America--certainly much  different than Europe--was the organizing and voluntary associations.  These often are charitable organizations--whether they are churches or  synagogues or mosques or just community organizations--that as part of  their good work provide charitable benefits for our fellow man and  woman. We ought to encourage that.   Of course, none of us is an island. It is not that lower tax rates  translate to everyone looking out exclusively for No. 1. Oftentimes,  that is the way our friends across the aisle will depict lowering  taxes. They say: You are lowering taxes for the rich.   We want to lower taxes for everybody--not because it benefits an  individual but because it benefits the country and it benefits all  Americans. It makes us more competitive globally. It creates more jobs  and opportunities for Americans who are looking for those jobs and  opportunities. It creates incentives for investment so that the  entrepreneur can start a business, come up with a new idea, change the  world, and create jobs and opportunities for other people at the same  time.   We know that social obligations are still important. It is just that  there are many ways of meeting them other than just cutting a big  paycheck to the Federal Government every April. In fact, the higher  taxes we pay, the easier it is for citizens to assume that, well, I  have paid the Federal Government; so let the government take care of  it.   That is not who we are. That is not who we have been. That is  certainly not how we began. We began as a government that believed in  the individuality and the importance of all individuals, and we all  collectively benefit when each of us is free to pursue their dreams  because that increases the prosperity and the opportunities for all.   We will never become, I hope and pray, a country that says: It is the  government's job when it comes to taking care of a man or woman or a  family in need. Yes, government has a role to play, but I hope we will  always be the generous sort of country that we started out to be and  that we still are today, with neighbors helping neighbors.   Middle-class Americans have experienced a decade of higher taxes,  more regulation, and stagnant economic growth under the last  administration. It is time to break out of that cycle, and this is our  time to do that.   Every American knows we can do better. If you ask them: Are your  taxes hard to prepare, is it complicated, are you confused, or do you  feel like the Federal Government is getting a bigger bite out of your  paycheck than it should, I think you would get near unanimity that the  Tax Code is too complex, the Federal Government is too voracious when  it comes to taking a bite out of your paycheck, and people would  welcome the ability to keep more of what they earn.   It is time for us to show that we understand the plight of hard- working American families and people of all economic levels, that we  are hearing them when they say they want to keep more of the paycheck  they earn and they want us to lower their cost of living by lowering  the tax bite out of the paycheck they do earn.   Americans are wondering what our tax reform policies will be. For me,  here are some nonnegotiable items. The Tax Code must be simplified. Job  creators must be incentivized to keep well-paying jobs here at home in  the United States. American competitiveness in a global economy must be  increased by lowering business tax rates.   The result should be a new, retooled system that will put more money  in the pockets of middle-class families and reenergize our economy. It  will benefit Americans in every State across the country. It will also  make it possible for us to meet our other priorities, as the Federal  Treasury also will benefit from more people working, earning better  wages, and helping to support their government. It will make it  possible for us to spend more money on our priorities, like national  defense, which right now is underfunded, or medical research or other  priorities that the American people may have.   By delivering on these principles, we can restore prosperity for this  generation and many generations to come, and we can keep the promise of  the Declaration of Independence that we are endowed by our Creator with  certain unalienable rights, including life, liberty, and the pursuit of  happiness.   Ultimately, that is what we are talking about when we talk about tax  reform. We shouldn't just be wearing green eyeshades, getting out our  spreadsheets, and counting the numbers. This is about keeping the  promise of the Declaration of Independence that we are endowed by our  Creator with an unalienable right to pursue happiness.   I yield the floor.
