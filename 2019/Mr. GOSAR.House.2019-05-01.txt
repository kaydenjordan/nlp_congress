 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer my amendment ensuring  the constitutionality of the Paris Agreement. The previous  administration refused to abide by the Constitution and called this an  agreement, not a treaty, despite the agreement having an impact on  every American.   Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution states that the President  shall ``have power by and with the advice and consent of the Senate to  make treaties provided two-thirds of the Senators present concur.''   My amendment simply states that the Paris Agreement is a treaty, and  before anything can be implemented to abide by the agreement, it should  be submitted to the Senate for approval.   My good friend from Virginia, Representative Morgan Griffith, said it  best yesterday in our Special Order when he eloquently stated: ``If we  are going to bind our hands and seal our fate to be the number two or  number three or number five economy in the world instead of being the  number one economy in the world, if that is what we are going to do,  then there ought to be votes taken down the hall. Men and women in the  United States Senate should put their name on the line and say yes or  no. And the American people then will know who has voted yes and who  has voted no. They won't be hiding behind any games or circumstances or  procedural maneuvers. Then the American people can use the power that  was given to them by our Constitution and an inalienable right granted  by God to use the ballot box to make a decision as to whether or not  they wanted to be bound, whether or not they wanted to have their  economy reduced, and have their children and grandchildren to be lesser  than what we have today in our economic wealth.''   Many radical environmental groups are saying the Paris Agreement does  not need to go to the Senate, that the agreement reiterates obligations  already contained in article 4 of the 1992 United Nations Framework  Convention on Climate Change, or the UNFCCC. This is completely a  falsehood.   The Congressional Research Service has already proven them wrong.   Let me quote the CRS: ``The George H.W. Bush administration stated  that Article 4.2 of the UNFCCC, which commits the parties to, inter  alia, adopt national policies and, accordingly, mitigate climate change  by limiting GHG emissions did `not require any new implementing  legislation nor added regulatory programs.' Perhaps, most importantly,  it stated that an amendment or future agreement under the UNFCCC to  adopt targets and timetables for emissions reductions would be  submitted to the Senate for its advice and consent.''   Furthermore, in a subsequent report, the Senate Committee on Foreign  Relations wrote:   ``A decision by the conference of parties to adopt targets and  timetables would have to be submitted to the Senate for its advice and  consent before the United States could deposit its instruments of  ratification for such an agreement. The committee notes further that a  decision by the executive branch to reinterpret the convention to apply  legally binding targets and timetables for reducing emissions of  greenhouse gases to the United States would alter the `shared  understanding' of the convention between the Senate and the executive  branch and would therefore require the Senate's advice and consent.''   The previous administration purposely ignored the will of Congress by  refusing to send the Paris Agreement to the Senate. I often hear  Members from both sides of the aisle lament about executive overreach.   Here we have a clear case of the executive branch telling Congress it  doesn't matter.   If Congress refuses to exercise its constitutional authority and not  demand the Paris Agreement to be sent to the Senate, then this body is  telling future Presidents that there are no checks and balances.   Madam Chair, I urge the adoption of my amendment that preserves the  constitutional checks and balance, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Chair, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. McCaul).    Madam Chair, may I inquire how much time I have remaining.    Madam Chair, I will finish that up.   The State Department has a Circular 175, and there are ten  opportunities  [[Page H3389]]  that tell us whether they are an agreement or whether they are a  treaty.   So let me highlight just four or five of these.   Number one, the extent to which the agreement involves commitments or  risks affecting the nation as a whole.   This obviously impacts everybody across this country, therefore,  ratification by the Senate.   Whether the agreement is intended to affect State laws.   This will bind all State laws, because they have to fulfill the  ratification based on that activity. So, therefore, it, once again, has  to be a treaty.   Whether the agreement can be given effect without the enactment of  subsequent legislation by the Congress.   This agreement obligates U.S. taxpayer funds to the Green Climate  Fund, which is a slush fund, but it still obligates those applications  and that money to that fund. Therefore, it must be fulfilled by a  treaty.   Madam Chair, I ask Members to adopt my amendment, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I rise today to offer an amendment that  strikes section 3 of the bill. Section 3 prohibits the use of funds to  advance the withdrawal of the United States from the Paris Agreement.  My amendment ensures any decision made on the Paris Agreement will be  based on the merits, not politics.   I have said this before, and I will say it again: Either the Paris  Agreement is a treaty, or it is not. If it is not a treaty, then the  current administration may independently terminate the agreement  without congressional approval, as the previous administration entered  into the agreement without congressional approval.   Makes sense, right?   What one administration does by executive action can be undone by the  next administration by executive action.   If the Paris Agreement is not an agreement entered into by the United  States by executive action and constitutes a treaty, then it should be  presented to the Senate and put on the floor for a two-thirds vote per  Article II, Section 2 of our Constitution.                                time  1730    For the last several years, Democratic Members have crowed at the top  of their lungs about none of the funds provisions and forced the U.S.  Senate to agree to only take up appropriation bills if they don't  include political riders. Riders have not been included in the final  appropriations bills signed into law as a result.   Well, folks, section 3 is a political, none-of-the-funds rider, whose  sole ability is to try and prevent the administration from doing  something they currently have the authority to do. The hypocrisy here  is outrageous, and this amendment should pass based on that precedent  utilized over the last several years alone.   We have heard folks on the other side of the aisle claim we need to  stay in the Paris Agreement in order to protect future generations.  Americans for Tax Reform estimates the Paris Agreement will cost the  U.S. an estimated 6.5 million jobs by 2040 and reduce our GDP by over  $2.5 trillion.   NERA Consulting estimates those numbers are even higher, and that the  Paris Agreement will cost the U.S. an estimated 31.6 million jobs by  2040 and reduce our GDP by over $3 trillion.   How does killing 6.5 to 31.6 million jobs and costing our economy  more than $3 trillion protect future generations? I don't know.   The European Climate Action Network reported that no single country  in Europe is performing sufficiently to meet the Paris Agreement goals.   A recent United Nations Emissions Gap report found that all  participating countries will have to at least triple their efforts in  order to meet the Paris Agreement's basic goals.   China and India, the world's two biggest polluters, have said they  will not even consider reducing carbon emissions until 2030 at the  earliest, while we are pledging to reduce our emissions by 26 to 28  percent by 2025.   How does tying ourselves to a nonbinding agreement that puts us at a  competitive disadvantage and that countries throughout the world are  failing to implement protect the American people?   This is not a partisan issue, Madam Chairwoman. This is about doing  what is right for America and about protecting freedom and opportunity  for our children and grandchildren.   If the administration didn't already have the authority to withdraw  the United States from the fundamentally flawed Paris Agreement, then  there should be no reason to include the section 3 political rider  being debated here today.   But since the United States Senate has failed to take up the Paris  Agreement and weigh in one way or the other whether the Paris Agreement  is a  [[Page H3390]]  treaty or not, this body should not attempt to tie the administration's  hands with a political none-of-the-funds rider.   Either you are for the Constitution or you are not. Either you  believe executive action can be taken to enter and leave the Paris  Agreement or you don't.   I urge adoption of my amendment, which removes the politics from the  bill and allows any decision made on the Paris Agreement to be based on  merits, not politics.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Once again, Madam Chairwoman, this is an important  application. Once again, you have to realize that we are talking about  the Constitution.   The other side talks out of both sides of their mouth. They want it  one way when they are in the minority, they want it the other way when  they are in the majority, and they can't have that.   This is about the rule of law and about good policy. Good process  builds good policy builds good politics, and that is just not what is  here today.   So when we start looking at the applications here, let's make sure  the American taxpayer, the American family, is treated fairly, not put  at a disadvantage by the rest of the world.   Too often we have taken the short end of the stick. It is fine for us  to stand up.   And, by the way, if I am not mistaken, in 2015, 2016, and 2017 we led  the world in carbon emissions reductions. Yes, it is that very  application of entrepreneurialism and technology that has driven that  boat. Let's continue doing it that way. Let's get back to good process.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
