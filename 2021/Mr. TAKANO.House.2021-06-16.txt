 Mr. Speaker, I say mahalo to my colleague, Representative  Case, for yielding and for organizing this Special Order hour to  commemorate the release of an historic stamp that honors the bravery  and service of the 442nd Regimental Combat Team, the Go for Broke  Japanese American Soldiers of World War II Forever Stamp.   I am a proud Japanese American, the son of a mother and father who  were young children when executive order 9066 was signed by President  Franklin Delano Roosevelt, which forced them and the rest of my family  out of our homes and into internment camps on American soil.   Executive order 9066 labeled Japanese Americans as enemy aliens. It  scapegoated an entire community of Americans and questioned their  loyalty. It was misguided, it was based on lies, and it was rooted in  racism and fear.   During this time, 120,000 Japanese Americans were unjustly  imprisoned, mass-blamed for atrocities they did not commit. Their  rights were trampled, their freedoms were curtailed, and their humanity  was ignored.   While our own government was carrying out the unthinkable against its  own people, while fighting for the ideals of liberty and freedom  abroad, young Japanese-American men stepped up to serve under our flag,  even when our country did not want them to.   Following the attack on Pearl Harbor, Japanese-American men of draft  age were excluded from military service. They were considered enemy  aliens, unfit to serve and unfit to fight for their very own country.  Yet, in spite of this, a highly motivated group of Japanese Americans  eager to prove their allegiance and patriotism petitioned the U.S.  Government for their right to serve.   President Roosevelt relented, allowing these men to form the 442nd  Regimental Combat Team of the United States Army, a legendary,  segregated Japanese-American fighting unit that was sent to the front  lines of World War II, even as their families were in internment camps  back home.    Among these men were three of my great-uncles, including my great- uncle Manzo ``Mon'' Takahasi, who is pictured right beside me. My  great-uncle Mon gave his life for our country in Italy just a few weeks  before D-day. He was 26 years old.   Recently, I rewatched the testimony of his brother, my other great- uncle Nobi, who recounted the story of the day that he learned that his  brother had died in battle, in what he called the final push of the  war.   Mon and so many other nisei soldiers never had the opportunity to  relish the victory that they helped secure, but their valor helped move  our world closer to peace.   My great-uncle Nobi also shared what it was like to serve in the  rescue of the Lost Battalion as a member of the 442nd. The rescue of  the Lost Battalion took place in the Vosges Mountains of France in  October of 1944. Eight hundred men in the 442nd lost their lives in  combat to rescue 211 men in the 141st Texas Regiment. He told a story  of bloodshed and of the carnage that he witnessed there. He described  the nauseating, terrible feeling after seeing dead bodies of American  and German soldiers and helmets all around him.   The nisei fighters believed in the promise of America. These men were  betting on America, and they bet that America could be a more perfect,  free, and more equal Union. In the case of my great-uncle Mon, he bet  his life.   I just want to say that the motto of this unit was Go for Broke,  which means to go all in, to bet everything. This group of men bet not  on the reality of America--the reality then was an America that let  Japanese Americans down, that stripped them of their rights and  interned them without reason.   These men were in a humiliating place to have to prove their  patriotism. They had something to prove, and they did prove it. So I  tell the story of my great-uncles and the 442nd with great pride and a  strong belief that, if it wasn't for them, I would not be a Member of  Congress today.   Did they win their bet?   I stand as evidence that they did.                                time  2150
