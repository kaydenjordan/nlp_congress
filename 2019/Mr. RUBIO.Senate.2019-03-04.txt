 Mr. President, as chairman of the Committee on  Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize a small  business that exemplifies the value of hard work and the storied  American entrepreneurial spirit. It is my privilege to honor a Florida  small business that exemplifies what it means to overcome adversity and  to succeed as both a company and as a community leader. Today, I  recognize Hog Technologies, of Stuart, FL, as the Senate Small Business  of the Week.   Previously known as Waterblasting Technologies until a rebranding  effort last year, Hog Technologies has grown significantly since its  founding in 1988. Founder and chief executive officer, James P.  Crocker, bought a single pressure washer from a friend and began  knocking on doors to find work. Since then, Hog Technologies has been a  one-of-a-kind entrepreneurial success story that has revolutionized an  entire industry.   After discovering the niche industry of paint removal, James took a  leap of faith and bought a 10,000-psi water-blasting machine. Soon, Hog  Technologies was being awarded major contracts for their services.  After years of success in this field, Hog Technologies expanded to  create fully functioning models of a makeshift water-blasting vehicle.  In 1997, the Original Stripe Hog was developed, effectively changing  the landscape of the hydroblasting industry.   Today, Hog Technologies holds more than 20 patents, has products  operating in 56 countries worldwide, and is a world leader in marking  removal and pavement maintenance. Through strong investments in  research and development, Hog has a diverse line of products, ranging  from rubber and paint removal, to pavement marking equipment and  machines, to industrial vacuums and hydro-excavators. In 2012, the team  at Hog Technologies calculated that, over a period of 13 years, they  have placed more units worldwide than their five largest competitors  combined. With international success, they continue to expand by  looking to hire 130 new employees over the next 3 years. Hog  Technologies is an incredible American industrial success story. Having  remained local, Hog Technologies constructs their machines in the  United States and continues to support Florida's economy.   In addition to supporting the local Stuart community, Hog  Technologies has financed a large portion of the construction of a home  for underprivileged children in India. In 2017, James was awarded the  Stuart/Martin County Chamber of Commerce Business Person of the Year.  Mr. Crocker has also recently followed his creative passion and began  authoring children's books that aim to teach children leadership  skills. Hog Technologies and their employees are very involved in their  community and pride themselves on charitable endeavors. Annually, they  participate in the Toys for Tots holiday gift drive and in local  parades where they drive their machines through the streets of Stuart.   Hog Technologies is an outstanding example of a Florida manufacturing  success story. In true American fashion, James and the team at Hog saw  a problem and created a solution. They have seen incredible success,  while remaining committed to supporting Stuart and its surrounding  communities. I would like to congratulate Mr. James Crocker and the  entire team at Hog Technologies on being named the Senate Small  Business of the Week. I wish them good luck and look forward to  watching their continued growth and success.                            ____________________
