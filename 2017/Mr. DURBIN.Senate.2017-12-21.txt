 Madam President, years ago, a man with a famous name  aspired to be President of the United States. Critics dismissed this  idea as ridiculous. One of the leading political columnists of the day  wrote that the man's initials stood for ``Feather Duster Roosevelt, a  lightweight''--nothing to him.   Al Franken's decision to run for a seat in this Senate from Minnesota  was met in many quarters with the same sort of mockery.   Many people said: He is a comedian. He doesn't have the knowledge or  the skill or the patience or the vision to be a lawmaker. You can't  joke your way into the Senate.   The pundits were wrong about FDR. He was one of our greatest  Presidents during one of our darkest hours.   Madam President, the doubters were wrong about Al Franken too. Al  Franken has been my friend, my personal friend, for more than two  decades. For the last 7-plus years, he has been my colleague in the  Senate. He has been a credit to the Senate, a passionate advocate for  his home State of Minnesota, a defender of our Constitution, and a  determined fighter for justice. He became a better Senator every year.  His work in the Senate has made life for millions of people better in  Minnesota and far beyond. He and his dedicated staff can take pride in  that fact. Al Franken has been and I am sure will continue to be an  effective champion for those whose daily struggles too often go  unnoticed and unaddressed in the places of power.   During his time in the Senate, Al Franken has always been there when  his Senate colleagues asked for help. He was one of the most sought- after voices in our party. He never failed to pack a bag, catch a  plane, and spend another night away from his family to help each and  every one of us.   Twenty years ago, when I first met him, he was this well known,  successful comedian on ``Saturday Night Live'' who happened to play the  role of a fellow named Paul Simon, a Senator from Illinois who was my  predecessor. Paul Simon invited Al Franken to come to Makanda, IL. It  is not even close to Chicago. He agreed on a Sunday afternoon to be  there on behalf of my campaign, although we had never met, and he came.  He limped onto Paul Simon's front porch, saying: ``I twisted my ankle  playing squash.'' I thought it was another perfect example of a reason  he could have used to avoid the invitation, but he came anyway. We had  a great afternoon and a terrific time with Paul Simon of ``Saturday  Night Live'' and the real Paul Simon and a senatorial candidate who was  grateful for Al Franken's presence that day.   When people ask me to describe my politics, I say that I follow the  gospel of St. Paul. By that, I mean I try to emulate three of my  greatest political heroes, who happen to share that name.   The first Senator, Paul Douglas of Illinois, was a champion of  honesty, economic justice, and civil rights, and the man for whom I had  the good fortune of interning when I was a college student; Paul Simon,  whom I just mentioned, my predecessor from Illinois, who was one of the  smartest, most decent men I have ever met in any walk of life; and  Senator Paul Wellstone of Minnesota, who has received many deserved  tributes today. Paul Wellstone was the champion of farmers, hotel  maids, grocery clerks, cafeteria workers, and everyone who worked hard  and struggled for dignity and enough money just to pay the bills.   Paul Wellstone, as we have heard from both Senator Klobuchar and from  Al Franken himself, is the man Al Franken chose to emulate in public  life. He stated Paul Wellstone's famous quote: ``We all do better when  we all do better.'' It is a simple statement, a profound truth, and it  has been the guiding light for Al Franken's Senate career.   Senator Wellstone died 15 years ago in a tragic plane crash. On the  10th anniversary of that terrible loss, Senator Franken wrote an essay  about Paul Wellstone's legacy for The Atlantic magazine. I want to read  a short section from that essay.   Senator Franken wrote:         One of Paul's most famous quotes is this: ``Politics is not       about power. Politics is not about money. Politics is not       about winning for the sake of winning. Politics is about the       improvement of people's lives.''        That quote is often used to criticize those on the other       side who seem to forget the human consequences of their       political agenda. But progressives should keep it in mind, as       well.        The big fights--war and peace, justice and liberty--are       important. But there aren't any small fights. And where Paul       made the biggest impact--where his work resulted in the       greatest improvement of people's lives--was on issues that       don't usually lead anyone's stump speech: mental health,       domestic violence, homelessness among veterans.    When future historians look back at the legacy of Senator Al Franken,  I believe they will say: Here is a man who loved his State and his  country, who worked hard to be a good Senator, and who never hesitated  to take up an important issue, large or small.   Al Franken and I served together on the Senate Judiciary Committee.  Over the years, I have watched him mature into one of the best, most  insightful questioners on that committee. His questioning of Supreme  Court Nominee Gorsuch, now Supreme Court Justice Gorsuch, helped to  expose the Justice's troubling record of ruling against workers and  families.   It was a story about a truckdriver who deserted his position on the  roadway, was freezing in the middle of the night, who finally got his  day in court, and the decision by Judge Gorsuch at the time, in my  opinion and Al's opinion, did not serve justice. Many of us raised that  issue; no one raised it more effectively than Al Franken.   His probing questioning also exposed Attorney General Sessions for  misleading America about his meetings with Russians during the 2016  Presidential campaign.   He has been equally effective on the HELP Committee. His questioning  of the future Secretary of Education, Betsy DeVos, showed her to be  unfamiliar with some of the most basic and important debates in  education policy and clearly exposed the fact that she was unready to  serve as our Nation's leader at the Department of Education.   I guess some people seek elected office to make a name for  themselves, but Al Franken didn't need to be a Senator to achieve that.  He already had a well-known name as an entertainer, radio host, and  best-selling author before he entered politics. He and his wife Franni  have a good life, two great kids, and wonderful grandchildren who  followed.    ``Terrific'' is the word. Terrific grandchildren who  followed.   When it came down to it, Al Franken wanted to do more than just  entertain and be well known; he wanted to make a difference in the  lives of others. More than anyone, as he said this morning, his wife  Franni inspired him. As he explained in his book, her family wasn't as  lucky as a lot of us. Her dad died when she was a young baby girl. Her  mom raised five kids on Social Security survivor benefits and a  paycheck from a local supermarket. But every member of Franni's family  [[Page S8201]]  made it to the middle class because of Social Security, Pell grants,  the GI bill, and title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.   Al  writes:         They tell you in this country you have to pull yourself up       by your bootstraps. And we all believe that. But first you've       got to have the boots. And the federal government gave       Franni's family the boots.    ``Opportunity is supposed to be for everyone.'' That is one of the  articles of faith animating everything that Al Franken has done or  sought to achieve in the Senate.   I am going to miss my friend Al Franken, my colleague, and one of my  fellow members of the Senate Judiciary Committee. I am sorry he is  leaving under these circumstances, but he is going to be remembered,  and he is going to have an opportunity to use his voice for others in  the future.   Every person who has ever lived has had moments they wish they could  erase and words they wish they could take back. In this life of both  calm and stormy seas, we all draw strength from the healing power of  redemption, and we can take heart in the knowledge that tomorrow is  another day with new opportunities to offer a helping hand and make our  lives count.   I am happy to hear Al Franken say that while he may be giving up the  Senate, he is not giving up his voice in public life. I wish Al  Franken, Franni, and their great family the very best and thank them  again for what they have given to all of us.   Madam President, I yield.    Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Colorado. We  have been engaged in this battle of immigration reform for years. He is  a worthy ally, thoughtful, and always thinking of a solution. I thank  him for his continuing commitment to this cause.   In the midst of the Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln got so  frustrated with General McClellan that he sent him a message. He  couldn't get him to attack. He wouldn't do anything.   He asked: General McClellan, if you are not going to use your Army,  can I use it? Can I borrow your Army?  [[Page S8219]]    So I would like to ask the leaders of the House and Senate: If you  are not going to use your Congress, can I borrow it for a minute? Can  we fill up this empty Chamber and actually have a real debate over a  real bill to solve a real problem?   I think that might be a worthy thing for us to do. In fact, I think  that is what we are paid to do; isn't it? Didn't we swear to uphold  this Constitution? Didn't we take this historic job on with the goal of  making America a better place?   On September 5, President Trump, along with Attorney General  Sessions, eliminated the DACA Program. This was a program that gave to  almost 800,000 young people--brought to the United States when they  were little kids--a chance to go to school, to work, to have futures in  this country. They had to go through criminal background checks, turn  over all of their information, and pay their taxes--all of the above.  Then, for 2 years, they could operate in America. They were not  citizens, but they were legally in America. On September 5, President  Trump and Attorney General Sessions said: It is over--as of March 5,  2018, no more.   Then the President said: I challenge you, Congress. Do something  about it. Pass a law.   That was almost 4 months ago. What have we done in 4 months to  address this problem that affects the lives of 800,000 DACA-protected  young people? Nothing. We are not using this Congress. General  McClellan was not using the Army. Isn't it time that we do something?  Wouldn't the American people be so pleasantly surprised if we did  something on a bipartisan basis that solved a problem in America?   I know my Republican colleagues are euphoric over their tax bill. Two  out of three Americans are not. I am not. I will put it aside for a  minute. They spent a lot of time. They passed it. So be it. They did it  on a strictly partisan basis. They had a right under the Senate rules  to do it that way, and they did it that way. This cannot be done on a  strictly partisan basis. You cannot fix the immigration system unless  you engage both political parties in the solution.   I am lucky. I care about this. I also found some Republican Senators  who care just as much. Jeff Flake of Arizona announced his retirement.  I am sorry to see him go because he is a good person of good values. He  stepped up and cosponsored the Dream Act that we are talking about  here. I didn't even have to call him on the phone. I thanked him, and  he said: It is the right thing to do. Lindsey Graham, a Republican of  South Carolina, was my cosponsor. Cory Gardner of Colorado and Lisa  Murkowski of Alaska stepped up and said: It is the right thing to do  for these young people, to give them an opportunity to earn their way  into legal status, to earn their way to citizenship.   I thank them for that. We need eight more. If we get 8 more, we will  have 12 Republicans out of 52. With eight more, we are ready. We are  ready to put 60 votes up when they call the roll. With 60 votes in the  Senate, you can get things done.   What has happened? What opportunities have we had in the almost 4  months since the President eliminated this program? None--not one.   Senator McConnell said to Senator Flake when his vote on the tax bill  was in doubt: I promise you that we will bring this up in January--this  coming January.   I can tell you that I read the promise very closely, and there are a  lot of contingencies on there. I hope that Senator McConnell is going  to give us our chance early in January to find out if we can come up  with a bipartisan solution to this problem.   If you think there aren't other Republicans who support this, 34  Republicans in the House of Representatives sent a letter to Speaker  Paul Ryan and wrote: Pass the Dreamer legislation this year--34  Republicans. So we are not alone. They are not the only ones.   Yesterday, 11 Governors--11 of them, Republicans and Democrats--sent  a letter to Congress, calling on us to do this. The letter was signed  by the Democratic Governors from Minnesota, Montana, Pennsylvania, and  North Carolina and by the Republican Governors from Nevada,  Massachusetts, Vermont, and Utah, and by Alaska's Independent Governor.   We are hearing from those in the business community. They want this  done. They have seen these Dreamers. They have seen these young people.  They believe in them, and they want us to do something to help them. We  have heard it from the labor organizations, and we have heard it from  the faith organizations.   Across the board, 76 percent of the American people support what we  are trying to do here--76 percent. What issues get 76 percent? The  flag? I will bet you it gets even more, but not many others get 76  percent approval, including 61 percent of the Trump voters. They think  it is the right thing to do. Do you know why? Because many of these  people have met the Dreamers. When you come to know them and hear their  stories, you come to the conclusion--at least I do--that, for goodness'  sake, these are extraordinary young people. Somehow or another, they  have survived and have even flourished in a country that doesn't  recognize them as legal. They went to our schools. They pledged  allegiance to our flag. They sang the national anthem. That is the  country they know.   Let me tell you about one before I turn the floor over to my  colleague from Maryland. This young lady's name is Miriam Gonzalez. She  is the 105th Dreamer whose story I have told on the floor.   When she was 6 years old, her family brought her to the United States  from Mexico, and she grew up near Los Angeles. She was a good student  and a good athlete. In high school she played softball and golf. She  was a member of the bible club, the chemistry club, and the reading  club. She was an active volunteer in her community, including assistant  teaching at the local elementary school. She was the valedictorian of  her high school class. She was accepted at UCLA. She majored in  anthropology and minored in classical civilization.   Let me give a postscript here. If you are undocumented and go to  college in America, you get no Federal assistance--no Pell grant, no  Federal loan. You have to earn the money. You have to work jobs to do  it. She did. She held down the necessary jobs and commuted to school  from her parents' home by taking public transportation for 2 hours each  way on every schoolday.   She was involved in student groups, mentored students at Van Nuys  High School, and encouraged them to go to college. She continued to  excel academically. She made the dean's honor roll and was awarded a  certificate for her research at UCLA. Today, she is assisting students  in low-income neighborhoods and schools.   After graduation, she went to work with Teach For America. Do you  know what that means? It means taking a job that pays hardly anything  to teach in one of the most challenging schools in America. She did it.  She taught seventh- and eighth-grade students in L.A. She teaches five  classes for students who are having trouble with math and reading, and  she gives one-on-one tutoring.   She is involved in the school's parents committee and tries to get  the parents of these kids who need their helping hands to excel as  well. She is a full-time graduate student at Loyola Marymount  University, where she is pursuing a master's degree in education.   I am going to read her letter and then turn over the floor.         Every day for [my] first two months [as a teacher] my       students would ask me if I would be returning the next day,       week, and month, and I would reassure them that I was there       to stay. Eventually, they began to trust me and believe that       I was there to support them. . . . Now students believe that       I am there for them and truly care about helping and       preparing [them] to succeed academically. My students have       made huge improvements academically, [and] I am particularly       proud of how hard they all work. After hearing about the fate       of DACA--    She is talking about President Trump abolishing DACA--       my students were worried that they would be losing me. I       continue to reassure them that I am not going anywhere       anytime soon and will fight to be able to see them finish       middle school.    What is going to happen to her if we don't do what we are supposed to  do--if we don't use this Senate and that House to solve this problem?  What is going to happen to her and her students? Are we so busy? Do you  notice it on the floor? Are we so busy that we  [[Page S8220]]  can't take up a piece of legislation here, debate it, and pass it  today?   Before the end of the day, we are going to pass a measure to keep the  government open and functioning for about 3 or 4 weeks. It is something  that may pass the House. We will find out later this afternoon. I am  troubled by it. It doesn't have one word in it to deal with this  challenge, and we have known for 4 months that it was coming and that  we had to do it.   I am going to be voting no on that, and it is not because of the  merits of the continuing resolution. Until we address this issue and  take the time to use the Senate and use the House to solve this  problem, I am not going to be standing here and saying: I am going home  for Christmas. I don't know what is going to happen to Miriam. I don't  know what is going to happen to 800,000 others--get back to you later.  The time is now for us to solve this problem.   I yield the floor.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to  acknowledge an extraordinary woman from my home State of Illinois.   Heather Gooze lives in Nevada now, but she grew up in the Chicago  area. She is a survivor of the worst mass shooting in modern American  history. On October 1, she was working as a bartender at the Route 91  Harvest Festival in Las Vegas. She was there when a gunman with his own  private arsenal rained down gunfire from a high-rise hotel, murdering  58 innocent people and injuring more than 500 others.   Ms. Gooze testified at a recent Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on  ``bump stocks,'' the $200 accessory that the Las Vegas gunman used to  make his assault rifles fire almost as fast as a machine gun.   When she heard the first round of shots, Heather thought it might  have been fireworks, but suddenly people were running in every  direction. Some were shot; many were covered in blood.   Heather directed wounded and frightened people to an exit. With about  20 other people, she then pushed down a fence to make it easier for  people to escape the gunfire.   She could have run to safety herself. Instead, she went back to the  bar to try to help people who had been shot and lay wounded on the  ground.   One young man had been shot in the head. Heather held a jean jacket  to his wound to try to staunch the bleeding. When she dropped the  jacket, she used her fingers to try to plug the hole in the young man's  head. He died the next day.   She then saw three men trying to move another badly injured man using  a metal ladder as a stretcher. Heather reached out to grab a corner of  the ladder and help lift it. The young man on the ladder grabbed her  hand, squeezed it lightly, and then let go--dead.   Heather looked around, saw other dead bodies lying alone, and decided  that she would not leave that young man alone like that.   She stayed with his body for hours, until 3:30 in the morning.   When his cell phone rang, she answered. She told the young man's  mother that her only child had died. The young man's girlfriend had  escaped the killing field to the safety of a nearby hotel. Heather told  her that young woman that the love of her life was gone, but Heather  would stay with him and learn for the family where his body would be  taken.   At the recent hearing, Heather said that horrific night in Las Vegas  made her part of a growing, grieving ``family'' she had hoped never to  join: the American family of survivors and victims of mass shootings.   She said that she has asked herself many times in the days after the  shooting why she stayed and risked her life for young men she didn't  know and for their grieving families. She said the only answer she  could come up with was that she hoped that someone would do the same  for her and not leave her alone in the midst of a massacre.  [[Page S8244]]    I think that is the same plea that many Americans have for this  Congress. They understand that gun safety is a politically heated  issue. They understand that there are constitutional and legal  questions that are difficult to balance.   They want us to have the courage to take up that debate rationally,  responsibly and respectfully.   On an average day, 93 Americans are killed with guns--93 people a  day, every day. Over 30,000 Americans a year die from guns. Many more  live in daily fear that they could be next.   I hope that we can agree to be more like Heather Gooze, to not  abandon our fellow Americans to face that danger and fear of gun  violence alone. Supporting Senator Feinstein's bill to ban the sale of  ``bump stocks'' would be a good place to start.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to  acknowledge the remarkable courage of a woman from my home State of  Illinois.   Her name is Angela McQueen--``Angie'' to her friends and family.   Ms. McQueen teaches math and physical education at Mattoon High  School in central Illinois.   In late September, she was in the high school cafeteria when she saw  a student pull a semiautomatic handgun from his backpack and start  spraying the cafeteria with gunfire.   Ms. McQueen and other teachers at the high school had recently been  trained on what to do when faced with the threat of gun violence at  school.   It is sad and distressing to think that teachers need such training  today, but that is, sadly, the reality. Thank goodness Angie McQueen  had that training.   The instant she saw the gun, she lunged and pushed the young man's  hand towards the ceiling so he couldn't shoot others.   She said she had only one thought in her head as she acted, as she  put it, ``You're not going to do this to my kids.''   Hundreds of students were in the cafeteria at the time. One student  was shot and hospitalized briefly, and another student suffered minor  injuries when he was apparently grazed by gunfire.   School and law enforcement officials say that Ms. McQueen's selfless  actions likely saved students' lives.   One student who witnessed the incident told a reporter for a local  newspaper, ``Ms. McQueen is like Chuck Norris, basically. She's a  hero.''   Angela McQueen is the daughter of two retired teachers. In her  biography on the school's website, she was asked to describe why she  became a teacher. The first reason she gave: ``I wanted to make the  world a better place.''   She has certainly done that.   Ms. McQueen is modest. She doesn't like being in the spotlight, but  she recently allowed the city and families of Mattoon to thank her  publicly at a reception at the school.   Mattoon School superintendent Larry Lilly undoubtedly spoke for many  when he said, ``We are forever grateful to Angela for her courageous  actions that saved the lives of our kids. She was a ray of light in our  darkest hour.''   ``You're not going to do this to my kids.'' That was what Angela  McQueen vowed before she risked her life to disarm a young man with a  semiautomatic handgun.   I hope that all Members of Congress will take those words to heart as  we debate gun safety and what we can do as a society to protect our  children and all Americans from gun violence.   Mr LEAHY Mr. President, we are a Nation of immigrants. That should be  an obvious point, but it bears repeating at a time when our President  sees political advantage in trafficking in xenophobic scapegoating.  Unless you are Native American, you come from a line of people who come  from somewhere else. Indeed, that simple fact is an integral part of  the American story.   We are also a nation that believes that anything is possible. Our  ancestors and relatives journeyed here because, in America, where you  come from does not determine what you can accomplish. In this great  country, as long as you work hard and play by the rules, you can  achieve your dreams. That itself is the American Dream.   No single group of people embodies these ideals more than our  Nation's Dreamers. Dreamers grew up in this country; they were brought  here as children. They seek only the opportunity to contribute to our  Nation and to be legally recognized as the Americans that they are.  Dreamers are our neighbors, our teachers, and our first responders.   Nearly a thousand Dreamers serve in our Armed Forces, risking their  lives to defend the only country they have ever known as home. We  cannot in good faith claim to care about the American Dream if we  neglect to protect the very people who are living it.   Take, for example, Dr. Juan Conde, a DACA recipient and a resident of  Vermont. Dr. Conde was born in Mexico and brought to the United States  as a child by his mother. In 2007, his mother was tragically taken by  cancer. Showing remarkable courage and determination for a young man,  this tragedy inspired Dr. Conde to find a way to help cancer patients  like his mother; yet he was unable to become an oncologist due to his  immigration status. So instead, he decided to obtain a Ph.D. in cancer  research from the University of Texas.   Dr. Conde wanted to treat cancer patients, not just study the  disease. After receiving DACA status in 2012, he was empowered to  pursue his medical degree. He is currently a medical student at  University of Vermont's Lanier College of Medicine.   Dr. Conde hopes to spend his life in the United States treating  cancer patients and helping to find a cure for the disease. My hope is  that we can make that happen, not just for Dr. Conde but for every  other Dreamer. There are almost 800,000 Dreamers like Dr. Conde, all of  whom have just as much potential to make our communities and our  country truly great. To deny them these opportunities because they were  brought here as children is as senseless as it is cruel.   Yet that is the decision the president made. He could have worked  with Congress to find a permanent solution for Dreamers while leaving  DACA protections in place. Instead, he cast them aside. His  administration has made absurd, nonfactual, and offensive arguments in  support of that decision ever since. When Attorney General Sessions  announced that DACA was being terminated, he argued that the program  was an example of the Obama administration's repeated failure to  enforce our immigration laws. He argued that such failure caused crime,  violence, and even terrorism. During Senate Judiciary Committee  hearings, I pressed both the Attorney General and his Department on  this point, to name just one Dreamer who was involved in terrorist  activity. Of course, they could not, but apparently, fear-mongering is  more effective than acknowledging simple truths.   By definition, Dreamers are law-abiding. They seek nothing more than  to contribute to our country. If the President refuses to stand with  Dreamers, then Congress must. We have done it before in the Senate.  Four years ago, 68 Senators, Democrats and Republicans, voted for  comprehensive immigration reform legislation that I managed on the  Senate floor. That legislation included key protections for Dreamers,  including an expedited pathway to citizenship. It is time for the  Senate to act again now and for the House to follow suit. The future of  Dreamers and the fate of the American Dream itself lies in our hands.                            ____________________
