 I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum  call be rescinded.    Madam President, I hope my colleagues had a good time  with their families over Thanksgiving. I sure did. The flu intervened  in some of our visitations, but we were able to join by Zoom and by  telephone and had a great time in that holiday. I am looking forward to  even better times for the Christmas holiday that is coming up.   Before we can leave for Christmas, we have some work to do. There is  a priority for this Congress as it ends this calendar year and fiscal  year. We have many challenges ahead of us.   The leader came to the floor and talked to us about the Omnibus  appropriations bill, which we know has to be done. We don't want the  government shutting down.   We have the National Defense Authorization Act, which is critically  important for the defense of our Nation and for our continued presence  in places like Ukraine, to provide assistance to the people there who  are fighting for their freedom and literally fighting Vladimir Putin  for their lives.   We also have issues before us such as the Respect for Marriage Act,  which confirms, I hope, on a bipartisan basis in the Senate, that we  stand behind the Obergefell decision, that we believe people should be  able to make their own decisions about the people they love and marry  on a civil basis. And I believe that should pass--and I hope it does  pass--before we leave for Christmas.                                  DREAM Act    Madam President, there is another issue that is of urgent priority  that is personal to me. It deals with the legal limbo that has been  created for hundreds of thousands of Dreamers and DACA recipients who  are now uncertain of their future.   These recipients are immigrants who were brought to the United States  as children. Some were toddlers and infants; others, kids in their  teens, brought here by their families. They didn't make the decision to  come, but they made a life when they came. They attended school. They  grew up in America. They stood up in the classroom every morning, as  all kids do across this country, pledging allegiance to that flag,  believing it was their flag and their country. But that is not how the  law sees it.   Some of those, just babies when they arrived, grew up here and were  educated in school. They went to school with our kids and our  grandkids. Their parents attended church with our families.   Responding to the need to take care of these young people and give  them a path to citizenship--a chance to become a permanent part of  America, legally in this country--20 years ago, I introduced the DREAM  Act. We came up with the term ``DREAM Act'' between myself and Senator  Orrin Hatch, a Republican conservative from Utah, who was my original  cosponsor of the bill.   It was a bipartisan bill. Here was Durbin from the State of Illinois  and Hatch from Utah, agreeing on a bill that was so important that we  argued between ourselves who would be the lead sponsor. I deferred to  Senator Hatch the first time we introduced it because the Republicans  were in the majority and I thought it gave us a better chance to pass  it.   As time passed, Senator Hatch lost his interest in the issue and  withdrew as a sponsor. But over the years we have had the sponsorship  of many Republicans who believe, as I do, that these young Dreamers  deserve a chance to prove themselves and to earn their way to  citizenship in the United States.   We have had a few conservative Republican cosponsors, but we needed  many more. We needed 60 votes to pass  [[Page S6812]]  the bill on the floor of the U.S. Senate. We had several attempts at  it--I think almost five--where we brought the measure of the DREAM Act  to the floor. And we made it clear: You had to have come to the United  States as a child; you must have lived here without any substantial  legal or criminal record; and you must be given a chance to have a  citizenship opportunity in your life. That was basically the bill.    We brought it to the floor five different times. We had a majority  each time. But in the Senate, a majority is not enough. As you know, it  takes 60 votes. We fell short each of those times.   I remember one Saturday--it was a lameduck session at the end of the  year--and we decided to make a try for the DREAM Act. Harry Reid was  the Democratic leader in the Senate. He said: I will give you a chance  for a vote. So we had that vote on a Saturday morning. The whole  Gallery was filled with young Dreamers. They decided to come in their  caps and gowns from their graduation ceremonies. So they brought those  caps and gowns out of storage and wore them on the floor to prove that  they were a valuable addition to the future of the United States. They  were so excited to think that this will be their chance.   Well, sadly, we had a majority but not the supermajority that the  Senate requires. I met with them afterward, and there were a lot of  tears that were shed by them--and by me--as they thought about what it  meant. They were so uncertain about where they were going to go and  what their future was going to be.   I decided to try a different approach. If we couldn't pass the DREAM  Act in the Senate, maybe, just maybe, my cosponsor in the DREAM Act,  the former Illinois Senator Barack Obama, could find a way as President  of the United States to help. And thank the Lord, he did. He came up  with DACA. This was the approach that said to these young people: Here  is what I can give you. If you will stand up and apply each year to be  protected in the United States, we will give you a chance. If we check  your background and everything is fine, we will give you 2 years at a  time to stay here and live in the United States as Dreamers, be able to  work legally, and no fear of deportation. He issued that Executive  order. I remember it well. The day was August 15, 2012, 10 years ago-- more than 10 years ago. Congressman Luis Gutierrez of Chicago and I  decided that we would have a signup occasion at Navy Pier, a well-known  landmark in the city of Chicago. We didn't know how many young people  were going to show up to sign up for DACA. We brought together a few  immigration attorneys who volunteered their time to help them fill out  the forms.   And we waited.   We started hearing this rumbling of people who were interested. I  remember speaking to Congressman Gutierrez and wondering: Are we going  to have 100, 200? The estimate started going up just wildly as people  started saying there will be many more than you could imagine. It  turned out there were thousands. Ten thousand applicants showed up at  Navy Pier on that day. They overwhelmed all the volunteer attorneys  that we had. Some of them had been waiting outside through the night to  make sure they had their chance to sign up for DACA. In the end, some  780,000--maybe even more--across the United States answered President  Obama's call and were protected by DACA. What they have done with their  lives is nothing short of remarkable.   Let me tell you about one who I think is just so amazing. This is a  young lady who was in the line set up in 2012, August of 2012. She was  one of the first Dreamers to receive the protection of DACA--a young  woman from Chicago. Her name is Karen Villagomez. Karen's parents  brought her to America from Mexico when she was just 2 years old--same  age my mother was when her family came to the United States. I know the  Presiding Officer is an immigrant herself and proud of her family  story, the courage your mother showed especially bringing you and your  family to the United States. Karen was 2 years old when she was brought  into the United States from Mexico. She didn't really discover that she  was undocumented until she applied for college. She was accepted. She  grew up in Chicago and had been accepted to college at the University  of Rochester in New York. But because she was undocumented and DACA,  she, unfortunately, didn't qualify for any Federal assistance to help  her through school. That meant working jobs, her parents helping her,  putting together all the money they could so that she could go to  college. She wasn't eligible for 10 cents in Federal financial aid, but  she wasn't going to be stopped.   Karen was a freshman at the University of Rochester of New York when  I first heard of her. It was spring break of her freshman year in  college. She was hoping to fly home to Chicago to surprise her family.  Instead, she was arrested and detained by ICE. One lawyer told her she  probably had about 4 months before she was going to be deported back to  Mexico. Karen and her family called my office. There was a lot of  emotion in that phone conversation. My staff and I reached out to the  Federal Agencies and said: Don't deport her. Give her a chance. You  won't regret it. She has no background that suggests she is any danger  to this country, but she has so much promise and determination. Give  her a chance.   Well, they decided to give us a reprieve, a short-term suspension of  the deportation. Karen went on with one reprieve after another, never  knowing whether she was going to be deported before she could even  finish college. But she finally did. Then she came back to Chicago. She  was accepted at Northwestern University Law School--law school. With  DACA, she was able to work as a paralegal, then as a counsel for the  city of Chicago. Graduating law school, she became a clerk for a  Federal judge in Chicago. She got married.   Three weeks ago, on election day, at long last, she was sworn in,  naturalized as an American citizen. I was there to see her take the  oath of citizenship. You know what she was going to do as soon as the  ceremony ended? Walk across the street, register to vote, and vote as  an American citizen for the first time on the day that she was  naturalized. There wasn't a dry eye in that court chamber as we all  celebrated this wonderful journey of this amazing young woman. And,  incidentally, there is a baby on the way. She and her husband are so  proud they are both part of this country and its future.    More than 830,000 young people just like her have been able to live  safely and work in America because of DACA. But there is an uncertainty  as to what is going to happen in the future. Last month, the Fifth  Circuit Federal Court remanded a case to the lower court to determine  whether DACA would remain the law of the land. It is still under  attack.   Here is what it gets down to: Unless Congress acts in the next 3  weeks to protect DACA recipients, DACA could end as soon as next year.  An average of 1,000 DACA recipients would lose their jobs and their  legal right to work every single week in healthcare and in education,  sectors of our economy that are so essential to our growth. DACA  recipients are doing the work. They turn out to be the nurses,  sometimes the doctors, as well as teachers, engineers, policemen,  firefighters. And they are going to be deported if we don't come to  their rescue and finally make DACA legal once and for all.   Does anyone think for one minute America would be better off if we  started deporting doctors and nurses and teachers who are now protected  by DACA or men and women who are risking their lives in the military or  our police and firefighters? The answer is clearly no.   You know, right before Thanksgiving, a few hundred Dreamers flew to  Washington. I think the Presiding Officer said you met with them. They  met with me and were telling me what is at stake here.   One young man, in particular--what an amazing story. Because of DACA,  he was able to graduate from college with an engineering degree. He  decided he would start his own company since he had that opportunity.  Now he has started several companies and is paying--he said last year,  he paid $180,000 in Federal taxes. And I said to the group he assembled  there, there are many large corporations in America that don't pay as  much in taxes as this young man, this DACA protectee, was able to pay.  It is an indication of the creativity, determination, and the quality  of these young people. We have  [[Page S6813]]  to give them a chance to be part of our future.   Some Republicans have cosponsored the Dream Act. Senator Lindsey  Graham, my friend, former chairman of the Senate Committee on the  Judiciary, is currently a lead sponsor with me. I have also worked with  Senator Graham and other Republican Senators over the years to deal  with comprehensive immigration reform.   I have had conversations with a number of Republican and Democratic  Senators who understand the urgency of dealing with this issue. I am  not going to name names here or in the hallway, but I will tell you,  conversations are taking place, and I am encouraged by them. I will  join them and provide whatever resources I can or, if I can help by  standing to the side, I will do that too. The goal is to make sure  these DACA recipients have a future. We need 10 Republican Senators to  join all the Democrats to get that done--just 10. We can break the  filibuster, get the supermajority we need under the Senate rules.   I have heard many Republican colleagues say they won't help DACA  recipients or even talk about immigration until we stop this so-called  flood of immigrants and asylum seekers at the southern border. Look,  every Democrat in the Senate agrees we need an orderly process at our  border, but simply closing the border to families fleeing violence is  not a simple or practical or worthwhile situation. That is why Biden,  as President, is adding capacity and building better systems at the  border. We need to do more, and we should do it together on a  bipartisan basis.   Today, there are over 23,000 Customs and Border Protection agents  working at the southwest border, and ICE has surged over 1,300  personnel to stop human smuggling networks. The administration is also  building new migrant processing facilities, working on a system that  allows meritorious asylum claims to be processed sooner.   But we can't fix these problems alone. We can't do it all in 3 weeks.  Many of my Republican colleagues have tried to blame the families who  are coming across the border for fentanyl. The overwhelming majority of  fentanyl that enters this country isn't being smuggled in by  undocumented immigrants. It is coming in through legal ports of entry  by people who are authorized to enter the United States. Many of these  people are U.S. citizens. I am not making excuses for them, but for  goodness' sake, let's be honest about the source of the problem.   Let me give you a few numbers that tell the story. This fiscal year,  Customs and Border Patrol seized six times more illegal drugs from  authorized travelers at land ports of entry than they did from migrants  crossing the border--six times--and nearly seven times more fentanyl  was seized at land ports of entry than at the border.   I want to stop the deadly flow of fentanyl. It hits my State and all  across America. You won't do it by turning away asylum seekers and  separating parents and children. You do it scanning every passenger and  commercial vehicle and all freight traffic crossing the border. We have  the technology to do it. Let's get it done on a bipartisan basis.   President Biden has signed the omnibus funding legislation and  infrastructure bill, which we talked about before. It included  resources to meet the screening goal, which ought to be our basic  starting point of this conversation. Sadly, a majority of Republican  Senators voted against both of these bills, but I beg them to come back  and join us again and see if there is some common ground. We can fix  America's immigration system in a way that honors our values and does  make us safer.   We need to focus on reality. We need less political posturing and  more compromise and we need to start in that lameduck session to  protect the Dreamers for their future and our own.   I yield the floor.    I announce that the Senator from Georgia (Mr. Warnock) is  necessarily absent.
