 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for  as much time as I may require.    Madam President, the late historian, Arthur  Schlesinger, Jr., said this: ``Self-righteousness in retrospect is  easy--also cheap.'' The late Samuel Huntington, who was a Harvard  professor of U.S. history and politics, wrote, in effect, that most of  our politics is about setting great goals for ourselves--we, the  American people--and then the struggle we have with the disappointment  we feel when we don't reach those high goals, like ``all men are  created equal.''   Ben Hooks, who was from Memphis and a well-known citizen of our State  and a good friend and once president of the NAACP, used to tell his  students at the University of Memphis:         Remember that our country, America, is a work in progress.       We've come a long way, but we have a long way to go.    It is in light of those three comments that I would like to discuss  the effort that some people made last night to tear down President  Andrew Jackson's statue in Lafayette Square across from the White  House.   I believe it is always appropriate to review the monuments and the  places that we name to see if there is a more appropriate name in the  context of today's times. For example, in this Capitol, every State has  two statues. From Tennessee, it is Andrew Jackson and John Sevier.   Senator Blunt, who is the chairman of our Rules Committee, tells us  that, at any given time, some of those statues are in rotation because  the State of Mississippi or Tennessee or Oregon or some other State may  have decided, instead of those two individuals, we would like to send  up another statue. We would like, in the context of today's times, to  name somebody else.   As we think about statues that are already named for generals in the  Confederacy or the Union--a war that was fought a long time ago--it is  appropriate, I think, to keep in mind that we have had a lot of wars  since then: two World Wars, Korea, Vietnam. We have had a lot of very  distinguished generals. We have had courageous Congressional Medal of  Honor winners. Maybe in the context of today's times, there is a place  for Camp MacArthur or Camp Eisenhower or Alvin C. York, who is a  Congressional Medal of Honor winner and hero from Tennessee. It is  always appropriate to review the places that are named and the  monuments we put up to see if there should be a better name or a better  place for a monument in the context of today's times.   But what about Andrew Jackson, whose statue is one that the State of  Tennessee has sent here, whose statue is of him on a horse outside the  White House at Lafayette Square? The similar statue is in Jackson  Square in New Orleans. What about Andrew Jackson? Let's make the case  for Andrew Jackson.   Presidential historians, almost without exception, put him in the top  10 of America's Presidents. They see him as the sophisticated, often  subtle political actor that he really was. What they realize--and,  unfortunately, what only dedicated students of the American Presidency  often realize--is that Jackson was arguably the most important American  President between Thomas Jefferson and Abraham Lincoln because, much  like Lincoln, he preserved the Union. If not for Jackson's devotion to  the Union against his own local  [[Page S3145]]  political interest, the Union might well have fallen apart in 1832 and  1833.   Jackson risked everything to keep our Union together instead of  siding with South Carolina's U.S. Senator John Calhoun's doctrine of  nullification. When a serious conflict of crisis arose, when South  Carolina decided that, following Calhoun's doctrine of nullification,  it could decide which Federal laws it could follow, it was Jackson who  stood up and said: Our Federal Union must be preserved and Jackson who  had the political will and the skill to make sure it was preserved.  Jackson's decisions as President gave us an additional three decades to  form what Lincoln eventually called ``the mystic chords of memory'' in  his first inaugural address. Surely--surely that is worth recognition.   Andrew Jackson was our first nonaristocratic President. When he was  born in 1767, it was not possible or plausible that the young boy,  orphaned at 14, could someday rise in an emerging Republic. Jackson  wasn't born rich. He wasn't born into privilege. He fought for  everything he had, and he rose to our government's highest office  through the sheer force of personality and political courage. That is  the case for Andrew Jackson.   Let us also recognize that Andrew Jackson was not perfect. In fact,  he was at the center of the two original sins of this country: slavery  and the treatment of Native Americans. But if we are looking for  perfection, we are not likely to find it in American history or the  history of almost any country or in human nature.   The historian Jon Meacham, who won a Pulitzer Prize for his biography  of Jackson and who wrote a biography of Thomas Jefferson, said that  when Jefferson wrote the words, ``all men are created equal,'' he was  almost certainly writing about all White men. Those were the context of  the times for Thomas Jefferson.    So what do we do about Jefferson if he was writing that all White men  are created equal in the context of those times? What do we do about  Jefferson, who--the only slaves that he freed, apparently, were those  that he fathered with his slave mistress, Sally Hemings? What do we do  about George Washington and Mount Vernon and the slaves that he owned?  What do we do about Abraham Lincoln, who some people say was slow to  act on emancipation? What about Franklin D. Roosevelt and his  internment of American citizens who were Japanese in camps during World  War II or, more recently, what do we do about Bill Clinton, who signed  the Defense of Marriage Act, which would not be in the context of  today's times, if two recent Supreme Court decisions are to be  followed, as they will be?   Let's not just pick on our Presidents. What are we going to do about  the Congress, the Senators, and the Members of the House? They approved  the Trail of Tears, Andrew Jackson's removal of the Cherokees to  Oklahoma. The Congress did. And they approved the laws requiring  segregation. Congress did. And what about the people who elected the  Congress? They approved those Members of Congress who approved of  segregation, who approved of the internment of Japanese in camps.   What are we going to do about us, the people of the United States? Do  we pretend that we didn't exist during that history, when decisions  were made that we would not make today or we would not approve of  today, some of which would be abhorrent today? Do we try to burn down  all the monuments, burn down Mount Vernon, burn down the Jefferson  Memorial, Hyde Park, home of Franklin D. Roosevelt? Do we try to erase  all of that from our history? That is not what we should do. We should  not try to erase our history. We should not try to pretend it doesn't  exist. We shouldn't ignore our history.   Here is what I think we should do. No. 1, as I said earlier,  recognize that it is always appropriate to review the places that we  have named or the monuments that we put up--just like the monuments of  States in here--to see if there is a more appropriate monument or named  place that is appropriate in the context of today's times. Remember, as  Ben Hooks said: America is a work in progress. It is always changing,  and our monuments or the places we name can change with that. That is  an appropriate, healthy exercise to go through. That is No. 1.   But, No. 2, with the history that includes things we today abhor, we  should try to learn from those things and build a better future. Let me  give an example.   Each year, I bring onto the floor of the Senate teachers of American  history who have been selected to attend the Academy for Teachers of  American History that I helped to create when I first came to the  Senate. I thought it was important to learn American history so  children can grow up knowing what it means to be an American.   When they come to the floor, they look for the various desks because  the desks of the Senate are what best describe them. They will go to  find Daniel Webster's desk, which is still there. They will go to the  back over there and find the desk that the three Kennedy brothers used,  where they sat. The ones from Tennessee will come here because Howard  Baker had my desk and so did Fred Thompson, the desk I now have. They  are interested in the desks of Senator McConnell and Senator Schumer  because they are the leaders, and they go to Jefferson Davis's desk.   Jefferson Davis was a U.S. Senator who had a great deal to do with  the building of this Capitol. But he, like many other U.S. Senators in  the South, resigned from the Senate and joined the Confederate Army.  Jefferson Davis became President of the Confederacy.   When I take them to Jefferson Davis's desk, these teachers of  American history, this is what I tell them; that there is on that desk  what looks like a chop mark. The story that is told is that it was  created by a Union soldier who came into this Chamber when the Union  soldiers occupied Washington, DC, and began to destroy the desk of a  man who was the president of the Confederacy, Jefferson Davis, until he  was stopped by his commanding officer, who told him: Stop that. We are  here to save the Union, not to destroy it.   What do we do with Jefferson Davis's desk? I say keep it there. I say  to learn from it, to learn from the fact that there was a Civil War;  that there was a Confederacy; that Senators left this body; that Union  soldiers were here; that one wanted to chop it up and another one would  say, his commanding officer: Let's bring a better future. Stop that. We  are here not to destroy the Union but to save it.   There are lessons in American history. There are lessons that we  should learn. The lesson of Ben Hooks: We are a work in progress. We  have come a long way. We have a long way to go; the lesson of Samuel  Huntington, that most of our politics is about setting high goals for  ourselves, that all men are created equal, and then dealing with the  disappointment, struggling with the disappointment of not reaching  those goals, deciding what to do about it.   Do we dishonor Andrew Jackson's effort to keep our country together  between Jefferson and Lincoln? Do we dishonor Thomas Jefferson's  eloquence? Do we dishonor George Washington's probity in character or  Lincoln's courage or FDR's grand leadership during World War II all  because they weren't perfect, all because they did things and lived  things and said things that today we wouldn't say? I think not. Doing  any of this would be a terrible misunderstanding of American history  and of human nature. It would be ahistorical.   In his first inaugural address, Abraham Lincoln appealed to the  better angels of our nature. If there are better angels of our nature,  I guess that means there must be worse angels in us as well, not just  in Washington and Jefferson and Jackson and Roosevelt and great men or  great women but in all of us. There are the better angels, and there  are the worst angels. In this country, our goal is to bring out the  best in us, which does not mean ignore the worst.   We need to be honest about our weaknesses. We need to be proud of our  strengths. We need to learn from both to create a better future for the  United States of America.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
