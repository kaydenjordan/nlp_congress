 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 2, after line 21, insert the following:        ``(D) Describe how the State will coordinate subsidized       employment funded under this subsection with the Federal       Work-Study Program, career pathway (as defined in section       3(7) of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act)       services, and other Federal programs to help low-income       individuals complete education and training programs and       enter the workforce.''.    The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 396, the gentlewoman from  Oregon (Ms. Bonamici) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Oregon.    Mr. Chairman, the amendment I am offering with my  colleague, Representative Susan Davis, strengthens coordination between  subsidized employment through the Temporary Assistance for Needy  Families, TANF, program, other Federal workforce development programs,  and the Federal Work-Study program.   The goal of the Accelerating Individuals into the Workforce Act is to  help low-income individuals gain the experience and skills necessary  for long-term success in the workforce and access to family-sustaining  wages. Yet studies of the long-term effects on unemployment from short- term, subsidized employment programs demonstrate differing outcomes,  which is why I commend my colleagues for including robust reporting and  evaluation requirements in the underlying bill.   We already know that other efforts have clear long-term benefits.  Adults who attain postsecondary credentials and degrees are much more  likely to be employed and much less likely to rely on public  assistance. For example, about 90 percent of young adults who earn a  bachelor's degree are employed. The employment rate for those who don't  complete high school is just 48 percent. Not surprisingly, the vast  majority--approximately 93 percent--of TANF recipients did not attain  education beyond high school.   Helping more low-income adults complete postsecondary credential  programs and degrees is a proven strategy for reducing reliance on  public assistance and promoting self-sufficient households. This is a  bipartisan goal.   Our amendment advances this goal by helping to give more low-income  parents high-quality work opportunities while enrolled in postsecondary  programs. Currently, the Federal Work-Study program provides part-time  jobs to students. Studies show that those students who are lucky enough  to get a Federal Work-Study job have higher completion rates and are  more likely to work in a position that aligns with their program of  study.   Unfortunately, Federal Work-Study alone cannot meet the demand for  connecting low-income students with valuable, work-based learning  opportunities. In fact, only about 2 percent of community college  students participate in Federal Work-Study.   The subsidized employment program authorized in the bill we are  debating today could help address this unmet need and target additional  support to low-income student parents, helping  [[Page H5120]]  them attain a credential or degree and vastly improving their long-term  employment prospects.   Administering the subsidized employment program in conjunction with  the Federal Work-Study program requires coordination among State  agencies and higher education institutions. My amendment encourages  this coordination, and I encourage Members to support it.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, a number of State programs leverage  Federal Work-Study funds to help TANF recipients who are enrolled in  community college programs meet work requirements and get real-world  experience in jobs that reinforce what they are studying.   Additionally, the Government Accountability Office has recommended  improving coordination between employment and training programs, and  the Department of Health and Human Services guidelines on helping TANF  recipients succeed in career pathways makes recommendations for using  the Federal Work-Study program in conjunction with TANF to boost the  attainment of industry-recognized credentials.   There is precedent and widespread support for improving the  coordination of programs that help low-income individuals gain work  experience to subsidize employment. Again, our amendment does not  require States to devote funds from TANF-subsidized employment programs  to low-income student parents, but it does ask States to consider how  they are using subsidized employment--whether through TANF or Federal  Work-Study--in concert to give more people the opportunity to earn a  higher education degree or credential and, thereby, a significantly  improved chance at finding a long-term, living-wage job.   Mr. Chairman, I ask my colleagues to support this commonsense  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.
