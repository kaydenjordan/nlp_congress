 Madam President, had there been a recorded vote, I would  have voted no on the confirmations of Executive Calendar No. 1101, E.  Martin Estrada, of California, to be United States Attorney for the  Central District of California for the term of four years and No. 1102,  Gregory J. Haanstad, of Wisconsin, to be United States Attorney for the  Eastern District of Wisconsin for the term of four years.                            ____________________
