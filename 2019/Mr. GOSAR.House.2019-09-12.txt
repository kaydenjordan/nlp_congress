 Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I rise in opposition to this unwarranted legislation. Like the two  bills we debated yesterday, this bill is another attempt to hinder  American energy dominance and our national security.   As someone who has visited the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, I  know the support that responsible energy production in section 1002 has  among the local population.   Responsible energy production will provide much-needed employment  opportunities to the local population as well as critical tax revenue  for local government services. Not only does energy development in  section 1002 have the support of inhabitants in the region, but it also  has the support of our colleague, Congressman   Don Young, and Alaska's  two Senators. In addition, the majority of Alaskans support it; every  Alaskan Governor since 1980 has supported it; 100 percent of Alaska's  congressional delegation since 1980 has supported it; and the Natives  who live right there, the village of Kaktovik,  [[Page H7680]]  the Inupiat, the proper Tribe that is closest to them and the only  Tribe within section 1002, support it.   This bill follows a bad pattern of how Democratic members on the  Natural Resources Committee operate. They do not care that local  representatives and residents oppose this legislation. They believe  that Washington, D.C., and extremist national environmental groups know  best and everyone else should just go along with their extremism. And  it double-crosses the tax bill passed just last year.   Section 1002 has the potential to benefit greatly our country's  energy security. Estimates from the U.S. Geological Survey believe  section 1002 contains more than 12 billion barrels of oil, not to make  mention of natural gas.   Once again, Mr. Chair, we have an example of the other side putting  left-wing extremism and their environmental donors ahead of local  voices, our national security, and the needs of the American people. I  am a firm believer in an all-of-the-above approach to responsible  energy production and multiple use. Our public lands, like section  1002, have nearly unlimited potential to power our country.   Further, we can do all this while protecting the environment. Section  1002 is a small sliver in this area, 2,000 acres, in fact.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose this legislation.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer an amendment that  allows the section 2 moratorium in this bill to go into effect when the  Department of the Interior, in consultation with the Department of  Labor, certifies that the anti-energy moratorium in the bill will not  kill a substantial number of Tribal, minority, and women jobs.   We heard arguments from Democratic Members on the other side of the  aisle against a similar amendment that this amendment doesn't matter  and is meaningless. How callous that response. Tell the opponents of  this amendment to tell that to the single mother working to put food on  the table for her two children that her job doesn't matter.   How about the minority family who just moved into a new neighborhood  so their kids could go to better schools? Tell those hardworking  minority parents these jobs don't matter.   Tell those local Tribe members, the Inupiat, the only Tribe within  the 1002 section who want these jobs, whose prosperity comes to their  community with these jobs, that these economic benefits don't matter.   Under the current administration, unemployment has reached record  lows. In August, the national unemployment rate sat at 3.7 percent,  with the unemployment rate for African American workers sitting at 5.5  percent, breaking the previous record of 5.9 percent, which was set in  May of 2018.   According to a recent report by The Washington Post, a bastion of  conservative dictation, nearly 90 percent of the jobs added under this  administration have gone to minority communities. This can be  attributed to, for the first time, a majority of new hires are people  between the ages of 25 and 54 and are from minority communities.   According to statistics published by the American Petroleum  Institute, minorities will comprise one-third of the total workforce in  the oil and gas sector by 2030. Women already comprise more than 15  percent of the oil and gas workforce.   These are good-paying jobs, $90,000 and above, that hardworking  families depend on. This legislation puts these employment  opportunities and associated economic benefits at risk.   America's energy renaissance has boosted the economies of previously  left-behind towns in areas and sections of this country and has turned  them into vibrant communities.   Mr. Chairman, this is a commonsense amendment, protects minority  Tribal members and women jobs, and puts the interests of the American  workforce first.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, how offensive. How offensive that argument,  particularly when you look at the Department of Labor. Hardly a bastion  in regards to the corruptness, at least in this administration.  [[Page H7683]]    Amazing. Amazing that jobs that we see the empowerment of people,  taking them away from the victims, victimhood, that Democrats so  desperately need, particularly, the Native Americans who are empowered  right here with the money and the jobs to lift them out from the  poverty that they actually see.   Amazing. Absolutely amazing.   So it seems to me that when you start looking at this application in  consultation with the Department of Labor, makes a big, big difference.   Now, when you look at this, American oil and gas production is nearly  responsible for 10 million jobs. That is a huge amount of sector. And  we discussed earlier that 90 percent of these jobs in this sector are  going to women and minorities. That is a fabulous number. That is the  American Dream.   This is a commonsense application that Congress has got to get used  to to understand the ramifications, the true ramifications of our  intent.   Mr. Chair, I ask everybody to vote for this amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous consent that my amendment be  modified in the form I have placed at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   The modified amendment allows section 2 of the bill to go into effect  when the DOI, in consultation with the Fish and Wildlife Service,  certifies that section 2 of the bill will not harm the caribou herd  population.   It has been proven that, over time, the caribou herds of the North  Slope can coexist and even thrive with energy development that takes  place there.   Many of my Republican colleagues and Members of the Western Caucus  have seen this firsthand. We have seen the great lengths that industry  and regional governments, Alaska Natives and others have gone through  to protect the caribou.                                time  1045    In March of this year, the Tribal administrator of the Native village  testified: ``Through the use of science and traditional knowledge, best  practices have been implemented to reduce or avoid impacts; such as,  adequate pipeline height to not impede migrating caribou, sufficient  distance between pipeline and road to avoid deterring crossing caribou,  specifications on road height and slope, thoughtful design on road  placement to avoid funneling migrating caribou, aircraft altitude  guidelines, time-area closures, and other restrictions on operations.   ``These safeguards have worked to protect caribou across the North  Slope, and we are confident that, through coordination with the people  of Kaktovik, these mechanisms can be successfully applied to oil and  gas programs in the coastal plain.''   In fact, I have seen that the pipelines that go through the area  occupied by the caribou herd are now 10 to 15 feet in the air, allowing  the herds to easily pass underneath them to facilitate migration and  breeding. And this was done voluntarily, at the industry's expense.   Statistics have shown that the caribou herds that inhabit areas in  and around areas where oil and gas production is taking place have  actually grown in size; whereas, herds that have inhabited areas where  no oil and gas activity has taken place have actually declined.   Yes, we have heard the false narrative from the other side today and  over the years that caribou populations are declining and oil and gas  production is to blame. That is simply not true.   For example, the Porcupine herd located within the proposed  development has fluctuated greatly, even without the oil and gas  development taking place. From 1989 to 2001, the Porcupine herd  population decreased by nearly one third, even while no oil and gas  production was taking place on the lands they inhabited.   This stands in stark contrast with the central Arctic caribou herd  which inhabits lands adjacent to ANWR, where oil and gas development  takes place.   The central Arctic herd grew from 5,000 caribou in 1975, about the  time development began, to almost 32,000 in 2002.   In short, oil and gas production has proven to be good for the  central Arctic caribou herd, and breeding caribou have even been found  to migrate toward the pipelines due to the heat they put off.   The other side uses the caribou herds that live in the ANWR region as  political pawns to try and prevent energy development in the area.   Again, statistics show that the caribou herd populations can benefit  with responsible oil and gas development.   This amendment challenges the false narrative that has clearly been  dis-proven with the population explosion of the central Arctic caribou  herd in oil-and-gas-producing areas.   Further, this commonsense amendment provides further protection for  caribou herds by ensuring this bill won't negatively impact these  populations.   Mr. Chair, I urge everybody to vote for this amendment, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, once again, we are going to debunk the flawed  science that the other side looks at.   Mr. Chair, I have two different articles that have been peer  reviewed, and I include them in the Record.              Caribou Calves and Oil Development--Do They Mix?                             (By Patti Harper)         One thing's certain about day-old caribou calves. ``They       are incredibly cute,'' says Steve Arthur, a biologist with       the Alaska Department of Fish and Game in Fairbanks.        Arthur and his research partner, Patricia Del Vechhio, have       gotten up close and personal with newborn calves of the       Central Arctic caribou herd each June since 2001, in an       effort to address an important question: What is the effect       of oil field development on wildlife?        Arthur says data they have collected suggest that when cows       are displaced from preferred calving areas, their calves are       smaller at birth and may not grow as fast or survive as well.       It's an important finding because some of the calving and       summer ranges of the Central Arctic caribou herd overlap       areas of oil development on Alaska's North Slope.        The herd's size increased from approximately 5,000 caribou       in 1975, about the time development began, to almost 32,000       in 2002. But Arthur says no easy answer can be gleaned about       whether development has affected the herd from looking at       changes in the overall number of caribou, because many       factors affect growth or decline of caribou populations.       Previous researchers have drawn contradictory and       controversial conclusions about whether and how much caribou       are affected, he said.        When the study started, the Alaska Department of Fish and       Game (ADF&G) and other management agencies had been       encouraging oil field developers to minimize impacts and       activities in calving areas, but wanted better data. ``My       interest is in trying to cut through some of the       controversial aspects of some of the previous work that has       been done and come up with something concrete and       measurable,'' Arthur said. The goal has been to identify and       measure the mechanisms through which development disturbance       might affect the caribou population, such as by reducing body       condition, reproductive success or calf survival.        The Bureau of Land Management and ConocoPhillips       contributed major funding for the project, and the National       Park Service and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service also provided       support.        Arthur and his team spent five years measuring calves, and       radiotracking cows and calves, to learn more about such       things as preferred calving areas, feeding ranges, and calf       survival. Each year, they captured 60 to 65 calves during the       two-week calving season in June, fitted them with radio       collars, weighed them and measured metatarsus (lower leg       bone) length. These calves were then located by radio signal       every two weeks through October, and the following March and       June, to find out how many calves survived. Calves were       captured, weighed and measured when they were three and nine       months old. Over the course of the study, 58 cows were fitted       with Global Positioning System (GPS) collars that provided       locations for them every five hours from May through October,       and every two days from November through April.        The work was exciting, but it wasn't easy. The team had to       hope for good flying weather during what could be a somewhat       wintry and blustery June. It was important, Arthur says, to       measure calves within a couple of days of their birth. Having       some older than others would make it difficult to compare       data. Also, at three days old, calves can run pretty fast,       making them difficult to catch. The newborns were caught by       hand--the helicopter landed, Arthur or Del Vecchio jumped       out, grabbed a calf, collared and measured it, and then left       as quickly as possible so its mother, watching from nearby,       could return.        Netting rather than drug-darting was used to capture older       caribou because animals from the herd are an important food       source for residents of the area. Skilled net-gunners leaned       from low-flying helicopters to release the nets. Caribou       caught in the nets were then hobbled and blindfolded to calm       them and again, the process of collaring, weighing and       measuring took just a few minutes before the caribou were       released.        In their recently published interim research technical       report, ``Effects of Oil Field Development on Calf Production       and Survival in the Central Arctic Herd,'' Arthur and Del       Vecchio compare what happened to calves that were born in two       different calving areas, an area that is in a mostly       undeveloped area east of Prudhoe Bay, and an area west of       Prudhoe Bay that has seen increasing development since the       late 1980s. In the western area, calving has shifted south       since development began, though the researchers point out       that it is unclear if the shift resulted from development,       increased herd size, or other factors.        The researchers found that newborns from the western area       on average weighed a little less and were slightly smaller       than those from the eastern area, and that these differences       persisted through at least the first nine months of life.       They also found that calves that were heavier in September       were more likely to survive the following winter. However,       statistically, survival rates did not differ between the       areas--depending on the year, 53 to 87 percent of calves that       were alive at the end of the calving period survived to the       end of their first year. The researchers say it is hard to       detect small differences in survival rates, and other       research has shown that small differences can have       significant effects on caribou population trends.        Arthur and Del Vecchio conclude that the differences in       size and mass of calves may be largely influenced by the       quality of habitat and forage available to cows during the       calving period. ``Thus, displacement of caribou cows from       preferred calving habitats may reduce fitness and survival of       calves,'' they wrote.        As oil exploration and production continue, the approach       set out in this research may help to provide solid answers to       the question of whether development does or does not       adversely affect caribou populations. Arthur and Del Vecchio       explain it this way in their interim report: ``If further       increases in levels of anthropogenic disturbance cause       caribou to reduce their use of preferred habitats, it should       be possible to detect effects of these changes by measuring       birth weights and growth rates of calves. If similar changes       do not occur in less-disturbed areas, then this may be taken       as evidence of possible effects of disturbance.''        Del Vecchio is headed back to the field this June to take       final measurements on calves born in 2006, and to recover       radio collars used in the study. Then, she and Arthur will       take another look at the data and write their final report.        The study collected lots of data. So, when they're finished       with the project report, Arthur, Del Vecchio and others will       look at other ways to use that data. Arthur says the       techniques to analyze GPS data have not kept up with the       ability to gather it, so they may be developing new       techniques. They hope to look more closely at where caribou       move and what habitat they use in relation to oil field       infrastructure.        Dave Yokel, wildlife biologist with the Bureau of Land       Management, said he's looking forward to that sort of       analysis. ``We hope we can use the results to mitigate any       impacts on the Teshepuk (caribou) herd from development in       the NPRA (National Petroleum Reserve Alaska),'' he said. To       do that, the BLM needs to know more about the impacts on       caribou of movement through infrastructure.        Looking back over his experiences in the field, Arthur says       he is struck by the resilience of the calves. ``The thing       that impresses me is how these little calves are so helpless       and weak and they're born in these really harsh conditions--      and yet most of these little guys still make it.'',                                   ____                      [From the ANWR Information Brief]                        Do the Caribou Really Care?         Are caribou affected by oil development on the North Slope?       It would appear not, based on the growing population of herds       that use land in the existing oil fields in northern Alaska.       The population of the Central Arctic caribou herd, which       migrates north each summer into the oil fields near Prudhoe       Bay, has been growing about 8.5 percent per year. Alaska       Dept. of Fish and Game biologists counted 31,857 caribou in       aerial surveys of this herd in July 2002. In July 2000, fish       and game biologists counted 27,128. In 1997, the count was       19,730.        Caribou herd populations rise and fall with natural cycles,       but one explanation biologists have for the increasing       population of the Central Arctic Herd is good calf production       and survival, and high survival of adults.        Pregnant caribou cows in the Central Arctic herd bear their       calves on lands within or near operating oil fields. Some       calves are born within a few hundred meters of oil field       roads.        The Alaska Dept. of Fish and Game findings are backed by       the Argonne National Laboratory. Argonne found no evidence       that oil development harmed the Central Arctic Herd in the       lab's work on the Environmental Impact Statement for an       extension of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System federal right-      of-way.  [[Page H7685]]                                  Arctic caribou herds         Caribou herds rise and fall in natural cycles, and it is       interesting that while populations have been rising in the       Central Arctic Herd (see chart) which use lands in the North       Slope oilfields, populations have been declining in the       Porcupine herd (see chart) which do not use lands where there       is oil and gas development. The Central Arctic Herd increased       to 32,000 animals in 2002, up from 27,000 in 2000. The       Porcupine herd was estimated at 123,000 in 2001, 129,000 in       1998 and 152,000 in 1994. In 1989, the population was counted       at 178,000. Most recent survey taken in 2002.                   Central Arctic, Porcupine caribou mingle         There is now evidence that caribou mix between all of the       North Slope caribou herds, the Porcupine, Central Arctic and       Western Arctic herds. Using analysis of DNA, researchers from       the University of Alaska, Texas A&M University and the U.S.       Dept. of Agriculture found that caribou in the three herds       are genetically related. This reflects migration of animals       between the herds over many generations.                         The truth on Arctic Caribou         Caribou use of the 1002 Area of ANWR varies dramatically       from year to year. In 1995, 92% of the Porcupine Caribou Herd       used this area to calve. In 2000 none did so.        In some years, the Porcupine Herd calves only in Canada.        Choice of calving area depends on snow melt and early       growth of forage plants.        Caribou live a boom and bust cycle, due to predation,       weather, and overhunting.        During the summer, caribou frequently use oil field roads       and gravel pads as insect relief habitat: they stand on the       elevated gravel pads because fewer mosquitoes and flies       harass them there.        North slope oil facilities are specifically designed to       allow caribou migration with elevated pipes to allow caribou       to freely walk underneath and limited use of service roads.        With 30 years of contact with oil development to go by, the       industry has shown that caribou and oil fields can       successfully co-exist. The Central Arctic Herd, which calves       in the vicinity of the Prudhoe Bay, Kuparuk, and Milne Point       oil fields, has increased 900% from an estimated 3,000       animals in the early 1970s to 32,000 in 2002.                                 ANWR Facts:         Refuge totals 19.6 million acres.        8 million acres designated Wilderness;        Coastal Plain, 1.5 million acres, set aside by Congress for       study of oil potential;        Only a small percentage of Coastal plain, about 2,000       acres, would be impacted by oil development;               The coastal plain is not a pristine wilderness:         About 40 guide outfits offer hunting and recreation       services in the coastal plain; A community, Kaktovik, exists       in the Coastal Plain; Military installations operate on the       Plain now and in the past.     Mr. Chair, once again, we see the caribou herds that have  been associated with oil and gas drilling actually expanding from 5,000  to 32,000.   Facts are hard to come by when they don't benefit you in the  discussion. It is simply untrue what they have been trying to narrate  in this respect.   This truly shows that you can work hand in hand, being  environmentally friendly and having energy independence, empowering  local communities and Tribes, looking at this in a comprehensive  fashion.   This is a commonsense amendment. This is not about delay. This is  about proper orientation, whether it be jobs associated with it or  whether it be the numbers of critical habitat and numbers of  populations within that critical habitat.   The facts just don't stand up for the other side.   Mr. Chair, once again, this is a very good amendment. Once again,  when we want to start talking about facts, facts that are exploited by  the other side that are truly false, we have to start looking at,  didactically, the facts.   When a herd goes from 5,000 caribou to 32,000 when it is associated  with oil and gas drilling in that area, where a herd declines by one  third where there is no drilling there, there has got to be some kind  of a prospect here.   Heat doesn't just rise. It is associated with the protection.   So, when you start looking at what industry and the individuals have  done to promote these herds, this is a stellar amendment.   Mr. Chair, I hope that everybody votes for this, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
