 Cliff, may I recognize two members of the Albania  Parliament.    What we do not only in the Congress, but as former  Members, because Albania is still an emerging democracy, I would like  to recognize Monika Kryemadhi, who is the chairwoman of the party,  Movement for Social Integration, that made the difference so that  Albania can function there, as a coalition government there, and she is  with us today. I would just--and her other colleagues who are also with  us, Mr. Petrit Vasili, chair of the parliamentary group, and Mr. Eriol  Braimllari, head of foreign relations.   And I would like to, before we conclude, recognize that they are  looking to America to make Albania stronger. These were two countries  that were created by the United States. Woodrow Wilson recognized  Albania in 1919. It almost didn't exist as a country and was about to  be put into Yugoslavia. And 10 years ago, George W. Bush recognized her  also, and this is the 10th anniversary.   Thank you very much.
