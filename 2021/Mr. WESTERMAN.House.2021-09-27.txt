 Mr. Speaker, there is no doubt we need infrastructure  funding in this country. Too bad we couldn't have taken this bill  through committee and debated that. But oh what a tangled web we weave  when we practice first to deceive.   Mr. Speaker, my, my, what a tangled web of deceit House Democrats  have woven, with this bill as only one of the threads. Let's take a  brief look at a couple of the biggest lies that are spun in this  dangerous web.   The first lie is that this is a bipartisan infrastructure bill. This  bill is not bipartisan, and Democrats know it. You can't have a  bipartisan House bill that didn't go through committee that will not go  to conference and has no Republican amendments.   If you want a bipartisan bill, then stop the deceit. Pull this bill,  send it to committee, and let's go through the bipartisan process.   The second lie is that this is an infrastructure bill. Mr. Speaker, a  half truth is a lie, and saying this is an infrastructure bill is like  saying that a hurricane is a rain shower. There are rain showers in a  hurricane, but there is so much more, just like there is some  infrastructure in this bill, but there is so much more.   In fact, this $1.2 trillion bill is just a down payment on the $5.5  trillion package that looks like it was developed at a socialist  symposium on taxing and spending. It is deceitful to say that this is a  $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill. It is only the beginning, and it is  intricately linked to trillions more.   This is a down payment on trillions more spending that slaps American  taxpayers in the face with line items such as the $200 million line  item for Speaker Pelosi's neighborhood golf and country club, Presidio  Park, that is surrounded by billionaires living in $30 million homes.   I urge my colleagues not to adopt this bill, which is just the  beginning. Its passage would be the beginning of the end of our country  as we know it. I urge a ``no'' vote.                                time  1945     Madam Speaker, it is great to represent the great  State of Arkansas. I want to say thank you to the HEAT Team and to Mr.  Joyce for holding this Special Order on the Democrats' assault on  American energy.  [[Page H5457]]    As gas prices have recently reached the highest level since 2014,  Americans are seeing the effects of the decisions that were made on day  one by President Biden.   In the Natural Resources Committee, Democrats continue to attack safe  and reliable energy production, spend millions to kill American energy  jobs, impose new taxes and fees on working families, and make our  Nation more reliant than ever on foreign adversaries for critical  minerals and energy resources we could be producing more cleanly,  cheaply, and effectively right here at home.   One glaring example of that--and there are many--is in the Natural  Resources Committee when we marked up this atrocious, now $5\1/2\  trillion, spending bill that the Democrats are trying to push through  Congress. There is actually a line item there, a $350 million line item  to close down a copper mine.   Now, Madam Speaker, how can you talk about green energy when you want  to close down copper mines in the United States?   Now, this copper mine is in Arizona, and it was agreed to on a  bipartisan bill by Senators Harry Reid and John McCain. The mine is  being developed. As a matter of fact, the owner of the mine has spent  $2 billion developing this mine. It is 7,000 feet below ground, but  Democrats want to yank that lease out of their hands. They want to  close it down.   Now, what does that tell investors who want to invest in mining in  America?   It says: We are closed. We are not open for business.   Madam Speaker, you can look at numerous other examples. A cancelation  of the Keystone XL pipeline immediately eliminated 1,000 union jobs as  well as 10,000 projected jobs associated with the project.   The President's ban on Federal oil and gas leasing has resulted in  lost revenues for energy producing States and led our National Security  Advisor to beg OPEC Plus--which includes Russia, Iran, and Venezuela-- to increase supply and bail us out.   If this administration's leasing bans become permanent, nearly  500,000 jobs could be lost by 2040.   Additionally, in 2019, States received a total of $1.81 billion for  mineral revenues and used these funds to support public schools,  environmental restoration, coastal resiliency, and many of our  important programs.   This administration has disregarded the fact that energy development  supports major environmental efforts at the Federal level, such as the  Land and Water Conservation Fund which is specifically funded by  offshore drilling revenues.   To justify its actions, the administration has argued that a major  scale-up in renewables will replace lost jobs and generating capacity.  That is nonsense. Forcing a national switch to alternative energy  against market forces will result in massive unemployment, higher  energy prices, and possibly rolling blackouts from insufficient power.   The Democrat's plan simply will not work. It will not work for the  economy, and it will not work for the environment.   Here is why it won't work: The Democrat's plan is all about electric  vehicles. We are going to make electric vehicles. Well, Madam Speaker,  if you look at global greenhouse gas emissions, the U.S. accounts for  15 percent of it. Transportation is 29 percent. If you could eliminate  every internal combustion engine, Madam Speaker, you would only affect  global emissions by a little over 4 percent, and that is if you didn't  have to use fossil fuels and emit carbon to make the electricity to  power these cars.   We are talking about a minimal impact on global carbon at a huge cost  for American consumers. We don't even have the grid that can handle all  of these electric vehicles. There are many, many technical problems  with it.   China, the world's greatest polluter, last year built 38 gigawatts of  coal power plants. That is one large coal-fired plant every week.   We have to ask ourselves: Why would China go to coal?   That is simple. It is because coal is reliable, and coal is low cost.   When we look at what our energy policies should be here in the United  States and when we look at what will actually work for our economy and  especially for the global environment, we should be asking ourselves:  How do we make the most reliable, lowest cost, and the cleanest  technology--technology that developing countries will adopt?   Because they are not going to adopt expensive technology. They are  going to continue building old technology.   We have got to be the innovators if we truly want to affect the  global environment.   Again, I appreciate the opportunity to speak on this important  matter, and I appreciate the gentleman for hosting this Special Order.
