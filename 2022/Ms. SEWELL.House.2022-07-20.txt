 Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the passage of  H.R. 3222, the Alabama Black Belt National Heritage Act, which passed  this House by a vote of 365-57.   As a daughter of Alabama's historic Black Belt, I am proud to be the  lead sponsor of this legislation to ensure that this region's  meaningful history is preserved for generations to come. As the  birthplace of the civil rights and voting rights movements, the Black  Belt represents the tireless efforts of the foot soldiers to end  discrimination against African Americans and the continued struggle for  full racial equality in our Nation.   This new designation will not only bring about national attention to  the rich history and culture of Alabama's Black Belt, but it will also  increase tourism, investment, and economic opportunity for many of the  rural communities that I so proudly represent.   I thank Senator Shelby for leading this bipartisan legislation in the  Senate, and I also thank the University of West Alabama and the  National Parks Conservation Association for their tireless work to  promote this legislation.   Madam Speaker, I urge the Senate to pass H.R. 3222 as soon as  possible.                            ____________________
