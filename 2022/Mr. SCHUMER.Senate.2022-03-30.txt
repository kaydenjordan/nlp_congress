 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, so today is going to be a very busy day  on the Senate floor, as we continue advancing even more of President  Biden's well-qualified nominees.   Later this morning, we hold an especially important vote to proceed  on the nomination of Alvaro Bedoya, tapped by President Biden to sit as  a Commissioner of the Federal Trade Commission.   The FTC right now is one of the best Agencies for protecting  Americans from price gougers, manipulators, and those trying to rip off  American consumers, or at least it would be if it had full membership.  Instead, the FTC has remained deadlocked for just about the entirety of  the Biden administration because of Republican obstruction, and the  consequences for American consumers have cascaded one after the other.   We all know that prices have been going way up and hurting a lot of  Americans. There are serious reasons to fear a lot is due to some  gouging and manipulation. The FTC is about the best Agency to look for  this. But as long as its membership is deadlocked, it cannot act.   This is especially urgent when it comes to energy prices. Americans  are seeing higher prices at the pump, despite massive profits for oil  companies. So we need a fully operational FTC to investigate and take  action if warranted.   That is why moving forward on Mr. Bedoya is so urgently needed. And,  frankly, the obstruction over Mr. Bedoya is truly unacceptable, given  the FTC is so important for fighting potential price manipulations.  [[Page S1843]]    Republicans know this. Yet his nomination has been deadlocked not  once but twice at the committee level. For all the howling our  Republican friends are doing about rising costs, they are truly content  with dragging their feet on public servants who could actually help  solve the problem. So shame on those who are blocking that.   Without Mr. Bedoya, the FTC and members are left handicapped and  incapable of moving forward. So today's motion to discharge is a matter  of immense importance, and I hope all my colleagues who care about  fighting inflation and price manipulation and collusion vote to proceed  with Mr. Bedoya's nomination.   And on one other point I wanted to make, I read that stock buybacks  by the oil companies have dramatically increased this year. Why is that  money going into stock buybacks instead of into other much more  productive uses? This is another thing the FTC could take a look at.   Now, as the day progresses, I also want my colleagues to realize the  possibility of additional votes later today. On Monday, I filed cloture  on five individuals to fill other important roles across the  administration. Today, we will move on the first of these nominees, but  we are working to move forward with the rest as soon as we can.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate now  vote on the motions to invoke cloture on Executive Calendar Nos. 718,  717, and 716; that the remaining votes tonight be 10-minute votes; that  if cloture is invoked on any of these nominations, all post-cloture  time be considered expired and the Senate vote on confirmation of the  nominations at a time to be determined by the majority leader or his  designee following consultation with the Republican leader.    Members, we have three more votes coming up. If we stay  in our seats and stay close, we can get them done quickly. So, please,  hang around.                            ____________________
