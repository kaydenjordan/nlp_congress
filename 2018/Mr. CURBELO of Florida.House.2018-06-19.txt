Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend  their remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 5775, currently  under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I stand today in strong support of H.R. 5775, the  Providing Reliable Options for Patients and Educational Resources Act,  or the PROPER Act.   This is a bipartisan bill centered on increasing educational  resources for Medicare beneficiaries and improving pain-related  questions contained in patient satisfaction surveys.   H.R. 5775, introduced by my colleagues Erik Paulsen, Ron Kind, Brian  Fitzpatrick, Bruce Poliquin, and Conor Lamb, contain several bills to  combat the opioid crisis, including H.R. 5686, the Medicare CHOICE Act;  H.R. 5714, the Education for Disposal of Unused Opioids Act; and H.R.  5719, the Reduce Overprescribing Opioids in Treatment, or ROOT Act.   Unfortunately, my home State of Florida has seen a dramatic increase  in opioid-related overdose deaths in the past several years. Every  year, thousands of Floridians become addicted and lose their lives to  opioid addiction.   Effective alternatives to opioids, such as physical therapy and  medical devices exist, and in most instances are covered by Medicare.   However, many seniors and providers simply aren't aware of the  coverage options. Education is a key tool for seniors to make informed  decisions about their healthcare.   For this reason, the Ways and Means Committee sprang into action and  passed H.R. 5775 unanimously. This bill contains provisions authored by  my colleagues Erik Paulsen and Ron Kind to inform seniors about  alternative nonaddictive pain management therapies covered by Medicare.   This bill also includes a provision led by my colleagues Diane Black,  Joe Crowley, Richard Hudson, and Raul Ruiz to educate seniors on safe  disposal of unused controlled substances.   Lastly, this bill includes another provision led by Diane Black and   Tom O'Halleran requiring the Secretary of Health and Human Services to  remove all pain-related questions contained in Medicare's hospital  patient surveys unless the individual experiencing the pain is also  informed about the risks associated with the use of opioids and given  information on nonopioid alternatives for the treatment of pain.   Madam Speaker, I want to thank my colleagues for their strong  bipartisan work. This bill will make a difference in addressing the  opioid epidemic that continues to devastate many Americans and their  families.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                          House of Representatives,                                     Committee on Ways and Means,                                       Washington, DC, June 8, 2018.      Hon. Greg Walden,      Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Walden: I write to you regarding several       opioid bills the Committee on Ways and Means ordered       favorably reported to address the opioid epidemic. The       following bills were also referred to the Committee on Energy       and Commerce.        I ask that the Committee on Energy and Commerce waive       formal consideration of the following bills so that they may       proceed expeditiously to the House Floor:        H.R. 5774, Combatting Opioid Abuse for Care in Hospitals       (COACH) Act;        H.R. 5775, Providing Reliable Options for Patients and       Educations Resources (PROPER) Act;        H.R. 5776, Medicare and Opioid Safe Treatment (MOST) Act;        H.R. 5773, Preventing Addition for Susceptible Seniors       (PASS) Act;        H.R. 5676, Stop Excessive Narcotics in our Retirement       (SENIOR) Communities Protection Act; and        H.R. 5723, Expanding Oversight of Opioid Prescribing and       Payment Act.        I acknowledge that by waiving formal consideration of the       bills, the Committee on Energy and Commerce is in no way       waiving its jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in       those provisions of the bills that fall within your Rule X       jurisdiction. I would support your effort to seek appointment       of an appropriate number of conferees on any House-Senate       conference involving this legislation.        I will include a copy of our letters in the Congressional       Record during consideration of this legislation on the House       floor.            Sincerely,                                                       Kevin Brady,                                                          Chairman.  [[Page H5258]]                                          ____                                          House of Representatives,                                Committee on Energy and Commerce,                                       Washington, DC, June 8, 2018.      Hon. Kevin Brady,      Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Brady: Thank you for your letter regarding       the following bills, which were also referred to the       Committee on Energy and Commerce:        H.R. 5774, Combatting Opioid Abuse for Care in Hospitals       (COACH) Act;        H.R. 5775, Providing Reliable Options for Patients and       Educations Resources (PROPER) Act;        H.R. 5776, Medicare and Opioid Safe Treatment (MOST) Act;        H.R. 5773, Preventing Addition for Susceptible Seniors       (PASS) Act;        H.R. 5676, Stop Excessive Narcotics in our Retirement       (SENIOR) Communities Protection Act; and        H.R. 5723, Expanding Oversight of Opioid Prescribing and       Payment Act.        I wanted to notify you that the Committee will forgo action       on these bills so that they may proceed expeditiously to the       House floor.        I appreciate your acknowledgment that by forgoing formal       consideration of these bills, the Committee on Energy and       Commerce is in no way waiving its jurisdiction over the       subject matter contained in those provisions of the bills       that fall within its Rule X jurisdiction. I also appreciate       your offer to support the Committee's request for the       appointment of conferees in the event of a House-Senate       conference involving this legislation.        Thank you for your assistance on this matter.            Sincerely,                                                       Greg Walden,                                                          Chairman.     Madam Speaker, the PROPER Act will bring much  needed education to our seniors.   This bill was brought through the committee process in a bipartisan  fashion, and now on the floor I strongly urge my colleagues on both  sides of the aisle to vote in favor of H.R. 5775, the PROPER Act.   This is another example of how Republicans and Democrats can come  together, can work together, to help struggling families in our  country, and in this case seniors, who should be aware of all the  different options that are available to them for pain treatment and  should certainly be aware of the many risks associated with opioid use.   Madam Speaker, I am grateful to all my colleagues and to committee  staff for all their work on this legislation, and I strongly encourage  everyone to support it, and I yield back the balance of my time.
