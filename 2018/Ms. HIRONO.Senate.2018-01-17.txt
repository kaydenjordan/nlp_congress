 Mr. President, when the Sun rose last Saturday in Hawaii,  nothing seemed out of the ordinary. People on Kauai were getting ready  to participate in the local march to commemorate Dr. Martin Luther King  Jr. Day. Families were sitting around the table eating breakfast.  Others were sleeping in after a long week of work.   At 8:07, everything changed. Mobile phones throughout Hawaii received  an emergency alert in all capital letters informing them of a ballistic  missile threat inbound to Hawaii and that this was not a drill. The  terror and panic were real, and people's reactions reflected that.  Parents passed their children through manhole covers into the sewers,  seeking safety for them. Separated family members took to the highways,  driving as fast as 100 miles per hour to get home. Some had to decide  whether to rush to be with their spouse or their children.   Then 38 minutes later, an emergency alert came through saying that  there was no missile threat--false alarm. The relief was palpable. This  relief gave way to real, visceral anger. Anger that there was a false  alarm. Anger that it took 38 minutes to alert the public. Anger that we  faced a missile threat at all.   This incident has undermined the public's faith in our State  government's ability to provide timely and accurate information about a  potential crisis. At a time when we face heightened tensions around the  world--and particularly with regard to North Korea--it is crucial that  the people of Hawaii have confidence in the government to provide  accurate information. That is why I am calling for a thorough,  transparent investigation into what occurred. We need a full accounting  of the human and system failures that occurred, and we need to identify  and put in place specific steps to make sure nothing like this ever  happens again.   What we do know is that the incident was a result of human error. An  operator mistakenly triggered the alert. Although the error was  discovered quickly, we need to better understand the circumstances that  led up to the incident. We need to understand how the operator was  trained. We need to identify and understand any other potential issues  that resulted in this specific human error.   The State has appointed an investigator to get to the bottom of this,  and the State legislature is scheduled to be briefed on preliminary  findings this Friday. Once the circumstances that precipitated this  error are identified, we, of course, need to correct them as quickly as  possible.   Concurrently, we need to understand the system failures that resulted  both in the false alert and in the 38-minute delay before the Hawaii  Emergency Management Agency, or Hawaii EMA, issued a correction. Why  did Hawaii EMA officials believe they needed approval from the Federal  Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, to issue a correction? The Secretary  of Homeland Security told me at a hearing yesterday that no such  permission was necessary, pointing to a need for clarity regarding  Agency responsibilities.   State governments oversee and operate local emergency management  alert systems, but the Federal Communications Commission, FCC, and the  Department of Homeland Security, through FEMA, have a role to play to  make sure that these systems are operating properly.   During yesterday's hearing in the Judiciary Committee, Secretary of  Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen committed to working with me to  strengthen the Federal-State cooperation on emergency alerts, assess  potential failures, and improve overall readiness in Hawaii and across  our country.   The FCC is also conducting an investigation into what happened.   The entire Nation will benefit if these key Federal agencies work  with States to close gaps in training and communication, institute best  practices, and ensure that our States and local governments have the  appropriate resources to prevent this kind of occurrence from happening  again.   This false alert also clarified the importance of strong coordination  between the State government and our military. Over the weekend, I also  spoke with Admiral Harris of Pacific Command about ways to strengthen  this coordination, particularly during a period of heightened tensions  with North Korea. The fact that the people in Hawaii immediately  assumed that the missile originated from North Korea speaks to the  broad concern about the potential for conflict and the threat that  North Korea poses to our State and the rest of the country.   We need to support and strengthen diplomatic efforts regarding North  Korea because at a time, as I mentioned, of heightened tension between  the United States and North Korea, the potential for miscalculations  increases.   The President, rather than engaging in a tit-for-tat with Kim Jong  Un, should be supporting Secretary of State Rex Tillerson's efforts to  engage in meaningful diplomacy and marshal the support of our allies to  diffuse tensions with North Korea.   I spoke earlier with Secretary of Defense James Mattis to emphasize  the urgency of resolving this situation peacefully, knowing that he had  just  [[Page S247]]  returned from a multinational meeting with a number of key allies,  including Japan and South Korea. This meeting was to focus on North  Korean provocations. This meeting was cosponsored by the Secretary of  State, Rex Tillerson, in Vancouver. Secretary Mattis was at that  meeting to provide a military perspective. In our conversation, he  reiterated to me the importance of strong diplomatic efforts to resolve  tensions with North Korea.   I call on the President to support these kinds of initiatives and to  give Secretary Tillerson all the resources he needs to succeed in his  diplomatic endeavors.   I yield the floor.
