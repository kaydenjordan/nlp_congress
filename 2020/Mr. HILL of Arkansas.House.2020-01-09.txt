 Mr. Speaker, as a terror state, Iran is no  friend of the United States or our allies. For three decades, Iran has  been a leading state sponsor of terrorism and an eager empire builder.  Its history of money laundering, terrorism, and murder of U.S. soldiers  is undeniable.   Last week, the President, as Commander in Chief, took the legal and  decisive action when he eliminated terrorist combatant leader Qasem  Soleimani from the battlefield. Across the years in the region, this  man of murder has the blood of hundreds of thousands of innocents on  his hands.   To refer to this combat operation as an assassination or to offer  moral equivalence between Soleimani and a state-sponsored terror  organization with a rule-following nation actively engaged in the  family of nations is laughable.   In my view, Soleimani ranks up there with the worst exporters of  terror in the region, including the likes of Osama bin Laden or al- Baghdadi, the most recent demised head of ISIS.   Over these three decades, the United States and our allies have faced  greater and more violent Iranian or Iranian proxy attacks orchestrated  by the terror general Soleimani against the United States and our  allies, dating as far back as 1983, when Iran's proxy Hezbollah  committed the Beirut, Lebanon, bombing, killing 241 marines.   Soleimani, Iran, Hezbollah, and their thirst for violence is well  documented and undeniable. In the face of this record and their very  aggressive actions of the last few weeks, including the killing of an  American contractor, targeting of U.S. forces, attacking Saudi Arabian  oil operations, disrupting shipping in the Persian Gulf, shooting down  an American drone, and then blatantly and aggressively attacking our  Embassy in Baghdad, President Trump has been quite restrained during  the course of that record.   However, the killing of an American contractor and orchestrating that  storming and destruction at the American Embassy in Baghdad and the  eminent planning of additional threats that this Congress learned the  details of yesterday and attacks potentially on American troops or  diplomats was the final straw.   Mr. Speaker, the provocateur is Iran, not President Trump. The  assassin is Soleimani, not President Trump. The destabilizing force in  the region is Iran, not the United States.   Yesterday, President Trump reiterated that the United States does not  seek to start a war with Iran. His recent actions have sent an  unambiguous signal to Iran and their proxies: Harm Americans, pay a  price.   President Trump's objectives are clear: End Iran's export of terror;  end its advancing regional ballistic missile capabilities; and prohibit  their obtaining a nuclear weapon.   Instead, President Trump encourages the Iranian people to assert  their own aspirations and form a more open and pluralistic future for  their children and their children's children. This rich, historic land  deserves to return to a time when the beautiful, intelligent Iranian  people chart their own course for good, as citizens of a country eager  to be part of the family of nations.                            ____________________
