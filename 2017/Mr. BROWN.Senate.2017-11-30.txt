 Senator Hatch?    Senator Hatch?    Thank you, Senator Hatch.    The question is this. I appreciated the exchange we had in  the Finance Committee the other night----    I am fine. I just wanted to clarify something. When we had  our little exchange a couple of Thursdays ago, I talked about the bill  I thought was much more heavily weighted toward the top 1 percent. I  wanted to put another number out there and just ask you your opinion.   The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities yesterday said that in the  Bush tax cuts, 27 percent of the tax cuts went to the top 1 percent.  Their studies show that 62 percent of this tax cut goes to the 1  percent. I know in the Bush days people thought too much of it went to  the top 1 percent. That was only one-quarter. This is almost two-thirds  of that goes to the top 1 percent.   I wonder, Senator Hatch, if you would explain that to us.    Will the Senator yield for a question?    Will the Senator yield for a question?    Thank you. I accept that, but this bill was not spending  money on the poor, except Senator Lee and Senator Rubio wanted to do a  child tax credit, and we have done the earned-income tax credit. You  supported some of this----    But one of the things we could be doing instead of this  bill is the CHIP program, which you proudly, with Senator Kennedy,  offered 20 years ago. There are going to be letters that will go out to  people in Virginia next and Ohio and other States----    This is not a giveaway. This is something we have done  bipartisanly. Is there something we can do to----    We recognize that.    We recognize that.    Will the Senator yield?    Will the Senator yield?    Will the chairman yield for a moment?    OK. My one comment about CHIP, if that is OK, is that  there are letters that are going to go out. I so respect what you did  with Senator Kennedy. I know that your work was exemplary on it, 20  years ago, to start the Children's Health Insurance Program.  [[Page S7512]]         I know. We all understand that.    We so appreciate that, Mr. Chairman.   My concern is that you know some of these families. When you write a  bill like that, you meet a lot of these families who benefit--209,000  in my State alone. Some of the parents of those kids, if we don't move  on CHIP in the next week or so, are going to get letters in the mail  that read, ``Sorry, your child's health insurance is going to expire,''  while we are sitting here, dressed pretty well. I know you said that  you grew up with the poor people, is how you said it the other night,  but I worry about these families, and these are families with jobs. You  know that about CHIP. These are families who make $8 and $10 and $12 an  hour, who don't have insurance, and they are going to get letters,  reading: Your insurance is canceled.   How can we let that happen, Mr. Chairman?    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Will Senator Toomey yield?    Will Senator Toomey yield?    Mr. President, has the Republicans' time expired?   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority's time has expired.   The Senator from Ohio.    Mr. President, I am so amused at how any of my Republican  colleagues can talk about this being a legitimate process and that they  want Democratic support. I sat at the White House with Senator Wyden,  with Senator Cornyn, with Senator Toomey, with a number of--probably 11  or 12--Republican Senators on the Finance Committee, and with 6 on the  Democratic side of the Finance Committee.   I went up to the President and had a copy of two bills in my hand. I  brought it up to the whole group--the Patriot Corporation Act, on which  I will speak in a moment. It does exactly what President Trump wants to  do. It rewards corporations that pay good wages, that pay decent  benefits, and that keep their production in this country. The President  said that he liked it. He had had an interview with either Forbes or  Fortune Magazine not too much earlier, and he had talked about it. Then  I brought up to the President the Working Families Tax Relief Act,  which puts money directly in the pockets of people who are making  $25,000 and $50,000 and $75,000 a year. The President said that he  liked that.   But do you know what happened? He said it then, and he said it in a  phone call that a group of us were on a little bit later. Do you know  what happened? We know exactly what happened. They all went down the  hall here to the majority leader's office. All of my Republican friends  walked into that office, and they had their Wall Street lobbyists with  them; they had their drug company lobbyists; and they had their tobacco  company lobbyists. That is where they wrote the bill. There was no  light of day on this.   Then my colleagues on this committee told us that it was a legitimate  process on the night that we had the markup in the Finance Committee.  They call it legitimate, but they give us a bill with almost no  warning. They try to jam it through. They change it in the middle of  the night. Then we talk about it the next day. Then they change it in  the middle of the night again. They add a healthcare provision about  which the Congressional Budget Office said 13 million people will lose  their insurance; rates will go up; premiums will go up 10 percent a  year. If you are paying $500 a month today, you will pay $550 next  year, and you will pay $605 the following year, and you will pay $660- something a month the following year.   I mean, don't even insult us by saying that this is a legitimate  process. I don't even want to talk about the process, because that  really doesn't mean much to people.   In this letter that my friend mentioned, the first line states: ``We  write to express our interest in working with you on bipartisan tax  reform.'' That is what Senator Wyden said, if you would like to look at  it.   I want to talk about my amendment, which is exactly what Candidate  Trump campaigned on, exactly what pretty much everybody on this side of  the aisle stands for, but most importantly, it is exactly what the  American people have asked for.   It is simple. It is called the Patriot Corporation Act. If a company  does the right thing, if a company pays good wages and provides decent  healthcare and retirement benefits to its employees and does its  production in the United States, it will get a significant tax break  based on the number of employees it hires--a significant tax break.  President Trump said he liked that. He told Forbes that he wanted a  bill with economic development incentives for companies. The President  has said repeatedly that he wants legislation--a tax bill that supports  companies that stay here and are patriotic, and he said that we should  penalize companies that don't do their production in this country.   This bill now--comments from my friend from Pennsylvania  notwithstanding--gives a massive, permanent tax cuts to large,  multinational corporations, and it gives them more incentives to move  offshore.   The Presiding Officer grew up in the Cleveland suburbs. A plant shuts  down in Cleveland or Garfield Heights or Mansfield, where I grew up, it  moves overseas, and it gets a tax break now. Don't you think we should  fix that? Instead, this bill greases the wheels to send more jobs  overseas. Of all the things we should fix, that is it. That is what the  President wants to do, and that is what Senate Democrats want to do.  Instead, Senate Republicans--again, that deal was struck back there in  Senator McConnell's office--Senate Republicans are writing a bill that  gives huge tax cuts to the wealthiest people in this country.   The Center for Budget Priorities just yesterday came out with this,  done precisely according to the numbers. In 2001 and 2003, 27 percent  of the Bush tax cuts went to the top 1 percent. I thought that was too  high at the time. This bill more than doubles that--61 percent of the  benefits. It is not going to the middle class, and they know that when  they say it over and over. In addition, it kicks 13 million people off  of their insurance. We know that.   Under this bill, U.S. companies would pay a rate of 20 percent on  profit earned in a manufacturing plant in Akron, OH. That same plant  can shut down, lay off its workers, build a new factory in Asia, and  get a tax deduction for the cost of moving. Do you know what they pay?  They potentially likely pay a zero-percent tax rate. So what are they  going to do? Even in the Senate Finance Committee, where people are not  as quick as one might think they are, 20 is a larger number than zero.  Even we can figure that out. At 20 percent, what that means is that  there is an even greater tax incentive to go overseas.   The Presiding Officer knows Cleveland well. He knows that my wife and  I live in a neighborhood in Cleveland, OH. Our neighborhood ZIP Code is  44105. There were more foreclosures in my neighborhood in the first  half of 2007 than any ZIP Code in the United States of America. Why? It  wasn't the Wall Street scam that caused so many foreclosures later; it  was mostly because of the loss of manufacturing jobs. Do you know why  that is? Partly because of trade agreements like NAFTA, other trade  policies, PNTR with China, and all that. Much of it was about tax  legislation giving incentives to move overseas. Why are we doing more  of it? This bill rewards companies for sending jobs overseas.   Our legislation, the Patriot Corporation Act, will work to keep jobs  here. We know these corporate tax cuts are not going to end up in the  pockets of ordinary working Americans.   Senator Hatch and I had a very public discussion in the Finance  Committee a couple Thursdays ago when the bill was voted out. We talked  about a number of things. One of the things we talked about was this  promise, this assertion, this myth that if we give a company a big tax  cut, then we know what they are going to do. They are going to hand it  out to their employees. They are going to give a $4,000 or $5,000 or  $6,000 or $7,000 a year raise. That doesn't happen. That has never  happened. When this body passed a tax holiday a decade-plus ago, the  money that was brought back from overseas at a lower tax rate went to  executive compensation, to stock buybacks, and to dividends--almost all  of it. Workers didn't get raises and they didn't invest more in our  economy.   Companies are sitting on large stacks, huge caches of cash. Those  companies can hire more people now. They can raise wages now. They are  not doing any of that.   What we ought to do, instead of shoveling more money to the top, to  these large corporations that outsource jobs, we ought to cut out the  middleman and put the money directly into the middle class. If my  friends want to give a tax cut to the middle class, why don't we  [[Page S7514]]  give a tax cut to the middle class? Why don't we directly put the money  there?   I know the President said that he is a big loser on this bill  personally, that it will cost him zillions of dollars--whatever he  said. We know that is not even close to true. But if we really care  about the middle class, I say to my colleagues, let's give a tax break  to the middle class.   Think about it. They are not even hiding what they are doing. These  cuts go to corporate stockholders. They don't go to raise wages; they  go to executive compensation. They don't go to create jobs; they go to  stock buybacks. They don't go to middle-class Ohioans, Oregonians,  Texans, Pennsylvanians, or Alaskans. We know what will happen. Do you  know what will happen? As Senator Rubio said, after we pass this bill  and the President signs it into law, the budget deficit will explode  again. Do you know what will happen? Senator Wyden knows. This will  come back, and you guys will say: You know, we have this budget  deficit, and we are going to have to raise the Social Security  retirement age. Do you know what that means to a barber in Garfield  Heights? Do you know what that means to a construction worker in  Warren, OH? Do you know what that means to somebody who is working in  manufacturing in Mansfield, OH? They can't work until they are 70. We  can all work until we are 70, if our constituents allow us, because we  have these jobs. Well, a lot of our constituents can't. And if that is  the scenario--and it is almost inevitable--if we pass this bill, if we  do this bill, if we pass this bill of big tax cuts for the wealthiest  people in this country, we will drive a hole in the budget deficit, and  then we will come back and make the middle class and working families  pay to fill that hole. That is irresponsible. That is morally  reprehensible.   I yield.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip.    Mr. President, I call up my motion that is at the desk.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the motion.   The legislative clerk read as follows:         The Senator from Ohio [Mr. BROWN] moves to commit the bill       H.R. 1 to the Committee on Finance with instructions to       report the same back to the Senate in 3 days, not counting       any day on which the Senate is not in session, with changes       that--        (1) are within the jurisdiction of such committee;        (2) create a tax credit of up to $1,500 per employee for       employers that--        (A) maintain headquarters in the United States if the       company has ever been headquartered in United States;        (B) maintain or increase the number of employees in the       United States as compared to the number of employees overseas       (including independent contractors);        (C) have not inverted to avoid United States taxes;        (D) pay not less than 90 percent of their employees in the       United States an hourly wage that is not less than 218       percent of the Federal poverty line for an individual;        (E) provide quality health insurance coverage to employees       in the United States;        (F) provide not less than 90 percent of their employees in       the United States who are not highly compensated with a       defined benefit plan or a defined contribution plan and match       employee contributions to such plan up to an amount that is       not less than 5 percent of the employee's annual       compensation;        (G) pay to any employee who is a member of a reserve       component (as defined in section 101 of title 37, United       States Code) who serves on active duty an amount equal to the       amount, if any, by which the employee's regular salary       exceeds the employee's military compensation; and        (H) have a plan in place to recruit veterans; and        (3) fully offset the tax credit described in paragraph (2)       by changing the corporate tax rate as necessary.    The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 30 minutes of debate equally divided  on the motion.   Who yields time?    Madam President, I thank the Senator from Oregon, and I  appreciate the time in this as we wind down this debate.   The answer is yes. We have a tax system right now in place. I hear my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle disingenuously say: Well, as  for the Democrats, because they don't like our tax plan, that means  they are for the tax system the way it is. Of course, we don't like the  tax system the way it is, and we particularly don't like it in States  like mine and, I would say, especially in places like Eastern Oregon,  where companies shut down production in Lima, OH, or Springfield, OR,  and move to Wuhan or Beijing and get a tax break for doing it. We want  to close that loophole, but you know what, this bill explodes that  loophole. It explodes it, because, as I said a few minutes ago, if a  plant shuts down in Barberton or it shuts down in Xenia or it shuts  down in Zanesville, the company, under this bill, would pay a rate of  20 percent on profits. If it shuts down and moves to Asia, it can build  a new factory and get a tax deduction for the cost of moving, still,  and pay a U.S. tax rate of zero. So why wouldn't they move?    Briefly, very briefly.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.    I take back my time.    I take back my time.    Sure.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio has the floor.    OK, I will yield for a question, if it is a question.    Madam President, I reclaim my time.    Madam President, I reclaim my time.    Madam President, I reclaim my time.    Madam President, I reclaim my time.   Of course, I don't believe that is the new normal. It is the same old  game they played before. If you are not for our tax plan, then you are  not for tax reform. Nobody believes that.   Of course, we don't think 1.5 percent is the normal. But do you know  what else we know? We know that the last time, 20 years ago, when we  focused on the middle class and cut taxes on the middle class during  the Clinton years, the economy exploded. There were 22 million private  sector jobs.   But do you know what happened a dozen years ago? President Bush did  two tax cuts for the wealthy, under the view that it trickles down and  everybody will do better. During 8 years of President Bush, there was  no net job growth.   Yes, during the last few years, we have had this low level of GDP  growth for a whole lot of reasons, but you don't fix it--you don't grow  the economy--by giving tax cuts for the rich with the hope of it  trickling down. One of the ways you fix that is to do the patriot  corporation legislation. If a company does the right thing, if a  company pays good wages, if a company provides decent health benefits  and retirement benefits and keeps its production in the United States,  that company gets a better tax rate--$1,500 for workers, the way this  amendment would work. That is how you grow the economy. That is what  Candidate Trump said and then President Trump said to me in a meeting  with all my Finance Committee Republicans in the room--in the  President's Cabinet room. Now, we know that. That just goes without  saying, in spite of the myth that we continue to propagate on the  floor.   Before I turn it to Senator Durbin, who is one of the original  authors of the patriot corporation legislation, I want to say one other  thing. We have seen some pretty charts on this floor about middle-class  tax cuts. Well, what we didn't hear mention was that on about the third  year of this bill, the tax cuts go down and down and down and then they  cross zero, and then you have tax increases. The Tax Policy Center said  that, in 2019, 13 million  [[Page S7517]]  households will have a tax increase; in 2025, 19 million households  will have a tax increase; and in 2027, 87 million will have tax  increases. Those aren't the Trump family that will have tax increases.  Those aren't Senators' families that will have tax increases. Those are  working families in Toledo, in Dayton, and working families in Omaha  and in East St. Louis, IL. They are the ones who are going to get hit  with these tax increases while the wealthy continue to get more tax  breaks.   I will yield the remainder of the Democratic time to the assistant  Democratic leader, Senator Durbin   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant Democratic leader.    Madam President, how much time remains on the Democratic  side?   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Three and a half minutes.    I appreciate the leadership of Senator Durbin on this  issue.   I want to ask Democratic Ranking Member Wyden a question as we wrap  up. We have heard that in order to sell this scam that we see rushed  through and negotiated in the majority leader's office with his Wall  Street and drug company lobbyist friends, that to sell this scam for  the 1 percent and their billionaire contributors, that Republicans  continue to say the Democrats didn't want to participate, didn't want  to do this in a bipartisan way. Senator Wyden and I were at the White  House when I handed the President the Patriot Corporation Act and  handed the President the Tax Relief for Working Families Act. Other  Democrats were saying: Here are some ideas that can make this truly a  bill aimed at the middle class, helping the middle class and expanding  the economy.   I keep hearing them say: We didn't want to do this. I mean, really.  So I want to ask Senator Wyden--he is the senior Democrat on the Tax  Committee--would you just expand on that? I mean, what really happened?    This is a really simple debate. Then-Candidate Trump,  President Trump, has said: We reward corporations that do the right  thing: They pay good wages. They provide decent benefits. They keep  their production in the United States. He then went on to say: Penalize  companies that don't, but if they are patriotic, you give them a tax  break.  [[Page S7518]]    The Brown-Durbin amendment bill provides roughly $1,500 for every  employee when companies do the right thing. Why would we not want to  reward American companies that are making things in America?   This suit I wear is made by union workers 10 miles from my house. Why  wouldn't we want to reward companies that do that instead of reward  companies that go overseas?   Vote for the Brown-Durbin Patriot Corporation Act Amendment.   I yield back my time.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.   The question is on agreeing to the Brown motion to commit.
