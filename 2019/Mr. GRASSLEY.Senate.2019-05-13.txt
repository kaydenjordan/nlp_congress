 Mr. President, I ask to speak for 2 minutes as in  morning business.    Mr. President, I would like to tell my colleagues in  the Senate about a project I worked on in Iowa on getting history from  various veterans.   This morning, I delivered 20 stories from veterans to the Veterans  History Project at our Library of Congress. These stories will be  preserved in the permanent collection of the Library of Congress,  making accessible the personal accounts of American war veterans so  that future generations may hear directly from veterans and better  understand the realities of war.   I want to thank all of our veterans, including those who were  interviewed, who have sacrificed for the defense of our freedoms. Their  service ensures that all Americans will live in peace and prosperity  for generations to come.                            ____________________     Mr. President, May is National Foster Care Month.   Due to the opioid crisis and other substance abuse issues plaguing  communities in Iowa and all across America, the number of kids in  foster care is rapidly rising. In 2017, there were 443,000 kids in  care. Ninety-six thousand entered foster care because of parental  substance abuse.   These families need help. That is why Congress passed the Family  First Prevention Services Act, which will allow States to receive  Federal reimbursement for services to help keep kids with their  parents. These services include substance abuse treatment programs.   As we celebrate this month of May as National Foster Care Month, I  hope we will think about the number of kids who are there and do what  we can to help those kids have permanency and parents. As chairman of  the Caucus on Foster Youth, those are the two things I hear from them  when listening to them talk about going from foster home to foster  home, sometimes two or three times a year. They tell me they would like  to have parents and they would like to have a home. They want  stability.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, this week marks National Police Week,  which is dedicated to the brave men and women of law enforcement.  Police officers prioritize the safety of their neighbors and fellow  citizens above their own.   This week gives us an opportunity to reflect on the dedication and  perseverance of law enforcement officers across the country. We should  also honor those who made the ultimate sacrifice while serving our  communities. It is because of the commitment and bravery of police  officers, firefighters, first responders, and other public safety  officers that we can feel safe in our homes, places of work, and our  communities.   I am particularly grateful for the men and women in blue who serve my  fellow Iowans.   I would also like to thank the officers who serve in Washington, DC.  The Capitol Police work diligently every day to ensure that those of us  who work here and everyone who visits this Capitol are safe. Each  member of the Capitol Police works selflessly to protect us, and their  dedication to service doesn't go unnoticed.   National Police Week serves as a reminder to thank specific members  of law enforcement whom we know and care about; however, we can't  forget to honor those who sacrificed their lives to protect ours. These  individuals are heroes.   According to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, a  total of 1,582 officers died in the line of duty during the past 10  years. That is an average of one death every 55 hours.   In 2018, 158 officers were killed in the line of duty.   At the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial, the names of some  200 Iowans are inscribed amongst those who made the ultimate sacrifice.  Each name represents a unique individual who answered the call of duty.  We are indebted to each and every one of those people.   To that end, I am pleased that the Senate Judiciary Committee  recently approved three bills, two of which I cosponsored and one that  I introduced.   My bill, the Protecting America's First Responder's Act, seeks to fix  issues in the Federal Public Safety Officers' Benefits Program.  Officers whose lives have been transformed by injury in the line of  duty deserve our support, and that bill lends to their support and  makes sure that it is actually accomplished. Unfortunately, the Federal  program that was created to assist them has fallen short in responding  to claims efficiently. This important bill improves this program to  ensure that disabled or fallen officers receive the benefits they  deserve.   My bill enjoys the wide support of multiple groups, including the  Fraternal Order of Police, Federal Law Enforcement Officers  Association, Sergeants Benevolent Association, National Association of  Police Organizations, Peace Officers Research Association of  California, Wounded Blue, How2LoveOurCops, Billings Montana Police  Department, National Volunteer Fire Council, National Association of  School Resource Officers, and the Violently Injured Police Officers  Organization.   I look forward to passing this bill into law, and I thank all of the  bill's cosponsors for helping to move this bill forward.   In addition to the Protecting America's First Responder's Act, we  also moved two other bills out of the Judiciary Committee.   The first is the Patrick Leahy Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant  Program reauthorization. This bill allows State and local law  enforcement officers to purchase lifesaving bulletproof vests for those  officers working in the field. I am happy to cosponsor this legislation  and support my colleague Senator Leahy's tireless efforts to improve  the availability of bulletproof vests to our police.   The other bill that passed out of committee last week is the  Supporting and Treating Officers in Crisis Act. Mental illness and  suicide among police officers continue to grow. Senator Hawley  introduced this bill, and I am proud to cosponsor it with him because  it addresses a critical issue that far too many officers face. This  bill seeks to provide necessary resources to law enforcement on mental  health and suicide prevention.   I urge my colleagues to support all three of these bills. Passing  them into law is one way to say thank you to the brave men and women  who serve us so selflessly.   I would like to conclude my remarks by once again thanking all  members of law enforcement for their dedication and sacrifice.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
