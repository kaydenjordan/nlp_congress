 Mr. President, today I am proud to recognize in the  Record the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, VA, Principal Deputy  Assistant Secretary for the Office of Congressional and Legislative  Affairs, OCLA, Christopher E. O'Connor, in honor of his upcoming  retirement. Mr. O'Connor recently received the VA's Exceptional Service  Award for his long record of service to our Nation's veterans.   Mr. O'Connor has advised four VA Secretaries, four acting VA  Secretaries, and their legislative teams as  [[Page S2960]]  they have worked with Congress to make a stronger and more effective  department for America's veterans. He has provided continuity in the  Department's communication with Congress during the shift of executive  administrations.   Most recently, Mr. O'Connor worked with our committee on the VA  MISSION Act, which is a major reform in veterans' healthcare. He also  helped inform Members of Congress about the need to modernize the  department's antiquated electronic health records system, and he played  a key role as the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act  made its way through Congress.   Under his leadership, Mr. O'Connor and his team prepared VA's senior  leaders to successfully participate in more than 400 congressional  hearings. Their office also coordinated thousands of informational  briefings to Members of Congress, committee staff, and personal staff  that advanced VA's message and priorities.   Upon his upcoming retirement, Mr. O'Connor leaves the Department with  an important legacy. In 2017, Mr. O'Connor spearheaded the  Congressional Fellowship Program, which places VA employees in a  yearlong fellowship position in the office of a Member of Congress.   Today, I am honored to pay tribute to Mr. O'Connor for his service to  our country and his steadfast commitment to advocating on behalf of  veterans throughout his career. Congratulations to Mr. O'Connor on his  lasting legacy of advocacy for veterans, and I wish him the best in his  retirement.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today, I am honored to recognize  in the Record Mr. Tom Lewis of Atlanta, GA, the senior adviser to the  president of Georgia State University. Tom has announced he will retire  in June after 28 years of service to the school.   Tom Lewis has built a strong legacy in our State and Federal  Government, as well as in higher education. Early on, he learned the  value of public service from his parents, Eleanor and Carlton Lewis.  While he was a student at Georgia Southern University, he spent time  here in the Senate as an intern for the venerable Senator Richard B.  Russell of Georgia. Upon his graduation from the university, he worked  on the campaign of then-Presidential candidate Jimmy Carter of Plains,  GA, who was subsequently elected to the office of U.S. President.   Next, Tom set out to make a difference in our State government as  executive director of the Georgia Franchise Practices Commission from  1974 to 1978. Later, while he was executive vice president of the  Bartow County Chamber of Commerce, Tom met and befriended State  legislator Joe Frank Harris of Cartersville, GA, and his wife  Elizabeth. That friendship turned into a trusted bond, and when Joe  Frank Harris set out to become Governor of Georgia, Tom joined his  campaign as an adviser and served in several roles in Harris's  administration, including as chief of staff from 1986 to 1991.   I got to know Tom while I was also serving in the Georgia General  Assembly, and he was always someone who you could count on and trust.  When he went on to Georgia State University, he left his mark there,  advancing the school's interests, creating new opportunities, and  helping Georgia State University grow in the early years and then  absolutely take off. The Washington Post has called Georgia State  University a ``hotbed of growth and innovation.'' This and many of its  other well-earned accolades are due not only to a serious and active  student body, but also thanks to the long-term planning and constant  efforts of great leaders like Tom Lewis.   In addition to his accomplishments spanning decades and touching  countless lives, Tom and his wife Patty are the parents of three  children, Wes, Ellen, and Shannon. His five grandchildren, Wesley  Claire, Leighton, Will, Nate, and Jacks will surely benefit from Tom's  retirement. I have a strong suspicion that his home community of  Cartersville, GA, will benefit from the additional time he is able to  spend in town, too.   As Tom and Patty prepare for this new chapter, I wish them and their  families all the best. I offer my deepest gratitude for their  friendship and work on behalf of our State.
