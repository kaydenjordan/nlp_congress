 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to recognize a Mainer whose  acts of kindness and love touched the lives of so many, even though  most never knew his name until now.   On every Valentine's Day since 1979, Kevin Fahrman of Falmouth,  Maine, anonymously papered the greater Portland area with red hearts  with the help of family and friends.   Known as the Valentine's Day Bandit, he would blanket the city with  hearts large and small in an enduring love letter to Portland, Maine.  Every morning on February 14, Portland residents and visitors would  wake up and walk the streets of the city covered in reminders of  unconditional love handed out without any expectation of recognition or  thanks.   The identity of the Valentine's Day Bandit remained a mystery that  confounded and delighted Mainers for decades--until now. Kevin passed  away unexpectedly this past weekend, and his family decided it was  finally time to unmask the man who had left an indelible mark on the  city of Portland.   Kevin never wanted recognition during his life, but his family wanted  to honor him in his passing.   I thank Kevin's family for sharing him with us for so long and for  allowing us the opportunity to say thank you and honor him now in his  passing.   May his legacy of love transcend his life and continue to inspire us  to show kindness to one another every single day of the year.                            ____________________
