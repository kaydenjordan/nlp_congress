 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to underscore the pressing  need to protect the full faith and credit of the United States and  cleanly raise the debt ceiling.   The debt default would be catastrophic for my constituents in  Virginia's Fourth District and for Americans across the Nation. It  would jeopardize Social Security payments for 98,000 families in my  district and disrupt over $160 million a month in Social Security  income, not to mention its detrimental impacts on mortgage payments,  student loans, car loans, and more.   Yet, congressional Republicans are holding the American economy  hostage, threatening a default unless their extreme proposals are met.  Let's be clear, H.R. 2811, or the default on America act, would slash  funding and limit access to crucial social safety net programs like  SNAP benefits, school funding, and childcare options, which would  disproportionately impact low-income communities and communities of  color.   It would also immediately rescind $2 billion in funding of veteran  medical care, impacting countless veterans and families in our  communities.   Mr. Speaker, we need to cleanly raise the debt ceiling without  strings attached that affect our national security interests.                            ____________________
