 Madam Speaker, I thank my very good friend and  colleague from the great State of Ohio, Marcy Kaptur, for her  leadership on this. It is remarkable.   Madam Speaker, I, too, rise today in support of Ukraine and its fight  against tyranny. Imagine where we would be, the global community, had  the United States and Europe joined forces in 1939 to stop Hitler when  he invaded Poland?   The world is watching us now, and Russia wants nothing more than for  the United States and our allies to abandon Ukraine. That is the big  win for Putin.   Abandoning Ukraine would give Putin and his despots like him the  green light to further their wars of imperialism and expansion, and  history, as I mentioned, shows us that appeasing autocrats has  devastating consequences. Doing so could draw the United States and our  allies into direct conflict, putting American troops in harm's way.   Ukraine is fighting for its survival. Eastern Europe is fighting for  its survival. The United States in partnership with our allies must  stand firm by Ukraine's side as it fights to defend its freedom, its  sovereignty, and its future.   We have to pass a budget. We have to pass this much-needed investment  in our global partners. We can, if and when the Speaker realizes how  serious of a moment this is and decides to be serious and bring us a  bipartisan bill which will pass overwhelmingly.
