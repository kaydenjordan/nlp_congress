 Mr. President, in March, Mr. Comey briefed Ranking  Member Feinstein and this Senator on the Russia investigation. This  included telling us who was and who was not under investigation.   After that meeting, I publicly called for Mr. Comey to tell the  public what he had told us about whether President Trump was under  investigation. I did this because the public had a right to know. Mr.  Comey told me and other congressional leaders that the President was  not under investigation. He even told the President himself, and I  understand that he repeatedly told this to the President. But Mr. Comey  didn't listen to my request for transparency. I think transparency in  government is very important because transparency brings  accountability, and government needs to be accountable. Mr. Comey  didn't listen to the President's request. Only months later has the  truth finally come out.   Well, it ought to raise the question with anybody: What happened in  the meantime? What happened because Mr. Comey refused to tell the  American people that the President wasn't under investigation? The  short answer is something you see almost hourly, particularly in this  city: media hysteria. Countless media articles falsely claimed the  President was under investigation for colluding with Russia.  Unfortunately, a number of our Democrat colleagues in the House and  Senate played right along. Over and over again, the media published  selective leaks. They published classified half-truths. All this was  used to make false allegations of sinister conduct by the President.  And, of course, there were a lot of people who believed it.   The intelligence community conducted an assessment of Russia's  efforts to interfere in the election. That assessment said one of  Russia's goals was to undermine public confidence in our democratic  system.   Because Mr. Comey refused to tell the public that the FBI was not  investigating the President, conspiracy theories and, of course, wild  speculation have run rampant about the election, the President, and  Russia. These conspiracy theories and wild speculation have played  right into Russia's aim of undermining faith in our democratic system.  [[Page S3708]]    That doesn't come out very often in these stories, but we have to  understand that Russia makes a career of not only undermining  democratic systems in the United States, look at what they have done in  Ukraine militarily, and look at what they have done in France with the  elections and in the Netherlands with the elections. They are talking  about upcoming elections in Germany, where the Russians will try to do  the same thing because autocrats don't like democratic systems that  work and whatever they can do to undermine those democratic systems is  going to obviously make them look better in comparison.   Those national security concerns should have taken precedence. Mr.  Comey said he was worried about a duty to correct the record if  evidence of collusion involving the President came to light later on.  But that concern was merely hypothetical--in other words, pure  speculation. In the unlikely event that it came to pass, the public  should know if the FBI is pursuing a criminal investigation against the  President, just as the public should know if the FBI is pursuing a  criminal investigation against a major party's nominee for President.  But Mr. Comey agreed with Attorney General Lynch to shade the truth in  favor of the Clinton campaign's rhetoric and call what was an  investigation a ``matter'' instead of using the word ``investigation.''  This came about because of an order by Attorney General Lynch.   After a year of the entire might of the U.S. intelligence community  and the FBI looking for evidence of collusion with the Russians, where  is that evidence? But after all of this chaos and mountains of innuendo  about the President and collusion with Russia, the truth finally came  out: The FBI was not investigating President Trump in the Russia probe.  The media was wrong. The Democrats were wrong. The wild speculation and  conspiracy theories ended up harming our country. They played right  into Russia's hands.    How did we all learn the truth? In President Trump's letter removing  Mr. Comey from office. At first, most didn't believe it. The media  scoffed when they read what the President said in that letter. They  insisted that Mr. Comey would never tell the President that he was not  under investigation. We learned earlier this month from Mr. Comey  himself that he had done exactly that. It wasn't a surprise to me  because Mr. Comey had told me the same thing.   I have to note something else here. Mr. Comey didn't just tell the  President, Senator Feinstein, and me that the President was not under  investigation. He had also told the Gang of 8. Of course, the Gang of 8  includes the Senate minority leader, Mr. Schumer. But even after Mr.  Comey told the Gang of 8 that the President was not under  investigation, the minority leader told the media that the President  was under investigation, and, of course, that further helped feed media  hysteria. The minority leader even tried to say that the Senate  shouldn't vote on the Supreme Court nomination because the President  was under investigation, and the whole time, he knew it wasn't true.   Media hysteria and baseless political attacks filled the vacuum left  by Mr. Comey's failure to inform the public--to be transparent, to be  accountable.   The odd thing about it is none of this fiasco had to happen. If Mr.  Comey had just been transparent with the public, as I urged him to be,  it could have been avoided.   Unfortunately, now it looks as if Mr. Comey and the media might be  doing the same thing to Attorney General Sessions.   Two weeks ago, Mr. Comey said he didn't tell the Attorney General  about the conversation he supposedly had with the President about  General Flynn. Mr. Comey said this was because he believed the Attorney  General was going to recuse himself from the Russia investigation.   Mr. Comey said the FBI was aware of the facts that he couldn't  discuss in an open setting that could have made the Attorney General's  continued engagement problematic. Well, that vague statement sounds  very mysterious to people who don't know the whole truth. They will  wonder: What were those secret facts? What did the FBI conclude about  those secret facts? Was the Attorney General under investigation? Did  the Attorney General collude with Russia?   Once again, Mr. Comey is not being as transparent about senior  government officials and the Russia investigation as he could or should  be. Now the speculation is running rampant again, this time about the  Attorney General instead of the President.   CNN reported that Mr. Comey told the Intelligence Committee behind  closed doors that the issue was a possible additional meeting between  Sessions and the Russian Ambassador. The media has begun to speculate  all sorts of nefarious things. So here we go again. The rumor mill is  back in business. It is insinuating improper ties with Russians and  undermining people's faith in another senior government official, with  the follow-up that it also undermines people's confidence in our  institutions of government, and maybe even in our Constitution.   This is the same destructive pattern, and it plays right into the  Russians' hands again. Well, this time around, we shouldn't put up with  it. We ought to say enough is enough. There is no reason Mr. Comey  couldn't have told the public the whole truth.   Once again, 3 months ago, Mr. Comey specifically told Members who was  and who was not under investigation in the Russia probe. He should also  tell the public whether the FBI ever had an open investigation on  Attorney General Sessions. He should tell the public whether the FBI  checked out the times Sessions met the Russian Ambassador. He should  tell the public whether the FBI looked into the Mayflower Hotel event  that went on. He should tell the public if the FBI found nothing  improper about these meetings. If there was nothing to it, he should  say so publicly. He should not be telling Senators one thing behind  closed doors and then making public insinuations that are different. He  is the person who can nip this ridiculous speculation in the bud.   Mr. Comey should have told the public earlier what he told Members  about the President, and now he should tell the public what he told  Members about the Attorney General. Enough of this nonsense.   The investigations of Russian interference and of circumstances  surrounding Mr. Comey's firing will continue. I am confident that we  will eventually get all the facts, one way or another, and we are going  to go where the facts take us. In the meantime, it is time to stop the  rumor-mongering. It is time to stop the innuendoes and half-truths. It  is time to stop leaking national security information to score  political points. And it is time to stop playing into Russia's hands by  intentionally sowing false doubt about your political opponents.  Instead, it is quite obvious that it is time to get back to doing the  people's business.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record  a relevant supplemental article from the Washington Post.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                 [From the Washington Post, June 14, 2017]       The Sessions Hearing Shows Who's Really Colluding With Russia                           (By Marc A. Thiessen)         According to the U.S. intelligence community, Russia's       objectives in meddling in the 2016 election included not only       hurting Hillary Clinton's chances but also undermining       ``public faith in the U.S. democratic process,'' ``impugning       the fairness of the election'' and calling into question       ``the U.S.-led liberal democratic order.'' If the spectacle       of the past few months is any indication, Russian leader       Vladimir Putin is certainly succeeding in these latter goals.        And here is the great irony: Those who are falsely claiming       that Trump was under FBI investigation for collusion with       Moscow are, in fact, the ones inadvertently colluding with       Putin to undermine American democracy.        Case in point is the campaign of McCarthyite character       assassination on display in the Senate Intelligence Committee       hearing Tuesday. No doubt Putin was smiling as Attorney       General Jeff Sessions was forced to rebut what he correctly       called ``appalling and detestable'' accusations that he       colluded with the Russians and lied to the Senate. Sessions       testified that the much-vaunted ``third meeting'' between       Sessions and the Russian ambassador at the Mayflower Hotel--      which Sessions reportedly failed to disclose--did not happen,       at least not beyond possible incidental contact that he       doesn't even recall.        There was a time when airing unproven allegations of       coordinating with the Kremlin was seen as bad form. Now it is       common practice in Washington. These kinds of false charges       and innuendo directly assist Russia  [[Page S3709]]       in its efforts to undermine public confidence in our       democratic institutions. Those raising such accusations       without proof are, wittingly or unwittingly, doing the       Kremlin's bidding.        For months, Democrats (a.k.a. ``The Resistance'') have been       spinning the false narrative that President Trump was under       FBI investigation to call into question the validity of his       presidency. In March, Democrats used it as a pretext to argue       that Trump did not have the legitimacy to fill a Supreme       Court vacancy. Senate Democratic leader Charles E. Schumer       (N.Y.) declared in a floor speech that the Senate should not       vote on Neil Gorsuch's nomination because Republicans       ``stopped a president who wasn't under investigation'' from       filling the seat. Two days later, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-      Mass.) said the same thing, declaring, ``The FBI has revealed       that the sitting president of the United States is under       investigation. And it raises a really, I think, important       question and that is whether or not a president who is under       investigation by the FBI ought to be ramming through a       Supreme Court nominee that would have a lifetime       appointment.''        The media gleefully echoed these false claims. The day       before Comey testified, CNN blared: ``In testimony, Comey       will dispute President Trump's blanket claim that he was told       he wasn't under investigation.'' In fact, Comey said       precisely the opposite. When Sen. James Risch (R-Idaho)       asked, ``While you were director, the president of the United       States was not under investigation. Is that a fair       statement?'' Comey replied: ``That's correct.'' Even then,       CNN was not willing to concede its error, declaring in a so-      called ``correction'' that ``Comey does not directly dispute       that Trump was told multiple times he was not under       investigation'' (emphasis added).        No, Comey did not fail to ``directly dispute'' it, he       directly confirmed it. The CNN story--and its non-correction       correction--was ``fake news.''        Not only that, Comey also testified that Trump never tried       to get him to stop the probe into Russia's election meddling,       which Comey explained was a separate matter from the FBI's       investigation of disgraced former national security adviser       Michael Flynn. Not only did Trump not ask Comey to stop the       probe, the former FBI director told Sen. Marco Rubio (R-      Fla.), ``He went farther than that. He said, and if some of       my satellites did something wrong, it'd be good to find that       out.'' Rubio pressed Comey, asking whether he was testifying       that Trump effectively said, ``Do the Russia investigation. I       hope it all comes out. I have nothing to do with anything       Russia. It'd be great if it all came out, people around me       were doing things that were wrong.'' Comey replied, ``That       was the sentiment he was expressing. Yes, sir.''        Given these facts, Trump has legitimate reason to be       frustrated. If you knew you were not under investigation by       the FBI, but everyone was saying you were, you'd want the       truth to get out. And you might be upset with an FBI director       who refused to lift the ``cloud'' hanging over your       administration by confirming that he was not investigating       you.        That said, Trump has been fueling the liberal feeding       frenzy with his tweetstorms taking his critics to task. If       Trump knows he did nothing wrong--and if he really wants to       find out whether any of his ``satellites'' did--he should       stop talking and tweeting about the investigation, let       special counsel Robert S. Mueller III do his work and focus       on his job: governing. His daughter Ivanka Trump was recently       asked how she dealt with the media frenzy over Russia. She       replied, ``I'm trying to keep my head down, not listen to the       noise and just work really hard to make a positive impact in       the lives of many people.''        That's a good strategy--and one her father ought to       emulate.     I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.
