 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3922. I  want to thank Chairman Walden and Dr. Burgess for their leadership in  bringing this bill to the floor today.   The CHAMPIONING HEALTHY KIDS Act reauthorizes and funds a number of  programs important to my constituents, including the State Children's  Health Insurance Program, community health centers, and the Teaching  Health Center Graduate Medical Education program.   H.R. 3922 will continue CHIP for 5 years, allowing this successful  Federal-State partnership to provide health coverage for low-income  children and pregnant women. It also extends funding to federally  qualified health centers for 2 years, a key component of the healthcare  safety net; and helps address our increasing health provider shortages  by investing in the education and training of future health  professionals.   Of importance, this legislation is fully paid for with responsible  policies, such as measures to allow States to disenroll lottery winners  from Medicaid and prioritize the most vulnerable.   I am proud of the good work that was done by the Energy and Commerce  Committee to advance this legislation to the floor, and I encourage my  colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the bill and to ensure the programs are  available for the people who depend upon them.
