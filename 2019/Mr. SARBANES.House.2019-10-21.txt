 Mr. Speaker, I rise to remember a great American  patriot, Elijah Cummings.   On behalf of the people of Baltimore, I want to thank him for his  incredible leadership, for his friendship to so many, for his  mentorship of so many in the community and to me.   I had the privilege for almost 12 years, the last 12 years of  Elijah's life, to sit a few feet away from him in the  [[Page H8284]]  Oversight and Reform Committee and to see what a national leader he  was, how he fought for the left out and the locked out.   I also had the opportunity to be with him on many occasions in  Baltimore, to see how people responded to him, how they invested in his  leadership. We will miss that dearly.   I was thinking today as I drove from Baltimore through West  Baltimore, the community he loved, about his fight for the soul of our  democracy, and I had anxiety about if we can continue that fight  without him. But it occurred to me that Elijah would not have left us  when he did if he didn't believe that we had it within ourselves to  finish that fight.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Elijah for his inspiration. May his memory be  eternal.                            ____________________
