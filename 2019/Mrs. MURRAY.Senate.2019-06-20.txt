 Mr. President, as ranking member of the Senate  Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, I rise to pay  tribute to Peg Seminario, a fierce advocate for working people with  more than 40 years leading the AFL-CIO and the labor movement in  fighting for stronger protections and safer worker conditions for  workers.   Peg has led the AFL-CIO's safety and health program since 1990 and  throughout her career has played a leading role in the fight to  promulgate strong health and safety standards pertaining to major  hazards facing workers, including asbestos, lead, silica, noise, and  ergonomics. In fact, she has had a hand in every major health and  safety rule adopted since 1977--almost all of which were adopted since  the inception of the Occupational Safety and Health Act, OSHA.   She has pushed Congress to protect and enhance the provisions of the  OSH Act; to increase Federal funding for critical worker protection  Agencies, including the Occupational Safety and Health Administration,  the Mine Safety and Health Administration, and the National Institute  for Occupational Safety and Health; and worked tirelessly to see that  first responders who responded after the 9/11 attack and suffered  illnesses as a result received the necessary medical care they need and  deserve.   I hope my colleagues will join me in recognizing Mrs. Seminario's  distinguished career and thanking her for her efforts to protect the  health and safety of workers in America.                            ____________________
