 Madam Speaker, title 42 is a critical tool to manage  the crisis at the southern border. It is hard to believe that the Biden  administration claims that the termination of title 42 would actually  decrease the number of encounters at the border. This is not only  grotesquely disingenuous; it is actually laughable.   Does the administration not remember the caravans headed to the  southern border when the administration just announced the end of title  42?   Do you know the cartels actually used the end of title 42 to promote,  to advertise, their human smuggling business?   Has the administration even spoken to our brave heroes, the Border  Patrol agents, who consistently say that without title 42 authority,  they would lose any semblance of operational control on the border?   Let's be clear. The expected influx of border crossings if title 42  ended is not just a humanitarian crisis, which it is. It is a national  security crisis, as well. The cartels will once again use the increased  flow as a distraction to continue to bring in record amounts of  narcotics such as fentanyl.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous  question so that we can bring up H.R. 471, the PAUSE Act, to help give  our border agents the tools that they need in order to achieve  operational control of the border.
