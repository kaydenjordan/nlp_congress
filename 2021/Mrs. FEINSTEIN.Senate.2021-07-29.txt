 Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the  ``Affordable EVs for Working Families Act of 2021.''   This bill is an important measure that will ensure more widespread,  equitable adoption of electric vehicles by creating a tax credit for  buyers of pre-owned electric vehicles, similar to the tax credit that  exists for purchasers of new electric vehicles.   Starting now, and over the next several decades, the United States  must take swift, decisive action to reduce our carbon emissions-- especially from the transportation sector, which makes up one-third of  all U.S. carbon emissions.   I am proud to say that California has led the way in the adoption of  low- and zero-emission vehicles for several decades by incentivizing  the development and purchase of electric and hybrid electric vehicles,  and setting high fuel economy standards that 13 States have opted to  follow.   According to research released just last month by the Pew Research  Center, California has by far the highest share of electric vehicles of  any State in the Nation--on average, 12 electric vehicles registered  per 1,000 people.   As a result, California now has the largest pre-owned electric  vehicle market in the nation. Sales for pre-owned electric vehicles in  California have grown significantly in recent years.   However, a study released just last month by Energy Innovation found  that for lower-income households, the up-front costs of purchasing an  electric vehicle presents an especially large hurdle, despite the long- term cost savings that they offer, such as on gas and maintenance.   Transportation is the second-largest expense for all U.S. households,  but presents a particular burden for lower-income households-- suggesting that incentives for pre-owned buyers targeted toward lower  and middle-income communities can increase adoption of electric  vehicles in those communities significantly, and further accelerate  overall adoption.   We cannot miss an opportunity to ensure that as we electrify our  transportation sector, electric vehicles become an option for all  families--not just those who can afford new ones.   My bill would do just that.   My bill would provide a $2,500 tax credit to purchasers of preowned  electric vehicles, similar to the credit already offered to purchasers  of new electric vehicles. The credit only applies to vehicles that cost  $25,000 or less, and would be phased down for buyers whose adjusted  gross income exceeds $75,000 per year for individuals and $150,000 for  joint filers.   My bill also includes critical safeguards such as a vehicle  identification number reporting requirements and a 2-year previous  ownership requirement to ensure that any attempted fraud is quickly  caught.   I would like to thank Congressmen Jimmy Gomez who is introducing the  House companion to this bill, and has carried this effort in the House,  along with Congressman Mike Thompson who included a similar provision  in the House clean energy tax incentives package, the GREEN Act.   I would also like to thank the Los Angeles Department of Water and  Power, California Air Resources Board, our utilities and other  California localities that have led the way on this policy by offering  their own rebates for pre-owned electric vehicles.   Now, with the Senate considering historic investments in electric  vehicles and charging infrastructure, it is time for the federal  government to follow California's lead and ensure that buyers of pre- owned vehicles receive a tax credit similar to the one for buyers of  new EVs.   I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Thank you, Mr. President.  I yield the floor.                                  ______                                         By Ms. HIRONO (for herself, Mr. Whitehouse, Mrs. Murray, and Mr.          Durbin):   S. 2553. A bill to amend title 28, United States Code, to protect  employees of the Federal judiciary from discrimination, and for other  purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.
