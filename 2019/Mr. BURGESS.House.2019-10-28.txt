 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   As an author of the Educating Medical Professionals and Optimizing  Workforce Efficiency and Readiness for Health Act of 2019, also known  as the EMPOWER for Health Act, I rise in support of this bill, H.R.  2781. This moved with strong bipartisan support through regular order  in the Energy and Commerce Committee and its Health Subcommittee.   As the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Health Subcommittee in the  last Congress, I made it a priority to get this bill to the House  floor. While I succeeded in doing so, the Senate did not take up the  legislation; so I hope, this year, with plenty of time and plenty of  runway, the Senate will reauthorize these critically important  programs.   This legislation reauthorizes the title VII health professions  workforce programs for fiscal years 2020 through 2024.   Title VII programs have expired, but they continue to receive  appropriations. In fact, in fiscal year 2018, the appropriations levels  for these programs actually increased. Reauthorizing these physician  workforce programs will provide the needed stability to those who  depend upon this funding.                                time  1800    Title VII of the Public Health Services Act includes programs that  are vital to building and maintaining a well-educated, well-trained  physician workforce. The EMPOWER Act reauthorizes the funding for Area  Health Education Centers at more than $40 million a year. These centers  are critical in providing both medical education and healthcare  services to medically underserved areas.   The bill also reauthorizes programs that incentivize diversity in the  physician workforce, including the Centers of Excellence program which  this bill authorizes at a level of $24 million per year. This  particular program provides grants to medical schools that have a  disproportionate number of minority students for the purpose of  expanding the school's capacity or to improve curriculum.   Primary care is an important aspect of our Nation's healthcare  system, and now many Americans receive the majority of their healthcare  services through primary care centers. H.R. 2781 reauthorizes funding  for our Primary Care Training and Enhancement Program at more than $50  million a year. This program provides grants to hospitals and other  professional schools to develop and operate supplemental primary  training programs.   Lastly, this bill aims to strengthen our workforce that cares for our  geriatric population. This bill makes strides towards modernizing the  Geriatric Workforce Enhancement program and the Geriatric Academic  Career Awards. With an aging population, our workforce needs to be  adequately trained in handling the unique needs of our seniors. These  two programs enable physicians and other providers to be able to  achieve that training.   I want to thank Representative Schakowsky and the staff of the Energy  and Commerce Committee for their work on this legislation.  Reauthorizing title VII is long overdue, especially in a time when our  existing physician workforce is struggling to keep up with the demand  for healthcare services.   Madam Speaker, I urge support of this legislation, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, I have no additional speakers and am prepared to  close.   This is a good bill. It was a good bill last Congress when we passed  it then and sent it over to the Senate. The authorization on these  programs has expired. They are continuing to receive funding. The  people who depend upon these programs deserve the certainty that  reauthorization would allow.   Madam Speaker, I urge passage of the bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I support H.R. 728, the Title VIII Nursing Workforce  Reauthorization Act of 2019 which was introduced by Mr. Joyce, our  Republican lead of Ohio. This bill reauthorizes the title VIII nursing  workforce programs for fiscal years 2020 through 2024. Title VIII  programs, in addition to the title VII physician workforce programs,  have actually expired, but they have continued to receive  appropriations.   According to a Health Resource and Services Administration report on  nursing workforce projections in 2017, the future supply of and demand  for nurses will be affected by a host of factors, including population  growth, aging of the Nation's population, overall economic conditions,  expanded health insurance coverage, changes in healthcare  reimbursement, geographic location, and health workforce availability.  The demands for RNs are projected to increase by nearly 800,000 between  2014 and 2030.   Texas is projected to face a shortage of all types of nurses by 2030.  Registered nurses, nurse practitioners, certified nurse anesthetists,  and certified nurse-midwives will fall short of demand year after year  from now until 2030. This is an issue that we are facing across the  country, and H.R. 728 can help fix that.   While our appropriations process has continued to fund these  programs, without authorization there remains uncertainty regarding how  much money the program will receive each year. These programs range  from providing our advanced practice nurses with additional educational  opportunities to increasing nursing workforce diversity.   In the midst of a nursing shortage, we must ensure that our  healthcare system has the capacity to educate and retain a qualified  workforce and also allows for career advancement. This bill includes  grants for nurses of different levels of education to obtain further  education to advance within their profession. Additionally, this  legislation reauthorizes loan repayments, scholarships, and grants for  education, practice, quality, and retention. These provisions are  essential in educating and retaining a qualified nursing workforce.   Madam Speaker, I urge support of H.R. 728, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Ohio (Mr. Joyce), who is the Republican lead on this bill.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Again, this is one of those bills that passed out of the Subcommittee  on Health last Congress, passed on the floor of the House, and, for  some reason, didn't see action over in the Senate. This year, it needs  to, for all the reasons we have heard articulated here today.   I also am obligated to mention that my district in Texas is home to  one of the largest and best nursing education programs in the country  at Texas Woman's University.   I would also be remiss if I didn't acknowledge the work done in the  last Congress by Lois Capps, who was our colleague at the time, who is  no longer in Congress, but it was always her passion to see this bill  passed.   Madam Speaker, I urge passage, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise to speak in support of H.R. 2115, the Public  Disclosure of Drug Discounts and Real-Time Beneficiary Drug Cost Act.    This bill includes three provisions that passed through the Committee  on Energy and Commerce in July as part of a larger transparency  package, at that time called the METRIC Act.   The first provision aims to hold pharmacy benefit managers  accountable in the negotiation of rebates by requiring the Secretary of  the Department of Health and Human Services to make rebates, discounts,  direct and indirect remuneration fees, and other information available  on a public website. This policy includes a requirement that this  information be displayed in such a way that it maintains the  confidentiality of individual drugs and plans.   What I believe is the most important provision is the one that  requires prescription drug plan sponsors to include real-time benefits  information in electronic prescribing in Medicare. As a physician, I  recognize how important it is for doctors to have as much information  at their disposal in prescribing appropriate medications for their  patients.   Madam Speaker, I thank my fellow Texans, Jodey Arrington as well as  Pete Olson, for bringing forth this policy.   In the past few years, we have begun to see the success of the 21st  Century Cures Act actually come to life. New treatments and new cures  are coming to the market at an exciting pace, providing great promise  for America's patients.   It is important that doctors be able to see and compare the prices of  these medications so that they can help their patients assess their  options. Price transparency at the point of prescribing will provide  physicians with information regarding what would or would not be  covered under their patients' insurance and would help them discuss  what would be the most affordable options that are available to their  patients.   While there are a lot of factors that doctors must consider when  prescribing their patients' medications, medication adherence is  essential. If patients cannot afford their drugs, the stage is set for  a lack of adherence to the recommended regimen.   We have all heard the stories of patients showing up at the pharmacy  counter to pick up their prescriptions, at which point they learn it is  unaffordable. This policy would help reduce the number of prescriptions  left at the pharmacy counter, not picked up due to cost concerns.   The American Medical Association testified at our drug supply hearing  in May that ``access to accurate patient coverage and cost-sharing  information at the point-of-care would streamline the process, reduce  burden for the physician and the patient, and speed delivery of the  most appropriate care.''   I agree with that statement, and I am pleased this legislation would  improve access to real-time benefits data, further informing quality  and doctor-patient decisionmaking and improving patient access to  affordable medications.   Madam Speaker, I urge Members to support H.R. 2115, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Carter), a pharmacist by profession and a very valuable  member of the Health Subcommittee of the Committee on Energy and  Commerce.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Arrington), coauthor of this legislation.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Montana (Mr. Gianforte), a valuable member of the Health Subcommittee.    Madam Speaker, I urge passage of this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 647, the Palliative Care and  Hospice Education and Training Act, by Representatives Engel and Tom  Reed and cosponsored by many Members of the House. This helps build our  palliative and hospice care workforce by establishing and supporting  palliative care and hospice education centers through Federal grants,  while enhancing research in palliative care at the National Institutes  of Health.   1.5 million Medicare beneficiaries were enrolled in hospice care for  some time during 2017. With the American population aging, we need to  be sure that our workforce is prepared to handle the influx of patients  transitioning into palliative and hospice care.   The bill's sponsors and advocates have worked hard for the past few  years to get this legislation to the President's desk. As the chairman  of the Energy and Commerce Health Subcommittee last year, I made it a  priority to move this bill.   I also think that this bill complements the House of Representatives'  work on the opioid crisis. It is appropriate that we are passing this  bill now as we come to the 1-year anniversary of passage of the SUPPORT  Act.   The bill before us today could address the issue from a different  angle. With the growing scrutiny on doctors prescribing opioids in the  midst of the  [[Page H8525]]  opioid crisis, we must remember that there are patients with legitimate  chronic pain. While the use of opioids can lead to substance use  disorder, these patients still need access to their pain medications,  particularly if they have been successfully maintained and managed on  opioids in close consultation with their doctors.   This bill will ensure that we have a palliative and hospice care  workforce that is adequately trained to manage patients with serious  illness, which frequently includes some aspect of chronic pain or the  need for pain relief.   I am disappointed that we did not include a provision that  stakeholders believe is necessary in order for this bill to become law.  Senate language included this small but necessary change, and I expect  that this issue will be resolved prior to the bill's arrival at the  President's desk.   Mr. Speaker, with a commitment to including this legislative  language, I urge Members to support H.R. 647, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Reed), the co-author of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Carter), a valuable member of the Health  Subcommittee of the Committee on Energy and Commerce.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support of the bill, and I yield back the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1781, the Payment Commission  Data Act of 2019, which was introduced by my colleague, Representative  Carter of Georgia. This bill provides the Medicare Payment Advisory  Commission, colloquially known as MedPAC, and the Medicaid and CHIP  Payment and Access Commission, affectionately known as MACPAC, with  access to certain drug payment information.   MedPAC is an independent congressional agency that serves to advise  Congress on issues affecting the Medicare program. And MACPAC is a  nonpartisan legislative branch agency that provides policy and data  analysis and makes recommendations to Congress on issues affecting  Medicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance Program.   The issue was brought to our attention that despite getting similar  data, such as plan bid data, we were surprised to learn that while this  data could be shared by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services  with the Government Accountability Office and the Congressional Budget  Office, it could not be shared with MedPAC or MACPAC, leading us to  this effort to correct this in a bipartisan way through H.R. 1781.   By providing these entities with drug payment and drug rebate  information, MedPAC and MACPAC will be better able to analyze the drug  cost data in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Therefore, these  commissions will be able to make better recommendations to Congress on  how to address drug pricing based on accurate and factual data.   In a letter from MedPAC to Chairman Pallone, Chairwoman Eshoo,  Republican Leader Walden, and myself in March, MedPAC said that ``a  statutory change giving us access to these data would enhance our  capabilities for assisting the Congress on issues relating to  prescription drug costs.'' The letter further outlines a number of ways  that this data would help MedPAC support Congress and serve the  commission's intended purpose.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record their letter.                                          Medicare Payment Advisory                                                      Commission,                                     Washington, DC, March 26, 2019.      Re: Drug pricing and rebate data      Hon. Frank Pallone, Jr.,      Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Anna G. Eshoo,      Chairman, Subcommittee on Health, Committee on Energy and           Commerce,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Greg Walden,      Ranking Member, Committee on Energy and Commerce,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Michael C. Burgess, M.D.,      Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Health, Committee on Energy           and Commerce,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairmen and Ranking Members: The Medicare Payment       Advisory Commission (MedPAC) is an independent, legislative       branch agency established by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997       (P.L. 105-33) to provide expert policy and technical advice       to the Congress on issues affecting the Medicare program.       Medicare spending has grown substantially over the last       decade, particularly for  [[Page H8527]]       prescription drugs, placing an increasing financial burden on       the taxpayers and beneficiaries who finance it. Congress       plays a vital role in overseeing Medicare and solving these       fiscal challenges so that the program remains secure for       current and future beneficiaries. MedPAC serves as an       important source of information and advice to the Congress as       it exercises that oversight. To enable MedPAC to best advise       the Congress on how to address the problems stemming from the       high and rising costs of prescription drugs, I am writing to       request a narrow change in law that would grant MedPAC staff       access to important drug pricing and rebate data that other       congressional agencies are already able to use. The change in       statute is necessary because MedPAC is unable to access the       data under existing statutory authority.        MedPAC uses a wide variety of data in order to support the       Congress' oversight of Medicare, and the Commission has a       strong track record of protecting different types of       proprietary and confidential information. For example, MedPAC       uses and keeps secure the bids that private insurance plans       submit under Medicare Parts C and D, data that Medicare       Advantage plans submit on encounters between beneficiaries       and their health care providers, and data on beneficiaries'       use of prescription drugs.        To ensure that the Congress has comprehensive and up-to-      date information, MedPAC strives to use all available data       pertinent to our analyses. The Commission uses these data to       provide information to the Congress on spending by Medicare       and its beneficiaries and to help the Congress develop       policies to improve the value of taxpayer dollars used to       finance the program. MedPAC delivers this information in       mandated reports, congressional testimony, and frequent       briefings to congressional staff.        The large growth in drug spending has been a key       contributor to the financial strain on Medicare and its       beneficiaries. Today, Medicare spends more than $100 billion       annually on prescription drugs under Parts B and D, and       beneficiaries are exposed to more than $20 billion in cost       sharing liability. Of particular concern is the growing       number of beneficiaries who are exposed to very large cost       sharing amounts when they take extremely high-priced drugs.        Despite broad data access under its authorizing statute,       MedPAC is unable to access important drug pricing and rebate       information under Medicare Parts B and D, and under Medicaid,       because of how specific places of the Social Security Act are       constructed (for example, MedPAC is not specifically named in       Section 1927(b)(3)(D) of the Social Security Act as one of       the entities with access to certain data detailing how much       the Medicare program and its beneficiaries pay for       prescription drugs). Because we lack these important data, we       have been limited in the analysis and information we can       provide to the Congress as it grapples with how to bring down       the prices of drugs for beneficiaries and taxpayers. A       statutory change giving us access to these data would enhance       our capabilities for assisting the Congress on issues related       to prescription drug costs.        With these data, MedPAC staff could:        Assist Congress in understanding the true costs (net of       rebates) of prescription drugs to beneficiaries and taxpayers       under the Medicare program.        Evaluate different policy options that aim to bring down       the prices of drugs and the cost sharing that beneficiaries       face for their medicines at the point of sale.        Provide insight into how Part D plans manage the growth in       drug prices.        Analyze the effects of market entry and competition on drug       prices.        MedPAC looks forward to continuing to support the Congress       in developing approaches to payment that ensure beneficiary       access to important therapies, while reducing costs for the       Medicare program and its beneficiaries. I very much       appreciate your consideration of this request for this       statutory change, and I also appreciate the support that the       Congress has long given to the Commission.            Sincerely,                                          Francis J. Crosson, M.D.,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, this bill continues the work of the Energy  and Commerce Committee last Congress where we marked up a discussion  draft of this very bill at the Health Subcommittee, which I chaired.  Drug pricing remains an issue for patients in the United States and  this bill will allow the House to act on factual analysis and  recommendations to help lower drug prices for Americans.   Mr. Speaker, I urge fellow Members to support H.R. 1781, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 5 minutes to the  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Carter), the principal author of this bill  and a valuable member of the Health Subcommittee of the Committee on  Energy and Commerce.    Mr. Speaker, I urge support of the underlying bill, and  I yield back the balance of my time.
