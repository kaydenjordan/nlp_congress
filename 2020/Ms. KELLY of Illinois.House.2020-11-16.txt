 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to challenge this  Congress to act to end the shocking health disparities that COVID-19  has put on display. To date, nearly 250,000 Americans have lost their  lives to COVID-19 and more than 10 million have been infected. And  these numbers are still rising.   Shocking, but not surprisingly, a disproportionate number, as you  have heard, of those who fought and those who fought and lost battles  with COVID-19 have been people of color. Once again, another public  health crisis has taken an oversized toll on Black Americans, Latinx  Americans, Asian and Pacific Americans, and Native Americans.   COVID-19 is simply the latest in a long list of diseases, including  cancer, addiction, HIV/AIDS, maternal mortality, diabetes,  cardiovascular conditions, and on and on and on, with a  disproportionate impact on communities of color.   Why does this continue to be the case in America, the greatest,  richest, most powerful country in the history of our world?   The answer is simple: health disparities.   In America, despite all of our technology and pledges to equity, the  ZIP Code in which you are born is nearly inescapable as a determinant  of your life, your health, and, yes, even your death.   In Chicago, part of my district, life expectancy varies up to 30  years by neighborhood. The pattern is the same across most American  communities.   But what are the social determinants of health, or, as I like to say,  the social determinants of life?   In short, they are all of the nonmedical factors that impact your  health, the things you don't necessarily see a doctor for, such as not  having ample fresh food and vegetables in your diet because there  aren't any grocery stores in your community; missing routine preventive  care, such as cancer screenings, because seeing the doctor means  getting up at 4 a.m., taking two buses, and missing a day of work or  school.   It means worrying about manganese or lead poisoning in the air you  breathe, the water you drink, or the playground where your child plays.   It means dealing with stress, anxiety, and depression from housing  instability on top of a recession and pandemic.   All of these factors decide our lives, our health, and, tragically,  again, our death. So many of these factors are out of one's individual  control, including environmental factors, the location of medical  facilities, discriminatory housing policy, and discrimination and so  forth.   We all know these factors have been with us for a long time. They  have been undermining our health and the health of generations of  Americans for centuries.   As we work on these issues, I am continuously reminded of a quote  from Dr. King: ``Of all of the forms of inequality, injustice in  healthcare is the most shocking and inhumane.''   Despite 70 years passing and amazing technological and societal  advancement since he spoke these words, injustice in healthcare, of all  of the forms of inequality, still remains the most shocking and  inhumane.   Right now, we are seeing parallel COVID-19 pandemics: one in  wealthier, whiter communities, and a much harsher one in vulnerable  communities of color.   But this is America. There shouldn't be a two-tiered system, because  when it comes to public health, we are all in this together.   The only solution is to root out health disparities at their source.  We must end systemic racism and a lack of opportunities for low-income  and minority communities.   To address these issues in healthcare, my colleague and mentor,  Congresswoman Barbara Lee, has introduced the COVID Community Care Act,  H.R. 8192. This legislation, which I am proud to support and my office  helped develop, will provide grants for community-based organizations  and nonprofits to conduct testing, tracing, and outreach activities in  communities.   Given the number and rates of COVID-19, we know that these resources  are most urgently needed in communities of color. I believe this  legislation is central to making health equity a cornerstone of our  Nation's immediate pandemic response. I am proud to be an original  cosponsor of this important and immediate-acting legislation.   Additionally, I have introduced the Ending Health Disparities During  COVID-19 Act, H.R. 8200, which provides a sweeping approach to  addressing the widening health disparities from COVID-19. It tackles  the immediate-term needs of testing, tracing, and public awareness from  COVID-19.   But just as crucially, the bill makes long-term investments to build  a stronger system to reduce and eliminate health inequities in the  future via investments in the social determinants of health,  technology, research, workforce diversity, and community health centers  and workers.   Lastly, H.R. 8200 makes our government accountable for progress on  health equity by creating a Federal task force with oversight over  health disparities during COVID-19 and beyond and protects the Office  of Minority Health. That is a long list to do, but it is all  desperately needed.   I truly feel that this long-term approach, combined with strict  accountability for health disparities, is exactly what this moment  calls for. For the first time, many Americans are waking up to the  reality faced by communities of color, a reality that the Tri-Caucus  and our fellow Members of Congress, such as champions like  Representative Barbara Lee, are working to address.   We need to harness this rightful outrage and catalyze it into action.  We need to make this the last pandemic to have a disproportionate  impact on any  [[Page H5754]]  American community, because the fact is Americans deserve a public  health system that works for all Americans. We deserve to live in one  America, not an unequal America with worse health outcomes for Black  and Brown people.   We all deserve healthcare because healthcare is a human right, yet it  is not easily won. It must be fought for. As Frederick Douglass taught  us: ``Power concedes nothing without a demand. It never did and it  never will.'' The only path forward is for us to demand it.                                time  2045    We demand action to end health disparities once and for all. We must  do this by passing the COVID Community Care Act, H.R. 8192; and Ending  Health Disparities during the COVID-19 Act, H.R. 8200.
