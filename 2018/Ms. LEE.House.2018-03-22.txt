 Mr. Speaker, first of all, let me thank our ranking member  for yielding, but also for her tireless work day and night to really  help shape this bill to be, in many ways, a bipartisan bill.   Also, I thank all of our ranking members. The input that they  received from all of us and our staff and the phenomenal work that they  have done has just been amazing in spite of the circumstances. So I  just have to thank them and Leader Pelosi for all of their very  diligent work.    Almost 6 months after the deadline, though, for the fiscal year 2018  appropriations bill, this 2,232-page omnibus was released late last  night. Now, less than 24 hours later, we are about to vote on a bill  that really no one has had the time to read. I don't know who in this  body has read this bill. We would have had to read 100 pages per hour  to get through this bill.   Does anybody here read that fast, 100 pages per hour?   What kind of informed decisions are we making with this last-minute  rush for a vote?   This is no way, Mr. Speaker, to run a government.   However, yes, this omnibus has some really good provisions in it. It  eliminates hundreds of poison pill riders ranging from efforts to  defund Planned Parenthood to dismantling of critical labor and consumer  protections. I am very grateful for that.   Many good provisions include a new competitive grant which we have  been working on for years for computer science funding for young girls  and people of color. We include increases in job training, education,  and family relief, as well as for Historically Black Colleges and  Universities. My State has the highest number of students coming to  HBCUs; so I am very grateful for those increases.   Even with these increases, Mr. Speaker, the omnibus bill still falls  so far short of what we need to just return to the funding levels  before the sequester 8 years ago. Adjusted for inflation, we are still  way below the 2010 levels for domestic spending. What is worse, while  underfunding our needs here at home, this bill includes an increase in  $80 billion in defense. This includes the overseas contingency fund  which really is a slush fund for the Pentagon to fund these wars off- budget.   We know that the Pentagon doesn't need this excessive increase in  funding to ensure our national security.                                time  1145     A Washington Post report in 2016 exposed a report detailing  $125 billion in waste, fraud, and abuse. Yet we are increasing this by  $80 billion; not to mention that much of this funding is dedicated to  continuing the endless wars that we are waging around the world; wars  that, I might add, Congress has still not debated, voted on, or  authorized.   Put simply, the defense spending will be the single largest increase  for the Pentagon since the beginning of the Bush so-called war on  terror.   What is worse, this bill also fails to protect our young Dreamers who  are still stuck in limbo. DACA recipients are American in every way,  except on paper.   When are we going to vote to protect our young people, Mr. Speaker?   It is time to put politics aside and pass a clean Dream Act  immediately.
