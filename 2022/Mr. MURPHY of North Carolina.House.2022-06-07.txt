 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman  for allowing me to speak today.   I rise in opposition to H.R. 6087. I do this as a physician where I  understand that diagnosing, treating, and certifying disability claims  takes an expert's opinion--not general medicine, an expert's opinion-- and physicians have exceedingly more training and experience in dealing  with what are truly complex medical issues.   Let's be very clear: Disability is a complex issue. It is a lifelong  problem. This particular instance requires diagnosis, treatment, and  evaluations continually. There is nothing wrong with the system that we  have in this country. In many instances, we find that we work together  well as a team. But I think our Federal workers really, in this  specific avenue, deserve better, and I urge them to understand that  physicians are the best ones to do this.   Using the claim that there is a physician shortage should not be an  excuse to lower what I believe are standards for expert care.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this bill.
