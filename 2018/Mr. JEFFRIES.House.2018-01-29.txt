 Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentleman from  Georgia for yielding and for his tremendous leadership on this issue.   Here in America, if you work hard and play by the rules, you should  be able to provide a comfortable living for yourself and for your  family; but for  [[Page H667]]  far too many American workers, that basic contract has been broken.   Since the early 1970s, the productivity of the American worker has  increased in excess of 285 percent; but during that same period of  time, wages have increased by less than 10 percent. So the productivity  gains of the American worker have not gone to the American worker;  instead, they have gone to the privileged few, to millionaires and  billionaires and to big corporations to subsidize the lifestyles of the  rich and shameless. That is the America that we are dealing with right  now.   Some may explain it as a result of globalization; some may say it is  fully negotiated trade deals; some may say it is the outsourcing of  good-paying American jobs; some may say it is the rise of automation.  Certainly, all of those factors are implicated, but the decline in  unionization has been a significant, if not decisive, reason that so  many people have been struggling to achieve the American Dream.   And now the Supremes, in their wisdom, want to give us another raw  deal, rightwing hit to benefit the wealthy and the well-off to the  detriment of hardworking Americans. So let's hope that Justice Kennedy  does the right thing, that five Justices on the Supreme Court see  themselves to not interfere and overturn settled law for the purpose of  continuing a march to benefit the privileged few to the detriment of  hardworking Americans.
