 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I wanted to come down here because a  single Senator in this Chamber, a colleague from Alabama, has put a  blanket hold on every pending nominee and promotion of flag officers at  the Department of Defense.   As far as we can tell--and this might be the intention of the Senator  from Alabama; I don't know whether he knows this or not--there is no  precedent for what the Senator from Alabama is doing. There is no  precedent for what he has done. It has never been done, stopping the  U.S. Senate from taking up promotions for uniformed military officers.  These are promotions that happen to people as a group. These are flag  officers at the Department of Defense that we have to ratify here in  the Senate.   And we asked the Senate Armed Services--I couldn't believe it when I  heard it. I couldn't believe it. But we asked the Senate Armed Services  Committee if this had ever happened in the history of America, the  history of the Senate; and the answer was, they have no record of that  ever happening before.   And it is happening at an incredibly unusual and difficult time in  the world's history with the biggest land war in Europe since the  Second World War, China's saber-rattling in the Pacific. We just had an  hours-long open session of the Intelligence Committee to hear the  report from the head of the FBI, the head of the CIA, the head of the  NSA, the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency. All of these folks  were coming together to say: This is what the threat looks like. This  is the global threat that America faces--a geopolitical landscape more  unsettled than at any point in my lifetime, Madam President.   My understanding is that the Senator from Alabama has placed this  unprecedented blanket hold because he objects to the Department of  Defense's new policies to help our servicemembers access reproductive  care. And I will have more to say about that in a minute; but I don't  think I should wait any longer to advance these personnel. We should  get this done today.   Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to  executive session to consider the following nomination en bloc:  Calendar Nos. 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52; that the nominations be  confirmed en bloc; that the motion to reconsider be considered made and  laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate; that no  further motions be in order to any of the nominations; that the  President be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and the  Senate then resume legislative session.    Madam President, I appreciate the words of the Senator  from Alabama and his conviction. I will say he said I am mistaken on  the facts.   I think one thing you didn't hear was any dispute at all that this is  the first time in American history that a U.S. Senator has held up the  promotion of flag officers--the first time. It is the first time in  American history that any of the more than 2,000 people that have  served in this body--but less than 3,000 people--have seen fit to hold  up the promotions of people at DOD. That is not a fact that is in  dispute, Madam President, as we sit here today on the floor.   You know, I have spent a lot of time when I come down to this floor-- and I am on the floor listening to people's speeches, or I am thinking  about my own--thinking about the history of America. And broadly  speaking--it has not always been true at every moment or at every  juncture--but broadly speaking, the American story has been a story of  expanding freedoms and expanding opportunity for the American people.  It is the story of one generation after another putting their shoulder  to the wheel to make our country more democratic, more fair, and more  free.   It can be easy, when you are on this floor, to think about those  victories as ancient history, as old as the marble in this Chamber. But  it was only 100 years ago, our grandmothers' generation--our  grandmothers' generation--when women in America didn't have the right  to vote. That is just 100 years ago. It took 100 years for the people  that were fighting for women to have the self-evident right to vote to  vote, and they didn't get it until 100 years after they fought. And it  was only 100 years ago that they got it.   It was only when I was born in the middle of the 1960s that we  attempted, finally--finally--after the Civil War in the United States,  after Reconstruction and then the redemption that came after that,  after the Jim Crow  [[Page S695]]  laws and the redlining that had happened in the United States of  America--it was only after that that we finally tried to secure the  rights of African-American citizens to vote, a promise that had been  made after the Civil War was over and never fulfilled. I would argue it  hasn't been fulfilled to this day.   By the way, when I was born in 1964--I was at the African American  Museum the day before I got sworn into this body, this time with my  family, and I said to one of my nephews--we were walking through the  slavery exhibit--I said, I was born in 1964, which, to him, admittedly,  that seemed like ancient history. But the year I was born was just 100  years since the people in this country still enslaved human beings.  Just two short lifetimes divided when I was born from when we still  enslaved human beings.   It was even more recent in our country's history--just 50 years ago,  Madam President--before we secured the constitutional right to an  abortion in Roe v. Wade, putting an end to the days when women in this  Nation--when our mothers and our grandmothers--were forced into back- alley abortions in the United States of America, forced to carry  pregnancies to term, and forced to live without any freedom to chart  their own course about their lives or their families' lives. That was  just 50 years ago when the Court in Roe v. Wade said there is a  constitutional right at stake here; there is a constitutional right  that we are going to protect here.   And in all of these cases, in my judgment, our fellow citizens have  sought to broaden the horizon of freedom and equality in America. And  our progress has never been in a straight line. The pages here should  know that. We have always been in a battle. We have always been in a  battle in this country between the highest ideals that have ever been  expressed on the page by human hand, the words in the Constitution of  the United States and the worst impulses in human history--the worst  impulses in human history--in our case: human slavery and the genocide  that was perpetrated on the Native American population that was here at  a time when those incredible words were etched into the Constitution  that are etched all over the walls of this beautiful building--a  building, by the way, that itself, I say to the pages that are here,  was built by enslaved human beings. And we are in that fight today.   Today, we face a decades-long campaign that stretches back, at least,  to when Ronald Reagan was elected President. It is a battle that has  been mostly invisible until recently to the American people, even  though it has transformed American life. While that campaign had many  objectives over its 40 or 50 years or so--those four decades--one of  those objectives was to confirm a majority of Justices on the Supreme  Court who subscribed to a radical constitutional interpretation called  originalism, a legal document that was invented in the 1970s.   My colleague from Louisiana is here today. He is a distinguished  lawyer. He might disagree with some things that I would say, but I was  there at the origin of originalism. I was a lawyer trained a decade or  so after this was something that was perpetrated by the Federalist  Society and Anthony Scalia and the law-of-economics guys and Mark  Feldstein and all these folks, as part of what they were trying to do  with the Reagan revolution. And a huge part of that was originalism. It  is the most amazing name. It is the most amazing name, I think, in  political history. I don't think there has been greater branding in the  history of mankind than ``originalism'' because it makes you think  immediately: That is what the Founding Fathers must have set. It is  their original intent, as if that could be divined across the decades,  across the centuries, or across the ages, as if they even agreed with  each other.   You don't have to go to a musical like ``Hamilton'' to see the  disagreements that these people had with one another. That is the  beauty of the founding of our Republic, which is to see the  disagreements that they had with each other and the way they sorted  through them and the compromises they made as a result of this  disagreement--some of them, American tragedies that we live with to  this day.   But they called it original. I just want the pages to know this and  the law students that are out there today that might want to dispute  this to just look up the history. There is a beginning of this. There  is a beginning of this, and it does not start with John Marshall. It  does not start with George Washington or Thomas Jefferson, who  himself--Jefferson would be absolutely shocked to believe that there  are people in the 21st century who think that we should be dictated to  by the hand of the 18th century or the 17th century. There should be a  revolution even less than in every generation.   If you had told me--I mean, we all knew about originalism when I was  in law school. We certainly did. I did. We had professors who  subscribed to it. Certainly, there are political people who subscribe  to it. But if you had told me when I was in law school that I would  live to see the day when a majority of the U.S. Supreme Court would  subscribe to the originalist position of the Federalist Society, I  would have said: That is not believable. That is preposterous.   I am not saying there wouldn't be people who wouldn't have  fundamental constitutional disagreements with me on all kinds of  things, but the idea that you would have a Court that would say  originalism is where it is at? But that is what has happened, and it  has been a 40-year campaign to do it.   I actually had a moment on the floor of this Senate once when I  congratulated the leader of the Republican Party for having achieved  his dream, having achieved his vision. I wasn't congratulating him  because I agreed with him or that I felt positive about what he had  done, but he had set out to carry that water, and he did it decade  after decade after decade.   I said earlier that this wasn't really noticed by the American  people, this battle. In many ways, it wasn't until 8 months ago. Eight  months ago, we saw that majority take its most radical decision yet  when it overturned Roe v. Wade, stripping the American people of a  fundamental constitutional right to make their own reproductive  choices--a right that Justices appointed by Republican and Democratic  Presidents had upheld for half a century, for 50 years.   I have a colleague in this Chamber whom I love named Jon Tester, who  is from Montana. He is a farmer. He is one of the last farmers in this  place. He said to me--this was even before this happened--he said to  me: My daughter is having to fight for things her mother never had to  fight for because her grandmother won these freedoms. Her grandmother  won these rights, and she won these freedoms and these rights when Roe  v. Wade was decided half a century ago.   I read on the way home to Colorado--well, I guess in honesty, I read  the decision--I am sure my friend from Louisiana read it earlier, too,  when it got leaked by the Supreme Court somehow--something that should  have never happened--something that should have never happened. That is  when I first read Justice Alito's opinion. I had a chance, again, to  read it on the plane back to Colorado, and I was hoping that it would  be different because the opinion that I had first read as a draft  opinion just dripped--dripped--with a cavalier dismissal of the right  that it had destroyed. And when I reread it on the airplane, that is  what I saw again.   Justice Alito's opinion doesn't even have the courage to grapple with  the fundamental nature of the right it was stripping the American  people of. It didn't contend with the simplest questions like what it  would mean for millions of Americans, including for millions of  American women like my three daughters.   Justices Breyer, Kagan, and Sotomayor expressed this in their  dissent. They wrote:         [The majority opinion lacked] any serious discussion of how       its ruling will affect women. . . . It reveals how little it       knows or cares about women's lives or about the suffering its       decision will cause.    That is a quote of the dissent in that opinion.   Instead of grappling with the consequences of his ruling--which would  have been, I am sure, painful even for Justice Alito to deal with, just  as it is for women all over this country and their families to deal  with the aftermath of this decision every single day since it has been  rendered--Justice  [[Page S696]]  Alito essentially wrote that if it wasn't a right in 1868, it is not a  right today.   I mean, you have to give him credit. That is originalism, although he  is not going back to the Constitution; he is going back to the 14th  Amendment. If it wasn't a right in 1868, it is not a right today.    We ratified the 14th Amendment in 1868. That is the depth of the  analysis in that opinion, which, if you were guided only by originalist  ideology, I suppose that would be what you would say. The dissenting  Justice pointed out that Justice Alito completely ignored that the men  who ratified the 14th Amendment in 1868--and all of them, obviously,  were men--did not perceive women as equals, did not recognize women's  rights.   Quoting them now in the dissent:         When the majority says we must read our foundational       charter as viewed at the time of ratification . . . it       consigns women to second-class citizenship.    Of course it does. Women had no right to vote. Black Americans had no  right to vote. The dissent continued:         Because laws in 1868 deprived women of any control over       their bodies, the majority approves States doing so today.       Because those laws prevented women from charting the course       of their own lives, the majority says States can do the same       again.    And that is exactly what we have seen with one State after another  treating Dobbs as a green light to obliterate access to reproductive  care for millions of American women and families. Many of us have  spoken about how the ruling has harmed the privacy, the health, the  freedom of our fellow Americans, and all of those are important.   Let me say also, this is a difficult issue in my State. I want the  Senator from Alabama to know that and everybody to know that. It is a  difficult issue for all of the families across America. It is difficult  for anybody who has been through this. And I am certainly not cavalier  about how difficult this decision is and the fact that different people  have different points of view, different people have different  religious perspectives, different people come from different parts of  the country.   I thought about these things a lot over the years, and my conclusion  is that it is best to leave this decision in the hands of a woman and  her--well, whomever she chooses to consult--her doctor, her family.  That is my opinion. I respect the opinion of other people who disagree  about that. I realize that this is a heartfelt decision.   But there is a reason why people have been out on this floor and  other places talking about the effect on freedom, the effect on the  right to privacy, the effect on the health of our fellow citizens  because it has an unbelievable effect on all of those dimensions.   But I don't think we have focused nearly enough on how the ruling  will harm our national security, and that is what brings us here today.  That is what brings us here today at this unprecedented moment, when a  Member of this body, for the first time in American history, has said:  No, I am not going to let a single person go through. I am not going to  let any of these flag officers go through because I am upset with the  policy that the DOD has pursued, that the DOD is pursuing a massive  subsidy on abortion here, the abortion travel agency that the DOD has  become. And because I don't like that--I am not accepting those  characterizations of what the DOD is becoming--but because I don't like  that, I am going to hold hostage the promotion of the flag officers at  the Department of Defense.   Over a million men and women serve in our Armed Forces, supported by  over 700,000 civilians in the Department of Defense. These are  obviously moms and dads, sons and daughters who volunteer to risk their  lives to protect ours. But when our men and women in uniform volunteer  to serve, when they heed the call and they say, ``Sign me up,'' they  don't get to decide where they serve. When our men and women in uniform  volunteer to serve, they don't get to decide where they are going to  serve; the Pentagon decides that. You can't sign up and say: Well, I  would like to be in Colorado, or, well, I would like to be in Alabama,  or I would like to be in a State where my reproductive healthcare is  going to be covered or a State where it is not.   Before Dobbs was decided, our troops had at least some assurance that  wherever the Pentagon sent them, they would have minimal access to  reproductive care as a protected constitutional right. They knew that  for 50 years--for 50 years, for 50 years--no matter where they served.  That is no longer true. The Supreme Court stripped that right away,  again, without even bothering to consider what it would mean for our  troops based in States with no access to reproductive care. Justice  Alito doesn't deal with that in his decision.   After Dobbs, one of the first calls I received was from a woman who  once served as a senior officer in the Air Force. She immediately  grasped how Dobbs is going to affect our military readiness. And that  is what this is about--our military readiness. She understood, as, I  would say, thousands of women in this country understood, how  disruptive it is to force women in uniform to travel from their duty  station to access care, to say nothing of the cost to her privacy when  every single person in her unit finds out about it, knows about it,  unlike any other medical procedure that we give people leave for, that  people can get paid travel for. The privacy issues here are seismic,  and the military readiness issues as a result are seismic, too.   Women are the fastest growing part of our military. They are about a  fifth of our total force and over one-third of our civilian workforce.  It is not hard to see why they might think twice before enlisting if  they know they are going to be stationed somewhere that doesn't respect  their reproductive freedom.   (Senator MURPHY assumed the Chair.)   The Senator from Alabama talked about how the DOD is having the worst  recruiting they have had for generations. She is right. That is true.  It is hard to see how this is going to help.   You don't have to take my word for it. A recent study from RAND  concluded that Dobbs could increase attrition, decrease readiness, and  hurt national security. And that is after the Pentagon had its worst  recruiting season, as the Senator from Alabama suggested, since the  Vietnam war.   In an attempt to deal with these issues 2 weeks ago, the Pentagon  announced three new policies, and here is what they were.   By the way, I apologize to my colleagues who are here because I know  you are here to give this other speech. I delayed for 24 hours or more,  so I am going to just continue, and I will beg your forgiveness.   But these are the three things that have brought the Senate to a  halt. These are the three things that have created an unprecedented  objection to flag officers of the Department of Defense being approved  in the common way that they have been approved in this body for 230  years.   The first of these policies authorizes travel allowances for  servicemembers to access reproductive care if it is unavailable at  their duty stations. That is important because they may not be able to  afford to travel, which is why we pay for other procedures, like LASIK  eye surgery or to remove a bunion, none of which seem to have gotten  the objection of anybody in this body.   The second allows servicemembers to take absences without leave to  access reproductive care. This recognizes, I think, the difficult  choice a woman has to make in incredibly, profoundly challenging  circumstances. LASIK surgeries aren't banned in Alabama or Connecticut.   The last policy extends the time before servicemembers have to tell  their commanding officers about a pregnancy. It gives them just a  little bit more time to deal with the shock that can come when somebody  has an unexpected pregnancy and is trying to make a decision about what  to do. This says that rather than get you in a position where you might  find yourself feeling like you can't tell your superior officer the  truth, this says take a little bit more time so you can think of it.   That is what these three provisions do, these guidelines do, these  rules do, about giving the women in uniform the time and the privacy to  decide if they want to carry a pregnancy to term or not--a decision  that anybody on this floor, no matter what they think about this,  surely can understand has become more complicated in the wake of Dobbs.   So I applaud the Secretary of Defense, Secretary Austin, for taking  [[Page S697]]  these steps to protect our soldiers, our sailors, and our marines. He  is in a difficult position. It is hard to do because, you know, I don't  think many people were expecting that this would actually happen, and  yet it has.   Instead of welcoming this leadership from the Secretary of Defense,  some of my Republican colleagues have attacked these proposals. They  call them--I am now not quoting the Senator from Alabama; I am quoting  others who have written about this. They have called them  ``disgusting.'' They have called them ``heavy-handed.'' They have  called them ``disastrous.''   I could be wrong--I have certainly been wrong before--but I don't  think the American people would consider it disgusting or disastrous  that women in uniform don't have to dig into their own paycheck and use  their limited leave to seek care that is unavailable because of where  our government required them to deploy. I think fundamental fairness  would say that is a reasonable reaction to the disruption that has been  caused by the Supreme Court.   Now I am quoting the senior Senator from Alabama when I say:         The Secretary of Defense is following through with his       radical plan to facilitate thousands of abortions a year with       taxpayer dollars, so I will follow through with my plan to       hold all DOD civilian, flag, and general officer nominations       that come before the U.S. Senate.    OK. Let's just hold up here for one second. Thousands. The Senator  was down here the other day saying this is not a readiness problem  because it is only 20 abortions that DOD paid for last year. Well, I  don't know the facts of every one of those abortions. I do know the  facts of the DOD policy with respect to abortion on paying for it, and  that is in cases where there has been rape, incest, or the life of the  mother is at stake. And maybe that is what those 20 were.   But the Senator from Alabama himself said that what we are talking  about here in the context of the rule are what he calls thousands and  thousands of abortions that he is saying are subsidized by DOD because  the DOD is willing to pay for the travel of women to go from a State  that has banned abortion to a State that hasn't. I don't see how--how  could that not be a matter of readiness when you are talking about  thousands of people?   The Senator from Alabama said:         The American people want a military focused on national       defense, not facilitating a progressive political agenda.    I could not agree more--could not agree more--with the Senator from  Alabama. The American people want a military focused on national  defense, and for that reason, that is why I find it so hard to imagine  that the American people would tolerate any Senator holding up critical  national security personnel to impose their ideology.   The Senator from Alabama correctly says that abortion is illegal in  his State. I read the polling data that shows that 55 percent of  Alabamians actually support a woman's right to choose. But that is  neither here nor there. In terms of the law in Alabama, the Senator  from Alabama is right about that--abortion is banned there. In Alabama,  abortion is banned at any stage of a pregnancy. It has no exceptions  for rape or for incest.   Under Alabama law, doctors can face up to 99 years in jail if they  perform an abortion. Last month, an Alabama State legislator announced  a bill to treat abortion as murder. The State's attorney general  suggested using a chemical endangerment law--a law designed to protect  kids from methamphetamine--to prosecute a woman for taking a pill to  terminate her pregnancy. That is the law. That is the debate that is  going on in Alabama.   I recognize that Alabama has made certain decisions about this issue  that are different from the ones that Colorado has made. We were the  first State in America to decriminalize abortion in 1967. That was the  State of Colorado, a Western State, 5 years before Roe v. Wade was ever  decided.   In Colorado, we believe these decisions belong between a woman and  her family and her doctor, and we don't accept that the government  should impose itself on that private decision. And of course, that is  not just what I believe; it is not just what Colorado believes; that is  what the large majority of the American people believe. That is what  the American people believe.   I acknowledge that Alabama has made a different choice, but what I  can't accept is that its Senator would impose that choice on every  woman and family in our armed services who happened to be stationed in  his State or any State that doesn't protect access to reproductive  care, because it is not just Alabama. It is not just Alabama. Eighteen  States have banned abortion. Nine of them--nine of them--have no  exceptions for rape or incest.   Many States have only begun their war on a woman's right to choose.  Just yesterday in Florida, which is home to 22 military bases--22  bases, where men and women in the United States who signed up to fight  or to join our military have no choice about where they serve. Governor  DeSantis committed just yesterday to sign a 6-week abortion ban. He may  be unaware--I haven't talked to him about it. I don't know. He might be  unaware that one in three women doesn't even know that she is pregnant  until around 6 weeks--or maybe he does know that. I don't know which  would be worse.   Texas is posting $10,000 bounties to any resident who successfully  sues a doctor or nurse for performing an abortion after 6 weeks or even  someone who just drives their friend or relative or neighbor to have a  procedure--a procedure that for the last 50 years--until this radical,  originalist majority came into the Court--for the last 50 years, for  almost my entire lifetime, has been a constitutionally protected right  in this country.   All of us who are in this Chamber can remember how, in the aftermath  of Dobbs, State legislators all around the country wrote laws  restricting the freedom of female citizens to travel from States like  Texas or Alabama that had banned abortions to States like Colorado that  had ratified a woman's right to choose.   Now we have Senators here who aren't content to merely deprive  servicewomen of reproductive care if they are based in a State where  abortion has been banned; they want to make it even harder to travel to  another State to avail themselves of that care.   From the vantage point of my daughters, the nearly 6 million people  who live in Colorado, and the vast majority of Americans who support a  woman's right to choose, I think there is a real question here about  whose position is radical.   When the military pays for servicemen to travel from one State to  another if they need LASIK eye surgery or a sinus procedure or to  remove a bunion on their foot, is it really radical to imagine that  servicewomen should have the right to travel--to have the price of that  travel defrayed so they can get reproductive care?   That is just the debate we are having. That says nothing about why we  are actually here today, which is the vehicle that the Senator from  Alabama is using to delay the vote of every pending nominee and  promotion at the Department of Defense at a moment when we have the  biggest land war in Europe since the Second World War and China saber- rattling in the Pacific.   If you told most Americans that a single Senator in this place was  delaying every nomination and promotion at the DOD, all for the  privilege of making it harder for servicewomen to travel for  reproductive care or take leave for that care or shorten the time a  woman has to make a choice about her reproductive health before she has  to tell her commanding officer--and those are the facts of what these  rules do. If you told Americans that is what was happening on the floor  of the Senate, I don't think they would believe it. I don't think they  would accept it. And maybe that is the reason why it has never  happened. Coloradans wouldn't accept it.   Like the Senator from Alabama, we in Colorado are honored to host a  strong military presence in our State, from the U.S. Air Force Academy  to Fort Carson, to Schriever, to Peterson, and to Buckley and Space  Command, and we are honored to protect the reproductive care for the  men and women who protect us.   In the case of Space Command, we have a live example, I am sad to  say, of how the Supreme Court's decision could harm our national  security. I will not go through the whole story today. I will spare the  Senators from Alabama and Louisiana and everybody else who is here this  painful and, as I describe it, saddest story I know.  [[Page S698]]    Here is the essential point: In the waning days of the last  administration--I think Donald Trump, President Trump, had 9 days  left--our top generals recommended Colorado as the top choice for Space  Command's permanent headquarters, but President Trump overruled them  and said it should go to Alabama. He later went on the radio and said:  They all were against me. They all said it ought to go to Colorado, but  I overruled them, and I said it should go to Alabama.   Now, look, I do not think that is how we should be making basing  decisions in this Nation. Every single person who has looked at this  Space Command issue knows what the generals recommended, and they know  they were overruled by the President of the United States for his own  political purposes. We need to make these decisions according to the  national security interests of the United States, not in the political  interests of a President.   That is why, over and over, I called on the Biden administration to  restore integrity to this process and honor the generals' original  recommendation. They should have made that decision 2 years ago after  President Trump made this decision, in the last few days of his  administration, overruling these generals, the experts who know where  Space Command should be.   But my specific issue with Space Command has led me to a much broader  concern as I have studied this issue. In the wake of Dobbs, we  literally have no policy to account for the harm of moving a base from  a State that protects access to reproductive care, like Colorado, to a  State that does not, like Alabama. We are now living in a world where  the Pentagon makes basing decisions according to criteria like the  number of parking spaces or the quality of schools or the availability  of childcare. All of those are relevant decisions, important decisions,  questions to ask. But one question they are not asking is about basic  reproductive healthcare in a country where it has been legal, where it  has been a fundamental constitutional right for the last 50 years, that  the majority of the American people and the majority of the people in  Alabama supports.   They are not asking whether a State prosecutes women who seek an  abortion or imprisons doctors for 99 years for performing abortions or  turns residents into bounty hunters against women. It is ridiculous  that they would be counting parking spaces and not reflecting on what  this world looks like for the people in our armed services, especially  women and their families, post Dobbs. I can't agree that the Pentagon  should care about how much it costs to house a family when it makes  basing decisions but not whether the family has the freedom to plan its  future.   The Supreme Court, because of its ideology, may not have had the  courage to grapple with the consequences of its ruling on our men and  women in uniform and on our national security, but that doesn't give us  the ability or give the Department of Defense reason to shirk its  responsibility. We have to stand on the side of expanding rights and  expanding opportunity for Americans, not restricting them.   So, today, I am calling on the Pentagon to codify the policies it  announced last month and develop a new framework that accounts for  access to reproductive care in its basing and its personnel decisions.   I call upon my colleague from Alabama to lift his holds so the Senate  can advance these national security personnel, because if our men and  women in uniform can spend every day defending our freedom, surely, we  can defend theirs.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, first of all, I would say, with respect to  my colleague from Alabama, I appreciate his arguments here.   He first says that he clearly doesn't have the ability to do this;  that, somehow, this is up to Congress to pass a law to make sure that  servicemembers who need to travel for reproductive healthcare have it  paid for them, not the abortion, by the way, which is what the Senator  from Alabama said--that is inaccurate--but the travel is his argument.   The reality is that the DOD, it is clear, can pay for servicemembers'  travel for LASIK eye surgery, but current law doesn't say that. It can  pay to have a bunion removed, but current law doesn't say that either.  All of that has happened without complaint from this body because it  makes sense that the DOD has the discretion to provide the care it  believes its servicemembers require. And they are making those  regulations as part of the law that they have been granted from our  branch of government to make sure they care for our servicemembers. I  think that is point 1.   Point 2, the Senator from Alabama talked about, you know, this being  about who is paying for abortion. This is not about who is paying for  abortion. This is about those three changes to the law I mentioned  earlier. I won't go into them because I know my colleagues are going to  lose their minds over my staying here. But those are the three things.  One is travel. One is, you know, being able to take a little bit of a  longer time to talk to your supervisor, and those kinds of things. So  it is not about paying for abortions.   Although, I will say that the Senator from Alabama has another piece  of legislation that he has introduced that objects not to the DOD but  to the VA. He says this is radical. The VA has said: We have noticed  that our policies that allow us to pay for abortion when the life of  the mother is at stake don't also include exceptions for rape and  incest, and we are going to add those exceptions for rape and incest.  The Senator from Alabama has brought that to the floor and said he  wants to have a vote.   I want to have a vote on that too. I can't wait to see how every  single Senator in this Chamber stands on the Senator from Alabama's  position that  [[Page S699]]  having the VA add cases of rape and incest to the exception to allow it  to pay for abortion is not somehow abortion-on-demand or abortion--as  some people say, abortion after people have already had the child but  is simply adding two things that probably 80 percent of the American  people agree with.   On the last point, on Space Command's being decided on the facts, let  me tell you something. Here are the facts as I understand them: The  generals said they thought Space Command should stay in Colorado. The  generals and the Secretary of the Air Force went to the White House  with the recommendation of Colorado. The President of the United  States, Donald Trump, overturned that recommendation on their advice.  He went on the radio--the Rick & Bubba Show, I think it is called--in  Alabama, where he said: Everybody was for Colorado, and everybody was  against me on Alabama, but I made the decision to send it to Alabama.   Those are the facts on Space Command. And it is not off-topic. You  know, it is not off-topic. That was a political decision that should  never have been made. If the politics had not entered into that  decision, the generals would have gotten their way, and Space Command  would be in Colorado, and we wouldn't be having the conversation we are  having today because no one in Colorado would be having their abortion  rights stripped from them and being sent to another State that has  banned abortion, where doctors can go to jail for 99 years because they  perform an abortion, where laws that are meant to bring down folks who  traffic in methamphetamine are being threatened to be used against  women who use a chemical version of abortion.   This is not a complaint I have with the Senator from Alabama. This is  my complaint with the White House. You should have dealt with this 2  years ago. And now I hope this administration will deal with, in the  wake of Dobbs, this daily gray area that is tearing at the emotions and  the well-being of members of our Armed Forces, who don't get to decide  where they are stationed.   Alabama can have whatever law it wants. That is not up for me to  decide. I respect that there are differences in this country, but  people in this body have a duty and a responsibility to the men and  women of the armed services, and we have a duty and responsibility to  fulfill our duty and responsibility, which is not to hold up the  promotion of flag officers at the Department of Defense because I have  a position that is different from what others may think. That is what I  think.   I yield to the Senator from Louisiana.
