 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding, but more  importantly, for his service to our Nation, and when he talks about  that bill, you think, in Congress, when can you find something that is  bipartisan?   Here you have something come out of the Senate that Republicans and  Democrats both agree upon. Republicans on this side of the aisle will  vote for that. The only thing holding it up for these veterans are the  Democrats. They know the bill they are going to produce won't go  anywhere, and hopefully, we can come back and get this done, and it  will go to the President's desk. It would have been nice for the  President to have a bill before he came for the State of the Union, so  he could actually sign something, but unfortunately, politics again  gets in the way.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the rule and to support Mrs.  McMorris Rodgers' and Mr. Westerman's legislation.   The crisis in Ukraine is a crisis of American energy security.   Over the past decade, we have had every opportunity to lead. During  the previous administration, we were energy independent and an exporter  of energy for the first time in 50 years.   Today, however, we have an administration that crippled domestic  production. This administration has increased its daily reliance on  Russian oil by 34 percent.   As every American is glued to their television to see what is  happening in Ukraine, to see the bombing of innocent children and  women, there is no one American who would want any of our money to go  to fund that. But in this administration, you had actually done that,  increased the production of oil and natural gas coming from Russia to  America. Meanwhile, it slow-walked oil and natural gas exports to our  allies in Europe. In doing so, it made Europe more reliant on Putin.   Today, 40 percent of natural gas and 25 percent of crude oil in  Europe comes from Russian. The Biden administration has made the free  world dependent on despots for oil and natural gas from Russia.   We all know that is shameful.   As an economic and energy superpower why are we relying on dictators  when we should be supplying the world?   If you are like me and you are concerned about the environment, do  you realize that American natural gas is 42 percent cleaner than  Russian natural gas? That crude oil could have come from Canada and  been refined in America if President Biden hadn't pulled the plug on  the Keystone Pipeline. But instead, he allowed Putin to have Nord  Stream 2.   For those at home that are wondering, what is the Nord Stream 2  pipeline? It is another pipeline built by Russia to go in to supply  natural gas to Europe, but it goes around Ukraine because the current  pipeline goes through Ukraine, and Ukraine gets part of the money.   But with this new administration and President Biden going to meet  with Mr. Putin, what did he do? He waived the sanctions. But when  President Biden watched Putin put hundreds of thousands of men along  the border of Ukraine there was an amendment offered in the Senate to  put sanctions on Nord Stream 2. People wondered; did it pass? It came  close, but it failed.   Do you want to know why it failed? Because the Biden administration  used all their political will to lobby against it passing. And more of  American millions of dollars went to fund Putin who uses it for his  military.    That natural gas that goes to Europe, it could have come from  America, from our Federal lands and waters where President Biden hasn't  approved a single new lease--not one; he has actually shut them down-- and if we had continued the energy policies of the Trump  administration, we would actually be safer today and Putin would have  less money to fund his military weaponry. Our allies would be safer  today, and American families would be paying less for cleaner energy.  In California it is more than $5 a gallon, as you know, Mr. Speaker. I  don't know if you can remember back when when it was much less.   Now, I hear from our colleagues on the other side that the reason  American resources must stay in the ground is climate change. I  listened to Mr. Kerry be interviewed as Russia invaded Ukraine, and he  was concerned. This former Secretary of State, now helping in this  administration, I thought he would be concerned about the men and women  in Ukraine. He was concerned with; would Putin still work with climate  change? I think you should tell that to the Ukrainian people. I don't  think one of them is concerned about that right now.   Now, I hear our colleagues when they talk about climate change, but  if they really studied it, the truth is what I told you before,  American natural gas is 42 percent cleaner than Russian natural gas.  And we can guarantee you this, we are not invading Ukraine. We won't  use the resources to carpet-bomb, to shoot innocent women and children.   If you are concerned about the environment, like I am, you should  support this bill. You could, Mr. Speaker. It immediately approves the  Keystone Pipeline because we have waited long enough and can't afford  to wait a minute longer. It removes all restriction on liquid natural  gas exports so we could become an arsenal of energy for the free world.  And it restarts the leases on Federal lands and waters which are being  held up by the Biden administration.                                time  1330    Mr. Speaker, it is interesting. You have the majority here on the  floor. You have the Biden administration. It is in the power of your  party. But those six permits that sit at the desk of the Secretary of  Energy that could take money away from Putin, provide American jobs,  and provide Europe with cleaner natural gas from America still sit  there to this day because somehow you think it is better for climate  change.   Mr. Speaker, a vote for this bill is a vote to produce more energy  for our allies. It means American jobs. It means our allies don't have  to deal with Putin, be held hostage to him. It means Putin will not  have millions of dollars from Americans to buy the weaponry that he  uses to kill innocent people in Ukraine.   A vote for this bill is a vote to provide relief for working families  at the pump. It means Americans won't have to pay the high prices they  are today.   I know at the White House, when they were asked this question, they  said it is okay that the price is high because that way somehow it  helps them with climate change if they could get more renewable energy.   Mr. Speaker, that is a tax on all Americans, especially low-income.  But I don't know, in this administration, they have the highest  inflation we have had in 40 years. Somehow, they must think that is  positive, too.   Mr. Speaker, in this new administration, when you have crime, we have  a border that is not secure. People are coming across the border that  are on the terrorist watch list. We now have more fentanyl in America  today than at any time, enough to kill every single American seven  times over.   Mr. Speaker, I know you would care about this because you know,  today, the number one cause of death of those between the ages of 18 to  45 is fentanyl. You know where it comes from, the chemicals of China,  across the border of Mexico that no longer is attended to.   Mr. Speaker, I know the President of your party has put the Vice  President in charge, and she has been there one time--one time. Every  city in America has become a border city today every single weekend.  [[Page H1197]]    Mr. Speaker, you know this based upon your background. You see the  deaths that are happening. It is unwanted. It is unneeded. And we could  do better.   Mr. Speaker, a vote for this bill is a vote to deprive Putin of a  major revenue stream.   It is not difficult. There won't be any pressure. All Members have to  do is walk onto the floor, take the card out of their pocket, put it in  the little box. And if you are somebody that because you are afraid of  COVID, you are still home, or you are on a boat, you could still vote  by proxy with this majority.   What you could do is you could vote for this bill. You could vote to  make America energy independent. You could lower the gas prices. You  could take the money out of Putin's hands that he uses to kill innocent  people.   Everybody in the world is watching. Mr. Speaker, the sad part, I bet  if this bill was on the floor in any country in Europe, it would be 100  percent voted for. I will be watching. I think America will be  watching.   Would we stand for America and for freedom? Would we stand for  President Zelensky, who didn't take the advice of President Biden and  leave his country, who doesn't ask for men and women from America to  come to fight? He just asks to provide some weapons so they can defend  against Putin.   Mr. Speaker, the sad part about that is every day that we allow crude  or natural gas to come from Russia, American money is going to Putin.  Let's stop that and stop that today.
