 Mr. Speaker, one of my colleagues came to the floor this  morning and said: It kind of smells like bacon in here. I said: That is  because the Republicans are cooking their budget just off the floor.  That is what they are doing. They are cooking up a budget with cooked  books.   Here we are with a national debt of nearly $20 trillion and the  highest priority on the Republican side of the aisle--reflected both in  their so-called healthcare bill, which was actually tax cuts only for  people who earned over $250,000 a year--is tax cuts for people who earn  over $250,000 a year, particularly targeted toward those in the top  one-tenth of 1 percent--those who earn millions of dollars a year.   They say that is the cure for all of America's ills: just cut their  taxes, and the benefits will trickle down onto all the rest of us. I  think a lot of people don't much like to be trickled on in that manner.   What are the priorities, other than tax cuts, in their budget? A  massive increase in spending at the Pentagon.   Remember, the Pentagon is the only agency of the Federal Government  that is unauditable. That is right. Every year, every agency of the  government is subject to an audit, but not the Pentagon. They say: Hey,  we can't be audited. The books are a mess. We can't be audited.   Last fall, there was a report that $125 billion went missing from the  Pentagon budget. The Pentagon attempted to repress that report. God  forbid we should bring any fiscal accountability to the Pentagon. They  are just going to shower more money on them, in the hope that some of  it gets spent on the real needs of the military. But there is no sense  of responsibility there.   How are they going to get to their illusory balanced budget if they  are having massive tax cuts for the wealthiest among us and massive  increases in spending at the Pentagon, with no fiscal accountability?   Well, simple. We are just going to cut the programs that average and  struggling Americans depend upon, like student financial aid. They  don't know anybody at the country club whose kids need help going to  college. So those programs get cut. Hungry kids? They have never met  one. Never met a hungry kid. So let's cut the school lunch program  again, and let's cut food stamps for families.   But they are breaking some new ground here and breaking some of the  President's promises. The President promised he would not cut Medicare.  Well, their proposed budget cuts Medicare. Yes, it cuts Medicare. It  would cut $500 billion out of Medicare. It assumes that, instead of  getting a guaranteed benefit, an earned benefit that  [[Page H5983]]  every American over 65 can have, you will get vouchers, and you can go  into the private insurance market and do better. It sounds a little bit  like the failing ObamaCare plan that they talk about all the time. Now  they want to put seniors in that same boat, instead of guaranteed  Medicare.   Then, of course, $1.5 trillion cuts in Medicaid. That is welfare.  Well, actually, the largest recipients of Medicaid are seniors in long- term care. A lot of people are going to be surprised when grandma or  granddad is out in the street or comes home and needs a lot of help and  assistance and there is none to be had.                                time  1015    So that is the largest group.   Now, what is the second largest group of freeloaders on Medicaid?   Oh, it is kids. God forbid that kids should get medical help when  they are growing up. Let's have them long-term, lifetime disabled. Deny  them medical care when they are young and we will just worry about all  that later. This is quite a set of priorities they are putting before  us and fiscally irresponsible.   So as I have in past years, I am introducing a fiscally responsible  balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, not like the Republican  one that said you have to have two-thirds to increase taxes and one  vote to cut taxes, no. This one would say you have to balance the  budget, but you do it by prudent reductions in spending, and also you  have to deal with the revenue side. And, oh, by the way, mine protects  Medicare and Social Security totally from these sorts of cuts. It makes  them into the entitlement programs they are supposed to be that the  Republicans want to do away with in their budget.   So I think there is a better way to go forward, but just like in  their fake healthcare bill, which was really disguised tax cuts for the  wealthiest among us, they are now giving us a supposedly prudent fiscal  budget blueprint, which, again, is huge tax cuts for the wealthy,  massive increases for the Pentagon and cuts for everybody else.                            ____________________
