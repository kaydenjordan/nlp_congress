 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I rise in support of Jen Easterly's  nomination to serve as Director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure  Security Agency, commonly referred to as CISA.   Before the Senate adjourned for the July 4 holiday, I stood right  here and urged my colleagues to confirm her for this vital position. I  was disappointed that a Republican colleague blocked Ms. Easterly's  swift confirmation at that time, but I appreciate that he has now  resolved his concerns and that we can move forward today.   I warned that, without confirming Ms. Easterly, we risked leaving  ourselves vulnerable to cyber attacks, and in the 2 weeks since I last  called on my colleagues to approve this critical nomination, nation- state actors and criminal organizations have continued their relentless  targeting of the United States.   Over the July 4 weekend, we learned that U.S. software company Kaseya  was the target of a major ransomware attack that has impacted hundreds  and possibly thousands of businesses and organizations worldwide. Days  later, we saw reports that a Republican National Committee contractor  had been attacked in an attempt to target the RNC.   Unfortunately, these are only the latest of several recent cyber  attacks that threaten our government, critical infrastructure, and key  industries. These attackers will stop at nothing to infiltrate our  networks, and we urgently need qualified, Senate-confirmed cyber  security leaders in place to fight back.   With more than three decades of cyber security expertise and service  in the public and private sectors, Ms. Easterly is more than qualified  to lead CISA. We need her in place immediately so she can get to work  with agencies, businesses, and others to recover from recent cyber  attacks and to strengthen cyber security defenses before the next  attack.   I appreciate that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have  withdrawn their objections and that the  [[Page S4813]]  Senate is prepared to confirm this highly qualified nominee on a  bipartisan basis. I certainly look forward to working with her and with  my friends on both sides of the aisle here in Congress to shore up  cyber security vulnerabilities and keep American families, businesses,  and the Federal Government secure.                            ____________________     Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of the following nomination, Calendar No.  176.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  vote on the nomination without intervening action or debate and that,  if confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon  the table, all without intervening action or debate; that no further  motions be in order to the nomination; that any statements related to  the nomination be printed in the Record; and that the President be  immediately notified of the Senate's action.    Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
