 Mr. President, I know my friend from Illinois, Senator  Durbin, is sincere in his desire to get some relief for the DACA  recipients, whose case is now pending before the U.S. Supreme Court. I  share a desire to give them some certainty. That is why I supported  what President Trump offered in February of 2018, which was a pathway  to citizenship not only for the individuals who had applied for and  received deferred action under President Obama's administration but for  all those who were eligible but did not apply.   What continues to confuse me is how our Democratic colleagues will  routinely vote against that offer, which was incredibly generous. I  don't think any other President in my lifetime would have had the  boldness and the courage to offer a pathway to citizenship for 1.8  million DACA-eligible young people, but President Trump did, and our  Democratic colleagues turned it down. That leads me to wonder about  their sincerity. Do they like this political issue more than they have  a desire to find a solution to the problem?   I agree that these young people, who through no fault of their own  came to the United States because their parents brought them here, are  the most sympathetic and deserving cohort of immigrants in the country.  I wish we could work together to come up with a solution. But at some  point you have to wonder whether our Democratic colleagues prefer not  to solve the problem but would rather try to portray this as a  political football for partisan advantage in the runup to the next  election.   That is tragic--toying with the lives of these young people, stoking  their insecurity, telling them you are on their side but on the other  hand voting against an offer to provide them a pathway toward  citizenship. I don't know how you reconcile those two positions.
