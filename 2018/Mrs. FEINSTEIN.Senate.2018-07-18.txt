 Madam President, reserving the right to object, I  rise today to express concern with S. 118, the Reinforcing American- Made Products Act, because it would preempt California's strong ``Made  in America'' labeling standards.   California requires that at least 90 percent of a final product be  composed of American-made parts to use the label--the strongest  standard in the Nation.   This bill would undo California's tough standard, setting instead a  watered-down national standard. Companies could then confuse consumers  by flooding the market with products sold under the ``Made in America''  label that were built using more foreign-made components. That is why  the California attorney general and the Consumer Federation of  California support keeping California's strong standards in place.    The ``Made in America'' label should promote U.S. manufacturing and  give consumers confidence that they are supporting American jobs.  Consumers want to know that products bearing the ``Made in America''  label are truly made in America. Because this would undermine that  confidence and preempt California's strong standards, I believe this  bill should not move by unanimous consent. Regretfully, for those  reasons, I object.
