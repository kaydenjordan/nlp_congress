 Mr. Speaker, later today, we are going to be voting on H.R.  1, and I would like to make a few points for the Record.   To my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, before you vote this  afternoon, I would like you to remember one thing. This bill is nearly  600 pages, and it has been referred to 10 different committees, yet it  has been subject to only one markup.   I want the supporters of this bill to think about how that really  looks. You are bringing up the bill that is intended to expand the  ability of Americans to participate in the political process by using a  process that restricted the participation of their elected officials.   The second thing I want to point out is the section of this bill that  creates a voucher program to allow people to use public funds for  campaign donations. Mr. Speaker, instead of using taxpayer dollars for  critical needs like border security or fixing our roads, we would be  sending these dollars to political campaigns. That would be a complete  disaster.   One last thing that I am going to point out about this bill is the  fact that it would weaponize the FEC to favor the ruling political  party.   Under current law, the Federal Election Commission is made up of six  members, consisting of three Republicans and three Democrats. Four  votes are needed to move forward with any kind of prosecution. The bill  says that the new commission must consist of two Republicans, two  Democrats, and one independent. By this logic, Bernie Sanders is  technically an independent and would count, even though we all know he  is a socialist and caucuses, though, with the Democrats.   I would say much more about this bill, Mr. Speaker, and in the coming  weeks I plan to. But for now, I want my colleagues on both sides of the  aisle to know that we have a real chance to put politics aside and pass  some serious reform that would make our system work even better, but  the more time we focus on partisan games like this, the less time we  actually focus on draining the swamp.                            ____________________
