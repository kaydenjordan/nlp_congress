 Mr. Speaker, I rise and say: God bless you  both. Thank you for what you said.   I rise in strong support of H. Res. 129. This resolution I introduced  calls for an intensified effort to account for the tens of thousands of  American servicemembers who are still missing in action. Many folks  don't realize there are still more than 82,000 American servicemembers  who remain unaccounted for.                                time  1615    In fact, I, myself, was classified as missing in action for almost 2  years after my shoot-down over north Vietnam in 1966. That is why it is  so meaningful to have this resolution on the House floor during the  45th anniversary of Operation Homecoming, which brought me and my  fellow Vietnam POWs back to our beloved country after many long years  in hell on Earth.   During my time as an MIA, my family was unsure where I was or whether  I was even alive or dead. But my devoted wife, Shirley, and countless  other families with the National League of POW/MIA Families  continuously advocated for the return of all our POWs and MIAs from the  Vietnam war. It is because of their tireless work, and by the grace of  God, that my fellow POWs and I were reunited with our families 45 years  ago this week.   I am joined today by my two daughters, Gini and Beverly, who, along  with my late wife, were a key part of the effort to bring us home.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask my colleagues to join me in  recognizing the strength and devotion of my two lovely daughters, Gini  and Beverly, who are seated in the gallery.   But, Mr. Speaker, we must never forget our troops who still remain  missing in action; and we must never forget their families, who  anxiously await a final accounting of their loved ones. In many cases,  so much time has gone by that it has fallen to the next generation to  repatriate their missing family members. They deserve our dedicated  help and support.   After my return from Vietnam, I vowed to continue to fight for our  missing troops and their families. During my time serving in the U.S.- Russia Joint Commission on POW/MIAs, I traveled the world to places  like Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, and even to the Russian military archives  in Moscow to try to find our missing troops. And I will never stop  fighting.   For the families of our troops who remain missing in action, this  resolution is for you.   This resolution calls on the United States Government and the  Department of Defense to diligently continue  [[Page H1089]]  efforts to investigate, recover, and identify all missing U.S.  personnel around the world. It also calls on foreign governments that  have information on our missing personnel to cooperate fully with our  government.   We must remain united in our efforts to recover all of our missing  troops and to never forget their sacrifice.   I would also urge my colleagues to remember that, while I was in the  Hanoi Hilton, the north Vietnamese told my fellow POWs and me that our  country had forgotten us. As the days turned into years, we had to  fight that fear. The feeling of being alone and forgotten is horrible.  And the families of POWs and MIAs feel a similar pain. That is why I  will continue to make every effort to repatriate my missing brothers  and sisters in arms and hold true to the promise: ``No Man Left  Behind.''   But I also call on all current and future Members of Congress to  carry the mantle.   We cannot, and must not, forget the faithful servicemen and -women  who deserve to be brought home to the country they gave their all to  protect. It is my sincere hope that we will one day bring home all of  America's missing patriots. These heroes deserve to return to American  soil with all of our honor and respect. And their families deserve the  closure of their loved ones that they have awaited for for so long.   Mr. Speaker, I ask for the support of all of my colleagues and that  they join me in supporting this important resolution.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
