 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of an amicus brief  filed by our majority whip,  Steve Scalise, in defense of the  Bladensburg World War I Memorial in Prince George's County.   The 93-year-old memorial honoring fallen soldiers has recently come  under attack simply for being shaped like a cross. The Fourth Circuit  Court of Appeals ruled the memorial unconstitutional because of the  inherent meaning of the cross as a religious symbol.   What kind of world do we live in where a monument to honor fallen  soldiers of World War I--93 years old--is being threatened because of  its shape or religious meaning?   What is more, this is a clear violation of the Establishment Clause,  which has been litigated. It could only be described as hostility  towards religion, not neutrality.   What is next, Arlington National Cemetery? the U.S. Capitol? or  countless other national monuments, historic sites, or traditions?   The Supreme Court has a chance to reverse this decision. I urge them  to set precedent that will protect America's historic monuments in  perpetuity.                            ____________________
