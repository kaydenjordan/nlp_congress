 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to complete my  remarks prior to the vote.    Madam President, Senators come to this floor with  greatly diverse life experiences and political theories and  representing enormously different States. But we all share this in  common: a vast appreciation of our team members, our staff, who enable  us to do our work as U.S. Senators on behalf of our own States, but  also on behalf of the Nation.   These team members are not just staff. They are family. We share in  moments of joy--marriage, the birth of a child. We grieve with them in  those life moments that are so difficult. And when the team members  choose to move on, it is a bittersweet moment.   I come to the floor today to recognize and pay tribute to a beloved  member of my team, Amy Amrhein, who in just a few short days will be  leaving us to a well-deserved retirement. Even after knowing for months  that this day was coming, it is still hard for me not to be saddened by  her departure. She has been on my team from the very beginning of my  time as a Senator, serving as my field representative in Southern  Oregon and staffing our Medford office. That is now a dozen years.   She took on the task of learning complicated natural resource issues  and learning them with determination and insight, working to  internalize the issues and challenges of every community in the region,  from the smallest port to the biggest county.   She mastered the art of putting on a townhall, as I do one in every  county every year, and I think at last count that is about 80 townhalls  she has conducted over the years.   She has worked to bring the community together to discuss visions for  the future. One of those was the potential expansion of the Cascade- Siskiyou Monument. She organized a gathering that gave public  testimony, which helped share insights from all the stakeholders. Local  leaders and regional Tribes and all members of the public shared their  insights and perspectives.   It is no exaggeration to say that there are few people in the world  with a better grasp of the complicated water issues in the Klamath  Basin. We have a saying in the West that ``whiskey, that's for  drinking; water, that's for fighting'' because it is so essential to so  many aspects of our economy and our natural system.   For 12 years, Amy engaged in shuttle diplomacy over long-term  solutions to water shortages. She found ways to help farmers and  ranchers save their livelihoods through shattering droughts, truly  making herself an indispensable facilitator to stakeholders across the  board and an indispensable facilitator as I tried to work out  agreements. That really came in handy with the Klamath Basin  Restoration Agreement, developing that effort to have the stakeholders  share a common vision for the future. It really came in handy when we  worked to get funds to address the devastating droughts in 2010 and  2013--funds that would help the farmers who depended on irrigation but  had no water to be able to temporarily, for a season, retire their  water rights and therefore have some income for their ranch or their  farm or be able to have money to pump groundwater to compensate for the  lack of irrigation water during those drought years.   One of the issues has been the water quality in the Klamath Basin and  the competing environmental rules regarding the river and the lake, and  a piece of that is the survival of two endangered species. So she  helped to put all the details together to hold the Sucker Science  Summit, which brought together again the farmers, ranchers, Tribes,  scientists, local government officials, and Federal officials to devise  a plan for the long-term survival of the C'waam and Koptu suckerfish in  the Klamath Basin.   There is no doubt that Southern Oregon could not have asked for a  better advocate over these past 12 years. I have appreciated her  diligence, her humor, her positive attitude, and her candor about our  smart political tactics or policy tactics and our mistakes. I could  share some of those stories, but perhaps they are better shared through  the eyes of our fellow team members, so I will read some of their  comments.   The first goes as follows:         Amy is the definition of dedication. No one can out work       her. She is committed and she will keep asking questions and       pushing buttons until she makes progress on an issue. She is       fearless. She has been such a great leader and mentor for not       only the field team, but the entire state staff. I'm so       grateful for the opportunity to learn from her. Oregon is a       better place to live because of her service and she will be       dearly missed.    A second team member expressed this:         When I think of Amy I think about her fearlessness. A       distant field rep's job is really challenging--[the rep] is       the face and the voice of the Senator and you are all alone,       far from DC, even far from Portland. Despite all our       communications breakthroughs you are still all by yourself,       driving remote highways, walking into rooms full of       strangers, never knowing what is going to be thrown at you.       They want a Senator, and instead they get you. Amy was open       about her questions and concerns, but once she was out there       and on her own, we always had confidence she would do and say       the right thing.    A third team member said this:         No surprise that she is leaving behind big shoes. She makes       covering some of the largest counties and most difficult       issues in the state look easy. Her knowledge of the issues       run deep and her contacts in counties is impressive. When you       ask about a county, she'll give you the breakdown of all her       contacts: who would give me straight answers and who has the       juicy county political/social gossip. She has also been a       great mentor to those in the field. I am pretty sure she has       walked every one of us through our first town halls,       roundtables and site visits. She was someone you could rely       on to give you feedback and let you know if you were on the       right path.    The final comment from a team member:         I would just say that every time I have ever come into       contact with a community leader or elected official that has       worked with Amy, no matter the political party, they       absolutely love her. She has done so much for the Southern       Oregon communities. Just a beautiful human who has worked       incredibly hard over the last decade-plus to help rural       Oregonians. She is funny, kind, and blunt--always tells you       like it is. I cannot reiterate enough how imperative her       mentorship has been. She is a wealth of knowledge and       experience that can't be replaced.    I certainly could not have said it better, so I appreciate the team  members who contributed those thoughts.   On behalf of myself and the entire team, thank you, Amy Amrhein, for  all you have done for our team, for all you have done for the State,  and for all you have done for so many constituents, working on so many  complex and difficult issues. You are going to be deeply missed by the  entire team but by me most of all. It is the wish of the entire team  that you will have a joyous, healthy retirement.    Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.
