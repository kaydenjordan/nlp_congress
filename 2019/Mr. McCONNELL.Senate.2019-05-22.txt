 Madam President, on Monday, I introduced legislation  to raise the national minimum age for purchasing tobacco products from  18 to 21. I walked through the long history of our Nation's complicated  relationship with this major cash crop. I laid out the challenges  facing tobacco farmers in Kentucky and in other States and the new  opportunities some of them are actually turning to. I explained why, as  we see signs of a new public health crisis of nicotine addiction in the  younger generation, now is the time to take decisive new action.   Together with Senator Tim Kaine, who represents another State with a  very long history of tobacco production, I was proud to introduce the  bill that builds on the existing structure that is already in place and  simply raises the minimum age to 21. Rather than reinvent the wheel  here in Washington, it would set one national standard for enforcing  new age-21 restrictions. It is a bill designed with States in mind, and  it would allow States to take measures even more restrictive than  Federal law if they choose.   Senator Kaine and I have been grateful to see--already, even in just  the past few days--substantial support and recognition from public  health advocates that our approach is the right way to address this  pressing issue.   Already, our legislation has earned the support of leading voices  like the American Cancer Society, the American Academy of Pediatrics,  the American College of Cardiology, the American Heart Association, the  American Lung Association, the American Osteopathic Association, the  National Association of Secondary School Principals, the Foundation for  a Healthy Kentucky, the Kentucky Hospital and Medical Associations, and  many others. Here are just a few things these supporters of our bill  had to say:   One advocate called it a ``critical step forward that will profoundly  improve the health of our children and future generations.''   Another stated our legislation ``will be instrumental in stemming the  epidemic of vaping that is afflicting children as young as middle  school.''   Yet another said our bill could potentially ``save hundreds of  thousands of lives.''   This should be an area where we all lock arms to get results. I am  proud this body will have a chance to take action and stem the tide of  addiction among our Nation's youth. I am proud to be standing with  Senator Kaine. I hope each of our colleagues will recognize the  opportunity before us, avoid making this important issue any kind of  partisan football, and join in supporting the Tobacco-Free Youth Act.                            ____________________     Madam President, since President Trump took office in  2017, the Senate has confirmed 41 well-qualified individuals to serve  on our Nation's circuit courts. No. 41 was Daniel Collins of  California, whom we confirmed yesterday to the Ninth Circuit Court of  Appeals. As I have noted already, Mr. Collins came before the Senate  with every conceivable indicator of a brilliant legal mind and an  impeccable professional record. I was proud that the full Senate  followed up  [[Page S3018]]  the Judiciary Committee's favorable report with a majority vote here on  the floor.   But our work this week is just beginning. Yesterday, the Senate also  advanced four more nominees--these to serve on district courts across  the country. Today, we will vote to confirm all four.   The first, Howard Nielson, has been nominated for the District of  Utah. As I mentioned yesterday, Mr. Nielson has clerked for both the  Fourth Circuit and the Supreme Court and has assembled an impressive  record at the Department of Justice and in the private sector.   Next will come the nomination of Stephen Clark for the Eastern  District of Missouri. Mr. Clark is an accomplished litigator with  nearly three decades of experience in practice.   The third nominee is Carl Nichols, the President's choice to serve as  district judge for the District of Columbia. You will start to detect a  pattern because he, too, is a thoroughly impressive nominee--clerkships  for the DC Circuit and for the Supreme Court for Justice Thomas,  service at the Department of Justice, and recognized excellence in  private practice.   Finally, we will vote on Kenneth Bell, nominated to serve in the  Western District of North Carolina. Mr. Bell has under his belt nearly  two decades of service in the Office of the U.S. Attorney-- distinguished by national honors for his accomplishments as a  prosecutor--as well as extensive experience in the private sector.   So if I am sounding like a broken record, it is because the White  House continues to submit one extremely well-qualified and highly  impressive nominee after another to sit on the Federal bench. These are  men and women who are bright, talented, well-regarded, and committed to  applying what the text of our laws and our Constitution actually say.   Today, we can take four more steps in that positive direction. These  nominees deserve big bipartisan votes, so I hope each of my colleagues  will join me in voting to confirm each of them.                            ____________________     Madam President, now on one final matter, several of  our Senate colleagues and their counterparts in the House are  continuing to zero in on long-overdue legislation to deliver additional  help to Americans all across the Nation who are struggling to rebuild  from natural disasters. This ought to have been a fairly  straightforward process. We shouldn't need to explain why the need for  this relief is urgent, but just for good measure, let's remember the  Americans who are counting on us.   In California, last year's string of wildfires included the deadliest  and most destructive fire on record. It killed 85 people and burned  more than 150,000 acres.   In the Midwest earlier this year, storm surges flooded whole swaths  of States and racked up millions of dollars in damages. As one expert  recently put it, ``We have points in Iowa and Illinois that have been  in flood stage for over 30 days''--30 days--``which hasn't occurred  since we started keeping records--and some of them go back 150 years.''   Across the Southeast and gulf coasts, recent hurricane seasons have  left lasting scars. Hurricane Michael, which swept across Florida into  South Georgia last October, has itself produced nearly 150,000  insurance claims in Florida alone.   In Alabama, more tornadoes have already been recorded in 2019 than in  all of last year. One that touched down in Lee County on March 3 left  23 people dead.   Nearly 2 years after Hurricane Maria tore across Puerto Rico, too  many storefronts are still shuttered, too many homes still lack roofs,  and power remains too unreliable.   And the list goes on.   This is hardly the first time facts like these have been laid out  here on the floor. In fact, this legislation has already taken far too  long--far too long--to deliver. But now that we are in the home  stretch, it is past time to put partisan politics aside, move past any  tangential questions, and secure a final agreement that can become law;  that is, something that can both pass the Democratic House and earn the  President's signature soon. That is how to make a law in this  situation.   The Senate will vote on disaster relief this week. The Members of  this body will not return home for Memorial Day without taking further  action to help these struggling communities, which, by the way, include  a number of military installations that need assistance to recover and  to rebuild.   It is my sincere hope that we will be able to vote on a negotiated,  bipartisan, bicameral solution. That is how we can get to an outcome.  That is what affected Americans deserve.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
