 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, this is really pretty simple.   A constituent came to me with a problem concerning procurement for  aviation helmets. He has a manufacturing company here in the United  States, but he is not able to sell his helmets to the Department of the  Interior.   His helmets are not inferior. They are used by many industries. They  are used in many countries. But he is not on the approved list for  Federal agencies. Currently, the approved list includes only one  manufacturer.   My amendment will change this by providing additional options through  competition. The amendment requires compliance with the Federal  acquisition regulation policy that ensures a full and open process in  procuring aviation helmets.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this  great amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.
