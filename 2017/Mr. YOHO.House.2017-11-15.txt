 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of my bill, H.R. 3893, which renames the  post office in Interlachen, Florida, to honor a great American hero,  Robert H. Jenkins, Jr.   Robert H. Jenkins, Jr., enlisted in the Marines in February of 1968.  In July of that year, as a Private First Class, he was transferred to  the Republic of Vietnam.   Serving as a machine gunner with Company C, south of the  demilitarized zone, he was killed in action.   On March 5, 1969, his reconnaissance team was assaulted by a North  Vietnamese Army platoon. During the firefight, a hand grenade was  thrown at him and a comrade. Realizing the consequences of his actions,  Private First Class Jenkins, Jr., pushed his comrade to the ground and  leapt on the hand grenade to shield him from the explosion. Absorbing  the full impact of the blast, he was seriously injured and succumbed to  his wounds.   John 15:13 states:         Greater love has no one than this: to lay down one's life       for one's friend.    On April 20, 1970, the Medal of Honor was presented to his family at  the White House by Vice President Agnew.   Private First Class Jenkins, Jr., is buried at Sister Spring Baptist  Cemetery in Interlachen, Florida.   The sacrifice Private First Class Jenkins, Jr., made cannot be  understated. Naming his hometown post office after him is just one  small way we as a nation can continue to honor this American hero.   Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues in consideration of  H.R. 3893, a bill to designate the facility of the United States Post  Office located at 100 Mathe Avenue in Interlachen, Florida, as the  Robert H. Jenkins Post Office.   Robert Jenkins joined the United States Marine Corps in Jacksonville,  Florida, in February of 1968.   After completing training at Camp Lejeune, Robert was assigned to the  3rd Marine Division in Vietnam. There he served as a scout, driver,  machine gunner for Company C in an area south of the demilitarized  zone.   In the early morning of March 5, 1969, Private First Class Jenkins'  team was suddenly attacked by the North Vietnamese Army. While Private  First Class Jenkins and a fellow marine returned machine gun fire, a  hand grenade was thrown at their location.   In an act of pure selflessness, Private First Class Jenkins threw  himself on top of his fellow marine, shielding him from the explosion,  while absorbing the full force himself. Tragically, Private First Class  was gravely wounded and died soon after.   Private First Class Jenkins was posthumously awarded the Medal of  Honor for his valiant actions in April 1970.   Mr. Speaker, we should pass this bill to honor the valiant actions of  Private First Class Jenkins and to remember his courage and  selflessness devotion to his fellow marines.   Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of H.R. 3893. I have no further speakers,  and I yield back the balance of my time.
