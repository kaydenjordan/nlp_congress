 Madam Chair, I am a businessman. I am also the father of  three daughters.   I have managed people and managed compensation plans for more than 40  years, and I know that we cannot manage what we do not measure. I agree  with my friend, the Republican congresswoman from New York, that men  and women should be paid equally for equal work. This should be a  bedrock principle of our democracy.   But if we don't gather the data, how will we ever know if there is  paycheck fairness?   My middle daughter is a computer programmer--well paid. She was  dismayed to learn around Christmastime that her male counterparts doing  exactly the same work were making more money.   It is a fiction that this will be a burden on employers with more  than 100 employees. Absolutely none of these employers have not  digitized their paycheck process decades ago. The collection of this  data requires a keystroke; that is all. All the data, already there,  already gathered.   Pay transparency is the most powerful way to achieve paycheck  fairness.  [[Page H2858]]    Men and women together are outraged when they see actual measured pay  unfairness. But where incomes are most fair, where they are most  transparent--in the military and in government--paycheck inequity is  small or even nonexistent.   This is not a bill for lawyers. This is a bill for business owners  and business managers who want to do the right thing and now will have  the data to do that right thing.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, as a small business owner and employer, I understand  the value of data because you can't improve what you don't measure. So  my amendment, which I offer with Representative Ilhan Omar, exempts  employers with fewer than 100 employees from reporting compensation  data and only requires those with more than 100 to do so.   Employers already report workforce data by race, sex, and ethnicity  across 10 different job categories in their annual EEO-1 submission to  the EEOC. So collecting this data simply ensures equal pay for equal  work. If employers value the standard, this is an easy start.   I am very grateful to Chairman Scott and the leadership on the  amendments to strengthen pay data collection and to Congresswoman Rosa  DeLauro for her years and years of effort on this.   Persistent pay gaps exist in the U.S. workforce to correlate with  sex, race, and ethnicity. The Congress has found that 64.6 percent of  the wage gap can be explained by three factors: experience, industry,  and occupation, the things my good friend from North Carolina pointed  out. But the remaining 35 percent can't be explained by these  differences.   Federal law specifically prohibits men and women from being paid  differently for work, but enforcement of this mandate is impeded by a  lack of knowledge--no data, not reliable data, especially data by sex  and by race. This is a barrier to closing the persistent pay gap for  women and minorities.   All we are really asking here is to be able to provide the data so  that business leaders can make the good decisions and so that employees  can discover if they are being unfairly paid. They have a right, then,  to ask.   For over 50 years, companies have used the EEO-1 form to report.  Earlier today, we have heard that this will represent an unfair burden  on businesses.   While virtually every business I know--even those with two, three,  and four employees--find ways to outsource paycheck preparation, almost  all of this has been digitized. But to be extra cautious and make sure  that we are not providing any burden on small business, this amendment  would exempt those with 100 employees or less.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1600     Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the distinguished majority leader.    Mr. Chairman, I thank my friend from North Carolina for  supporting this amendment, and I thank my friend from North Carolina  for clearly stating a number of times today that Democrats and  Republicans are both committed to equal pay for men and for women.   I think our differences just come down to how we accomplish that,  because 50 years after the Equal Pay Act was signed, there are still  significant differences, despite our joint commitment to equal pay.   If unequal pay continues to persist, how do we address it? We simply  say that the collection of data to the EEO-1 is the best way to move  forward. The employers with less than 100 have been exempted from the  very beginning of the EEO-1 report, so this is simply consistent with  that and recognizes that, to get meaningful data, sometimes you need  more than a handful of people. That is, 6 or 10 or 12 people don't  necessarily give you an apples-to-apples comparison. When you get more  than 100, you can do it.   The government already collects the sensitive data. It has done it  for years without privacy concerns. My friend pointed out there may be  3,200 or 3,600 categories. Right now, with deep learning and machine  learning, this is something that takes a microsecond to do. This is  very easy. We are now in an intellectual and digital world where we can  have the EEO discover which companies have persistent patterns of pay  inequity, and it really works.   All our offices have pay transparency. When I am trying to figure out  how much to pay a legislative correspondent or legislative director or  front office, I know that everyone can go online and figure out what  everyone else is making. That is a powerful incentive for us to make  sure that people are paid fairly and paid equally. All we are trying to  do is bring the same transparency to American businesses across the  country.   Mr. Chair, I thank my friend for her support of this amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.  [[Page H2870]]     Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
