 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, what happened on March 16, 2021, in Atlanta is a  senseless tragedy. It is an unconscionable act of irrational violence.  We grieve with the victims' families, friends, and loved ones as they  now must cope with this tremendous loss.   Justice must prevail, and the perpetrator must be held to account for  these atrocious murders. That is why it is so very unfortunate that  this resolution that we are discussing and considering tonight on the  floor came on a rule when it wasn't even marked up in committee. I want  to talk about the process--both the committee process and due process.   Taking the former first, the committee process, I have only spent 4  months here in Washington serving this august Chamber, but I did serve  8 years in the Texas legislature. What I noticed was nearly all  legislation becomes better when it goes through the committee process.   So if this issue was so important, as my friends on the other side of  the aisle state--and it should be, it is very important--then Members  would have been allowed to offer amendments through the proper  committee process, which might have, and most likely would have,  greatly improved this resolution as it comes to the floor today and  helped garner broader support.   Our aim should be to send the strongest message possible to the  American people that all bigotry is to be condemned and not tolerated.   We are the most diverse nation on the face of the Earth, and our  diversity is our strength. We value the priceless contribution of our  American brothers and sisters of Asian descent, and that should be the  point, not to make this resolution unnecessarily partisan and  eventually become specious political talking points.   To the latter point, due process, this resolution threatens the rule  of law by assuming facts in an individual case that have yet to be  proven. There is no question that the shootings in Atlanta were  horrific, but their motivation has yet to be determined under law.   While all illegal violence will and should be roundly and justifiably  condemned, it is inappropriate for the House of Representatives to  opine on the facts of an individual case when those facts will be  decided by an impaneled jury, a jury that will hear all that evidence.  A jury should not be pressured into deciding the facts one way or the  other based on political spin and partisan pressure directed by this  Chamber.   Do my colleagues on the other side of the aisle understand how this  resolution could damage the ideal of legal due process by putting forth  an assertion of facts before our justice system has had the ability to  function?   The trial for this tragedy in Atlanta isn't over. In fact, it hasn't  even started yet. This resolution sets a dangerous precedent at this  time the way it is written. It is a possibly reckless path to embark  down for such an important legislative body as the United States House  of Representatives.   While this resolution threatens some political theater, it is  remarkable also for what it seems to be conveniently omitting from this  resolution addressing anti-Asian bias.   House Democrats have left out the many ongoing and high-profile  lawsuits filed by Asian Americans alleging anti-Asian discrimination in  schools' and universities' admissions policies.   So why would our friends across the aisle ignore these allegations in  this resolution?   At the same time, this resolution includes the strange statement that  references the Wuhan virus as anti-Asian. There are other elements that  are clearly anti-Asian that are in this resolution, and should be. But  the Wuhan virus is where this virus originated.   Historically, viruses are often named for their place of origin. A  case in point is the West Nile virus. It wasn't in Montana. It was in  the West Nile district of Uganda.   Zika was named after the Zika Forest in Uganda. Ebola was named after  the Ebola River in Zaire, in central Africa.   Here in America, we have the Rocky Mountain spotted fever named after  a big mountain chain in the West. A disease in my native New England,  Lyme disease, was found in Old Lyme, Connecticut.   So is that going to be geographically prejudiced?   Of course not.   There are no resolutions condemning the use of the words Ebola, Zika,  or West Nile. So not only have we not seen resolutions condemning these  names, they have also been embodied in the United States Code many  times in reference to the very diseases being combated. It is just  descriptive. It is not insulting by any stretch.   I could go on, but I think the point is made.   We should be more cautious in this legislative body with the  statements we pass as certainty and the procedural precedents we set  forth in the context of the judicial system. We should be focused on  allowing the due process to play out with justice served, and continue  to condemn vile and evil acts of violence against all Americans.   We should say this to our brothers and sisters of Asian descent: We  appreciate you, we respect you, we love you, and we grieve with you.   When you break down Americans demographically, Asian Americans are a  successful group in our country. Asian Americans, in their journey,  epitomize the promise of America.    I thought it was interesting, the U.S. Census Bureau in 2019, the  median household income for Asian Americans was $98,174 compared to,  for all Americans, $68,703. That is 43 percent higher.   The history of the Asian-American journey is one of prosperity, hope,  and promise fulfilled. Our Asian-American brothers and sisters should  be congratulated, admired, and emulated.   Our hearts go out to the families of the victims.  [[Page H2522]]    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Arrington).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   My colleague just mentioned that it must be nice to be born male and  White. I was born both, and I didn't choose it. That is the way it  happened. And then he went on to say: Must be nice that no one has ever  attacked you because you are male and White.   That is an interesting comment because I have a dear friend who was  beaten to within an inch of his life in a section of town that was  right outside of Duke University, and he was beaten primarily because  he didn't ``belong in that neighborhood.'' And do you know who is at  fault for that? The very people who beat him. No one else.  Unfortunately, hate occasionally fills all hearts, regardless of  someone's shape, size, or shade.   And that comment in and of itself was divisive. On this solemn  occasion, when we are discussing condemning hate, I just find that  unfortunate and disturbing, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I agree with my colleague that no one, no  American, should live in fear, Asian American, African American,  European American, Hispanic American, or otherwise. No one. Because if  you are not safe, then you are not free.   That is what we are here for, to guarantee equal protection under the  law. Safety and freedom are our most solemn tasks while serving in this  Chamber.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1900     Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, I will close with a statement of principle that no  House resolution can come close to matching in its compelling moral  clarity. It is the statement of one of the greatest Americans who ever  lived, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.   I will be honest, it gave me goose bumps as a child and it gives me  goose bumps every time I hear it or if I say it.   To quote this great man: ``I have a dream my four little children  will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the  color of their skin, but by the content of their character.''   Asian Americans certainly have demonstrated great character with  their numerous and countless contributions to this American experiment.   We all mourn the victims of this attack, including the family members  and community they leave behind.   I join my colleagues in seeking the fullest expression of justice  that our system is designed to deliver.   That gets back to culture, the culture of this Chamber. Sometimes you  hear from the mouth of babes. Well, I am a rookie and a freshman. I  have only been here 4 months. This is the most hyperpartisan  legislative body in this country, and it is awful. I am not saying that  my party may not have done something similar in the past. I don't know;  I wasn't here.   I served in the Texas Legislature, both the House and the Senate, and  I was very proud of the fact that almost 99 percent of the things we  passed in that body had at least some bipartisan support because we  worked together, for the betterment of our State, to make Texas better.   Why can't we do that here, for the betterment of our country?   Not everything has to be partisan. I know it is now, but it doesn't  have to be. We need to work together to change that culture.   I am a back-benching freshman. I don't have a lot of say. My voice  isn't really heard here yet. That is okay. But if there is ever a day  where it is, I pledge to do everything I can to work, when possible, on  a bipartisan basis because it is better for this country.   We don't always have to score cheap political points, looking down  the road for the next fundraiser or the next election. We can really do  what is best for the country. Not red America, not blue America.  America.   We had that opportunity here with this resolution. It could have been  written if we had the committee process. The minority party could have  contributed to it. We could have worked together on it. We could have  pretty much guaranteed a 435-to-nothing vote. Because, at the end of  the day, what I can recall in the Rules Committee was talking about  sending a strong message that hate will not be tolerated, bigotry will  not be tolerated.   Yes, this country has had an ugly past. It disgusts me. But when you  are raised the right way, you see it for what it is: evil,  unacceptable.   We are the greatest country history has ever known. By working  together, we can ensure that our children and their children enjoy the  fruits and the benefits and the labor and the bounty of this country. I  wish that were the case with this resolution, because it could have  been.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
