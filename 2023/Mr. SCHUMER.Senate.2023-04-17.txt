 Mr. President, first, let me begin by welcoming back our  friend, Leader McConnell, to the Senate. It is great to have him back  here in this Chamber. We are all happy to see he is recovering well.   I also want to welcome back our colleague from Pennsylvania and  friend, Senator Fetterman. We are all glad he got the support he  needed, and he is sending an important message to millions of Americans  that asking for and getting help works.
