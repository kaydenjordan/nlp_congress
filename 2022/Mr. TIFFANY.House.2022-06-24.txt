 Mr. Speaker, America does not have a gun problem.  America has a crime problem.   Mr. Speaker, law-abiding Americans do not want more laws chipping  away at the Second Amendment. They do not want to see their right to  bear arms eliminated on the installment plan. They want prosecutors to  prosecute. They want the police to police. They want dangerous  criminals off the streets and behind bars.
