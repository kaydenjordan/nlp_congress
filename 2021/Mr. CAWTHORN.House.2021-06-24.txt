 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the topic of this Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, what is the American businessman to do  [[Page H3120]]  when the American worker will not come into work?   For the past nearly 7 months, this President has held America's small  business owners hostage and declared a de facto strike on the American  economy.   Following the end of this COVID pandemic, the Biden administration  has been granted the political gift of a lifetime: take a staggering  American economy, still reeling from the economic collapse, and simply  let it return to normal. If the Biden administration had done nothing,  zero, if they had sat on their hands and twiddled their thumbs, if Joe  Biden had taken more naps, then experts say our economy would be in a  much better place than where it is right now.    Instead, the Biden administration's efforts place the American  economy in a financial choke hold that threatens to obliterate hundreds  of small businesses in my district.   It was John Adams that said: ``Facts are stubborn things; and  whatever may be our wishes, our inclinations or the dictates of our  passions, they cannot alter the state of facts and evidence.''   Let's cast our eyes over the facts, shall we?   Back in April, economists predicted over 1 million new jobs to be  added to our economy. Biden added just over 250,000. In May, economists  adjusted their expectations, acknowledging this administration simply  cannot deliver the type of job growth past administrations could.   Even with adjusted expectations, the Biden administration still fell  short of the mark. There is no debate that the Biden administration of  free handouts has dramatically undercut efforts to restart our economy.  His massive increase of unemployment benefits has kept workers at home  and left store owners scrambling to keep up with the growing consumer  demand.   In my own district, business leaders in Asheville, Hendersonville,  Franklin, and Macon County, have spoken with me about the difficulty in  getting employees back to work. Who can blame them? Biden is literally  paying American citizens to stay home instead of getting them back to  work.   Who would fault an American husband or mother when they decide to  stay home with their family and earn double their salary while doing  it?   The Biden administration knows that their policy of handouts harms  and is hurting business owners, but the game has always been about  creating a welfare class, not empowering our economy. It is disgusting.   With those thoughts in mind, I now recognize one of my fellow North  Carolina champions, the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Bishop).    Thank you very much, Congressman Bishop, for those  words. I echo the sentiments of both Jodey Arrington and  Dan Bishop of  wanting to jump-start this economy again.   With the fact that there are 9.3 million job openings in this country  right now, we do need to change something to be able to actually fill  the hire rate that has not increased at all. In fact, last quarter it  only increased by 4.2 percent.   My friends, we will have artificial inflation if we do not do  something to act quickly, and I believe the Jump-Start the Economy with  Jobs Act is a great idea.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize another North Carolinian, a  lion of our mountains, my dear friend, the gentleman from North  Carolina (Mr. Budd).    Congressman, thank you for introducing that bill.  [[Page H3121]]    If you think about it, $387 is the amount the average American  receives from their home State in weekly unemployment benefits. You add  to that the $300 boost that the Federal Government is putting on, on  top of that, and it is no wonder why people aren't going back to work.  They get to stay at home with their families while making $17.17 an  hour. That sounds like a good deal to me.   But I genuinely hope that we can find some way out of this, because  there is a real spiritual poverty created when you don't actually work  for your living.   It is now time for me to recognize a dear friend of mine from a  Carolina that is not as good a North Carolina, the gentleman from South  Carolina (Mr. Norman).    Mr. Speaker, Congressman Norman was elected to take  care of the American people, but right now the Democrats in Congress-- although it is hard to call them Democrats because right now I believe  that they have a socialist agenda, which is sabotaging America's jobs  recovery with a crippling tax hike that targets our small businesses,  the backbone of our economy.   Their plans raise small business taxes to the highest point in a  generation, halt new projects and small business growth by doubling  taxes on investments, and Democrats supercharge a second death tax, if  you can believe that, where they want to tax you more. It would hit  farms, machine shops, and other small businesses.   With all that in mind, I now yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania  (Mr. Keller).    Mr. Speaker, I can see why Pennsylvania loves their  Congressman so much.   When I think about what is going on in Congress and I see that  Democrats are prioritizing wasteful spending over hardworking  Americans' paychecks, I realize that the Democrats' socialist agenda  won't produce long-term growth or greater economic security for  American families.   A majority of Americans say they fear for an impending crash  following the injection of Federal stimulus money during the pandemic.  This is an unsettling thought for those who are trying to deal with  dining room politics.   With all those thoughts in mind, I am very pleased to yield to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Nehls), my dear friend and America's sheriff,  who represents Texas' 22nd District.    Mr. Speaker, I now yield to the gentleman from Kansas  (Mr. Estes), a dear friend of mine who represents the Fourth District.    Mr. Speaker, I think Congressman Estes touches on a  great point. Under Republican leadership, under the last  administration, business applications were at record levels. The TCJA  encouraged business creation, as the amount of business applications  reached its highest level ever, of over 880,000.   Now, you contrast that with what is going on in America today. There  are many people who own restaurants in my own district, who are having  to literally pay people $50 just to turn an application in, and then  they never show up for the interview or even for work.   Because of how bleak things are looking, I am very happy to yield to  the gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. McClain), the most loved and the  most feared woman in all of Congress.    Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Minnesota  (Mr. Stauber).    Mr. Speaker, I believe we are created to work, and I  believe we are created to work hard, and the right to work and the  determination to build with one's hands is as foundational to the  American ethos as it can be.   We were not set in this universal orchard to stand still as trees.  There is no substitute under the heavens for productive labor. It has  been said that a firm work ethic is the process by which dreams become  realities. It is the process by which idle visions become dynamic  achievements.   This administration seeks, though, to strip employment from the men  and  [[Page H3123]]  women of America, to replace work with welfare and service with  subservience. I reject that notion.   Mr. Speaker, I now yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Carter),  my dear friend.                                time  1730     Mr. Speaker, when we started looking at the American  Families Plan, we realized the tax hikes it would increase would raise  capital gains and dividends tax from 20 to 39.6 percent, almost two  times the normal price. It would impose capital gains taxes at death,  which creates a second death tax, although I can't believe that we  would ever need to tax anyone more than we do now. It would expand the  3.8 percent Obamacare surtax to hit even more small businesses' income  than it already does.   Lastly, it would increase the IRS' auditing power, including  monitoring bank accounts, because the very first thing that we need to  reopen our economy at a better pace is to give more power to three- letter agencies.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Good), my  good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Colorado  (Mr. Buck).    Mr. Speaker, when we start thinking about what is going  on here in our country with unemployment, in the week ending May 1,  2021, about 16 million people collected unemployment. Now, that is a  staggering statistic when you realize that over 6.6 million of those  people would not have been eligible to receive unemployment benefits in  a traditional environment. But because of the trumped-up and boosted-up  unemployment benefits the Federal Government is sending out, we are  basically incentivizing people by giving them $34,000 a year to not go  to work, thus creating more and more inflation. There is no production  so, therefore, there are too many dollars chasing too few goods.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Moore).    Mr. Speaker, I am disheartened to know that with this  Federal unemployment stimulus that we are sending out around the  country, although it might solve some short-term financial woes, it is  creating a spiritual poverty in the hearts of men and women across this  country that I believe cannot be described.   When you start to think about how devastating it would be to one's  morale and one's own honor and one's own self-esteem to think that you  don't actually create anything, you don't actually build anything, you  are not truly benefiting society, it makes me shudder to think about  how I would feel about that.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Mann).    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have  remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Colorado  (Mrs. Boebert).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her always  incredibly accurate and fierce comments.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gohmert),  another similarly fierce Congressman.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the Congressman for his remarks.   Mr. Speaker, as I continue to consider that the Democrats' plan must  be to destroy our economy by incentivizing laziness, by incentivizing  people not going to work, I shake my head and say, No, that can't be  true. That is just one mistake that they made.   But then when I start to look through all the points that I have  outlined--of the ridiculous tax increases on dividends, the tax  increases on capital gains, the tax increases on small businesses, the  tax increases which will increase the cost of living for the middle  class, I am sure that they are trying to destroy our economy.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Brady), the  most powerful and the most humble man in Congress.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Brady for his  leadership on the Ways and Means Committee.   Mr. Speaker, I think with everything that has been said from all of  these Representatives from all over the country, each of them  representing nearly 730,000 people, I believe it is overly and  abundantly clear that it is time to end the emergency spending. It is  time to end the trumped-up unemployment checks, which are incentivizing  laziness. It is time to end government-mandated joblessness in America.   There is a labor shortage in this country, and if we don't end it, we  will see inflation, the likes of which our country has never seen  before, and I don't know if we will be able to recover from that.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
