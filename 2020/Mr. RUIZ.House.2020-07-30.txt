 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor and in memory of  Chauncey Lee Veatch III.   Chauncey was a natural leader with an incredible passion for life,  education, and helping others. He was a tremendous educator, a  lieutenant colonel in the United States Army, National Teacher of the  Year, and a mentor to so many in the Coachella Valley.   It was a high privilege to call him my friend.   Chauncey personally inspired me, encouraged me, and guided me as well  as my friend and current assembly member, Eduardo Garcia, and Riverside  County Supervisor Manny Perez and many students and teachers from the  Coachella Valley.   Chauncey was exceptionally brilliant. His brother, Gregory, said,  even in middle school, his teachers knew he was smarter than they were.   He paired his unique intelligence and gifts with an extraordinary  work ethic. He studied history at the University of the Pacific in  Stockton, where he was inspired by the civil rights work of Cesar  Chavez, and helped register voters as a United Farm Workers volunteer.   After college, he went on to the University of Notre Dame, where he  obtained his juris doctor degree. Chauncey then served in the U.S. Army  Infantry and the Medical Service Corps for over 20 years, retiring in  1995 as a lieutenant colonel.   After retiring from the Army, Chauncey began his service as an  educator at John Kelley Elementary School in Thermal, California, later  becoming a teacher at my alma mater, Coachella Valley High School.  Coachella Valley Unified School District was fortunate to have such a  devoted and fine man.   As a teacher, he was renowned for his ability to present complex  material to his students in simple, understandable ways and to mentor  each of them on an individual basis, helping them to achieve their  fullest potential.   Later in life, Chauncey served on The Desert Sun newspaper's  editorial board for more than 7 years. In 2010, he co-led the Coachella  Valley Healthcare Initiative with me, bringing together the community  to address the healthcare access crisis in our disadvantaged and  underserved communities.   In each of his endeavors, he gave everything he had. In a word,  Chauncey's life was full: full of joy, full of generosity, and full of  love. He saw the best in people.   Not only that, he drew out the best in people. He saw in others what  they did not see in themselves, and he would not rest until he helped  them achieve what he knew they were capable of. In fact, a lot of  people are where they are today because their paths crossed with  Chauncey's.   He helped many of his students achieve their dreams of becoming a  teacher. Serving disadvantaged students, he also helped many become the  first in their generation to go to college, even helping them get into  good schools and elite schools like Notre Dame and Harvard.   His leadership was in his acts, his words, and his presence. He  showed people the way. His brother called him a builder of dreams. I  call him an architect of goodness whose deep commitment and mentorship  to his students turned barriers into opportunities, disadvantages into  strengths, and transformed our communities for generations to come.   Our world has lost a light, our community has lost a leader, and I  have lost a mentor and a close friend. Today I mourn with his family  and celebrate his full life, knowing that he was a good man, an  outstanding citizen, and a veteran whose impact will live on in our  communities. My wife, Monica, and I will miss him very much.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my amendment to  H.R. 7617, which will increase funding for the Law Enforcement Mental  Health and Wellness Act grant program by $2.5 million.   In order to comprehensively address policing in our Nation, we must  address the mental health needs of law enforcement officers. For  example, officers are more than three times as likely to die by suicide  than from shootings. Rates of depression among officers are more than  four times higher and rates of PTSD are five times higher than the  general population.   That is why I have worked to substantially increase funding each year  since these grants were created to help with law enforcement training,  peer mentoring, and mental health program activities. It is important  that our officers know they are not alone and that we provide the  resources they need to protect our communities as well as their own  mental well-being.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Rose for cosponsoring this  amendment.
