 Madam President, when the Senate passed the CARES Act  back in March, we were trying to prepare the Nation for economic  paralysis and the medical battle of the century at the very same time.  Hospitals, healthcare providers, small businesses, and working families  needed help fast, and the Senate stepped up in historic fashion.   For months, our legislation has helped cushion the pain of this  crisis from coast to coast, but our Nation is not finished with this  fight. More Americans are dying every day. Millions and millions are  unemployed. And the institutions of American life cannot stay totally  shut down until our race for a vaccine hits the finish line.   Our Nation needs to smartly and safely reopen while keeping up the  medical battle. We need to get kids safely back to school and adults  safely back to work without losing ground in the healthcare fight.   The coronavirus does not care that we are divided. The coronavirus  will not care if Washington Democrats decide it suits their partisan  goals to let relief run dry. The American people are hurting, and  Congress should have their backs.   On Monday, I laid down a marker to shape the bipartisan conversations  that need to happen now--not a loony, ideological fantasy like the  House Democrats bill from a few months ago, which would have cut taxes  for rich people, raised taxes on small business, and provided no  additional round for the Paycheck Protection Program. No, serious talks  actually require a serious starting point.   That is why we wrote a serious bill containing largely bipartisan  policies. It has another round of cash for households--more than $3,000  for an eligible family of four, with even more support for adult  dependents; another round of additional Federal unemployment benefits  assistance, which would otherwise simply expire; and another targeted  round of the Paycheck Protection Program to prevent even more layoffs  and keep paychecks coming to American workers. It has powerful new  incentives to jump-start rehiring, bring down unemployment, and create  safe workplaces for workers and customers. It has more support for  hospitals and health providers; more support for testing, PPE, and  diagnostics; and more resources for the sprint toward a vaccine. It has  historic support for schools to reopen--a higher dollar amount than  House Democrats managed to propose in their bill, which costs three  times as much as ours.  [[Page S4554]]    And--uniting all three pillars of kids, jobs, and healthcare--we have  legal protection for medical workers, schools, nonprofits, and  businesses so that well-connected trial lawyers can't get even richer  off of stopping the recovery in its tracks.   This is a more-than-fair, more-than-bipartisan framework for  Democrats to engage with. The only reason I can see that Speaker Pelosi  and the Democratic leader would sabotage negotiations is if, as some  concluded when they killed police reform in June, they actually think  bipartisan progress for the country would hurt their own political  chances. That is why I said a few days ago that we would quickly learn  whether the American people would be getting the responsible Democratic  Party from March or the cynical, obstructionist Democratic Party from  June that blocked police reform. So let's review the early going.   Almost the instant we put out this proposal--which would send  thousands of dollars in cash to families and even more cash to  unemployed people--the Democratic leader proclaimed that ``those  Republican, hard-right money people . . . don't want the Federal  Government to help anybody.''   A trillion dollar proposal for kids, jobs, and healthcare just proves  Republicans don't want to help anyone.   Yesterday, after meeting with the administration, the Speaker of the  House said this ``isn't a negotiation.'   So here we go again. It is the script from police reform all over  again.   We have had weeks of talk from Democrats about the urgency of the  issue, weeks of Democrats thundering that people will be hurt if we  don't act. But then, when it is time to actually make a law, Democrats  would rather keep political issues alive than find a bipartisan way to  resolve them.   Take the issue of additional Federal unemployment insurance. For  weeks now, it has been clear to a majority of Americans that we should  not pay people more to stay home than we pay people who continue  working.   Should we have generous unemployment insurance in this crisis? Of  course. Republicans want to continue the Federal supplement at eight  times the level that Democrats themselves put in place during the last  recession.   But, obviously, we should not be taxing the essential workers who  have kept working so the government can pay their neighbors a higher  salary to stay home.   Let me say that again. We should not be taxing the essential workers  who have kept working so the government can pay their neighbors a  higher salary to stay home.   Until about 5 minutes ago, this was not a controversial opinion.  Democrats shared it with us. The House Democrat majority leader said  yesterday: ``That's an argument that . . . has some validity to it. . .  . It's not $600 or bust.''   A few days earlier, our Democratic colleague Senator Coons said he  thought we would be ``finding some path forward'' with a different  dollar figure.   The day before yesterday, our colleague Senator Cardin said: ``What  is the right number? Well, we certainly understand we don't want  someone to have higher benefits than what someone can make working.''   At the State level, the Democratic Governor of Connecticut agrees.  This is what he said: ``I think sometimes it discourages work. . . . I  would put off this extra $600 true-up they're talking about. . . . I  don't think we need that.''   That is the Democratic Governor of Connecticut.   Like I said, it is not controversial. The Congressional Budget Office  says that five out of six recipients of this aid--83 percent--receive  more to stay home than they made on the job.   Let me say that one more time. The Congressional Budget Office says  that five out of six recipients of this aid--83 percent--receive more  to stay home than they made on the job. We all know that is not fair,  and it is not workable in a reopening job market. We have already heard  from small business owners who had trouble reopening because it would  be financially irrational for their employees to come back.   This is why Republicans propose to continue providing Federal aid-- continue providing hundreds of dollars per week--but do it in a more  targeted way while providing even more incentives for rehiring.   But now the Speaker of the House apparently signals she rejects this  bipartisan consensus and will not let a package go forward unless we  continue paying people more not to work. That is apparently the  Speaker's position--that she will not let a package go forward unless  we continue paying people more not to work. That is what Speaker Pelosi  apparently signaled yesterday: No money for schools, no money for  households, no second round of the PPP, no more money for hospitals or  testing, nothing at all unless we continue to pay people more not to  work.   If the Democrats don't get to continue taxing essential workers to  pay other people more to stay home, then nobody gets a dime.   To put it gently, that is a completely unhinged position. Sixty-two  percent of Americans say that paying people extra to remain unemployed  creates the wrong incentive. A Democratic Governor says he doesn't want  that continuing. Her own deputy, the House Democratic majority leader,  said yesterday that there should be room to negotiate.   But Speaker Pelosi is literally moving the goalposts so fast that  even Democrats can't keep up, and now she apparently feels that any  rescue package will have to be to the political left of her own  Democratic majority leader, to the political left of the Democratic  Governor of Connecticut or she will not even consider it. She will just  refuse to legislate until the election and wish the American families  good luck in dealing with the pandemic.   These are not the positions of people who are putting the common good  above politics. These are not the positions of people who actually want  to reach an agreement to save Federal unemployment insurance from  completely expiring.   The American people deserve better than this. The American people  cannot afford for Democrats in Congress to have decided in June that  they are finished legislating until November--not during a crisis like  this. The country needs help. The country needs action. If Democratic  leaders decide they will not negotiate, they will answer to the  American people.                            ____________________     Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, this summer, it was my privilege to  select several talented young Kentuckians for an internship in my  Washington Senate office. As a former Senate intern myself, I am proud  of the individuals who are eager to apply themselves to public service.   I would like to take a moment to commend James Adams of Jefferson  County, William Cohen of Jefferson County, Julian Colvin of Jefferson  County, Garland Ellis of Bell County, Mary Grace Furnish of Harrison  County, William Miller of Taylor County, Lauren Reuss of Spencer  County, Samuel Rickert of Oldham County, Elizabeth Rupp of Fayette  County, Madelin Shelton of Owen County, Victoria Sisk of Christian  County, Jordan White of Campbell County, and Erdin Zukic of Warren  County for their interest in serving the Commonwealth of Kentucky and  our great Nation. Each of these young people has developed an  impressive list of leadership experiences and extracurricular  activities. Their applications stood out, and I was proud to offer them  an internship.   Unfortunately, the coronavirus crisis forced the cancelation of this  summer's internship program. The virus may have taken away this  opportunity, but it can never change the great potential these  Kentuckians have in store. I would like to thank each of them for  pursuing public service and to extend my best wishes for a bright  future.                            ____________________     Mr. President, it was my privilege to select three  outstanding high school students from Kentucky for this summer's U.S.  Senate Page Program. These talented young people completed a highly  competitive application process, and they represent the next generation  of Kentucky's leaders.   I would like to take a moment to commend Jackson Hester, Charlotte  McCarthy, and Thomas Schrepferman for their interest in serving the  Commonwealth of Kentucky and our great Nation. Their applications  showed a broad range of leadership experiences and extracurricular  activities. These Kentuckians and their families should be proud of all  they've accomplished at this young age.   Unfortunately, the coronavirus crisis made it impossible for the  Senate Page Program to bring these students to Washington this summer.  The virus may have canceled this opportunity, but it can never change  the great potential these young people have in store. I would like to  thank Jackson, Charlotte, and Thomas for their commitment to public  service and extend my best wishes for a bright future.                            ____________________
