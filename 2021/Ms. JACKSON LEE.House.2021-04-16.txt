 Madam Speaker, as senior member of the Committees on  the Judiciary, on Homeland Security, and on the Budget, I rise in  strong support of H.R. 1195, the ``Workplace Violence Prevention for  Health Care and Social Service Workers Act,'' which would establish  within one year an Occupational Safety and Health Administration  (``OSHA'') interim workplace standard requiring health care and social  service providers to implement workplace violence prevention plans, and  which would establish a permanent OSHA standard within 42 months.   Currently, there is no OSHA standard that requires employers to  implement violence prevention plans that would help reduce workplace  violence injuries among health care and social service workers.   The lack of an enforceable standard means that OSHA, the federal  agency created to protect workers' safety, has few meaningful tools to  protect health care workers from the threat of workplace violence.   The Government Accountability Office has estimated, conservatively,  that it takes OSHA at least 7 years to issue a standard.   Seven years; Our healthcare workers have worked too hard and  sacrificed too much for them to wait a minimum of seven more years  before measures are in place to secure their basic physical safety.   H.R. 1195 would provide health and social service workers the  protection they deserve by:  [[Page H1864]]    Compelling OSHA to issue an interim final standard in one year and a  final standard within 42 months requiring employers within the health  care and social service sectors to develop and implement a workplace  violence prevention plan.   Identifying risks, specify solutions, and require training,  reporting, and incident investigations. It would also provide  protections from retaliation for reporting violent incidents.   Protecting health care and social service workers in the public  sector in the 24 states not covered by OSHA protections.   Our nation's caregivers--including nurses, social workers, and many  others who dedicate their lives to caring for those in need--suffer  workplace violence injuries at far higher rates than any other  profession.   While the previous administration relegated the OSHA standard  protecting healthcare and social workers to the back burner, making no  progress for 4 years, we will not do the same.   Study after study has confirmed that healthcare workers are not  adequately protected in the workplace.   In 2014, OSHA reported that there are nearly as many serious violent  injuries in healthcare as there are in all other industries combined.   In 2018, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reported that the  rate of violence against health care workers increased more than 60  percent between 2011 and 2018.   Just last year, the BLS reported that health care and social service  workers were nearly five times as likely to suffer a serious workplace  violence injury than workers in other sectors.   And this problem has been exacerbated by the influx of patients and  stressors during the COVID-19 pandemic--according to National Nurses  United, 20 percent of registered nurses across the U.S. reported  increased workplace violence due to the pandemic.   This is not a new problem; this is an old problem that has found  fertile ground to grow during the COVID-19 pandemic due to an influx of  patients and increasing demands on our healthcare workers.   In my home state of Texas, over 50 percent of nurses in Texas have  reported being subject to workplace violence during the course of their  career.   A 2016 study by the Texas State Health Services found that in any  given year:   6 percent of Texas nurses experience sexual harassment;   12 percent of Texas nurses experience physical violence;   Nearly half of all Texas nurses experience verbal abuse.   The injuries healthcare workers take from workplace violence are not  only physical; victims of workplace violence often suffer mental trauma  that they will carry with them for the rest of their lives.   One example is Bridgette Jenkins, a nurse for 20 years in Houston and  professor at Houston Baptist University's School of Nursing, who will  not work in a psychiatric ward because 19 years ago a psychiatric  patient hit her so hard that half her face became swollen and doctors  encouraged her to get an x-ray to ensure her jaw wasn't broken.   Another is Norma Broadhurst, who testified before the Texas House of  Representatives that she experienced a ``traumatic amputation'' of her  right ring finger due to an intoxicated spring break patient biting off  her finger.   Workplace violence against healthcare workers is so ubiquitous that  more than a third of Texas nurses surveyed who did not report a recent  violent incident said they did so because it was ``an accepted/expected  part of the job'' or because they did ``not expect anything to  change.''   One stark example of this is Kimberly Curtin, a nurse for nearly 28  years in Houston, who was punched in the side of the head by a patient  as a young nurse.   Her colleague who witnessed the attack said to her, ``Welcome to  ER.''   As of 2019, according to the Texas Health and Human Services  Commission, Harris County has 4,303 registered physicians and 45,946  registered nurses.   That is over 50,000 individuals in my district that have been on the  front lines of the fight against the pandemic, where in addition to  facing a historically deadly virus they have been spit on, cursed out,  sexually harassed, and physically assaulted.   I cannot stand by while knowing that these people I represent, who  give so much to others, who have a personal and professional obligation  to ``do no harm,'' and who have a steadfast focus on helping patients,  must remain constantly vigilant at their place of work due to potential  threats to their physical safety.   Madam Speaker, throughout this deadly COVID-19 pandemic, we have  called our healthcare workers heroes, and we have lauded them for being  the front line defense against this deadly violence.   But words are only the first step towards action, and action is what  is needed here today.   Although it is not enough, the very least we can do to repay their  sacrifice and heroism is make sure healthcare workers everywhere are  secure against violence from within their workplace.   I urge all members to join me in voting to pass H.R. 1195, the  ``Workplace Violence Prevention for Health Care and Social Service  Workers Act,'' to reduce workplace violence injuries among health care  and social service workers.                     [The Texas Tribune, Feb. 9, 2021]   Half of Texas' Nurses Experience Workplace Violence. A Texas Lawmaker                      Says It's Time To Protect Them.                  (By Shannon Najmabadi and Neelam Bohra)         Steven D. Powell is a nurse with Texas Medical Center in       Houston. Powell said violent patients have left him covered       in bruises, but he more regularly faces verbal assaults.       Credit: Shelby Tauber for The Texas Tribune        State Rep. Donna Howard was working as an intensive care       unit nurse in the 1970s when a patient pulled an intravenous       drip out of his arm and walked toward her. She rushed to help       him--but didn't see the metal urinal he was clutching behind       his back until it was too late. He smacked her in the jaw       with it, knocking her across the room. ``I was briefly       stunned by the hit,'' said Howard, then working at the       Brackenridge hospital in Austin. ``But I continued working.''        For decades, health care workers have faced rampant       violence in the workplace. Now praised as heroes of the       pandemic, those front-line medical workers have been       routinely scratched, bitten or verbally abused by patients.       Well over half of Texas' nurses reported being subject to       workplace violence in their career, according to a 2016 state       study.        Nationwide, the rate of violence for health care workers       increased more than 60% between 2011 and 2018, and the       Occupational Safety and Health Administration has found the       rate of serious violent incidents in health care is more than       four times greater than for those in other industries.        ``It is presumed to be a part of the job,'' Howard, D-      Austin, said of the violence. ``That's not OK.''        There are no federal laws that specifically target violence       in nurses' workplaces. OSHA does not require health care       facilities to have violence prevention plans, though states       like California and Washington have passed laws to do so.       Howard has filed similar legislation in Texas that if passed       this year, would place Texas in a vanguard of states that       have backed similar protections for nurses.        It would require health care providers to create committees       to prevent workplace violence and to offer medical treatment       and other services after a violent incident. It would also       bar facilities from penalizing nurses who report abuse.        ``They are there to take care of us. And I think we have a       responsibility to take care of them,'' Howard said, adding       that this year especially, lawmakers have a moral obligation       to take care of health care workers who have been risking       their lives throughout the pandemic.        State lawmakers have for years heard examples of the       violence nurses face.        Rep. Stephanie Klick, R-Fort Worth, who has worked as a       nurse, said in a committee hearing that her wrist was broken       by an elderly patient and that she had to have surgery to       repair it.        Cindy Zolnierek, head of the Texas Nurses Association, said       a patient tried to punch her in the face on her first day as       a graduate nurse. She quickly stepped back to avoid being       struck.        And in 2013, an emergency room nurse named Norma Broadhurst       told a panel of lawmakers she'd had a ``traumatic       amputation'' of her right ring finger after it was bitten off       by an ``intoxicated spring break patient'' who she was trying       to help.        ``I will never have my finger back to wear the ring my       grandmother gave me,'' she said. ``Is this going to interfere       with my wanting to help the next patient? . . . I am right-      handed, everything I do involves this hand.''        That year, the Legislature strengthened the penalties for       assaulting emergency room workers, putting the offense on par       with harming first responders. Lawmakers later signed off on       creating a grant program to find creative ways to lower the       number of verbal and physical attacks against nurses. Those       efforts have been focused on training, trying to quickly       identify patients at high risk of lashing out, or raising       public awareness about the rate of violence, Zolnierek said.        Nurse advocates say that a proactive approach is essential       to stop assaults before they happen and leave health care       workers and patients traumatized by the experience.        ``Many members of the general public, they're like, 'Are       you kidding me? People assault nurses?' They don't understand       that it's a problem,'' Zolnierek said.        In Texas, more than a third of nurses surveyed for a 2016       report who did not report a recent violent incident said it       was because it was ``anaccepted/ expected part of the job''       or because they did ``not expect anything to change.'' About       a quarter of nurses--and nearly a third of those in       freestanding emergency centers--said their employer was not       at all or only ``slightly effective'' at managing workplace       violence.        It's not just nurses. Respiratory therapists, dietary aides       and other health care workers all face violence. Nearly half       of emergency physicians have reported being physically       assaulted at work.  [[Page H1865]]         Dr. Theresa Tran, an assistant professor of emergency       medicine at the Baylor College of Medicine, said violence is       an ``unfortunate commonality'' in emergency rooms everywhere       and something workers there have to always be ``vigilant''       about.        An OSHA webpage says people who work in hospitals, nursing       homes and other health care facilities face ``significant       risks'' of violence, in part because they may work closely       with people who have a history of violence or are under the       influence of drugs. A state report said nurses have the       ``highest risk'' among health professionals because of how       often they interact with patients.        Zolnierek said nurses may be viewed as ``non threatening''       and may be vulnerable to being struck because they work in       close proximity to patients. There can also be outdated sex-      based stereotypes of nurses--about 88% of whom are women--as       being passive or doctors' ``handmaids,'' said Zolnierek,       though both male and female nurses experience sexual       harassment from patients.        Daniel Funtong, a nurse who works in North Texas, said       older patients sometimes react poorly to pain medication, in       some cases threatening nurses with knives or spoons that are       served with meals.        ``I don't think they understand the magnitude, because       after going through . . . trauma or injury and then the       recovery process, and sometimes that brain doesn't function       as normal,'' Funtong said.        A variety of factors can spark aggression or a violent       outburst from patients. The presence of needles can trigger       violence, and patients who want to leave the hospital or who       are frustrated with waiting could be more prone to erupt,       according to researchers who analyzed a year of incident       reports at a hospital system in the midwest.        In other cases, patients' family members have lashed out if       they think the health care worker isn't doing enough to care       for their loved one.        Nurses and physicians ``constantly'' feel threatened by       patients and family members, Funtong said, and have been       trained to identify crisis-type situations and alert building       security if needed. He wishes police would work closely with       health care facilities' private security to more promptly       intervene with violent patients.        Registered nurse Steven Powell said violent patients have       left him covered in bruises, but he more regularly faces       verbal assaults. Recently, a patient called him a racial       slur--an occurrence that's not uncommon for nurses, according       to experts.        ``When you look at the workforce for nurses, it's a very       diverse landscape,'' he said. ``The violence that they can       experience from a verbal nature, threats due to their       culture--they may keep it to themselves or not respond in the       same manner that everyone would, having a plan like this that       encourages reporting.''        Powell, who also works as a traveling nurse, said health       care facilities he worked at in the Houston and Dallas areas       were unprepared for the pandemic--and that lack of readiness       extends to how they plan for violence.        ``Not all facilities are taking the steps necessary to       protect their staff,'' Powell said.        Some 82% of Texas nurses report being verbally abused,       which can include yelling, swearing and the use of hurtful       words, according to the 2016 state report. Nearly half also       reported physical violence like being hit, slapped or choked.        The threat of violence or abuse can take a heavy toll,       leaving health care workers with injuries, psychological       trauma or decreased morale. Nurseswho face violence may trust       their employers or coworkers less, become more guarded when       treating patients or even leave the profession--while Texas       faces a shortage of nurses.        ``One abusive patient can negate 25 lovely patients, and it       just hurts you on so many levels, more than just the       physical,'' said Mary Ball, a registered nurse at Parkland       Health & Hospital System. Ball said a co-worker was recently       bitten by a patient who drew blood, and that the hospital       doesn't provide enough information to staff or the public       about safety issues.        Ball, who is still in therapy after being robbed at       gunpoint in an employee parking lot almost two years ago,       said she wishes more armed officers were present in and       outside the hospital and said that restraints should be more       frequently used to protect them from potentially violent       patients.        A Parkland spokesperson said the hospital ``puts out a       great deal of information about safety and discusses these       matters regularly in our system-wide town halls, which is       open to all employees.'' Police officers are also present to       protect patients and employees.        The Dallas-based hospital has used other initiatives to try       to reduce workplace violence. It created a free course a few       years ago to raise awareness about the prevalence of       workplace violence and to teach employees and nursing       students how to protect themselves. It also purchased       wearable alarm systems for employees that can emit a piercing       noise if they need help and are not near a panic button, said       Karen Garvey, Parkland's vice president of safety and       clinical risk management.        Ball said the wearable alarm wouldn't have helped her when       she was being robbed.        Workplace violence is thought to be vastly underreported       among health care workers, in part because of a professional       obligation to ``do no harm,'' and a steadfast focus on       helping patients, even those who hurt them, according to       experts. Some health care workers who experience violence may       not want to blame or shame violent patients who are ill or       affected by medication. Others may be reluctant to report       violence because they view it as part of their job, fear       retaliation from their employer or are deterred by the time       and administrative hassle of going through the process,       experts say.        They may think, ```Nothing ever happens when I report so       why should I bother?''' said Judy Arnetz, a professor at       Michigan State University who for decades has studied       workplace violence in the health care sector. Some health       care workers may also sympathize with the patient and think       they ``didn't mean to hurt me, that patient . . . suffers       from dementia or was under the influence,'' she said.        Though awareness about workplace violence has grown,       there's still a dearth of information about how frequently it       erupts and affects health care workers, largely because of a       lack of reporting, said Arnetz, one of the researchers who       analyzed incidents at the Midwestern hospital system.        Health care workers and experts have said hospitals can add       more security guards or metal detectors and instill a culture       of violence prevention to help deter workplace violence. They       should also better understand where violence is occurring and       why. Violent outbursts have been reported more frequently in       emergency rooms or psychiatric facilities, where people may       be anxious, stressed, in pain or under other kinds of       psychological strain, experts have said. But it can still       happen in other health care settings, and workers there may       be less prepared to deal with the violence.        Tran, the emergency room physician, said health care       workers' role in stabilizing patients and trying to find       physical or mental issues that they cari address can add a       complicated layer to the violence.        ``I think health care workers, especially physicians and       nurses in the ER, tolerate violence more than other       industries because we see ourselves in a position where we're       supposed to help patients and look past any aggressions on       ourselves,'' she said.
