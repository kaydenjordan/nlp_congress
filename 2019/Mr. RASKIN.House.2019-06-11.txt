 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 431 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 431         Resolved, That at any time after adoption of this       resolution the Speaker may, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule       XVIII, declare the House resolved into the Committee of the       Whole House on the state of the Union for consideration of       the bill (H.R. 2740) making appropriations for the       Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and       Education, and related agencies for the fiscal year ending       September 30, 2020, and for other purposes. The first reading       of the bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order       against consideration of the bill are waived. General debate       shall be confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour       equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking       minority member of the Committee on Appropriations.

It shall be in order at any time for the chair of       the Committee on Appropriations or her designee to offer       amendments en bloc consisting of further amendments printed       in part B of the report of the Committee on Rules       accompanying this resolution not earlier disposed of.       Amendments en bloc offered pursuant to this section shall be       considered as read, shall be debatable for 20 minutes equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on Appropriations or their respective       designees, shall not be subject to amendment except as       provided by section 4 of this resolution, and shall not be       subject to a demand for division of the question in the House       or in the Committee of the Whole.        Sec. 4.

Res. 430) authorizing the       Committee on the Judiciary to initiate or intervene in       judicial proceedings to enforce certain subpoenas and for       other purposes. The amendment in the nature of a substitute       recommended by the Committee on Rules now printed in the       resolution shall be considered as adopted. The resolution, as       amended, shall be considered as read. The previous question       shall be considered as ordered on the resolution, as amended,       to adoption without intervening motion or demand for division       of the question except one hour of debate equally divided and       controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the       Committee on Rules.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Cole), pending  which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During consideration  of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only.                                time  1230                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members be  given 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks.    Mr. Speaker, on Monday, the Rules Committee met and  reported a rule, H.R. 431, providing for consideration of H.R. 2740,  making appropriations for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human  Services, and Education, and related agencies for the fiscal year  ending September 30, 2020, and for other purposes, and H. Res. 430,  authorizing the Committee on the Judiciary to initiate or intervene in  judicial proceedings to enforce certain subpoenas and, also, for other  purposes.   The rule provides for consideration of H.R. 2740 under a structured  rule, self-executes Chairwoman Lowey's manager's amendment, and makes  in order 106 different amendments.   The rule provides 1 hour of general debate, equally and divided and  controlled by the chair and ranking member of the Appropriations  Committee, and provides that they may offer up to 15 pro forma  amendments, each for the purposes of debate.   The chair of the Appropriations Committee may also offer amendments  en bloc consisting of amendments made in order by the rule and not  earlier disposed of.   Additionally, the rule provides for consideration of H. Res. 430  under a closed rule, with 1 hour of debate equally and divided and  controlled by the chair and ranking member of the Rules Committee.  [[Page H4403]]    Mr. Speaker, this rule pairs two bills which demonstrate the  commitment of the House majority both to making strong progress for the  American people in the areas of health, labor, and education, at the  same time that we defend the Constitution of the United States and the  rule of law against the obstructionism and the lawlessness of the  executive branch of government.   Let's start with H.R. 2740, which is designed to make government work  for our people. It provides $189.9 billion in discretionary funding for  the Department of Labor, the Department of Education, and the  Department of Health and Human Services.   It increases investment in the National Institutes of Health, our  country's preeminent medical research agency, a national treasure,  which is headquartered in Bethesda, Maryland, in my district, to  support research for Alzheimer's disease, HIV/Aids, breast cancer,  colon cancer, cystic fibrosis, multiple sclerosis, childhood cancer,  heart disease, stroke, diabetes, mental health, suicide prevention, and  the Cancer Moonshot initiative.   The people of NIH and their network of allied entities and agencies  and supported universities and research labs across the country are  making profound progress in the struggle to uplift the health of the  people against all of the killer diseases of our time.   And for the first time in more than 20 years, this bill contains  funding to support gun violence and firearm injury prevention research,  and we are proud of that.   This legislation increases funding for Department of Education  programs to help America's children succeed, providing critical  resources for elementary and secondary schools, special ed programs,  and Federal student aid. Importantly, the bill increases the maximum  Pell grant to help America's college and graduate students keep pace  with inflation and the high cost of living.   H.R. 2740 also provides $56.4 billion in funding for the State  Department, USAID, and the U.S. Institute of Peace. We are making major  strategic investments in diplomacy, global health, and international  basic education, the crucial ingredients for maintaining peace and  security around the world.   This legislation provides essential humanitarian assistance and  critical funding to improve maternal and child health, to fight  diseases like malaria, and to support women's reproductive health and  literacy across the globe. We know that the key to improving social and  economic development around the world is the education of women and the  investment in family planning programs and literacy about procreation.   This legislation renews our Nation's commitment to addressing the  climate crisis by investing in directives on adaption and renewable  energy. It also prohibits the use of any government funds to withdraw  from the Paris climate agreement.   Now, on the other legislation, which deals with contempt, Mr.  Speaker, we know from Special Counsel Mueller's report that there was a  sweeping and systematic assault on America's elections in 2016. There  was a conscious effort and plan by Vladimir Putin and the GRU to  undermine and destabilize the American elections by interfering and  hacking into the Democratic National Committee, the Democratic  Congressional Campaign Committee, Hillary Clinton's offices to inject  poisonous ideological propaganda into the body politic of America  through Facebook, through Twitter, through YouTube and other social  media entities and then to directly hack into the State boards of  election.   The Department of Justice launched a special counsel inquiry. It was  a Republican Attorney General who named a Republican special counsel,  Mr. Mueller, to do it.   The President of the United States, according to Special Counsel  Mueller's report, engaged in at least 10 different episodes of efforts  to interfere with that investigation, to obstruct justice. We received  that report a couple of months ago from the special counsel.   In the aftermath of it, President Trump said, ``We are fighting all  subpoenas,'' and declared that there would be no cooperation from the  executive branch with legislative branch subpoenas, with our demands  for documents, with our demands for witnesses, with our demands for  testimony from the executive branch. He said: ``I don't want people  testifying,'' and, ``There is no reason to go any further.'' And since  then, they have drawn a curtain down over the executive branch of  government and defied the lawful orders of the Congress of the United  States.   The Trump administration is stonewalling, from pillar to post,  congressional investigations, defying validly issued congressional  subpoenas. So, for example, Attorney General Barr is refusing to  produce the full unredacted Mueller report and the related underlying  evidence to the House Committee on the Judiciary.    Every other independent special counsel had simply turned their  report over to Congress and Congress did the redactions, but Attorney  General Barr engaged in a series of games with the Congress of the  United States and confused the American public, as Special Counsel  Mueller complained in a letter that he sent to the Attorney General.   He is also defying a House Intelligence Committee subpoena directing  him to turn over documents and materials related to Special Counsel  Mueller's investigation, including all counterintelligence and foreign  intelligence materials produced during the investigation.   Don McGahn, the former White House counsel, has defied a subpoena  issued by the House Committee on the Judiciary without any substantial  legal basis at all.   Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin is defying a subpoena from the House  Ways and Means Committee directing him to produce the President's tax  returns under a statute that makes it crystal clear that Congress has a  right to obtain the tax returns of the President or any other citizen  of the United States.   Commerce Secretary Ross and Attorney General William Barr are  refusing to comply with duly authorized bipartisan subpoenas from the  House Oversight and Reform Committee, which is investigating the  administration's shadowy and illicit efforts to add an illegitimate  citizenship question to the 2020 Census completely outside of the  Administrative Procedures Act process. Several District Courts have  struck that down. But, in any event, the administration is refusing to  turn over evidence, relevant evidence, to Congress about this effort to  impose the citizenship question on the census.   The administration is refusing to turn over documents, witnesses, and  testimony relating to the corruption of the security clearance process  in the White House personnel office.   There were 25 different individuals who were denied a security  clearance by the professional staff in the White House personnel  office, who were then overruled by President Trump or political  appointees. We are trying to get information as to what was the basis  for the original denial. It was, likely, conflict with foreign  governments or financial conflicts of interest. It might also have been  drug or alcohol problems. But we want to get the details of each one,  and then we want to know if there is any written documentation of why  the President and his subordinates overturned those.   In all of these cases, Mr. Speaker, the executive branch of  government has followed President Trump's orders to say, simply: We are  not going to turn anything over to Congress.   Now, understand, the Supreme Court of the United States has held that  it is an essential and integral aspect of legislative power to engage  in investigation and factfinding. That is how the people's  Representatives are able to legislate: We are able to get information.  But if you shut down our ability to get information, we cannot engage  in lawmaking. For that reason, we have begun to win in all of these  Federal District Court cases where we are going out to try to get this  information.   But, Mr. Speaker, we cannot tie up the floor of the House of  Representatives every time the executive branch decides to follow the  order of the President and simply deny us the information that we seek.   My friends across the aisle know from the Fast and Furious  investigation, the Hillary Clinton email investigation, the Benghazi  investigation it is Congress' right to investigate and to obtain the  documents that it wants. They obtained millions of documents  [[Page H4404]]  in those investigations. We had a right to get them then, and we have a  right to get all of these documents now.   Mr. Speaker, this legislation will give the power, first of all, to  the Committee on the Judiciary to follow through on the subpoenas that  it has issued. It will also empower and authorize each chair of the  House of Representatives to enforce their lawful subpoenas that are  being dishonored and violated by the executive branch of government.   So we are very proud to bring forward these two pieces of  legislation, one which makes good on our commitment to the American  people to continue to make progress in the fields of education,  healthcare, labor, and scientific and medical research while, at the  same time, we defend the Constitution, the rule of law, the  prerogatives and powers of Congress against the lawlessness and the  obstructionism of this administration.   We are the preeminent and primary branch of government. The very  first sentence of the Constitution, Mr. Speaker: ``We the people of the  United States, in order to form a more perfect Union, establish  justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense,  promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to  ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution  for the United States of America.''   The second sentence that follows is all legislative power is vested  in the Congress of the United States.                                time  1245    The sovereign power of the people comes right through the preamble  into Article I, establishing us as the representatives of the people.  Then you get dozens of paragraphs setting forth all the powers of  Congress: to declare war, to raise revenues, to write budgets, to  impeach the President or other executive branch officials who commit  high crimes and misdemeanors and to remove them in the Senate, to set  up a post office, to govern the seat of government, and to establish a  capital city. Those are the prerogatives and powers of Congress.   Then you get to Article II, and Article II fixes the powers of the  President. What are the President's core responsibilities? To take care  that the laws are faithfully executed. That is the President's job: to  take care that the laws are faithfully executed.   It is even in Article II that the President can be impeached, in  Section 4.   Just to make it clear, the President works for the Congress; the  Congress doesn't work for the President. And we, the Congress, work for  the people.   That is what it means to have a representative democracy. We work for  the people.   Now, we have a President who is in an unprecedented, wholesale,  categorical defiance of the powers of Congress by denying us the  information that we seek to obtain, which is our right and which is our  need.   We are going to get it, and we are going to get it by empowering  Congress to go to court to enforce our subpoenas.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to hear from my friend from Oklahoma  about both of these bills. We were here together last night until  around midnight, working on the rules for these bills.   On H.R. 2740, the appropriations package that we have together, we  have authorized more than 100--I think the number is 112--bipartisan  amendments. In fact, I think the first amendment is one that is from  the gentleman from Oklahoma. We have made that first.    I won't be voting for it. I won't be supporting it, but he has the  opportunity to make his case on the floor of the House of  Representatives and to present it to colleagues.   We are proud of the fact that there are more than 100 amendments. In  fact, I think we are meeting again this afternoon, and we might adopt  dozens more amendments, for the consideration of the full House.   But on the question of H. Res. 430, which is to empower the Judiciary  Committee and the other committees in Congress to enforce our right to  obtain information that we seek, I think that this should be an  overriding, bipartisan commitment within the Article I branch, within  the Congress of the United States.   We simply cannot tolerate a posture from the President of the United  States--and it is hard for me to think of any other Congress that would  tolerate it from any other President--of noncooperation and absolute,  comprehensive, and wholesale defiance of the will of Congress in trying  to seek information.   My good friend from Oklahoma says that the President does not work to  enforce the laws of Congress; he works for the people. Well, we all  work for the people. That was my point. His job is to take care that  the laws passed by Congress are faithfully executed. We work directly  for the people.   At least until we get a national popular vote for President, the  President is not elected by the people, as we know from the 2016  election itself where the popular vote winner, who gained several  million more votes than Donald Trump did, lost the election because of  the workings of the electoral college.                                time  1300    The Presidency was set up as an indirect mechanism, and that is  something that I think that we should be replacing. But I think it is  not appropriate to claim a popular mandate for the President when the  President emerges from the electoral college.   In any event, the President's job is to take care that the laws are  faithfully executed and also to be the Commander in Chief in times of  actual conflict, but it is up to Congress to legislate. That is what we  do. That is why it is so problematic when the President of the United  States says:         I will not accept a bipartisan congressional rejection of       billions of dollars in funding for my border wall; I am going       to declare a national emergency and then reprogram money from       other lawfully appropriated purposes.    That is a violation of the spending power of the Congress of the  United States. It is just like the President rejecting a bipartisan  repudiation of his involvement with the Saudi Government in the Yemeni  civil war. We have not declared war with Saudi Arabia against Iran or  anybody else in the Yemeni conflict, and so we don't want to be  involved in it. We don't want our money going to that bloody  humanitarian catastrophe, and yet the President simply rejects the  majority will of both Houses of Congress. That is a decisive rejection  in defiance of Congress' power to declare war.   Now what we are getting is this complete defiance of our ability to  get the information that we need. The President said it very clearly.  He basically said: No subpoenas, no witnesses--enough--and no do-overs.   So he is not going to allow us to investigate the compromised  security  [[Page H4406]]  clearance process and the White House is not going to allow us to  investigate the completely suspect corruption and distortion of the  constitutional mandate for a Census which we have got to do by virtue  of the Constitution every 10 years, and he is not going to cooperate  with any investigation into the matters that were covered by Special  Counsel Mueller; the organized, systematic comprehensive, sweeping  attack on our elections by the GRU and Russian agents or the more than  100 contacts they had with the Trump campaign or the 10 different  episodes of Presidential obstruction of justice that were set forth by  Special Counsel Mueller in his report.   We can't accept that. So this legislation in H.R. 430 will give us  the opportunity to go to court right away to enforce our subpoenas  against this unprecedented defiance of congressional power by the  President of the United States.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, all of us, of course, embrace and uphold the First  Amendment and the rights of religious freedom, the right to not have  government establish a religion and to participate in the free exercise  of religion and to worship or to not worship exactly as you please.  There is nothing in any of our legislation that would interfere with  anybody's right to exercise precisely their religious preference to  worship exactly as they please and to belong to whatever religious  faith or denomination they want.   I am not quite sure exactly what the gentleman was referring to. We  know that the idea of a religious freedom to discriminate has been  asserted ever since the 1960s with the Civil Rights Act of 1964 where  the hotel and motel, lunch counter and department store owners  said that they had a religious right to only serve the customers that  they wanted and that it violated their religious faith to have  interracial parties seated in restaurants or at the lunch counter. Our  Supreme Court rejected that, and this Congress has rejected that.    There have been similar efforts to say we have a constitutional right  not to serve gay and lesbian customers. That has been rejected, and I  hope that this Congress will also reject it.   We passed the Equality Act very proudly to add protection for LGBT  people to the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and I hope that the Senate will  go along with it.   In any event, there is nothing in any of the legislation before us  and none has been cited which violates any of the free exercise rights  of the people. So with that, unless I hear anything further, I am not  moved by how anybody is affected by this appropriation negatively.   My other good friend from Oklahoma referenced the phrase checks and  balances, and that does appear in the Federalist Papers. I think it is  in Federalist 51. It actually refers to the relationship between the  House and the Senate. That was the design of the Framers of the  Constitution that the House and the Senate would check and balance each  other. But the Framers were very clear that we were overthrowing  monarchy. We didn't want monarchy. That is why we got rid of the king.  The revolutionaries and the rebels who gave us America and who wrote  the Constitution were trying to institute a new form of government  representing We the People. That is why we are so proud to be able to  serve in the people's House here along with our friends in the Senate.   But the President's core job is to take care that our laws are  faithfully executed. We have no kings here; we have no monarchs here.  That is why we have the Emoluments Clause in the Constitution which  says that none of us who serves in Washington can accept any present-- any emoluments, which just means a payment--any office or title from a  prince, a king, or a foreign government without the consent of  Congress.   That is a cardinal principle in the Constitution. It is our original  anti-corruption principle because the Framers did not want the  President or Members of Congress selling out the country. They wanted  complete, undivided loyalty by those of us who come to Washington, who  aspire and obtain the public office to have complete, undivided loyalty  to the American people and not to lobbyists for foreign governments,  agents, and saboteurs.   So that is another real problem that this President seems not to  recognize. That provision obligates him whenever he receives any money  from a foreign government through his hotel or his office towers or any  of his going businesses that he has kept going in the course of his  tenure, whenever he receives any of that money, he has got to come to  Congress to ask for our permission and for our consent.   Mr. Speaker, we can show you records from lots of prior Presidents  who came to Congress to ask for a consent because they received a  Persian rug, or a shawl, or cufflinks. Yet--at least according to court  reports and media reports--this President has been receiving hundreds  of thousands of dollars or millions of dollars from foreign  governments. In fact, the President I think made a voluntary deposit he  said of the profits from foreign government receipts of $350,000 to the  U.S. Treasury without any accounting to us, without any receipts, and  without asking for our consent.   So even if the Constitution says that you can't accept the profits  from foreign payments, which it doesn't, it says you can't accept  foreign payments. That would be insufficient because Congress has got  to offer its consent.   Look, we need to lay down the law about all of these matters. When we  ask for a document, we want the document. When we issue a subpoena from  the United States Congress, you comply with the subpoena. When we ask  for  [[Page H4407]]  a witness, the witness arrives. That is what H.R. 430 is all about. We  have got to empower Congress to enforce its will.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I still have not heard a single instance offered from anybody whose  religious freedoms under the Constitution of the United States are  threatened by any of the legislation here.   I do know that the ultimate logic of the argument that we just heard  here is to support legislation like what was just passed in the State  of Alabama. In Alabama today--please read an article in the Washington  Post this morning, Mr. Speaker--in Alabama today if this legislation is  signed into law, a 15-year-old girl who is raped by her step-uncle not  only would not be able to obtain an abortion, because there is no  exception for rape or incest in the ban that the legislature just  passed, but she would be compelled to have him involved in the raising  of the child because Alabama protects the paternity rights of the  rapist. So it is one of only two States in the country where a rapist  continues to have parenthood rights in the child.   So get this straight. If what we are hearing is actually enacted into  law--and I understand my colleagues to be encouraging legislation like  this around the country, like the law in Alabama--we will have a  situation where girls who are 15 or 14 or 13 or 16 years old who are  raped by their stepfathers or step-uncles must carry a child to term,  have the baby, and in some States be forced to raise the baby with the  rapist.   So I don't think that is where we are today in America under Planned  Parenthood v. Casey and Roe v. Wade, and certainly the majority is  going to stand very strong for healthcare for women and reproductive  freedom for women and men to make their own decisions.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms.  Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time to close.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   It is a pleasure to work with the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Cole)  on H.R. 2740 and H.R. 4340, and I do urge all of our colleagues to  support this rule for this legislation.   I do hope my friend from Oklahoma will tutor some of his colleagues,  like the last speaker, who referred to the ``Democrat majority.''  Democrat is the noun. Democratic is the adjective for our party, and I  think that would be a basic gesture of interparty civility if they  would follow that fairly easy grammatical device.   Mr. Speaker, one of the other Members from the other side, I think  from Oklahoma, talked about some education matters, so I want to go to  some statistics that actually mean something to the American people. I  think we can refute all of the statistics that were advanced by my  friend from Oklahoma, as I said.   There are more than 100 amendments that we are going to be bringing  up today, and we are going to be adding more of them, and we certainly  don't want to endure lectures from people who belong to the caucus that  ran the most closed Congress in the history of the United States.   But here are some figures that actually mean something to the  American people. Our bill provides a total of $75.9 billion in  appropriations for the Education Department, which is $4.5 billion  above the 2019-enacted level, and $11.9 billion beyond what the  President asked for. So that means dramatic increases in everything  from IDEA special education spending, to education, innovation, and  research programs, to spending for teacher professional development  evidence-based models and so on.   We are also increasing money for student financial assistance for  Pell Grants for higher education, because it has become too difficult  for our young people to make their way through college, and they are  graduating, basically, with a mortgage of 100 or $150,000, but they  don't have a house to go with it. So this majority is committed to  alleviating the burden on America's college students.   Mr. Speaker, we are trying to make progress, under very difficult  circumstances with this President, for the American people in the realm  of education, healthcare, scientific and medical research. We are  making that progress, and I urge all of my colleagues to support this  legislation.   I urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule and the previous question.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Cole is as follows:                     Amendment to House Resolution 431         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 8. That immediately upon adoption of this resolution,       the House shall resolve into the Committee of the Whole House       on the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       3056) to provide supplemental appropriations relating to       border security, and for other purposes. The first reading of       the bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order against       consideration of the bill are waived. General debate shall be       confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on Appropriations. After general       debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the       five-minute rule. Points of order against provisions in the       bill for failure to comply with clause 2 of rule XXI are       waived. Clause 2(e) of rule XXI shall not apply during       consideration of the bill. When the committee rises and       reports the bill back to the House with a recommendation that       the bill do pass, the previous question shall be considered       as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to final       passage without intervening motion except one motion to       recommit with or without instructions. If the Committee of       the Whole rises and reports that it has come to no resolution       on the bill, then on the next legislative day the House       shall, immediately after the third daily order of business       under clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the       Whole for further consideration of the bill.        Sec 9. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 3056.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.
