 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the life and  legacy of Judy Heumann, an internationally recognized activist and  trailblazer who I am also fortunate enough to have called a friend.   As a young girl in a wheelchair, Judy was denied entry to her local  public high school because she was considered a ``fire hazard.''   Years later after graduating from college with a degree in education,  she was again discriminated against and denied the opportunity to  teach. She challenged the city in court and went on to become the first  teacher in a wheelchair in New York.   Her passion for justice and inclusion persisted throughout her  lifetime. I was honored to work with her to craft and pass disability  legislation of my own in recent years.   Judy once said: ``Disability only becomes a tragedy when society  fails to provide the things we need to save lives.''   I will continue to pursue disability advocacy in Congress with her  quote and her legacy top of mind and close to heart.                            ____________________
