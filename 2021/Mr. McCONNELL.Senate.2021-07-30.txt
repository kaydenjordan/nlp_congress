 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I am sorry to begin my remarks today  with a third Senate eulogy for this week alone.   Last evening, we received word that our former colleague from  Michigan, Senator Carl Levin, passed away at the age of 87. Carl's  fellow Michiganders elected and reelected him six times. He was the  longest serving Senator from Michigan ever. His home State liked what  they had in this passionate activist turned attorney, turned public  servant. His dutiful, diligent, and detail-oriented approach led  Senator Levin to build expertise and win respect across a huge range of  issues.   The pinnacle of our colleague's career was his years atop the Senate  Armed Services Committee. I certainly did not always reach the same  conclusions that Carl did, but his independence, his genuine humble  curiosity, and his affection for the men and women who wear the uniform  were impossible to dispute.   He was earnest. He was solid, forthright, and devoted to the defense  of our Nation in ways that he thought best.   I especially admired Carl's courageous, consistent defense of the  Senate filibuster and the unique structures that define this  institution. He never let short-term political facts cloud his long- term judgment in that crucial area.   I know all of our condolences go out to Barbara and the entire Levin  family today and to all Senators, staff, and friends who will miss our  colleague.
