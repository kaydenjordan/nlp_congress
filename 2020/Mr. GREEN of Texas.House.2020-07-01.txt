 Madam Speaker, and still I rise. And I rise  tonight to express my support for H.R. 2, the Moving Forward Act.   I have supported this legislation because it is not only good for my  congressional district, it is also good for the country.   This legislation will allow us to do something that I think is quite  important. I sit on the Financial Services Committee, and it allows us  to address housing as a part of our Nation's infrastructure. The  Honorable Maxine Waters has worked tirelessly to get housing included  in this legislation. I believe it will benefit many people, especially  those people who may find themselves with rent due and an inability to  pay their bills.   I also am proud to say that it will help our ports. We have the Port  of Houston, and that is a port that is very significant as it relates  not only to Houston but to the country.   It will help with our schools, and it will help with broadband. It is  a very good piece of legislation.   But there is one additional thing in this legislation that I think  would be of benefit, not only to the young people in this country but  also to our police officers. This is H. Res. 169 which is a piece of  legislation that emanated in my office. This would have a driver and an  officer safety education component.   We talk about the conversations that African American parents have  with their children. This is a conversation that takes place because of  a history that we too well understand. This legislation addresses that  conversation, but it addresses it not only as it relates to the young  person, the person who is going to be driving the car, it also  addresses it as it relates to the officer.   It would grant States moneys for grants such that they would be able  to train officers about the interactions with civilians and train  civilians, give them the education that they need so that they will  understand how to properly interact with officers.   Understanding can change the course of history. It can make a  difference in the lives of people. My hope is that with this  legislation in H.R. 2 it will cause somebody to benefit from just  knowing how to interact with a person who happens to be a police  officer or a police officer getting a better understanding of how to  interact with someone from a given community.   As important as this piece of legislation is, I do understand that if  we are to have the kind of change that we seek, we will probably have  to have another piece of legislation that I am proud to offer. This is  a piece of legislation calling for a department of reconciliation. A  lot of what is happening in our country is systemic. It is  institutionalized. If we want to deal with systemic and  institutionalized problems, especially as they relate to race, then we  need to have a department so that we can approach these systemic issues  not only in the short term but over the years and over the decades.   This department of reconciliation will, of course, have a secretary  of reconciliation. This secretary will have the responsibility of  devising the strategy and implementing a strategy to eliminate racism  and invidious discrimination in our country.                                time  1845    This department will be properly funded. We would like to see it  funded with a minimum of 10 percent of what the Department of Justice  receives. This would be the equivalent--the money would not come from  the Department of Justice--but the equivalent of 10 percent of what the  Department of Justice receives as a minimum in funding.   This department would be one that would give us the opportunity to  look into the future and devise a means by which we can avoid some of  the systemic problems that we currently have.   Madam Speaker, my hope is that this resolution will get the support  of my colleagues. It has gained support every day, and I look forward  to getting the continued support of my colleagues for the resolution.  The resolution, of course, is the forerunner to a bill, a bill that  will actually develop this department of reconciliation.   We found that there is a Labor Department, and this Labor Department,  of course, deals with issues associated with labor. We have other  departments that are specialties. They specialize in dealing with  certain issues. Well, why not a department of reconciliation so that we  can do something that has long been needed since the Emancipation  Proclamation?   While we had the invidious discrimination known as segregation,  through the years, we have not done what we need to do, and that is  reconcile, settle our differences, come to a conclusion as to what is  appropriate when it comes to some of the icons that we have in this  country with reference to Civil War memorabilia and where it can be  placed. These kinds of things can be resolved through the department of  reconciliation.   Madam Speaker, my hope is that we will have the department available  to us in the near future. My hope is that this is something that  Presidential candidates will embrace and want to talk about. I will  surely put it before candidates when given the opportunity because the  secretary will report directly to the President of the United States.  This will give us the insight that we need into the Office of the  Presidency. And the President can, of course, provide legislation by  and through the secretary.   It is a good piece of legislation, and my hope is that we will get it  passed.   Finally, this: I am honored to say that I, too, support law  enforcement. My uncle was a deputy sheriff. He had a great amount of  influence on my life. I believe that I am in Congress today because of  some things that he said and urged me to do.   Madam Speaker, I support law enforcement. I don't paint all law  enforcement officers with the same brush, just as I don't want all  protesters to be painted with the same brush.   I support the right to peacefully protest. I believe that if we who  support the protest movements and support peace officers, if we would  actually let people know that there are some persons who are in the  police forces that are not acceptable because of their behavior, and  there are some people who are associating themselves with the protest  movement who are not acceptable because of their behavior--persons who  do things that are inappropriate, persons who would burn buildings,  this  [[Page H3053]]  is inappropriate. I don't support that. Officers who would put their  knees on the necks of persons, that is inappropriate. No one would  support that, I would hope.   Madam Speaker, I just think that, as we move forward, let's not  conclude that there is something wrong with the protest movement  because of some of the people who associate themselves with the  movement, just as I don't conclude that there is something wrong with  all police officers because of the actions and behavior of some police  officers. There are people within both of these entities that I speak  of who are good, and the bad ones, we, of course, should eliminate.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
