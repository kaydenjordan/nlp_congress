 Madam Speaker, I rise today to praise the Democratic Party  for putting people over politics. Every day House Democrats fight to  better the lives of working Americans.   We are ready to support commonsense legislation to keep the  government open and to provide vital services to the American people.  We continue to bring down inflation and lower costs for food, medicine,  and other necessities. We invest in American families with bills to  help them with childcare and home energy costs.   We support our friends overseas with bills to provide aid to innocent  Palestinian civilians, Ukraine, and Israel, and we work daily to make  our country work for all Americans.   We are committed to voting rights for all Americans. We are committed  to reproductive rights for all women, and we want an America with  equality for all and prejudice toward none. That is why I am proud to  be a Democrat.                            ____________________
