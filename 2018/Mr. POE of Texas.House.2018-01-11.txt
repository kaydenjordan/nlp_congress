 Mr. Speaker, as a judge in Texas, I saw it all:  rape, robbery, murder, kidnapping, child abuse. Now, in Congress, we  are learning about the horrors of human trafficking, sex slavery.   Many groundbreaking laws have been passed to increase resources for  victims and crack down on traffickers and buyers, but like all criminal  enterprises, traffickers constantly stay ahead of the law.   Fortunately for victims, there is an army of individuals, NGOs,  religious and other advocacy groups fighting on behalf of victims. The  people serving in these organizations are New Friends New Life, RAIN,  Polaris, Rights4Girls, Shared Hope, Coalition Against Trafficking, and  Demand Abolition, just to name a few. They have all dedicated their  lives to serve and save victims of trafficking on the front lines.   On this National Human Trafficking Awareness Day, I want to thank all  those warriors--the victims' posse, as I call them--battling the  injustice of human slavery. We will not give up this fight until this  scourge has been eradicated.   And that is just the way it is.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I am a former prosecutor and a former  judge. I despise terrorists. We ought to go after them and get them.  Section 702 was written to go after terrorists, but it is being used to  go after Americans.   Normally, when I was a judge, I would sign a warrant. Before the  government could go into your house, they had to have a warrant to go  into the house and to seize something based on probable cause.   Under FISA, as it is used against Americans--forget the terrorists-- as it is used against Americans, government has already seized your  house of communications, all of it. They look around, and sometimes-- sometimes--they go back to a secret judge in a secret court and get a  secret warrant by a FISA judge, and they come in and seize something  and prosecute based on something irrelevant about terrorism. That is  why this bill violates the Fourth Amendment.   Get a warrant before you go into the house of communications and  effects  [[Page H145]]  and papers of Americans or stay out of that house. These documents have  been seized. Communications have been seized by government. They are  kept forever.   Keep government out. Without a warrant, you stay out, because  government, as we learned from the British, cannot be trusted.   Get a warrant. Stay out of the house of communications.   Vote against this bill. Let's redraft it and protect Americans.   And that is just the way it is.    Mr. Speaker, we are not talking about terrorism. We  are talking about the protection of Americans and their information.  All of the rhetoric and the fear tactics that this will destroy our  ability to go after terrorists is wrong.   The USA RIGHTS Act is important to protect Americans. The other side  talks about protecting Americans. Let's protect their Fourth Amendment  rights. We can protect them against terrorists if we amend this  legislation with the USA RIGHTS Act and protect their rights under the  Fourth Amendment.   Every American's data is being seized by the Justice Department, the  CIA, and the NSA. We have asked them how many times that has been  queried. They will not tell us because the information is massive.   All we are saying under the USA RIGHTS Act is that, if you want to go  into that information on Americans, get a warrant from a judge, not a  query. You can't go search it. Get a warrant under the Fourth Amendment  or stay out of that information and still go after terrorists under 702  and under FISA.  [[Page H155]]    We need to have this amendment to make the bill better to protect  Americans overseas and at home.   And that is just the way it is.
