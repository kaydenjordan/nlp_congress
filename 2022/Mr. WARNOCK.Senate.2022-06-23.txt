 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  following letters be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                     April 27, 2022.      Hon. Raphael Warnock,      U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.        Dear Senator Warnock: As a business organization focused on       a vibrant economy, the Metro Atlanta Chamber encourages you       to support the INFORM Consumers Act as part of the bipartisan       U.S. Innovation and Competition Act of 2021. This will ensure       legitimate businesses and consumers in Georgia and across the       country are better protected.        The Metro Atlanta Chamber represents businesses, colleges       and universities, and nonprofits across the 29-county region       that makes up the nation's ninth largest market. As a more       than 160-year-old organization, we strive to ensure that       Georgia maintains its status as the number one state to do       business.        In recent years, Georgia shoppers have been provided access       to a vast network of affordable on line products and       convenient, fast delivery. Georgia retailers are proud of the       supply chain that has allowed for this, especially when our       economy was upended due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Families       could depend on Georgia retailers that were essential in       keeping our state open for business and our communities safe.       However, the rapid growth of online shopping has provided new       opportunities for criminals and fraudsters--with many of the       latter located in China--to peddle cheap counterfeits and       stolen products designed to undercut American manufacturers       and local retailers.        The INFORM Consumers Act will help stop unsafe counterfeit       products such as N95 masks, toys, and automobile parts from       being sold in significant quantities, which are putting       Georgia consumers at risk. Today, illegitimate imports cost       domestic retailers at least $54.1 billion in sales. We can       only expect this number to grow as Russia scraps trademark       protections amid the ongoing conflict in Eastern Europe and       joins China as one of the most egregious intellectual       property offenders.        Meanwhile, sophisticated rings of criminals are brazenly       stealing merchandise off the shelves of retail store shelves       and selling these items online using fake screennames and       bogus business accounts. In addition to putting retail       workers and customers in harm's way, these thieves pose a       serious economic threat. Research suggests that retail theft       has cost retailers across the nation $68.9 billion in losses.       Congress must address these growing problems before       additional consumers or legitimate American businesses pay       the price. The common-sense measures of the INFORM Consumers       Act, introduced by Senators Dick Durbin (D-IL) and Bill       Cassidy (R-LA) in the Senate, and Representatives Jan       Schakowsky (D-IL) and Gus Bilirakis (R-FL) in the House will       make it harder for criminal networks and con artists from       around the globe to use the anonymity of online marketplaces       to dupe consumers with counterfeit and stolen products.        INFORM would require online marketplaces to verify high-      volume sellers on their platforms and provides consumers with       a method to contact sellers if they suspect they have been       ripped off and sold a fake, broken, or dangerous item. This       bill would not in any way inhibit the small businesses in       Georgia that conduct legitimate commerce on marketplaces       every day, and it protects the personal information of small       sellers. That's why it has united consumer groups,       manufacturers, retailers, and marketplaces who want to       protect American consumers from stolen, fake, and dangerous       products.        This simple, bipartisan measure will bring transparency and       accountability to third-party sellers online and make it       harder for criminals and counterfeiters to harm local       businesses and consumers. On behalf of Georgia retailers--and       especially for our employees and customers--we strongly urge       you to support the INFORM Consumers Act and include it as       part of the U.S. Innovation and Competition Act of 2021.            Sincerely,                                           Katie Kirkpatrick, P.E.,      President and Chief Executive Officer.                                   ____                                                     April 27, 2022.

Hon. Raphael Warnock,      Washington, DC.        Dear Senator Warnock: On behalf of the LaGrange Troup       County Chamber of Commerce, I am pleased to provide support       for increased funding for domestic semiconductor production.       Our membership includes several industrial partners in Troup       County who have been negatively impacted and repeatedly       shutdown due to chip shortages. Our Chamber appreciates your       efforts to provide U.S. manufacturers access to these       important components now and in the future.        The LaGrange Troup County Chamber of Commerce was       established in 1911 to support and enhance the businesses and       business climate of Troup County. Through our mission of       championing our member businesses and serving as a catalyst       for advancing the region's economic success, we work       diligently on their behalf.  [[Page S3155]]         The LaGrange Troup County Chamber looks forward to       continuing to support efforts to alleviate challenges in       workforce development and strengthen supply chain resiliency.            Sincerely,                                                    Connie Hensler,      President and CEO.                                   ____                                                      March 2, 2022.      Senator Raphael Warnock.        Dear Senator Warnock: On behalf of the Greater Columbus       Chamber of Commerce, I am excited to offer this letter in       support of the U.S. Innovation and Competition Act as well as       the America COMPETES Act. As our economy and workforce       continue to change, we believe that strengthening our ability       to compete globally is key to our long-term success. The       Chamber is actively engaged in supporting and enhancing our       local community as a regional catalyst in economic growth,       workforce development, community vibrancy, and inclusion.        We are hopeful that the passing of this bill means stronger       funding and policy support for regional job growth;       especially with support for semi-conductor manufacturing that       further enables technology manufacturing and strengthens       Georgia's automobile industry, the outcome of alleviating       supply chain obstacles and the inclusion of historic       investments in commercial development and science and       technology. Further, strengthening the designated innovation       hub between Columbus and Opelika remains an important focus       and we'd look forward to the availability of funding to       support research and development and commercialization in       this arena.        Lastly, as we tackle the challenge of building a world       class workforce in a tough environment, support via workforce       development programs and funding is imperative.        Please accept our support for SB 1260, the U.S. Innovation       and Competition Act. We look forward to this advancing and to       continuing to build a strong Columbus, a strong Georgia and a       strong nation. Thanks for your continued partnership.            Very respectfully,                                                   Jerald Mitchell,      President and CEO.                                   ____                                                      June 16, 2022.      Hon. Rev. Raphael Warnock,      Washington, DC.        Dear Senator Reverend Warnock: As Director of the Georgia       Manufacturing Extension Partnership (GaMEP), I want to thank       you for your ongoing efforts to enhance Georgia's innovation       and manufacturing sectors and work to strengthen U.S.       competitiveness. Each year, GaMEP assists more than 1,000       small and medium-sized manufacturers across Georgia through       onsite implementation, training and learning opportunities,       connections to partners, and other resources. I hope you can       further support the success of Georgia's manufacturing sector       in your important role as Senate conferee to the bicameral       conference for the United States Innovation and Competition       Act (USICA, S. 1260) and the America COMPETES Act of 2022       (COMPETES Act, H.R. 4521).        These important bills under negotiation have the potential       to transform the U.S. economy by spurring new innovations in       emerging technologies, jumpstarting our domestic       semiconductor production capabilities, and dramatically       expanding and solidifying the resiliency of the U.S.       manufacturing base. I strongly encourage the inclusion in the       final conference agreement the proposed increase of       authorized funding for the National Institute of Standards       and Technology's Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP)       program and the establishment ofa National Manufacturing       Advisory Council as outlined in both the Senate USJCA and the       House COMPETES Act. The bills also include important       provisions to create new supply chain resiliency programs to       identify, prepare for, and respond to threats to the U.S.       supply chain. Looking toward development of future and       emerging industries, manufacturers will also have an       important role in furthering Georgia's economic development       through the proposed Department of Commerce Regional       Technology Hubs program. Without actual funding behind these       tremendously important policy proposals, these activities may       never advance. As such, I encourage Congress to include       appropriated funding to begin these efforts.        GaMEP is proud to promote the success of the manufacturing       industry within Georgia and support our manufacturers to be       globally competitive. The competitiveness legislation under       negotiation will propel our efforts even further. I urge       Congress to come to a final agreement, which includes these       important manufacturing and supply chain provisions, and       swiftly enact this crucial legislation. I want to reiterate       my appreciation for your work to support the manufacturing       and innovation industries in Georgia and I would be happy to       answer any questions you or your office may have.            Sincerely,                                              Timothy D. Israel,                 Director, Georgia Institute of Technology--Georgia       Manufacturing Extension Partnership.                            ____________________
