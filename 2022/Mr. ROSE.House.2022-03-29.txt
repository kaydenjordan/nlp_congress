 Madam Speaker, once again, the President of the United  States made a terrible foreign policy blunder when he embarrassingly  said that Vladimir Putin cannot remain in power.   Almost immediately, the White House communications team did  everything they could to save face and walk back the President's  remarks. Thankfully, the Secretary of State issued a statement  clarifying the President's comments, saying that the U.S. has no  strategy of regime change in Russia.   Unfortunately, it was too little, too late, as Moscow was quick to  seize on the President's gaffe to embolden Putin's undeniably false  message that Russia is the one under attack.   Mistakes like these directly undermine Ukrainian efforts to protect  their sovereignty and stall momentum for peace. President Biden's  actions have been misguided from the onset of this war. He has failed  to deter Russia, and he was late to give Ukraine the military  assistance it so badly needed.   The world expects clear and resolute leadership from the Oval Office.  Unfortunately, it doesn't look like there is a chance of that anytime  soon.                            ____________________
