 Mr. Speaker, this really is a bittersweet moment. I am  so honored to have the opportunity to be here tonight with colleagues,  with the Speaker Emerita, to say a few words to honor our colleague, a  dear, dear friend, Congressman David Cicilline.   He embarks on a new challenge, president and CEO of the Rhode Island  Foundation, one of the largest and oldest community foundations in the  Nation.   Mr. Speaker, it is more than pizza which separates Congressman  Cicilline and myself, there really are more Italians in Connecticut  than there are in Rhode Island. I know about San Francisco, but it is  Connecticut and Rhode Island, and we go back and forth here. Our  numbers in Connecticut are larger than your numbers any day of the  year.   Congress is a really wonderful, wonderful institution and a place to  be. It really has to do with the people that you serve with. You make a  lot of acquaintances in the House of Representatives, but you can count  your friends probably on one hand, maybe two.   David Cicilline has been my friend. That is a friendship that occurs  in the good times and in the bad times, in those up moments and the  down moments when you know that someone always has your back and is  there for you, no matter what. David Cicilline has always been there  for me no matter what.   We had a bond from the moment he arrived in Congress. I kept saying  ``Chichilline,'' and he said, Cicilline. It was the Italian simpatico,  a brother and a sister.   It was my privilege to serve with David since he joined more than a  decade ago, 12 years ago. He has distinguished himself as a fighter for  Rhode Island, a champion for working, middle-class families everywhere.  He doesn't shy away from a fight, and he knows how to get things done.   He is a trailblazer for LGBTQ+ rights. The first openly gay mayor of  a major U.S. city. In Congress, he has been a leading voice on human  rights, civil rights, marriage equality, gun safety, antitrust,  bringing back manufacturing jobs, and so much more--taking on the tech  industry.   His passion and his commitment to these causes has made him one of  the most effective legislators in the House.                                time  1815    He spoke himself about his fight to prevent gun violence, which is at  his core. David was a founding member of the bipartisan coalition,  Mayors Against Illegal Guns, led the sit-in on the House floor in 2016  with the iconic John Lewis, Democratic whip Katherine Clark, my  colleague from Connecticut   John Larson, and we did sit in the well  here.   The Speaker Emerita was right. We didn't tell the leadership because  they would have said no, but we were convinced that we had to do it and  to be here. That was to protest inaction on gun violence. David, like  John Lewis, is not afraid to get into good trouble when fighting for  what is right.   He responded to the ongoing epidemic of gun violence in this country  by authoring the assault weapons ban when I was there when people told  him not to do it. They said, don't do it. He said, I am going to do it.  And that passed in the House last July. Not an easy vote for some, but  he knew that it was the right thing to do and he fought like hell to  make it happen.   Tireless champion in the fight for justice and equality. He fought to  enact the Equality Act, the conscious of the House on this issue. He  led the bipartisan passage for the Respect For Marriage Act, federally  recognizing same sex and interracial marriage, which President Biden  signed into law last August, a monumental achievement in advancing  civil rights.   He has been there next to me when we have fought together on so many  issues for women and families--protecting the right to choose, push for  pay equity, passing the Paycheck Fairness Act, passing the child tax  credit, a passionate and eloquent voice standing up for middle-class  and working families across the board, and a dedicated ally to do the  work and be there with you in the trenches.   David Cicilline is not  afraid to be in the trenches.     David Cicilline may be leaving the House of Representatives, but  his work continues, his legacy continues. I am so sad really to see him  go. I am proud that he will now have an opportunity to build, to expand  on so many of the issues and work that he did here in the Congress and  further improve the lives of all Rhode Islanders.   I know he will continue to be a fearless advocate for the people of  Rhode Island and for the causes he believes in and the causes he  believes are right.     David Cicilline knows why he became a Member of the Congress. He  understands the power of this institution;  [[Page H2543]]  its ability to transform people's lives. He didn't come like some these  days to dismantle the institution, but to push the edge of that  envelope which could help to make a difference for the people in this  country.   Mr. Speaker, we will miss him. What an honor it has been for me to  serve with him and, more importantly, what a pleasure it has been for  me to call him my friend and my brother.   Next time I am in Providence, and I hope that will be soon, we can  get a drink at Clementine Cocktail Bar and plan some good trouble  together. May God bless him, my dear and wonderful friend. Without a  doubt, I will miss him.
