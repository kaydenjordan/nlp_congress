 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Florida for  yielding.   Madam Speaker, we stand on the doorstep of delivering pro-life  protections for unborn babies. Today the Supreme Court heard oral  arguments in the Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization. The case  will decide the constitutionality of a Mississippi law that supports  life by banning abortion that takes place more than 15 weeks after  conception.   It is my hope that the Supreme Court will uphold the  constitutionality of this law, which will set the stage for Roe v. Wade  to be overturned, ushering in a new era where life is valued and  protected.   Nothing is more important than life. If we are not going to stand and  protect life, we will stand and protect nothing. If my time in Congress  is remembered for one thing, let it be that I fought to defend the  sanctity of life. That is why I wear these precious feet on my collar-- the exact size and shape of a baby's feet 10 weeks after conception.   Madam Speaker, I will always support life.
