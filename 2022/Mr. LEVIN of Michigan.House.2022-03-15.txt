 Madam Speaker, today, I rise to recognize  Abortion Provider Appreciation Day.   In March of 1993, Dr. David Gunn was killed outside his abortion  clinic by a white supremacist, anti-abortion extremist. To honor his  legacy, this day was established.   Last week, his children, David, Jr., and Wendy, joined a deeply  moving press conference to celebrate the essential, compassionate,  necessary healthcare providers deliver courageously, despite pressures,  restrictions, political interference, and violent threats to their  personal safety.   I want to recognize two incredible abortion providers and tireless  advocates in my district, Renee Chelian, the founder of Northland  Family Planning, and her daughter Lara, and the work these women do in  our communities to make reproductive healthcare accessible to all.   I urge my colleagues to join in this important affirmation of  Congress' commitment to abortion providers.                            ____________________
