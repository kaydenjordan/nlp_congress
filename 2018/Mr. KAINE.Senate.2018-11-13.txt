 Mr. President. Today, I am pleased to join my colleague  from Utah, Senator Orrin Hatch, to introduce the Fair Housing  Improvement Act of 2018. This legislation would advance our nation in  its long pursuit of achieving equal protection under the law and  protecting all Americans from discrimination. This bill would prohibit  housing discrimination based on source of income or veterans status and  give millions and families and veterans greater access to affordable  housing and economic mobility.   Many of you know I'm a former civil rights attorney. My practice  focused on fair housing and I witnessed the pain experienced by  families who were discriminated against as they searched for a home.  Today, veterans who are good tenants with supportive housing vouchers  can be turned down for an apartment or lease renewal because of how  they pay their rent. Housing decisions should be based on your merits,  not harmful stereotypes about those who receive housing assistance. If  you pass a screening and background check, you shouldn't be denied a  place to live because of your service record or how your rent will be  paid. Unfortunately, this happens in America every day and it is wrong.   This legislation has support from organizations focused on affordable  housing and helping those who have served find a place to live,  including National Fair Housing Alliance, National Housing Law Project,  National Low Income Housing Coalition, Paralyzed Veterans of America,  and Veterans Association of Real Estate Professionals. Many of my  colleagues in this chamber strongly support the housing vouchers that  help 2.2 million veterans and low-income households live in decent,  stable private market housing. I've said previously that your home is  critical to your identity and central to the life of every American. I  want to share a story about two of my constituents that illustrates the  need for this bill.   Rudolph Nanez is a Navy veteran who lives in Virginia Beach with his  wife, Jessica Youness. Rudolph moved to the United States from Spain as  a teenager and earned a high school diploma. He joined the Navy and  served three years on active duty, followed by several years in the  reserves. Three years ago, Rudolph and Jessica faced a housing crisis  and feared they would have to live on the street after temporarily  relocating to a hotel. Fortunately, with the assistance of local  Virginia nonprofits, they were able to find a home.   In September, Rudolph's wife Jessica contacted my office after they  received an abrupt notice that their lease would not be renewed and  they had to leave their home within 10 days, despite paying a portion  of their rent regularly through a supportive housing voucher for  veterans, known as HUD-VASH. Jessica was frustrated because, as she  said, it takes time to find an apartment that will accept these  vouchers. She couldn't understand why, after calling multiple apartment  management companies to find an available unit, she then had to explain  to the company representative what a supportive housing voucher was.   Rudolph and Jessica each have a disability and rely on public  transportation. It was challenging to find housing near a bus stop and  they needed time to save for a deposit on a new home. My office was  able to work with the property manager to get Rudolph and Jessica's  lease extended through next June.   This story had a happy ending. But it didn't have to come to this  point. More than a dozen states and over 70 local jurisdictions have  enacted laws to prohibit source of income discrimination in housing,  and it's time Congress did the same.                                  ______                                         By Mr. REED (for himself, Mr. Perdue, Ms. Heitkamp, Mr. Tillis,          Mr. Jones, and Mr. Kennedy):   S. 3614. A bill to amend the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 to  require proxy advisory firms to register as investment advisers under  that Act, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing,  and Urban Affairs.
