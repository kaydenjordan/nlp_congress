 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that  privileges of the floor be granted to my fellows for the rest of the  year: Abbie Lyons, Aaron Stuvland, Doson Nguyen, and Robert Bruce.    Mr. President, I am pleased that we are at this point  in the Senate calendar when we are talking about legislation on the  floor. We have S. 870, which is the Fire Grants and Safety Act. I am a  sponsor, a proud cosponsor of this measure.   My State of Alaska routinely faces severe fire seasons every year. As  cochair of the Senate Fire Caucus, I follow these issues very  carefully. Whether they are wildland fires or fires in our urban  centers, I believe we have a bill in front of us, a measure in front of  us, that deserves all of our support.   The Fire Grants and Safety Act is a pretty simple bill. It is not  very often that we actually have things that are simple and short, and  this one is just a few pages long. It reauthorizes the U.S. Fire  Administration, the Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program, as well  as the Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response Grant Program.  That is the SAFER Program. It reauthorizes all of these through 2030,  instead of allowing them to expire next year. The Fire Administration's  authorization is increased slightly, but the rest are basically  straight extensions here.   As I mentioned, it is a pretty simple bill, but I think it is  important to appreciate and understand the importance because sometimes  I think these programs are underappreciated. They help our local fire  departments recruit personnel--pretty important, we have got to get  those firefighters to us--but not only to recruit them but to retain  them as well. It also helps allow them to purchase updated vehicles and  equipment.   We also help our fire stations by providing for safety and rescue  training as well as health screenings.   The Fire Grants and Safety Act is also a very timely measure and not  just because we are looking at these programs nearing their expiration  date, but our U.S. Fire Administrator has reminded us that ``America is  still burning.'' That is the quote. Last year, fires destroyed over 1  million structures and over 7.5 million acres of land across the  country.   Again, in the State of Alaska, it is not unusual that we have 1  million-plus acres burn each season, and in many seasons, well more  than a million.   But in addition to dealing with the impact to the land and to  structures that are on them, it is a safety issue that comes with  fighting fires. Approximately, 2,500 people, including 96 firefighters,  have died because of these fires. Again, as we are seeing wildfires  become larger and more catastrophic, the danger that it presents from a  health-safety perspective but also the devastation and impact to the  land becomes that much greater.   In our State in Alaska, our geography and really our lack of core  infrastructure oftentimes makes it harder to respond, sometimes really  not possible at all. But you have got wildfires  [[Page S1218]]  that can start hundreds of miles from a road system. It is difficult to  deal with. But then you have house fires in one village off where road  travel--there is no connection between the two villages and an  inability to help address a local fire, as we have seen, unfortunately,  on far too many occasions.   Just last month, the Kennicott McCarthy Volunteer Fire Department  received $77,950. It doesn't sound like a lot in terms of dollars that  we talk about here on this floor, but it was $77,000-plus to support  recruitment and retention of firefighters. They were able to utilize  FEMA's SAFER Grant Program. Again, this is a program that is going to  sunset this year. But let me put the Kennicott McCarthy Volunteer Fire  Department into context. This fire department is over 300 miles from  Anchorage, the large city there. That is about a 7-hour drive in good  weather. And I would challenge people--most times getting into  McCarthy, it doesn't make any difference what the weather is, the road  is tough enough that it is going to take you well more than 7  hours. There are about 42 people who live in the McCarthy-Kennicott  area year-round, but in the summertime, you have got a growth in  population when tourists come into the area and when folks who have  cabins and properties like to spend the summers out there. So it can  grow to over 1,000, 1,200 people in the summer. It serves as the  gateway to the Wrangell-St. Elias National Park. So it is an important  tourist destination for us.    This little town hosted over 65,000 visitors last year. So it kind of  causes you to ask the question: How can a town of 42 year-round  residents support this influx of outside traffic without the assistance  of the Federal Government here? That is exactly what these SAFER grants  have allowed them to do. So believe me. That $77,000 is going to go a  long way for that volunteer fire department in Kennicott-McCarthy.   I mentioned that we face unique challenges in Alaska, but I would  wager to say that every Member of this Chamber or one of your family  members or your friends or your neighbors--every one of us has  benefited from the emergency services that are provided by our local  fire departments. So, as they have helped us, it is our turn to be  helping them.   I am hopeful that we will be able to move through this process. It  was good to have a vote on an amendment this afternoon. We will have  the opportunity for more tomorrow and, hopefully, be able to wrap this  bill up soon, this week.   But I do hope that this measure will garner the same level of  bipartisan support as its predecessors. Back in 2017, we passed a fire  grant reauthorization by unanimous consent. I think that that reflects  how every State recognizes the benefit from this act, and I think that  this year's effort should, really, be no different.   The Fire Grants and Safety Act has garnered widespread support. We  have got organizations and groups, like the International Association  of Fire Chiefs, the National Volunteer Fire Council, the Congressional  Fire Services Institute, the National Fallen Firefighters Foundation,  the International Society of Fire Service Instructors, as well as the  International Association of Fire Fighters. So we have great, great  support from these very important organizations.   One of my friends and a real leader in Alaska is the president of the  Alaska Professional Fire Fighters Association, Dominic Lozano. He has  shared his endorsement of this measure.   He explains and says:         Over the last few years, Alaska has faced record fire       seasons across the state, making our firefighters, rescuers,       and emergency medical workers as vital as ever. And whether       the fires take place in urban or rural Alaska, our rugged       terrain and harsh climate can make emergency response far       more difficult. This bill will assist Alaska Fire Departments       with hiring new firefighters to attain proper staffing levels       as well as provide valuable equipment to agencies across the       state.    I really appreciate Dominic's support for this measure.   I will tell you that I think we know that our firefighters have an  extraordinarily difficult job, a dangerous job, a job that tasks them  every day. I had an opportunity to participate in a VIP day, where we  all donned the turnout suits and had the hats and had the opportunity  to see how the ``jaws of life'' actually work.   We had the opportunity to go into a training facility that was built  out to be a burning apartment building and to haul the hose from the  truck, up the stairs, and into a burning room to put out the fire. I  can tell you that those who went in to literally take the heat got a  very, very, very small, small glimpse of what our firefighters go  through every day.   I thank all of our firefighters. I thank our Alaska firefighters and  all of those around the country for the tremendous and selfless work  that they do in putting themselves in harm's way to protect our lives,  our lands, and our communities. I am certainly committed to making sure  that they have the resources to get home safely every single day.   I appreciate the leadership from Senator Peters, Senator Collins, and  Senator Carper that they have put into this Fire Grants and Safety Act.  Again, I am glad to cosponsor it with them and am glad to be able to  give some short comments in support.   Our firefighters deserve this bill, and our communities need this  bill. That should be enough for all of us to support it.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
