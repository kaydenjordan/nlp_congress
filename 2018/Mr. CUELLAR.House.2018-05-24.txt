 Mr. Chairman, I thank Chairman Thornberry and Ranking  Member Mr. Smith, and I rise in support of this legislation, and in  particular, in support of amendment No. 202 offered by myself and Mr.  Castro and Mr. Doggett.   This amendment requires the Air Force to conduct a core sampling  study at Lackland Air Force Base to determine potential hazardous  substances along the route of a wastewater pipeline replacement  project.   Project negotiations are being held up because the proposed route  transects two very old landfills whose contents are unknown. Soil  sampling to identify potential contaminants along the construction site  will allow this project to move forward.   Replacing this crumbling pipeline is critical to avoid continual  wastewater spills, which impact the environmental health and well-being  of both the military base and the residents of San Antonio.   I urge all of my colleagues to support this amendment, the  legislation, this en bloc amendment to bring wastewater services to  over 500,000 residents in San Antonio, a rapidly growing southwest  community.
