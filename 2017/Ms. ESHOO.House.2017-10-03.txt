 Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to H.R.  36, the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act.   H.R. 36 would prohibit the performance or attempted performance of an  abortion after 20 weeks, and harshly punishes physicians who violate  the law. This bill has narrow exemptions for the life of a mother (rape  and incest) but there are no exemptions in the bill for conditions  where the fetus has conditions or diagnoses that are incompatible with  life.   We have spent the entirety of this Congress defending women's  reproductive rights and fighting against plans that would eliminate  funding and access to the health care providers of a woman's choosing.  This bill is yet another attack on a woman's right to decide what is  best for her and her body. A woman, not a politician, must be able to  make health decisions that are best for her own circumstances.   H.R. 36 ignores that every pregnancy is different and compromises a  woman's right to the health care she is legally entitled to. It  punishes women who are already in difficult situations. The Supreme  Court has repeatedly ruled that neither a state nor the federal  government can ban safe and legal abortion services pre-viability.   I support a woman's legal right to opt for or against an abortion.  The decision is private. It's a matter of faith and it's a matter of  conscience, and our Constitution recognizes this.   What I do not support is a bill that takes away a woman's  Constitutional right. The Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act is a  shameful attempt to impose a radical political agenda on women. It  strips away their individual liberties and puts their health at serious  risk. This bill is wrong, this bill is dangerous, and this House should  reject it.
