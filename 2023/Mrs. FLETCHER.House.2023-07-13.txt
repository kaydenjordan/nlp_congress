 Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment and  to the amendments that this body has debated here today and what they  have done to this traditionally bipartisan process, and, more  importantly, what they do to the members of our armed services,  especially our women in uniform.   In 2021, women made up more than 17 percent of our Active-Duty force,  231,000 members, and 21 percent of our National Guard and Reserves.  More than 23,000 of them are stationed in Texas.   Every day, the women of the United States military fight for our  freedom, yet, today, House Republicans are asking these women to fight  for your freedom while they just voted to take away theirs.
