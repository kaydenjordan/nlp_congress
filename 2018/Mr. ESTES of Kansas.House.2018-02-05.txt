 Mr. Speaker, many Americans who are charged with  managing Social Security benefits for their elderly parents or for  their children struggle to make the system work. I have heard stories  from my communities in Kansas of the burdensome process that can be  involved with the representative payee program.   That is why I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4547, the  Strengthening Protections for Social Security Beneficiaries Act of  2018. This important bipartisan piece of legislation reduces the  burdens on families by eliminating the requirement to file an annual  payee accounting form for spouses and for parents who live with their  children.   In addition, the bill protects the most vulnerable beneficiaries  through improved information sharing between the Social Security  Administration and their respective States' adult protective services,  such as KDADS in Kansas.   This will help identify whether a beneficiary is in foster care,  reassess whether the payee is appropriate, and ensure the beneficiaries  are provided for. The Social Security Administration has a great  responsibility to ensure that Americans who need help managing their  Social Security benefits get that help.   I would like to thank Chairman Johnson and Ranking Member Larson for  putting this bill together that will strengthen the representative  payee program so that it better protects beneficiaries and reduces  burdensome government paperwork that rarely provides any real value to  families. Too many Americans are counting on the Social Security  Administration to get this right.   Mr. SAM JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I have no other speakers. I  reserve the balance of my time.
