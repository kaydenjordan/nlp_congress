 Madam Speaker, I rise today to voice my opposition to the  reckless spending plan being pushed through this Congress. This so- called COVID relief bill is nothing more than a liberal wish list of  special-interest pork completely unrelated to COVID relief.   With more than $1 trillion of previous COVID relief funds remaining  unspent, it would be irresponsible to rush through a massive, partisan  spending bill that does nothing to help the American workers or get our  kids physically back into school. Our priorities should be reopening  our economy, getting students physically back in school, and spending  more for our vaccine distribution.   COVID relief should be temporary, targeted and tied to COVID. But  this plan does nothing of the sort.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, what an honor to get to speak before you. This  is a thrill.   I rise today to honor several hometown heroes from my district who  have made an impact on the community over the course of the year.   First, I would like to thank my colleague from Florida, Congresswoman  Kat Cammack, for organizing this Special Order hour.   I also reached out to my community, and I asked for the leaders in  our community to give us some of what they think to be hometown heroes.  Let me just run through a few real quick.   Last year has been tough on millions of Americans across the country  as we battle the COVID pandemic and endure countless hardships, but I  am proud of so many folks in south Alabama who have made our community  a better place. Many of them are unsung heroes. I would like to take a  moment today to honor a few of them.   Brian Copes, manufacturing instructor for the city of Chickasaw  School System, is a leader in the effort of developing inexpensive  prosthetic limbs that will change many lives of amputees throughout  Latin America.   Students from all disciplines have been working together to create a  real nonprofit business. Eventually, these students will travel to  Latin America, not only to fit the amputees but also to aid the  amputees in rehabilitation as they learn to walk and use their new  limbs.   Another one is Natalie Fox, assistant administrator and chief nursing  officer for USA Physicians Group. That ``USA'' stands for University of  South Alabama, which we are very proud of. And USA Healthcare has been  a leading coordinator in the University of South Alabama Healthcare  System community testing and vaccination sites for the Mobile region.   To date, she has overseen the successful implementation of over  26,000 COVID-19 vaccines administered since December 15, and over  50,000 coronavirus tests performed since the pandemic began. Natalie  has worked tirelessly to meet the high demands on the healthcare system  for the past year, and I am incredibly thankful for her hard work and  her dedication to the people of south Alabama.   Jennifer Myrick of Fairhope, Alabama, has been a critical figure in  the recovery efforts after Hurricanes Sally and Zeta, which hit the  area. Jennifer worked through the Fairhope United Methodist Church to  set up an independent point of distribution to hand out critical  supplies to the public.   She has also headed up a feeding program for those supplies and is an  active member of the Voluntary Organizations Active in Disaster through  Baldwin County Emergency Management, where she helped fulfill many  needs throughout the county.   Jennifer also worked with the Fairhope Police Department to keep  police officers, dispatchers, and correction officers fed through this  long stretch between both of these hurricanes.   Kathy Couey, a recreation supervisor for the city of Chickasaw,  Alabama, goes above and beyond her duties every day in her day-to-day  responsibilities to make sure the city is a better and healthier place  for families to live. Her creativity is limitless, with a true  servant's heart.    With so many people working and learning from home over the past  year, staying active and getting outdoors has been critical to people's  physical and mental health. Kathy's hard work has made Chickasaw a  better place to live and raise a family.   Virtually no person across the country has not been impacted in some  way by the pandemic, natural disasters, and the countless other  challenges that we have faced. We have come a long way. Although we are  living in difficult times, I could not be prouder than I am to be an  American today.   And I couldn't be more thankful for so many incredible people all  over my district and all over the Nation who have worked hard each day,  not for fame, not for recognition or for money, but for the betterment  of their friends and neighbors. This is what makes America strong.
