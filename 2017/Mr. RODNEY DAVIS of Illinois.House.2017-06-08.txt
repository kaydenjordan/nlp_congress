 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule  I, I demand a vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the  Journal.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on  the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order  that a quorum is not present.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor an  American hero, Air Force Captain Joe Smith, as he makes his final  flight home.   Though it has been nearly half a century since the 25-year-old  fighter pilot was fatally shot down during the Vietnam war, he will  finally be laid to rest in his hometown of Assumption, Illinois.   Thanks to the efforts of the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency, a  group which searches the world for missing American veterans, the  remains of Joe Smith were identified, along with his plane, by using  DNA analysis. The effort made to bring him home all these years later  is a true testament to the military's motto of no soldier left behind.   Those who knew Joe remember him as being a bright, polite young man,  who was well educated, earning his master's degree in business at the  University of Notre Dame and Washington University.   Though he did not have to, Joe went willingly into the service, where  he began as a first lieutenant and quickly worked his way up to the  promotion of being a captain.   With the help of the Assumption Historical Society, Joe's widow,  Elaine Mills, a native of Decatur, has worked hard to keep his memory  alive and honor his service to our Nation.   I hope to do the same by recognizing him today on this House floor.  Joe is a true hero. This country and this House will long remember his  valor.                            ____________________
