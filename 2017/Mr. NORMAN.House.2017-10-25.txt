 Mr. Chair, I rise today in overwhelming and adamant  support of H.R. 469, the Sunshine for Regulations and Regulatory  Decrees and Settlements Act, which will strengthen Article I powers for  Congress.   Let me begin by briefly quoting Article I, Section 8 of our  Constitution, the Necessary and Proper Clause: ``The Congress shall  have the power . . . to make all laws which shall be necessary and  proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers . . . in the  government,'' meaning, Congress must continue to respect and reinforce  the idea of the separation of powers in our government, but, at the  same time, Congress can ultimately decide when, whether, and how to  legislate the powers and authority of another branch of government.                                time  1645    Mr. Chairman, this piece of legislation will go a long way in  fortifying the balance of powers and reestablishing Congress' authority  set forth by James Madison and our Founding Fathers and Article I of  the United States Constitution.   Furthermore, we must be sure to use our constitutional authority to  effectively guarantee and ensure that government is more efficient,  transparent, and accountable to all American citizens of our great  Nation, and this bill will do just that.   It is time for Congress to establish procedures for honest  regulations, transparency within the Treasury Department, and judicial  intervention in unconstitutional court cases.   Mr. Chairman, again, I rise in full support of H.R. 469, and I urge  all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle and in both Chambers to  make sure this is a government not only of the people, but for the  people.
