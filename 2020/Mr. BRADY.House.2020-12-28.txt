 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, last fall, Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Washington  Democrats refused to accept a bipartisan COVID relief bill, insisting  instead on more than $3 trillion of absurd policies, from marijuana  banking to early release of criminals. Months ago, they even rejected a  nearly $2 trillion COVID relief proposal by President Trump. Many  Americans knew right then that leading Democrats were sabotaging the  economy ahead of the election for political gain.   During those crucial months, while Speaker Pelosi stalled COVID  relief, thousands of Americans died, tens of thousands of small  businesses closed, and hospitals and nursing homes struggled, while  millions of Americans were left jobless.   In the election, Democrats and Congress paid a steep price for this  cruel inaction, with voters giving House Republicans nearly two-thirds  of the seats needed to take back the majority.   I thank President Trump for signing bipartisan legislation, even with  its flaws, that included several separate bills that hitched a ride on  the annual funding bill for the government, including COVID relief, a  first-ever ban on surprise medical bills, and $328 billion in urgent  tax relief for families and local businesses.   Madam Speaker, I recognize that today's CASH Act will pass with  bipartisan support, Republicans and Democrats alike, and I respect the  decision of each Member of Congress. But for me, I worry that this  whopping $463 billion won't do what is needed: stimulate the economy or  get the jobless back to work.   At this point in the recovery, the fact is, it is hard to stimulate a  Main Street that is locked down by local politicians.   This won't help local restaurants get their workers permanently back  or hospitality and convention industries rehire their workers for the  long term, and it won't help get energy workers back on the job.   Will this stimulate our local economies? Not a lot.   What we know is that much of this extra $1,600 will go to pay down  credit card debt or savings or even make new purchases online at  Walmart, Best Buy, or Amazon.   So, rather than merely sending checks to credit card companies, this  half-trillion dollars could more than double the number of small  businesses and midsize businesses getting PPP forgivable loans to hire  their workers and stay alive through the recovery. It could make sure  airline workers have secure jobs for more than just a few months and do  more to replenish frontline healthcare workers.    Madam Speaker, we should be focused on the families that are hurting  most, none more than the 8 million Americans who lost their jobs due to  COVID. Our top priority, in addition to defeating the virus, is to get  them back to work. So far, Congress has already approved more than  $20,800 directly to a family of four with one parent out of  [[Page H9155]]  work. That is on top of their State unemployment benefits.   Madam Speaker, if we want to do even more for the jobless, this same  huge amount of money today could give every unemployed worker from  COVID and their employer a $50,000 incentive to return to work. With  this huge amount of money, you could even give the bottom 90 percent of  workers in America an income-tax-free year for 2021, a full year where  you go to work each day for yourself rather than for Washington.   Can you imagine what a no-tax 2021 would do for low-and middle-income  families, workers, and the local economy?   Or we can simply hold this money back, not hastily spend another  half-trillion dollars we don't have, while we assess the impact  vaccinations are having on consumer confidence and the unlocking of the  economy.   Madam Speaker, there are a lot of ways to spend money, if that is the  goal. But in my view, let's be smart about it. Let's target assistance  to those who need it most. The Committee on Ways and Means should be  the place to explore and analyze these options, not just have a bill  that spends over $400 billion hastily dropped on us at the last minute.   I know, working together, Republicans and Democrats, we can do better  to help people get back to work and truly help this recovery.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Oregon (Mr. Schrader).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Wisconsin (Mr. Grothman).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. McClintock).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I would point out to my colleague that nothing in this  bill helps anyone get back to work: not a dime to the 8 million people  who are left unemployed because of COVID, not a dime to help our small  and medium-sized businesses, not a dime for Main Street.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, you can say a lot about this Congress, but you cannot  say we have not worked together and appropriated remarkable funding to  help families defeat this COVID, to get back on their feet, and to save  small businesses.   A good example is that, so far, Congress, both parties, has already  approved more than $20,800 in direct cash payments to a family of four  with one parent out of work. That is on top of an estimated $18,000 of  State unemployment benefits, a little less than $40,000 to help working  families survive this COVID pandemic.   But, today, we do nothing in this bill to help 8 million Americans  who lost their jobs due to COVID. We could double the amount of money  that goes to small businesses or midsize businesses so they can rehire  the workers and keep them on the payroll to try to survive and ride  this out. We don't know yet what the vaccinations will do to consumer  confidence or to the lockdowns.   Again, I expect a number of Republicans to support this bill. In my  view, we would be wiser to assess the impact of the vaccinations in the  recovery going forward so that we can target relief to Main Street, to  helping get people back to work, and to truly stimulating our local  economy. That is where we address the harm that has been done by COVID.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, may I inquire how much time is remaining.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, first, let me congratulate the chairman of the Ways  and Means Committee, Mr. Neal, for working so closely together on our  bipartisan priorities.   Ending surprise medical bills when you go to the ER or you have a  scheduled medical procedure, ensuring, starting at the end of the next  year, for the first time, when you go to that doctor's procedure, you  will have a true and honest bill in advance of that. It will be so  crucial for so many patients.   Madam Speaker, I also thank the chairman for working so closely in a  bipartisan way on the COVID tax relief provisions in the first reforms  of our temporary tax provisions in 5 years. I applaud Chairman Neal for  his work, and I have enjoyed working with him.   The previous speaker talked about essential workers, our  firefighters, our healthcare workers, others who have done such an  amazing job. We had an opportunity earlier this year to help them.  President Trump, in his executive order, proposed a payroll tax holiday  for nearly 5 months for these workers. That would have meant, for those  essential workers, that firefighter, that hospital worker, that nurse,  that a family of four would have kept an extra $5,000 in their paycheck  throughout the holidays.   If we really wanted to help essential workers, our Democrat friends  would not have blocked that payroll tax holiday and would have adopted  our bill to make sure that those payroll taxes were forgiven.                                time  1645    As for State and local governments, they, too--even though I disagree  with many of the decisions--deserve our thanks. And, thankfully,  because this was the most rapid labor market recovery following a  crisis in history and we recovered more than half the jobs we have  lost, State and local revenues this year are almost even, down a mere  less than 1 percent.   Thank goodness Congress came together in the CARES Act to provide  more than $150 billion to those State  [[Page H9160]]  and local governments to be able to address these needs and continue to  function.   I will tell you, too, that--again, I speak only for myself--the best  way to help struggling families is to get them back to work. The best  way to save our Main Street is to give our small and medium-sized  businesses more help than we have. This bill does neither.   I don't believe--I think it is correct when the earlier speaker said  this is not a stimulus; it is not. And it does nothing to help get  people back to work.   I worry that, as we spend another nearly half a trillion dollars so  hastily, we are not targeting this help to the very Americans who are  struggling the most and need that help.   I will also point out that, as I said earlier, Congress has come  together to provide a family of four with one unemployed parent, now,  just a little short of $40,000 of Federal money in their traditional  State unemployment because we knew they were struggling. Now is the  time to get them back to work. That is my personal objection to this  bill.   I urge Congress to pause for a moment to assess the vaccinations over  the next few months or year to determine where next we need to weigh  in, if at all, on this recovery as we continue to work together to  defeat this virus.   Madam Speaker, I am honored to be here today, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I demand the yeas and nays.
