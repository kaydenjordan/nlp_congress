 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, it is August, and the Senate is in  session getting the people's work done. As the majority leader said  last week, the reason we can't afford to take this time off is because  we have so much to do.   Of course, one of the things we could do is agree to an expedited  confirmation of noncontroversial nominations--something our Democratic  friends have not been willing to do to this point. Indeed, they engaged  in unprecedented obstruction of some of President Trump's nominees,  even those who are not controversial. For example, we just confirmed  two Federal appellate court judges in a strong bipartisan manner last  week. These, of course, were both highly distinguished lawyers, and I  am sure they will do a great job on the Fourth Circuit. When we see  nominations get overwhelmingly bipartisan votes, we wonder why we had  to delay these nominations not only for the judiciary but also other  important nominations, such as at the State Department and in other  areas. Frankly, because of the delay, the vacancies impair the ability  of government to be responsive to the needs of the American people. It  is a shame we have seen that kind of mindless obstruction to President  Trump's nominees who, again, are not even controversial.    While we focus sometimes on how divided we are--and I know the  American people sometimes feel like we are unwilling to find common  ground--it is not true that we don't occasionally come together and do  important things. This week marks the continued collaboration between  Republicans and Democrats that started last week when we agreed to  address two important  [[Page S5710]]  funding bills. One is for the Department of Defense, which is my  personal priority, and I know the Presiding Officer would agree with  that. The other involves Labor, Health and Human Services, and  Education, which I will mention in just a moment.   Working together to do both of these appropriations bills is  something the New York Times described as a bipartisan breakthrough  because, in the past, we lurched from continuing resolution to Omnibus  appropriations bills, much to the frustration of not only our  constituents but many of us in the Senate.   We have seen continuing resolutions underfund our national security,  for example. We have seen gargantuan Omnibus appropriations bills that  basically four Members of Congress negotiate and then present to the  rest of us as a fait accompli, which is obviously a terrible way to  spend the people's money, but I believe we are doing something good  here this week.   These appropriations bills are the two largest of all the  appropriations bills. After we pass them this week, we will have passed  9 of the 12 appropriations bills, which fund 87 percent of  discretionary spending. Doing this with more than a month before the  end of the fiscal year is something we haven't done in a long time. We  are ahead of the House, which usually moves at a fast clip--although,  we are here working, and the House is taking a little time off, I might  add.   I offer my appreciation to Chairman Shelby, chairman of the  Appropriations Committee, and Ranking Member Vice Chairman Leahy, whom  I was just talking to. He was telling me about how pretty the weather  is in Vermont and how much he would like to be there instead of here,  perhaps, after we finish this bill. I told him if he helped us work on  some of this backlog of nominations, maybe that was something we could  discuss.   I would like to congratulate both Chairman Shelby and Vice Chairman  Leahy for their good work, on a bipartisan basis, facilitating a smooth  process so far. As I said, there have been seven of them, and the  chairman managed to mark up each prior to the Fourth of July State work  period. They have done a good job of managing the bills on the floor  and avoiding a quagmire--which, if encountered, would only kill the  process.   I would like to highlight a few of the aspects of each appropriations  bill we will be working on this week. In the Defense bill, we will be  including a provision requiring the Department of Defense to issue two  reports to Congress on the implementation of a bill called Fix NICS. To  refresh everybody's memory, this was a piece of legislation we passed  with broad bipartisan support that went to the President. I introduced  it in light of the shooting last fall in Sutherland Springs, TX, that  killed 26 people and wounded about 20 more. The gunman in that case had  been in the Air Force and was discharged, but his criminal convictions  while he served in the Air Force were not uploaded into the relevant  FBI databases. That is how he got his hands on a gun that he was  already legally prohibited from purchasing or possessing and committed  this mayhem and inflicted this misery.   That is why this report from the Department of Defense is so  important. Hopefully, they have remedied this failure to upload  derogatory and disqualifying information for people who cannot legally  purchase or possess firearms. We want to make sure--in light of this  legislative change--that the right changes are being implemented and  that lives will be saved as a consequence.   The Defense bill will also greatly benefit the Nation by providing  additional funding for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighters and the V-22  Osprey aircraft, which are both made in Texas. This is important not  only to make sure our warfighters have the most advanced airframes and  aircraft available but also to make sure the jobs that go along with it  are secured as well.   The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter is the latest and greatest warplane in  the American arsenal, and we have put, literally, all of our eggs in  that basket. As the saying goes, when you put all your eggs in one  basket, you better take care of that basket. We need to make sure these  Joint Strike Fighters are being produced in a responsible sort of way  and that both of these aircraft are being provided so our warfighters  can have the very best equipment they need in order to do the job we  asked them to do.   This bill also provides $30 billion for local school districts that  provide education to military children. Sometimes this is called impact  aid because our military bases aren't taxed by local school districts  when they are then called upon to provide education to the children of  Active-Duty military or military dependents. It is important the  Federal Government make sure they have the financial resources they  need in order to make that happen. Indeed, $30 million in impact aid  will be provided for local school districts.   Finally, this includes a 2.6-percent increase in military pay and  increases Active-Duty troop levels by more than 7,000. Both of those  are really important. Obviously, in an all-volunteer military, it is  important that we compensate our servicemembers appropriately. This  isn't about the money for them, but we have to make sure they can  provide for their families while they serve our Nation and help keep us  safe.   In terms of troop levels, it is important the troop levels match the  commitments we have made around the world to help stabilize unstable  regions and to provide safety not only for ourselves but for our  friends and allies around the world. Unfortunately, because of  extensive and lengthy commitments we made with a small force, our  Active-Duty servicemembers are likely to be deployed over and over  again, with a lot of stress not only on their families but on the force  effectiveness in general. Both of these are very important--a 2.6- percent increase in pay for Active-Duty military and increasing troop  levels by about 7,000.   In the second bill we will be passing, in addition to the Defense  appropriations bill, this will fund the Department of Labor, Health and  Human Services, and provide more funds for biomedical facilities to  expand, remodel, and renovate their existing research capabilities that  will benefit a multitude of institutions. Those include the Texas  Biomedical Research Institute in San Antonio. We know that in the  healthcare field, nurses are always in short supply. This bill will  also benefit nursing programs, like the one at Texas Tech University,  which will assist veterans in making the transition from military life  to civilian life. Finally, in the education sphere, it will provide  more than $475 million for charter school programs.                        Nomination of Brett Kavanaugh    Madam President, at the same time, we are continuing our work on the  nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh, who will succeed Justice Anthony  Kennedy as Associate Justice on the U.S. Supreme Court. His hearing is  set for the first week of September--September 4. I hope we will move  quickly thereafter to vote on his confirmation.   I have perhaps benefited from my familiarity and my acquaintance with  Judge Kavanaugh, dating back to 2000. Many of our colleagues are just  now meeting him for the first time and becoming acquainted with his  outstanding record as a lawyer for the White House and as a judge.   Late last week, the Senate Judiciary Committee received another  production of documents on Judge Kavanaugh. This batch amounted to  about 64,000 pages. Just so everybody can keep count of all the  documents that are being produced as part of his confirmation hearing,  the committee now has more than 248,000 pages of executive branch  material related to the nominee. The reason I mention that number is  because it really dwarfs the previous record for Judge Gorsuch, which  was roughly 180,000 documents.   The committee was also handed a list of documents that were withheld  on grounds that they are personal records as opposed to government  records under the Presidential Records Act. Chairman Grassley has  appropriately--and I think wisely--asked the National Archives to  review those withheld documents and confirm this determination by  making their own determination as to whether they are responsive or  should be withheld. I think this speaks volumes to the transparency of  the process since day one.   I am particularly grateful to Chairman Grassley for his leadership,  as  [[Page S5711]]  well as for the efficiency and thoroughness the committee has so far  displayed in reviewing the documents. We worked hard to accommodate our  Democratic colleagues' requests all along the way. Let's not forget  that for nearly 2 weeks before issuing the committee's request to the  George W. Bush Presidential Library, Chairman Grassley attempted to  seek a good-faith agreement from the ranking member to jointly request  documents relating to Judge Kavanaugh's legal work at the White House.  These efforts at good-will collaboration, unfortunately, were to no  avail. The chairman received, instead, unprecedented counterproposals  designed to unnecessarily draw out the process.   Although the chairman is right to prioritize review of some of the  documents coming from President George W. Bush's administration, we all  know the best evidence of how Judge Kavanaugh will perform as a member  of the Supreme Court is how he has already performed as a judge during  the last 12 years on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals. He has written  more than 300 opinions during that time. Of course, his work as a judge  is the best lens for how he will evaluate real cases in the future. Our  friends on the other side used to agree with that.   Back during Justice Sotomayor's hearings, they made this identical  comment that her judicial record was far more important than any  comments or speeches she may have made outside of that context. Maybe  belatedly for them, we now agree with them that this is the best  evidence. It is just common sense.   In Judge Kavanaugh's case, reviewing his judicial record, I think  what the record reveals is, he is diligent and thoughtful in his  reasoning. His rulings are clear, impartial, and just.   In the recent questionnaire he returned to the Judiciary Committee-- which is a standard part of the vetting process. Nominees are sent a  questionnaire, and they respond and attach copies of speeches, law  review articles, and other things they have spoken on or written. Judge  Kavanaugh listed what he saw as his most significant cases. I want to  mention a couple of those. I think they are illustrative of the work he  has done not only on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals but the kind of  work he will do as a member of the Supreme Court and his standing in  the Federal Judiciary.   First is a case called Free Enterprise Fund. Judge Kavanaugh found  himself in dissent. In other words, he didn't join the majority  decision, finding that the structure of an independent agency in the  executive branch violated the Constitution. Interestingly, when the  case was appealed thereafter to the Supreme Court, a majority of the  Justices on the Court cited Judge Kavanaugh's dissent in reversing the  panel's decision on the District of Columbia Circuit Court. When the  Supreme Court agrees with a lower court judge and cites that author's  opinion, that is a pretty good sign that he or she deserves to be taken  seriously. In Judge Kavanaugh's case, it didn't just happen once.   Consider a second case, Bluman, which involved a Federal ban on  election contributions made by foreign nationals. Judge Kavanaugh  authored the majority opinion, which rejected the plaintiff's  challenge. When the Supreme Court took the case thereafter, it  unanimously agreed with Judge Kavanaugh. All nine members of the Court  sided with Judge Kavanaugh's position.   In a third case, Wesby, Judge Kavanaugh filed a dissenting opinion on  a question of qualified immunity afforded to law enforcement officers.  Even though Judge Kavanaugh's views did not win the day in the DC  Circuit, the Supreme Court took the case and reversed the panel  decision and embraced Judge Kavanaugh's position in the end. Once  again, it bears repeating that the decision was unanimous--9 to 0.  Judge Kavanaugh's view was vindicated.    These are just a few of the 307 opinions he authored while he was on  the DC Circuit, and, of course, there are many more. In the coming  weeks, I know the lawyers on the Judiciary Committee, as well as my  colleagues, will have a chance to thoroughly delve into each of them  and then ask the nominee probing questions about them when he testifies  before the committee during the first week of September.   For now, we will continue with the great paper chase, which includes  the largest production of documents ever in the Senate's consideration  of a Supreme Court nominee. Unfortunately, as I have said before, many  of our Democratic colleagues aren't likely to ever be satisfied with  the boxes upon boxes of written materials. It will never be enough. In  some cases, it is because they have already decided to vote no against  the nominee even before having met the nominee or having reviewed any  documents whatsoever.   Emblematic of this phenomenon is one of our colleagues on the Senate  Judiciary Committee who has threatened to sue to obtain even more  records. The problem for that Senator is, on the night Judge Kavanaugh  was nominated by President Trump, he said he had done enough due  diligence to have reached a conclusion on whether the nominee should be  confirmed and had said he would not vote for the nominee. Yet this is  the same Senator who is now saying we ought to file a suit to get more  documents. I think the American people are smart enough to figure out  what is going on. It is gamesmanship, plain and simple.   So my question is, If our colleagues have done enough due diligence  to make a decision to not support the nomination, why do they need more  paper? To what avail? Why should we extend this process that will cost  the taxpayers more money and create a lot of confusion when they have  already made their decision?   Despite these games, the truth is, Judge Kavanaugh is eminently  qualified and well respected by all who know him, and I look forward to  confirming him as Justice Kavanaugh early this fall, following the  Judiciary Committee's hearings during the first week of September.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    The following Senators are necessarily absent: the  Senator from Texas (Mr. Cruz), the Senator from Nevada (Mr. Heller),  the Senator from North Dakota (Mr. Hoeven), the Senator from  Mississippi (Mrs. Hyde-Smith), the Senator from Oklahoma (Mr. Inhofe),  the Senator from Utah (Mr. Lee), the Senator from Arizona (Mr. McCain),  the Senator from Kansas (Mr. Moran), the Senator from Idaho (Mr.   Risch), and the Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr. Toomey).   Further, if present and voting, the Senator from North Dakota (Mr.  Hoeven) would have voted ``yea''.    The following Senators are necessarily absent: the  Senator from Texas (Mr. Cruz), the Senator from Nevada (Mr. Heller),  the Senator from North Dakota (Mr. Hoeven), the Senator from  Mississippi (Mrs. Hyde-Smith), the Senator from Oklahoma (Mr. Inhofe),  the Senator from Utah (Mr. Lee), the Senator from Arizona (Mr. McCain),  the Senator from Kansas (Mr. Moran), the Senator from Idaho (Mr.  Risch), and the Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr. Toomey).   Further, if present and voting, the Senator from North Dakota (Mr.  Hoeven) would have voted ``yea.''   Mr. Durbin. I announce that the Senator from Colorado (Mr. Bennet),  the Senator from North Dakota (Ms. Heitkamp), the Senator from Oregon  (Mr. Merkley), the Senator from Washington (Mrs. Murray), and the  Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Schatz) are necesssarily absent.
