 Mr. Speaker, last month we commemorated Holocaust  Remembrance Day. It is important that we always take note because,  sadly, genocide and anti-Semitism continues to exist in the 21st  century. As the philosopher George Santayana once explained: Those who  do not learn history are doomed to repeat it.   Yes. An important episode in the history of the Holocaust is the  story of Aristides de Sousa Mendes, a Portuguese diplomat, who was the  consular general in Bordeaux, France, in the late 1930s, 1940, and  1941. As a Portuguese diplomat in Bordeaux, France, at the outset of  the Second World War, Sousa Mendes is credited with saving the lives of  tens of thousands of European Jews fleeing the Holocaust.   As a proud Portuguese American and the co-chair of the Congressional  Portuguese Caucus, I am glad that later this year we will be hosting a  screening of the film, ``Disobedience: The Sousa Mendes Story,'' in  partnership with the Sousa Mendes Foundation.                                time  1045    We must learn from our history so that the atrocities of the past are  never repeated in the future. We remember, and we pledge to never, ever  forget.   Speaking of atrocities, sadly, they do continue to exist around the  world. This week, we will have an opportunity, as Congress, to go on  record to discuss the challenges of the civil war going on in Yemen and  America's participation in that effort.   It is high time Congress reassert itself in terms of our checks and  balances. We have abdicated our role far too often in terms of  declaring what America's actions and interventions will be like around  the world. This week, we will have an opportunity to go on record on  the atrocities that are taking place in Yemen and, hopefully, be a  positive force for change.   In addition to our efforts this week, a looming deadline on February  15 is before us, and that is whether we will reach an agreement on  proposed border security and continue to fund this government to the  end of our fiscal year. It is wrong, and it is irresponsible to ever  shut down government.   In the 14 years that I have been a Member of Congress, I have never  voted to shut down government. It is not just the hundreds and  thousands of Federal employees who are at risk, who have home payments,  car payments, and other obligations, but all the other contractors and  people who do business with the Federal Government or who are  indirectly impacted.   We have held hearings throughout my district. I hope that before the  end of this week, we will reach a bipartisan agreement on border  security. I hope that we will continue to ensure that  [[Page H1532]]  government is not shut down and that we go about the business of  working on this year's budget, hopefully, reaching an agreement to  reduce the cost of prescription drugs; to reduce the cost of  healthcare; to protect people's insurance for preexisting conditions;  and maybe, just maybe, reach an agreement on a bipartisan  infrastructure package. That is the business at hand, and that is what  we ought to be focused on.               Congratulating University of California, Merced     Finally, on an upbeat note, Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  recognize the University of California at Merced in my district being  named one of the country's universities of the year by Education Dive,  which honors education's top innovators.   One of the newest research universities in the entire country, it is  a testament to UC Merced's forward-thinking approach, which has been  integral in increasing opportunity to improve the quality of education  for California's San Joaquin Valley and the entire system of the  University of California.   UC Merced prides itself in having the largest share of low-income,  first-generation, and underrepresented students among all the  University of California's campuses. It is the first minority-majority  campus in California, with over 8,000 students.   It has been a pleasure to watch the university grow over the last 13  years and an honor to meet its educators, students, and alumni who make  up a tight, close-knit community.   Go Bobcats.                            ____________________
