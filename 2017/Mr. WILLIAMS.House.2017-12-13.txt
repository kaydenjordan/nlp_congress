 Mr. Speaker, I am happy to come to the floor this  afternoon to support House Resolution 658, the combined rule providing  for consideration of H.R. 1638 and H.R. 4324.   H.R. 1638, the Iranian Leadership Asset Transparency Act, sponsored  by the gentleman from Maine (Mr. Poliquin), is commonsense legislation.  The bill would publicize assets associated with Iran's Government and  military leadership. It would require a report to Congress on the  assets that these leaders control, how they were acquired, and how each  and every one of these Iranian leaders uses them.   The American people, the American businesses, and the international  community deserve to know who controls money and assets in Iran.   I am also proud to be the sponsor of H.R. 4324, the Strengthening  Oversight of Iran's Access to Finance Act. My legislation would improve  congressional oversight of any financing that the Treasury authorizes  for aircraft sales to Iran.   Every 6 months, the Treasury would need to certify to us that finance  authorizations would not benefit an Iranian person who is transporting  items for the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, nor  providing transportation for sanctioned entities.                                time  1300    Treasury would also have to certify to us that these authorizations  don't pose a significant money laundering or terrorism finance risk to  the U.S. financial system.   If the Treasury Department cannot make this certification, the  Department must tell us why, and it must explain to Congress the course  of action it intends to take.   I urge all of my colleagues to support this rule, and I urge them to  support H.R. 1638 and H.R. 4324.    Mr. Speaker, it is truly a privilege to speak in  support of my bill, H.R. 4324, the Strengthening Oversight of Iran's  Access to Finance Act.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4324 will improve congressional oversight of any  financing that Treasury authorizes for aircraft sales to Iran.   Every 6 months, Treasury would need to certify to us that finance  authorizations would not benefit an Iranian person who is transporting  items for the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction nor  providing transportation for sanctioned entities. Treasury would also  have to certify to us that those authorizations don't pose a  significant money laundering or terrorism finance risk to the U.S.  financial system, and that any banks engaging in this business have  appropriate due diligence procedures in place. If the Treasury  Department cannot make this certification, the Department must tell us  why, and it must explain to Congress the course of action it intends to  take.   I note that my bill was reported out of the Financial Services  Committee last month by a vote of 38-21, with five of my Democratic  colleagues voting in its favor.                                time  1745    Many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will label this  bill as a simple attempt to dismantle the Obama administration's Iran  nuclear deal. We have already heard it.   Mr. Speaker, this debate is not about U.S. commitments under the  Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA. It is not about  reimposing nuclear sanctions. It is not about prohibiting these  aircraft sales or the financing of these sales.   What this legislation is about is providing Congress with information  on the implications of these deals so that we can better understand  their impact on the integrity of our financial system.   I would like to take a step back and discuss how we got to this point  and why this legislation is necessary. As most of you know, under the  JCPOA, the Obama administration committed the United States to license  the sale of commercial aircraft to Iran. In addition to providing  licenses for aircraft sales, the licenses also allowed for banks to  engage in the financing of these aircraft.   All of this was permitted, despite the fact that Iran remained  classified as a jurisdiction to primary money laundering concern by the  Treasury Department and as the world's foremost state sponsor of terror  by the State Department.   Let us be abundantly clear on the facts. It was the Obama Treasury  Department that highlighted the role that Iran and Iranian aircraft  played in the destabilizing activity across the Middle East and in  supporting the atrocities committed by the rogue Assad regime in Syria.   On September 9, 2012, David S. Cohen, the Treasury Undersecretary for  Terrorism and Financial Intelligence under President Obama, released  the following statement:   ``The identification of Iranian aircraft also further highlights  Iran's ongoing effort to support the Assad regime's weapons of mass  destruction programs and crackdown against the Syrian people.''   This quote followed the Treasury Department's announcement to impose  sanctions against entities that support the Assad regime in Syria.   So quoting from the same September 9, 2012, Treasury statement: ``As  a result of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act,  foreign financial institutions that knowingly engage in significant  transactions with . . . Iran Air, Mahan Air, or Yas Air, including any  of 117 aircraft operated by these airlines, risk losing access to the  U.S. banking system.''   Mr. Speaker, this week I received a memo from the National Iranian  American Council urging members to oppose my bill. This is the same  council that opposes President Trump's travel ban, which was recently  upheld by a Supreme Court decision of 7-2, and the same organization  that took concern with new sanctions imposed on Iran's support for  Hezbollah.   This memo and the pro-Iran principles that it represents could not be  a better endorsement for the Strengthening Oversight of Iran's Access  to Finance Act.   I would ask this to my colleagues on both sides: At what point did we  relegate ourselves to negotiating with those who wish us harm? At what  point did we prioritize the interest of a rogue government that paints  their bombs with sayings like ``Death to Israel'' and ``Death to  America''? When did that happen?  [[Page H9884]]    There are simply two sides to this issue. You can either protect the  interests of the United States, her citizens, and the U.S. financial  institutions, or you can make important the wishes of the Ayatollah and  his revolutionary guard.   Which side do you choose to be on? That is the question.   I represent the red, white, and blue.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.    My commitment to the safety and well-being of these  United States is unwavering.   I urge my colleagues to do the same: support the red, white, and  blue, and support H.R. 4324.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4324, the Strengthening Oversight of Iran's Access  to Finance Act, would impose a new and unilateral certification  requirement on the administration in order to meet current U.S.  obligations under the Iran nuclear deal known as the Joint  Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA, with respect to the sale and  financing of commercial passenger aircraft to Iran.   This certification requirement would call for the Treasury Secretary  to consider factors that fall well outside the scope of the nuclear  deal and beyond the specific conditions that the U.S. is allowed to  place on the license of commercial aircraft to Iran under the nuclear  accord.   By moving the goal posts on our commitments under the deal, H.R. 4324  clearly aims to force the United States into a violation of the  agreement. Under the Iran nuclear deal, the United States is broadly  committed to allow for the sale of commercial passenger aircraft and  related parts and services to Iran. This involves licensing the sale of  aircraft and related parts and services to Iran, including the  financing for such sales.   Under the JCPOA Annex II, the only condition on the U.S. commitment  is that licensed items and services must be used exclusively for  commercial passenger aviation. Moreover, the only allowable conditions  the U.S. can place on authorizations for the sale of commercial  passenger aircraft to Iran apply to the licensed aircraft themselves  and the use of such licensed aircraft, not on activities or services  provided that have no relationship to the licensed aircraft or related  goods or services.   Yet, H.R. 4324 would impose new conditions on the licensed sale of  aircraft to Iran, including, notably, the condition that the recipient  airline has not used nonlicensed aircraft for purposes other than  commercial passenger aviation. That is, under this bill, the  administration would have to certify that Iran is not engaged in  certain activity unrelated to Iran's nuclear conduct but also unrelated  to the use of the aircraft itself. If the Treasury Secretary is unable  to make such a difficult certification, the Secretary must then report  to Congress as to whether the Secretary intends to suspend, revoke,  amend, or approve, notwithstanding such noncertification, any license  facilitating the sale of commercial aircraft to Iran.    Supporters of the bill will likely note that the bill will not  require the Secretary of the Treasury to suspend or revoke an  authorization in the event that the Secretary is unable to make the  necessary certification, but the obvious political conclusion is that  the Secretary will be forced to revoke such license if the Secretary is  unwilling to make the certification.   As we have now seen, the President detests the fact that his  administration has to take affirmative steps to keep the deal in place,  and he refused to do so. In the case of the last recurring 90-day  congressional certification requirement, proponents of this bill  undoubtedly hope Trump will react the same way to these additional  certifications and block the sale of commercial aircraft, which is a  key element of the deal.   In a break from reason and logic, this legislation plays directly  into the hands of the President, who is desperate to find any pretext  to say that Iran is in violation of the deal or to force Iran to walk  away, and thereby, avoid having to take the blame for pulling the plug  on the deal.   But let me be clear. By seeking to render impermissible that which is  expressly permitted by the JCPOA, the legislation is clearly intended  to undermine the nuclear agreement.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
