 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in solidarity with the nearly  150,000 United Auto Workers who are fighting for fair pay, better  benefits, and safer working conditions.   These workers have built $250 billion in profit for the Big Three  automakers over the past decade, but they have been left behind. The  Big Three CEOs, the big bosses, have increased by an estimated 40  percent in their compensation over the last 4 years, but workers over  the last 4 years, 6 percent--a measly 6 percent.   To put that in perspective, Big Three corporate bosses, $12,000 an  hour. Those starting wages for the autoworkers, 18 bucks an hour.   This says it all. It should be fair, but this is unjust and  unacceptable. Workers deserve a fair wage and benefits that reflect  their hard work.   Mr. Speaker, we urge them to be supported.                            ____________________
