 Mr. President, today I am introducing the Electric Vehicle  Grid, Improvement, and Development Act, which would take important  steps to prepare our electric grid for the deployment of the electric  vehicle charging infrastructure that is essential to meeting our  climate goals.   Our Nation's dependence on fossil fuels has created serious  challenges for our security, economy, and environment. The  electrification of our transportation system will play a crucial role  in confronting those challenges. Indeed, electric vehicles will help  reduce our dependence on oil, lower carbon emissions and save Americans  money at the pump.   The bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act took great  strides in advancing the deployment of electric vehicles. The bill  provided $15 billion for electric vehicles, including $7.5 billion to  create a national network of electric vehicle charging stations. Of  these funds, Rhode Island should receive $23 million for the deployment  of new charging stations across the State.   Investments in electric vehicle charging infrastructure must be  paired with grid readiness measures to ensure we can decarbonize as  quickly as possible. To that end, the EV GRID Act would direct the  Department of Energy to complete a study on the anticipated demand of  electric vehicle charging infrastructure on our electric grid. It would  also direct the Department, once the study is completed, to submit a  plan with recommendations for policymakers to help the electric system  meet demand.   This bill is critical to ensuring a smooth transition toward a  cleaner, decarbonized transportation sector. I urge my colleagues to  join me in supporting this commonsense legislation.                                  ______                                         By Mr. DURBIN (for himself and Mr. Brown):   S. 4155. A bill to amend title 28, United States Code, to authorize  extraterritorial jurisdiction; to the Committee on the Judiciary.
