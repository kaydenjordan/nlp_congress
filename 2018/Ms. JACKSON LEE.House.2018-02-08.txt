 Mr. Speaker, as school children rise across America  to go to a place of work for them, but a place of joy, of learning, I  rise today to reenforce the importance of education in the State of  Texas.   The Texas education administrator, along with the Governor of the  State of Texas, will be receiving a letter from me reaffirming the plea  of local officials--both governmental and educational officials--to  give Texas school children, because of the devastation of Hurricane  Harvey, a waiver for 2 years for them to be able to improve their  scores and to keep the schools open that the parents and the community  want to have open.   Many of my school districts--seven of which I represent--have faced  the tragedy of Hurricane Harvey: the displacement or relocation of  their children and the devastation of their schools, including the  Houston Independent School District. It has historic schools.   So my plea is that this is, likewise, a Federal issue. I was a strong  supporter of the SUCCESS Act where we look at different elements, other  than testing. Let's look at the holistic aspect of the school children  of Houston. Let's give them a waiver. Let's understand Hurricane  Harvey. Let's fix the schools and keep them open.   That is my fight, and that is my commitment.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise to explain the importance of the  pending legislation, which extends the Continuing Resolution passed by  Congress on January 26, 2018 but expired at midnight, February 8, 2018,  by an additional six weeks, or until March 23, 2018.   This crucial legislation rests upon three pillars.   First, the legislation before us provides $89.3 billion in aid to  respond to the damage caused by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, and  the wildfires in California.   Second, the Continuing Resolution pending before us is necessary to  finalize and implement a bipartisan and bicameral budget agreement  gives parity to defense and non-defense discretionary funding and  provides $117 billion more funding for needed non-defense investments  in the areas of education, public health, infrastructure, community  development, and disaster relief than proposed under the Trump FY 2018  budget.   Third, I will be advocating for a nay vote on the Previous Question  in order to bring to the floor a crucial legislative fix for debate and  vote that will provide permanent legal residence and a path to  citizenship to the more than 800,000 Dreamers, including the 124,000  who live in Texas, whose lives have been turned upside down because of  this Administration's cruel, unwise, and reckless termination of DACA,  the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.   And in connection with legislation to protect Dreamers, I will insist  that the Administration rescind the revocation of Temporary Protected  Status (TPS) for Haiti, El Salvador, and Honduras, or failing that, TPS  for those countries be extended by congressional legislation.   Mr. Speaker, 44,800 residents of Texas are TPS holders from El  Salvador (36,300), Honduras (8,400), and Haiti, who combined are  parents of 53,800 U.S.-born children in Texas and 14,000 of whom have  home mortgages.   These TPS holders are integral members of the Texas's social fabric,  having lived in Texas an average of 20 years, and contribute an  aggregate $2.2 billion to the Texas economy.   This legislation provides $89.3 billion in emergency supplemental  appropriations to help states, communities, businesses, and individuals  respond and recover from Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria, and the  California wildfires.   This amount represents a doubling of the woefully inadequate $44  billion disaster relief package proposed by the Administration and a  substantial increase over the $81.1 billion disaster relief funding  approved by the House.   Ever since the widespread and catastrophic destruction of Hurricane  Harvey occurred, I have been working closely with Senator Cornyn and  other federal, state, and local officials, along with my colleagues in  the Texas congressional delegation to secure the help necessary for the  areas affected by Hurricane Harvey recover and rebuild.   The $8 billion increase in disaster relief funding reflected in this  legislation is due in strong part to the efforts of Senator Cornyn,  with whom I worked very closely to ensure that the interests of Houston  and Harris County were promoted and protected.   I have witnessed firsthand the pain of storm-weary Houstonians who  lost their homes, their belongings, and in many cases their jobs.   Right now, at this very moment, hundreds of thousands of Texans--in  Port Arthur, in Port Aransas, in Rockport, in Houston and Harris  County--remain homeless or are living in substandard homes with blue  tarp roofs and infected with mold.   They are struggling and hurting.   So this is personal to me.   That is why right now my highest priority is to ensure that funding  that has been made available expeditiously gets in the hands of local  governments so that relief can deliver the resources and services so  desperately needed.   That is why I am working with the Texas General Land Office  Commissioner and have advocated for the immediate release of the $5  billion that was approved in September 2017 and wrote the HUD Secretary  to expedite promulgation of the proposed regulations necessary to  release the funds, which finally were published this week in the  Federal Register for notice and comment.   And that is why on September 6, 2017, ten days after Hurricane Harvey  struck, I introduced the first Hurricane Harvey disaster recovery  legislation.   I was joined by 44 colleagues in introducing H.R. 3686, the  ``Hurricane Harvey Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2017,'' which  provides $174 billion in disaster relief for the areas affected by  Hurricane Harvey, the worst superstorm ever to strike the mainland  United States.   The $174 billion in funding provided by H.R. 3686 represents a  comprehensive response commensurate to the challenge; specifically that  legislation would provide relief in the following amounts:   1. Housing and Community Development Fund: $50 billion   2. FEMA Disaster Relief Fund: $35 billion   3. Army Corps of Engineers--Construction: $15 billion   4. Flood Control and Coastal Emergencies: $13 billion   5. Public Transportation Emergency Relief Program: $33 billion   6. Small Business Disaster Loans Program: $2 billion   7. Emergency Conservation Activities: $650 million   8. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration: $321 million   9. National Aeronautics and Space Administration: $50 million   10. Legal Services Corporation: $10 million   11. Army National Guard: $10 million   12. Army Corps of Engineers--Civil Investigations: $150 million   13. Coast Guard: $450 million   14. National Park Service Historic Preservation Fund: $800 million   15. EPA Environmental Programs and Management: $2.5 billion   16. EPA Hazardous Substance Superfund: $7 million   17. Leaking Underground Storage Tank Fund: $15 million   18. State and Tribal Assistance Grants: $600 million   19. Employment and Training Services: $100 million   20. Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund: $2.5 billion   21. Airport and Airway Trust Fund: $90 million   22. Federal-Aid Highways Emergency Relief Program: $6.5 billion   Although, the disaster relief funding provided in the legislation  before us is not as robust as the package I have proposed, it is a  significant improvement over what was initially offered by the  Administration and will provide much needed assistance to disaster  victims in desperate need of help.   I wish to thank the leadership of the Appropriations Committee, in  particular T-HUD Appropriations Subcommittee Chairman Diaz-Balart, and  Energy and Water Appropriations Ranking Member Kaptur for including in  the legislation before us the following beneficial measures that I  requested, including:   1. Authority to establish and implement a $1 billion pilot program to  provide small business disaster recovery grants, modeled on H.R. 3930,  the ``Hurricane Harvey Small Business Recovery Grants Act,''  legislation I introduced on October 3, 2017 and is co-sponsored by 16  of our colleagues.   2. $75 million for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' Investigations  account, which is to be used in areas affected by Hurricanes Harvey,  Irma, and Maria, and can be used to finance the $3 million Houston-Area  Watershed Assessment Study.   3. This is a highly successful conclusion to the multi-year struggle  I waged to secure House approval of this project and funding with the  Jackson Lee Amendments to the Energy and Water Appropriations Act for  Fiscal Years 2016, 2017, and 2018.   4. The bill also includes helpful legislative language to ensure that  in awarding CDBG-Disaster Relief funds to states, the Secretary of HUD  should to the maximum extent practicable award grants to units of local  government and public housing authorities that have the financial and  administrative capacity to manage a grant awarded under the program.   5. The bill also includes a provision for which I advocated expressly  providing that religious nonprofit organizations and houses of worship  have the same opportunity to qualify for disaster assistance as their  secular counterparts.   Let me describe briefly some of the major provisions contained in  this disaster relief funding package before us:   FEMA Disaster Relief Fund: $28 billion to provide critical funding to  assist the ongoing federal disaster response to allow up to $4 billion  to be provided for Community Disaster Loans (CDLs).   Emergency Food Assistance Program: $24 million to provide an  additional 35 million pounds of food for food banks in states affected  by natural disasters.   Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and  Children (WIC): $14 million.  [[Page H1070]]    $7.6 million to repair 12 Food and Drug Administration sites damaged  by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria, including repair of scientific  equipment such as those used to test foods for chemical contamination.   Economic Development Assistance Programs: $600 million in additional  funding to provide grants to communities directly impacted by Hurricane  Harvey, Irma, and Maria, as well as others disasters declared in 2017.   This funding will support immediate relief efforts and longterm  recovery projects, including repairing and replacing basic  infrastructure needs that are vital for local economic recovery.   National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration: $400 million, with  $100 million allocated for improving weather forecasting capabilities  and data collection efforts to better protect lives and property in the  wake of future hurricanes, and with $200 million for fishery disasters  causing severe economic harm in coastal communities following  Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria.   National Aeronautics and Space Administration: $81 million to repair  facilities damaged at the Kennedy and Johnson Space Centers.   Legal Services Corporation: $15 million for mobile resources,  technology, and disaster coordinators necessary to provide storm- related services to the population in affected areas.   U.S. Army Corps of Engineers: $17.39 billion, including $15 billion  for flood control and storm damage reduction construction projects and  $135 million for high priority Investigation studies for risk reduction  from future floods and hurricanes.   Of this $135 million, $75 million is to be allocated for the Army  Corps of Engineers' Investigations account, which is to be used in  areas affected by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria, and can be used  to finance the $3 million Houston-Area Watershed Assessment Study I  have worked to secure and which has been previously approved by the  House.   The bill also included $608 million to finance needed federal  dredging projects, such as Houston Shipping Channel and $810 million to  prepare for and mitigate future flood, hurricane, and other natural  disasters.   The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), will receive  $28 billion allocated to the Community Development Fund to repair  homes, support local business, and rebuild infrastructure while  mitigating future risk.   Also included in the legislation is authority for HUD to adjust  Section 8 voucher funding for public housing agencies adversely  affected by disasters in 2017.   Mr. Speaker, George Bush Intercontinental Airport, located in my  congressional district, will benefit from the $10.3 million to repair  Transportation and Security Administration facilities, security  equipment, and access control equipment at airports damaged by the  hurricanes.   The Texas Gulf Coast will benefit from the $835 million allocated to  the U.S. Coast Guard; $4 million of which for site assessments to  determine environmental compliance and restoration needs.   Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) will receive $23.5 billion  for the Disaster Relief Fund to support response and recovery efforts.   Other important provisions in the FEMA appropriations:   1. Ensure that religious nonprofit organizations are given the same  opportunity to qualify for certain disaster assistance as their secular  counterparts.   2. Extend the period of time that local government revenue loss as a  result of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria can be considered for the  purpose of Community Disaster Loans.   3. Authorize the President to increase the federal cost share for  certain disaster assistance from 75 to 85 percent if recipients have  taken steps to make themselves more resilient against disasters.   The Environmental Protection Agency will receive $6.2 million for the  Superfund program to help repair damage sustained to remedies at  Superfund sites; $7 million for the Leaking Underground Storage Tank  program to repair damage to storage tanks to prevent spills and  contaminants from leaking into the environment; and $50 million for  debris removal and technical assistance to inspect and clean up  hazardous waste facilities.   Department of Labor: $100 million for disaster response economic  recovery through the Dislocated Worker National Reserve.   Department of Health and Human Services:   1. $200 million for Centers for Disease Control and Prevention;   2. $50 million for National Institutes of Health;   3. $650 million for Head Start; and   4. $162 million for the Public Health and Social Services Emergency  Fund, including $60 million for Community Health Centers and $20  million for Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration.   Department of Education will receive $2.7 billion for Hurricane  Education Recovery, including:   1. $2.46 billion to restart operations at elementary and secondary  schools;   2. $100 million for institutions of higher education, and students at  those institutions;   3. $25 million for education services for homeless children; and   4. $35 million for Project SERV for education-related services to  help students recover from traumatic events, including natural  disasters.   Notably, this legislation forgives loans made to four Historically  Black Colleges and Universities in response to Hurricane Katrina.   Also notably, the CR allocates $14 million for the Government  Accountability Office to conduct oversight and evaluate distribution  and use of disaster funding across agencies to ensure responsible use  of taxpayer funds.   Department of Veterans Affairs: $4.1 million to repair damages to the  Veterans Benefit Administration Office in Houston, Texas and the Puerto  Rico National Cemetery.   Department of Transportation: $30 billion to repair damaged  infrastructure and help communities recover from natural disasters.   Federal Highway Administration will receive $1.3 billion and the  Federal Transit Administration will receive $330 million, both for  their Emergency Relief Programs.   Mr. Speaker, there is much more work to be done in my city of  Houston, and across the areas affected by the terrible, awesome storm  that will be forever known simply as Hurricane Harvey, and by  Hurricanes Irma and Maria.   But the disaster relief funding package before us today represents a  solid start toward completing the necessary work that must be  undertaken to restore the affected communities to their previous  greatness.   As I conclude, I am remembering a heroic DREAMER, Alonso Guillen, who  came to the U.S. from Mexico as a child, and died in my congressional  district when his boat capsized while he was rescuing survivors of the  flooding caused by Hurricane Harvey in the Houston area.   There is no heart in ending DACA and leaving the fate of 800,000  young persons in limbo and constant fear of deportation from the only  country they have ever known, and the only nation to which they have  ever pledged allegiance.   The way to end this crisis is to bring H.R. 3440, the Dream Act of  2017, to the floor right now and vote for it so it can pass both houses  of Congress with a veto-proof majority.   A Dreamer seeking to earn her college degree and aspiring to attend  medical school to better herself and her new community is not a threat  to the nation's security.   Law abiding but unauthorized immigrants doing honest work to support  their families pose far less danger to society than human traffickers,  drug smugglers, or those who have committed a serious crime.   President Obama was correct in concluding that exercising his  discretion regarding the implementation of DACA enhances the safety of  all members of the public, serves national security interests, and  furthers the public interest in keeping families together.   According to numerous studies conducted by the Congressional Budget  Office, Social Security Administration, and Council of Economic  Advisors, DACA generates substantial economic benefits to our nation.   For example, expanding DACA is estimated to increase GDP by $230  billion and create an average of 28,814 jobs per year over the next 10  years.   That is a lot of jobs.   In exercising his broad discretion in the area of removal  proceedings, President Obama acted responsibly and reasonably in  determining the circumstances in which it makes sense to pursue removal  and when it does not.   Because of President Obama's leadership and visionary executive  action, 124,000 undocumented immigrants in my home state of Texas have  received deferred action.   91 percent of these immigrants are employed or in school and  contribute $6.3 billion annually to the Texas economy and $460.3  billion to the national economy.   Instead of wasting time scapegoating DREAMERS, we should instead  seize the opportunity to pass legislation that secures our borders,  preserves America's character as the most open and welcoming country in  the history of the world, and will yield hundreds of billions of  dollars in economic growth.   THE SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Collins of Georgia). All time for debate  has expired.   Pursuant to House Resolution 734, the previous question is ordered.   The question is on the motion by the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.  Frelinghuysen).   The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the ayes appeared to have it.                                Recorded Vote
