 Mr. Speaker, the bottom line is America needs to be  energy independent. We should not be relying on foreign governments. We  should not be relying on China, least of all.   Mr. Speaker, 60 percent of New Yorkers, for instance, rely on natural  gas. We need to expand our energy portfolio. We need to increase  domestic production of energy. We need to protect our reserves.   We should not be engaging in the type of behavior that the  administration has with respect to China, and we should continue to do  everything we  [[Page H218]]  can to reduce the cost of energy here in America and increase our  production.   That has to be the goal at all times.    Madam Speaker, earlier this week the Biden administration  announced plans to ban gas stoves. The Governor of New York embraced  the same plan.   The problem is that 60 percent of New Yorkers rely on natural gas,  and 70 percent of our electricity is generated by natural gas.   While we absolutely embrace the move to reduce carbon emissions, the  reality is natural gas has reduced carbon emissions far greater than  renewables over the last two decades.   We need a comprehensive energy plan and portfolio that is an all-of- the-above approach. We need clean, cheap, reliable energy. Natural gas  plays a critical role in doing that. To try and ban natural gas and  force homeowners to convert their home from gas to electric, the  average homeowner will pay $35,000 to do that.   The question for the President and the Governor of New York is: Who  will pay for that?                            ____________________
