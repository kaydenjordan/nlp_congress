Without objection, it is so ordered.                            Texas Independence Day     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                            Texas Independence Day     Mr. President, today is Texas Independence Day--a day  that inspires pride and gratitude in the hearts of all 28 million  Texans.   Before I came to the floor, I asked the Presiding Officer, who hails  from the great State of Alaska, to remind me--and he did--that Alaska  is 2\1/2\ times the size of Texas in terms of landmass, not in terms of  population. But today commemorates the signing of the Texas Declaration  of Independence, when Texas declared itself a republic and independent  from the Nation of Mexico.   Here in the Senate, we remember the sacrifice of those who came  before us and laid the foundation for our State by reading a letter  written by William Barret Travis, a defender of the Alamo. That  tradition goes back to 1961, when then-Senator John Tower started that  tradition. I am told my colleague Senator Cruz will read that letter in  full later today, perhaps around 12:30, carrying on this great  tradition. So today I wish to express my gratitude for these Texas  patriots, many of whom would later serve in the U.S. Congress,  including Sam Houston, whose Senate seat I am honored to now occupy.   Sam Houston came from his farm outside Huntsville, TX, in 1846. It  took  [[Page S1551]]  him about 3 weeks to get to Washington, DC. Of course, he didn't have a  modern mode of transportation, but I always marvel at the fact that it  now takes me about 3 hours to get home, where it took old Sam 3 weeks  just to make a one-way trip.                              U.S.-Mexico Border    Mr. President, on another matter, last week I had the great privilege  of hosting a number of my congressional colleagues at the Texas border.  At a time when so many people are talking about the border of the  United States and Mexico, I thought it was important to bring  colleagues who were willing to come to learn and listen about the  impact of trade, border security, and our relationship with Mexico on  my State and on the United States. Of course, this border is so  important on all of those issues--security, trade, the economy. It is  important to see where they intersect. I am glad they had a chance to  come to listen and learn last week.   We did receive a number of very important and useful briefings from  Customs officials, Border Patrol agents, and other Federal partners in  three major areas along the border, including the Rio Grande Valley. We  were in McAllen, TX, Laredo, and Del Rio. I think what my colleagues  discovered--if they didn't already know it--is how varied each part of  the border is. This is not just true in Texas. It is true in San Diego.  It is true in Arizona. It is true in New Mexico. When anybody suggests  that we can attain a goal that we all share, which is border security,  by just one solution, I think it is important to examine that  conclusion and to test it because, frankly, I think what the Border  Patrol will tell you is that what we need is infrastructure, yes. We  need technology, yes. Then we need people.   That is the formula--personnel, technology, and infrastructure. In my  own view, border security is a question of political will. The previous  administration did not have that political will. I believe this  administration does, and it has been long overdue. I welcome that.   We are going to be working with our State and local officials to make  sure that they have the resources they need in order to get the job  done. At the same time, I think what we were able to demonstrate to  some of our friends from out of State is that we have an important  trading relationship with Mexico. As a matter of fact, 5 million  American jobs depend on binational trade with Mexico.   We went to one of the largest land ports in the country. I think,  maybe, it is the largest port of the country--Laredo, TX--where some  15,000 trucks enter the United States every day. It is a huge influx of  cargo and, fortunately, businesses all up and down and along the border  have worked with the law enforcement agencies, with Customs and Border  Protection to make sure that we can expedite the flow of legal trade  into the United States. At the same time, we police for the entry of  illegal drugs and for people illegally entering the United States  without proper authority.   One reason why my State has done pretty well relative to the rest of  the country in terms of our economy is because of our business-friendly  attitude. We believe in lower taxes, reasonable regulation, and a  welcoming attitude when it comes to people who make investments and who  want to come to our State and start businesses or grow businesses.   We all know that roughly 70 percent of job growth in this country  comes not from the Fortune 500 companies but from those small and  medium-sized businesses. We work very hard to be a business-friendly  State. Why? It is not just because we care about businesses but because  we care about the workers who work at those employers.   As one of my former colleagues likes to say, you can't claim to be  worker-friendly if you are hostile to the businesses that employ them.  That is an inconsistent approach. You need to be consistent.   In addition to the issue of illegal entry into the United States by  individuals who come without regard to our immigration laws, we also  have a tremendous influx of illegal drugs into the United States. I  think one of the things I was reminded of that we all should be  cognizant of is that when we focus on the illegal drug activity in  Mexico, Central America, or South America, we need to look in the  mirror as a nation because the only way those cartels exist and make  the money they make and commit the mayhem and violence they commit is  because of demand in the United States.   I was very encouraged to hear Secretary John Kelly--former Marine  Gen. John Kelly. He is still a marine, always a marine, but now he has  taken off the uniform and assumed the responsibility of Secretary of  the Department of Homeland Security. He previously served as the  commanding general in the Southern Command, as the Presiding Officer  knows, which covers the combatant command from south of Mexico down to  Central America and South America. So he is very familiar with the  region. He made the point, before his confirmation hearing, that there  is one thing he would like to see the United States do--effect a major  societal and cultural change to deal with the demand for illegal drugs,  which fuels all of the cartels and the transnational criminal  organizations which plague our security situation along the border and  in our neighbors to the south.   I want to say that I am appreciative of our colleagues who joined us  on the trip--Senators Tillis and Heller, Congressman Rouzer from North  Carolina, and my colleagues from Texas, Congressmen John Carter and  Mike Conaway.   I also wanted to say how much I appreciate Speaker Ryan coming to  Texas and the Rio Grande Valley last Wednesday for, unfortunately, a  short period of time, but we are all grateful that he came at all--I  think, at the invitation of people like Congressman Michael McCaul,  chairman of the Homeland Security Committee in the House of  Representatives. I think it is going to take all of our efforts working  together to effect and implement the President's vision of border  security, a goal we all share.   I think what we all were reminded of is that it is more complex than  some people assume, and it is going to take a combination of  approaches, including personnel. We need to plus-up the Border Patrol  because it doesn't do you any good if you identify somebody illegally  bringing a shipment of drugs or illegally entering the United States if  you don't have a Border Patrol agent to stop them. Also, the very  useful border infrastructure--fencing and walls, for example, in the  Hidalgo County area--were actually implemented as a way to improve  their levee system when the Rio Grande river floods. They have actually  created a dual-use structure that actually satisfies the Border  Patrol's need for physical infrastructure along with levee improvements  in a win-win situation.    I believe that consulting with local officials and local  stakeholders, we at the Federal level can come up with more of those  win-win solutions. The point is that we have learned a lot,  particularly in our military, about how to use technology to keep us  safe--whether it is unmanned aerial vehicles or ground sensors or  radars. Actually, they have several new aerostats, or balloons, up in  the sky that are basically the eyes in the sky, or radar, which do a  tremendous job helping to identify people illegally entering the United  States and equipping the Border Patrol and law enforcement authorities  with the sort of early notice they need in order to interdict people  illegally entering the country.   I will close by saying that one of the always surprising things I  learn when I go to the Rio Grande Valley and talk to the Border Patrol  is this. I ask them: How many different countries are represented by  the people whom you detain illegally entering the United States?  Obviously, the majority of them come from our neighbors to the south,  not as much from Mexico as you might suspect anymore, because the  Mexican economy is doing better and people are finding more  opportunities there. But right now, the majority of the flow of people  illegally entering the United States is from Central America.   Unfortunately, the tragic situation there where mothers and fathers  worry about their children--whether they are going to be killed by  gangs or whether they are going to be forced to join gangs--and somehow  make the very painful and difficult choice of turning their children  over to human smugglers to try to make their way up the backbone of  Mexico and into the  [[Page S1552]]  United States, to be deposited on our doorstop in the United States.   Last week when the congressional delegation was in McAllen, we went  through the processing area where some of these immigrants from Central  America were being processed. I asked a young boy there, who was in the  process of being processed--through my regional director, because he  spoke only Spanish--how old he was, and he said he was 6 years old. He  wasn't unaccompanied in that trip from Central America, but his mother  and father thought it was important enough to get him out of that  ravaged part of the world, where the prospects are not very good, and  to turn him over to a human smuggler to make his way up into the United  States, only to find himself at a Border Patrol processing unit in  McAllen, TX.   My point is that I also met a young man from India, and I asked him:  How much did it cost you to get to the United States from India?   He said: About $6,000.   I said: How did you get here?   He said: I took a plane from India.   He went through Moscow, he said, and ended up in Central America,  where he worked his way up with the help of human smugglers into the  United States.   I mention that only to point out that we have a vulnerability there  where anybody determined enough or with enough money can find their way  into the United States. We generally assume these people are economic  migrants--in other words, looking for opportunity. We all understand  that. Those same vulnerabilities create potential danger for our Nation  and our local communities when people with unknown motives exploit  those same vulnerabilities to come into the United States.   The last point I will make, again, to emphasize the global nature of  illegal immigration into the United States is this. We saw that the  Border Patrol has several rescue beacons in Brooks County, TX. This is  about 70 miles from the U.S.-Mexico border. What happens is that the  human smugglers will transport people into the United States and across  the river. They will put them in stash houses, really in terrible  conditions. As a matter of fact, we went to one of these stash houses.  They found 18 migrants in the stash house waiting to be transported up  the highway into the heartland of America.   One of the checkpoints there is at Falfurrias, about 70 miles away  from the border. What happens is that the smugglers will have people  packed into a van or some vehicle, and before they get to the  checkpoint, they will tell the immigrants to get out. If it is hot,  they will give them a gallon jug--a milk jug--full of water and they  will say: I will see you on the other side. They go around the  checkpoint, out through the very difficult ranchland, and meet up on  the north side, and then are transported off.   In Brooks County, TX, we went by a cemetery where a number of unknown  and unnamed migrants have been buried because they have died due to  exposure. Some of these immigrants coming from Central America come up  through Mexico. You can imagine the conditions they have been exposed  to, and in the heat of the summer, they have been kicked out of a car  and told ``meet us on the north side,'' with a gallon jug of water, and  some of them don't make it. Of course the smugglers don't care about  people. You are just a commodity. You are just a paycheck. So they will  leave stragglers behind. Many of the ranchers said they found as many  as 100 different dead bodies on their property over an unspecified  period of time.    But there is a rescue beacon that the Border Patrol has down there  that is in three languages. It is in English, Spanish, and Chinese. You  might ask, why in the world would you need Chinese written on a rescue  beacon where somebody thinks ``OK, I am not going to make it; I need  help'' and goes and presses the button on the rescue beacon--that you  need English, Spanish, and Chinese. Well, because they have had Chinese  immigrants come through that border region, as well, like the young man  from India whom I mentioned earlier. And we have had people from Cuba  and from literally all around the world, including some nations that  are hosts to terrorist organizations.   This is not only an economic situation. This is not only a law  enforcement problem when it comes to drug interdiction. It is a  humanitarian crisis, as well. But it is also a national security issue,  I think all the leaders of the intelligence community will concede,  given the fact that people from 60 different countries have been  detained coming across the southwestern border just in the last year by  the McAllen sector of the Border Patrol.   We have a lot of work to do. I hope we will be able to work with the  President and this administration and in a bipartisan way to come up  with the tools we need in order to secure our border. We need to  enforce our immigration laws. Of course, 40 percent of illegal  immigration in this country occurs not from people entering the country  illegally, it is from people entering legally and overstaying their  visa. We may not catch up with them until they commit a serious crime  and they are arrested by local law enforcement. I think this is what  causes so many people to be angry at the Federal Government for not  enforcing our laws. And many of our colleagues, me included, would like  to do more to fix our broken immigration system generally, but until we  regain the public's confidence that we are actually serious about  securing our border and enforcing our laws, I don't believe we can have  that conversation. I don't believe we are going to be successful, which  I would like to see us be.   I think the first thing we need to do is to work with the  administration in order to accomplish the goal of securing the border.  Again, in the matter of political will, we know how to do it. We just  need to have the desire to get it done. And then once we have regained  the public's confidence that the Federal Government is once again  living up to its responsibilities, then I think we can have that more  expansive conversation about what our immigration system should look  like.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 1:35 p.m.  all but 10 minutes of postcloture time, equally divided in the usual  form, be considered expired on Executive Calendar No. 9, the nomination  of Rick Perry to be Secretary of Energy, and that following the use or  yielding back of time, the Senate vote on the nomination with no  intervening action or debate.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, let me just say briefly, I couldn't be  happier that my friend, the former Governor of the State of Texas, Rick  Perry, will be confirmed here shortly as the next Energy Secretary.   I know, personally, as do 28 million Texans, that Rick Perry has  dedicated his life to public service. He is best known perhaps for  serving our State as Governor for a record 14 years. Before that, he  served in the Air Force. He served as a State representative in the  Texas Legislature. He was elected as our Agriculture commissioner, then  served as Lieutenant Governor. As you can tell, the man was born to  lead.   During his governorship, Texas became known throughout the country as  the economic engine that could pull the train of the U.S. economy and  could weather even the toughest national economic downturn. Under  Governor Perry's leadership, the State promoted cutting-edge innovation  and sensible regulation in order to foster an ``all of the above''  energy strategy that revolutionized the Texas energy landscape and the  Texas economy. The State became not just an oil and gas powerhouse but  the top wind-producing State in the country. We really do believe in an  ``all of the above'' strategy when it comes to energy.   In short, Rick Perry created an environment where all energy  producers could not just succeed but really prosper, and that continues  to serve the people of our State well.   Texans still benefit from policies that continue to create more  energy options for families across our State. Put it another way,  Governor Perry has a very strong track record when it comes to  promoting energy in a way that makes everybody better off. I have no  doubt Governor Perry will take to the rest of the country these same  principles that led to the Texas success story, opening America to a  new energy renaissance.   I look forward to voting to confirm him in just a few minutes.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.
