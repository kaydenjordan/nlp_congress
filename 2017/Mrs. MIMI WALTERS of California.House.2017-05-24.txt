 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor  of Dr. Tod Burnett, who is retiring as president of Saddleback College  in Mission Viejo, California.   Since 2008, when Dr. Burnett was named the ninth president of  Saddleback, he has transformed the college into one of the top higher  education institutions in California and the country.   Over the last 9 years, Dr. Burnett established partnerships with  local school districts, supported adult education programs, and  pioneered the development of comprehensive support services for  veterans, Active-Duty military, and their families.   Prior to his time at Saddleback, Dr. Burnett was appointed to several  government positions, serving in the administrations of a U.S.  President, a Governor, and mayor. He also served as vice chancellor of  the California Community Colleges, the largest higher education system  in the Nation.   More importantly, Dr. Burnett's involvement in the community outside  of work has left a lasting impression on those who know him. He has  mentored veterans, personally funded student trips to Washington, and  dedicated resources to various programs throughout the region.   Dr. Burnett's generosity and commitment to his community and career  has transformed the lives of countless individuals at Saddleback  College and throughout Orange County.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Dr. Burnett for his decades of work and  dedication to service of the people of California, and I wish him well  during his much-deserved retirement.                            ____________________
