 Mr. President, I want to give short remarks on three  different subjects. Probably, for people wanting to speak, it will take  me about 10 or 12 minutes.   Thanks to Operation Warp Speed, effective vaccines are available on  demand to anyone who wants to take the shot. That means individuals and  businesses are beginning to return to a degree of normalcy we have all  been waiting for.   However, as I have made my annual tour through Iowa's 99 counties, I  have heard from business after business that they are desperate for  workers, but job applicants are scarce. Those that do apply often don't  show up for interviews.   Nationally, the economy added over 700,000 fewer jobs than were  expected last month. This is very concerning, as a vibrant labor market  is vital--vital--to a strong economy.   I get that some individuals, even after being vaccinated, may be  leery of returning to the market after a year of staying home to be  safe, but the vaccines have been shown to virtually eliminate the  chance of serious illness. Hopefully, the recent CDC guidelines that  reinforce this by easing mask guidelines will reassure individuals that  it is safe to return to work.   However, Iowa employers repeatedly informed me that the biggest  impediment to finding workers is the over-the-top unemployment benefits  extended as part of President Biden's so-called COVID relief bill.   I had 13 county meetings throughout Iowa during our last Senate  recess, and in all but one of them, this came up as a very important  issue.   The simple fact is this: Under that partisan COVID package, many  individuals can earn more if they don't work than if they do work. That  is wrong in principle and has proven disastrous in practice, and, as a  matter of fact, in American society, a job is very essential and center  to the quality of life.   As my Republican colleagues and I have warned for months, incentives  matter. If you can earn more not working than working, it makes perfect  sense not to work. I don't blame workers for taking that deal. I blame  government policy that puts the individual workers in this predicament.   Even prominent liberal economists have acknowledged a problem with  [[Page S2756]]  continuing to provide increased unemployment benefits. For instance,  President Obama's former chief economic adviser, Jason Furman, admitted  that if he were in a low unemployment State, he would be--these are his  quotes--``thinking seriously about whether paying people more to not  work than to work was a good thing to continue doing.''   This is the case in Iowa, which has an unemployment rate of 3.7  percent. That is low even in normal times, but it should be even lower  as Iowa has more job openings than unemployed people.   I stand firmly behind Governor Reynolds, who recently announced Iowa  would end its participation in the counterproductive enhanced benefit  program, and that ending will be effective June 12.   President Biden talks about the government creating jobs by spending  trillions of borrowed dollars, all while spending more borrowed money  to pay people not to work. Now, that fails the commonsense test.   In Iowa, the private sector is already creating more jobs than we can  fill. The economy is poised to take off if the government just gets out  of the way. Politicians should live by the same principle as doctors:  ``First, do no harm.''   We shouldn't continue pandemic-era policies longer than they are  necessary. That will only slow our economic recovery. Just as the CDC  updated its guidance based upon the new reality about masks and about  the vaccine, it is time for Congress to conform its policies to the  conditions on the ground.                           Pipeline Infrastructure    Mr. President, on another subject, yesterday I participated on a call  with Canadian counterparts that serve in Canada's Parliament.   Just for a little background on these meetings, until the pandemic or  until people got so busy they couldn't travel back and forth between  the two countries, over a period of more than a half a century, there  have been meetings of Canadian Parliamentarians and Members of the  American Congress on an annual basis.   One time, the U.S. Congressmen would go to some place in Canada; the  next year, the Canadian Parliamentarians would come down here.   In the recent 5 to 10 years, this has been done more like yesterday  by Zoom or by a few people from Canada coming down here more often than  we went up there.   But over the period of my years in the U.S. Senate, I presume I have  participated in at least 15 of those meetings where we travel back and  forth, and I found them very helpful in talking about problems between  the two countries. The problem is, it is almost laughable that we have  very many problems between Canada and the United States. So we would  end up talking about two or three issues, but they were problems that  had to be worked out.   So we had this meeting yesterday by Zoom, as I just said. We  discussed issues of concern that impact both legislative bodies in our  respective countries.   Canada and the United States share the same values and are closely  tied to each other culturally and economically. Canada is our closest  ally. We need to effectively work with Canada and Canadians on issues  that impact both countries.   On his first day in office, President Biden made a hasty decision to  shut down the construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline--a decision that  cost the United States and Canada over 10,000 jobs.   This decision by President Biden sent a clear signal to other  democratic countries across the globe. That message is, it doesn't  matter if it will cost your State jobs and raise gas prices or irritate  an ally; you would be better to listen to ideologues in your party who  say something like this: Pipelines that transport oil are bad.   But while the Keystone XL Pipeline is better known, the Canadians who  were meeting yesterday were worried about the current pipeline in use  that goes by the name of Enbridge Line 5. The pipeline, which has been  in use since 1953, delivers the bulk of Canadian crude exports to the  United States and also supplies fuel to Ontario and Quebec.   In June of 2019, the State of Michigan filed a lawsuit to compel the  decommissioning of the segment of Line 5 that runs under Lake Michigan.  The basis of the suit is that the pipeline is a public nuisance that  could become a source of pollution if it leaks. This month, the  Canadian Government filed a request to stop the State of Michigan from  shutting down the pipeline.   Shutting down the pipeline would have an immediate effect on crude  oil supplies for refineries and, as a result, increase the price of gas  for Americans. We saw it over the past 7 or 8 days, how the Colonial  Pipeline's shutdown has increased the price of gas--if you could buy  gas. So we ought to be thinking about these problems.   For the sake of North American energy independence and for American  jobs and to mend relations with our closest allies, I am asking the  Governor of Michigan to reconsider this lawsuit. For that matter,  President Biden ought to step in and the entire Democratic Party ought  to reconsider their stance on the use of pipelines. Take a cue from the  former Governor of Michigan, now Energy Secretary Granholm, who said  pipelines are ``the best way to move oil.''                       Inspector General's Act of 1978    Mr. President, my last comment, which will be very short, deals with  the subject of the Inspector General's Act of 1978.   When we passed that act, we required a President who wants to remove  an IG to provide Congress specific reasons why that IG was removed.  When Congress revised the IG act 30 years later, we amended that  notification requirement and made it even stronger. We require  Presidents to tell us their reasons and do it in no less than 30 days  in advance of the removal. Neither of these provisions did anything to  prevent the President from performing his constitutional responsibility  to hire and fire people within the executive branch of government.   Unfortunately, Presidents from both political parties--let me  emphasize ``from both political parties''--seem to have a hard time  following this simple notice requirement.   When President Obama fired IG Walpin of the Corporation for National  and Community Service early in his term, he sent a vaguely worded  letter saying only that he had ``lost confidence'' in Mr. Walpin. When  President Trump fired IGs Linick and Atkinson last year, he sent  letters to Congress saying exactly the same thing.   As I explained to both Presidents when they sent those letters,  merely telling Congress that you have ``lost confidence'' in an IG  isn't enough explanation. The loss of confidence occurs only after  something happens. When announcing their decision to remove an IG from  office, Presidents need to tell us what that ``something'' is. They  need to explain why they have lost confidence. Failing to do so misses  the point of the notice requirement entirely. The notice requirement  isn't about a President's confidence in the IG; it is about the  public's confidence in the inspector general system across the board.   IGs are put in office to serve as government watchdogs. If IGs are  carrying out their duties as intended, they are likely going to make  more enemies than friends. They may uncover things that make the  sitting President and his political appointees very uncomfortable. So  what? No President is going to like every investigation that an IG  undertakes or every report that an IG prepares. But IGs should not be  fired just for doing their jobs or to prevent them from releasing  findings that may be embarrassing to an administration, Republican or  Democratic.   Requiring the President to explain in advance why he or she is  removing an IG gives Congress time to evaluate those reasons. It helps  assure Congress and the public that the termination isn't based on  politics but on real problems with the IG's ability to carry out their  job.   Of course, there has been no shortage of bad IGs who are deserving of  removal. In fact, I probably had something to do with removing five or  six of them in the years I have been in the U.S. Senate. Maybe some of  those who ought to be removed are still in office.   Recently, I called on the President, President Biden, to remove the  Federal Housing Finance Agency IG due to an independent report by the  Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity  [[Page S2757]]  and Efficiency that verified longstanding claims to my office that she  abused her authority.   Whistleblowers originally came to my office in 2015 with concerning  reports that the IG was personally and publicly demeaning her  employees. She referred to them with demeaning names such as  ``weasel.'' The IG also allowed her deputy to threaten employees who  blew the whistle to my office. That was over 5 years ago, and--can you  believe it?--the abuse is still happening today.   Based on my investigations and the CIGIE's findings, I firmly believe  the IG needs to go, but I don't get to make that decision. Only the  President can make that decision. He gets to decide when to exercise  his constitutional authority. He has a right to do so and will  ultimately be accountable to the people for a decision that he makes.  All he has to do, all that is required for him to do under this law, is  to give Congress proper notice. That is how things should work. That is  how things were designed to work, but unfortunately, that is not what  has been happening.   It is clear to me that we have to be even clearer that when we say we  want reasons, we actually mean it. When making the decision to remove  an IG, Presidents must send substantive, specific reasons to Congress  in advance explaining the actions they are taking and why they are  taking those actions.   That is why I introduced S. 587, the Securing Inspector General  Independence Act. In addition to making the notice requirement even  more clear, my bill would limit who can be an IG in an acting capacity  and require CIGIE to provide guidance for annual whistleblower training  for all IG employees.   My cosponsors and I have an interest in keeping our IG system strong  and neutral, and that is what this bill does. I encourage all of my  colleagues to support it and ask that the Homeland Security Committee  give it full consideration.   I yield the floor
