 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Madam Speaker, it is with frustration that I rise in support of  today's short-term continuing resolution and urge my colleagues to do  so as well.   Once again, we need a means to keep the lights on for the Federal  Government. The American people need and deserve more from their  collective elected leaders. We are in the middle of an economic crisis  and global pandemic when many are unsure they can keep their own lights  on.   This 11-week extension puts our Federal agencies on autopilot. They  can't begin new programs or respond to shifting priorities. It  handcuffs our ability to respond to America's twin crises. It blocks  investments in national security, fails to assist schools struggling to  safely educate America's youth, fails the millions of families standing  in long lines desperate for food assistance, and leaves millions  questioning whether they even have a home tomorrow. It is a complete  and total dereliction of duty for today and tomorrow.   The lack of action from our Senate colleagues, for the second year in  a row, who deep-sixed their fiscal responsibility and leadership  brought us here today. Our Senate friends have not even started the  appropriation process. Not a single bill was considered in their  committees. But they have time for another judicial confirmation.   Madam Speaker, I commend Chairwoman Lowey's leadership, and Speaker  Pelosi and Majority Leader Hoyer for their prioritization and passage  in the House of 10 of our 12 annual appropriations spending bills--all  managed with the unknown and lack of Presidential leadership in  establishing a Federal response to the COVID pandemic. The Senate  achieved nothing. Nothing.   While Senate Republican strategists are squeezed in rooms over there  thinking about a Supreme Court nominee before election day, they ignore  their top responsibility of Congress' funding responsibility. Our  Senate Republican colleagues have 11 weeks to draft and pass 12 bills,  but not a single word on how they plan to achieve this monumental task.   The Energy and Water portion of the continuing resolution contains  commonsense, necessary extensions to keep certain programs operating  for the next 11 weeks.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this short-term  resolution.    Madam Speaker, I rise today in reflection following the  tragic loss of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.   Justice Ginsburg not only has woven her legacy into the fabric of  American law, but blossomed into a progressive cultural icon as a  result of her dogged defense of women's rights and gender equality.   Her personality and words of deliberate intention seamlessly filled  our courts with promise and purpose and our hearts with gratitude.   To say that her time as an attorney and Justice was revolutionary is  an understatement. Her impact, her memory, her stature will never be  forgotten and will be forever honored.   As early as the 1970s, Justice Ginsburg dedicated her career to the  advancement of women's equality. Acting as an unprecedented firebrand  for accessible, lawful, and equitable government, she became not only a  woman I admire so fervently, but a woman that has become an  installation of American regality.   When asked how she might wish to be remembered, she answered: ``Just  as someone who did whatever she could, with whatever limited talent she  had, to move society along in the direction I would like it to be for  my children and grandchildren.''   I believe she rests knowing she accomplished just that.   Thank you, Justice Ginsburg. What shooting stars your precious life  has yielded, giving guidance to human progress here at home and abroad.   A grateful nation says, thank you.
