 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                            ____________________     Mr. President, later this week, we are going to reach 1  year since President Trump was sworn into office as President of the  United States. From what I have seen and from what I have heard,  visiting with people at home, all around the State of Wyoming, his  first year has been a huge success.   People are telling me, telling their friends, and telling their  neighbors that America is finally headed in the right direction again.  People tell me that they feel optimistic--optimistic because of the  policies that Republicans have put in place over this past year.   The polling company Gallup says it is not just happening in Wyoming;  it is happening all across the country. They had a report the other day  that said Americans' confidence in our economy was positive in 2017,  and they say that this was the first positive annual average since they  started tracking these numbers back in 2008--the first time ever.   As soon as Donald Trump was elected President, economic confidence  began to soar. It has stayed positive every single month since election  day of 2016.   Gallup has said that this is the exact opposite of what they had seen  for the previous 8 years.   In another poll last week, Gallup said that people are also more  optimistic about the job market. They found that Americans' confidence  about finding a job--a quality job--was the highest it has been in the  17 years since they have been asking that question as well.   They said that there was a ``sharp increase'' over the year before-- in 2016, when President Obama was in charge--in people's feelings about  being able to find a quality job. People are confident, and they are  much more optimistic about the future. We see the signs of it  everywhere we turn.   Stores had their biggest holiday sales since 2008. When people are  feeling confident, they feel it is OK to go shopping. They feel there  is going to be the income to cover the things they are interested in  having for Christmas and the gifts they can give. They can relax. That  is the kind of optimism we are seeing now.   It is because they see that President Trump and Republicans in  Congress are serious about improving America's economy. They see that  we are serious about giving relief to Americans who have been getting  buried under an avalanche of redtape.   The President has cut through massive amounts of regulations.  Congress has rolled back 15 different major regulations from the Obama  administration. That is going to save Americans as much as $36 billion  over time because of the regulatory burden that has been relieved.  These are regulations that harmed Americans and wiped out American  jobs. Now those regulations are gone.   When people see that Washington is finally taking the right approach  to regulation, it gives them confidence. It makes them more optimistic  about the future.   A lot of the regulations that Democrats wrote had to do with their  war on American energy. Democrats shut down a lot of energy exploration  and energy development in America. They shut down attempts to export  American energy. They even wrote rules to put the United States at a  competitive disadvantage when we tried to develop energy resources  overseas.   Republicans have stopped Washington's war on American energy. We are  opening up more areas to responsible energy production off of our  coasts and in part of Alaska. Our goal should be to make American  energy as clean as we can, as fast as we can, without raising costs on  American families.   Republicans have put policies in place to restore that balance to  America's energy policy.   Now people are talking about not just energy security, energy  independence, but American energy dominance. When people see that  Washington is finally taking the right approach to energy, it gives  them confidence.   People see that Republicans are delivering on other promises as well,  such as giving American families serious tax relief. This tax law that  passed at the end of last year is giving back more than $1 trillion to  Americans over time. It is letting people keep more of their hard- earned money. It is spurring economic growth. It is going to make it  simpler for a lot of families to fill out their taxes.   When people see that Washington is finally taking the right approach  to taxes, it gives them more confidence, more optimism. They are  confident because they are already seeing the direct result in their  paychecks.   At least 166 companies have said that they are going to give raises,  give out bonuses, and invest more in their workers because of the tax  law. More than 2,236,000 workers across this country are getting more  money in their pockets as a result of these raises and bonuses. Some of  the folks who are getting bonuses are people who work at Walmart. That  is one of the biggest employers in my State of Wyoming. People who work  there are getting bonuses, they are getting higher wages, and they are  getting expanded maternity leave benefits--one advantage after  another--as a result of the tax law that was passed by a Republican  House, a Republican Senate, and signed by President Trump. These  workers are noticing the extra money. It is going to make a difference  to them and to their families. It is not just a one-time bump for  people; economists say that this tax relief legislation is going to  boost the economy for years to come.   There was a story on CNBC Monday that quoted an official from one  European bank. He said that President Trump has ``changed the  perception of what's possible in Washington.''   The American economy has roared back to life. We are finally-- finally--having the economic recovery that we should have had 8 years  ago. That is because we finally got the policies that allow our economy  to grow the way it should. We had a big recession in this country.  Democrats used that as an excuse to pile a bunch of regulations on the  American people. That had a lot to do with keeping the economy from  recovering at the pace it should have.   During the Obama administration, there was talk about the ``new  normal.'' People said that maybe it was just the way things were going  to be in America from now on--slow, tepid economic growth, weak  recovery, wages that didn't grow, people out of work for years at a  time. That is what we saw in that administration. Now we know that it  was never normal, it was never acceptable, and it was never the way  things had to be. Things could be different, and the American people  voted to make things different. In 2016, they said it was time for a  change. Republicans are showing that the economy can grow faster once  we get the right policies in place. America can be a greater place for  all of us.   We head into President Trump's second year with an economy much  stronger than it was the day he took office. We have more Americans at  work. We have businesses and families confident that the economy will  be even better this year. I think that is the kind of thing that people  mean when they tell me they feel confident and optimistic in the  direction of our country again. I see that confidence in Wyoming. We  see it on Wall Street, and we see it all across the United States.   Democrats might miss the Obama economy of higher taxes and more  regulation. Republicans are fighting to continue the policies that are  giving Americans confidence, optimism, and hope. Republicans know this  is just the beginning.

Mr. President, I wish to speak today about legislation  I am introducing to spur American energy development on Federal land.  This is the Opportunities for the Nation and States to Harness Onshore  Resources for Energy Act. It is also known as the ONSHORE Act. It is a  commonsense approach that streamlines the permitting process for oil  and gas development.   Oil and gas production has increased dramatically on non-Federal land  in recent years. Production on Federal land has fallen behind. That is  because energy producers face costly delays when they have to deal with  outdated and inefficient regulations from Washington, DC.   The legislation we are introducing reduces these unnecessary delays  by giving authority to States that have established regulatory  programs. Let's let the States make those decisions. These are States  that have a proven track record of managing oil and gas development  efficiently and effectively. At the same time, they protect the public  health and the environment. That is the balance we all want--and these  States are doing it--without Washington adding another unnecessary  layer of redtape.   In 2016, it took an average of more than 250 days for the Federal  Bureau of Land Management to issue permits to drill for oil on public  land. It took State agencies an average of 30 days. Look at the  difference--States, 30 days; Federal, 250 days. That is the difference  in what happens when Washington gets involved. The delays cost jobs,  they slow down economic growth, and communities lose important tax  revenue.   My home State of Wyoming is America's largest producer of natural  gas, and we are the second largest producer of oil on Federal lands.  Wyoming has a long history of managing oil and gas development on  Federal lands. We know how to do it. We do it safely. We do it  responsibly. Wyoming continues to be the place people from all over the  world want to see because of how beautiful the scenery and the  environment are. This legislation strips away that needless layer of  Washington regulation, and it lets States like Wyoming manage oil and  gas development the way we know how to do it.   Our legislation also eliminates the administrative fee that gets  taken out of States' share of revenues from oil and gas production.  Washington takes money that has been created locally, and it sends the  money out of the community and back to Washington. This is millions of  dollars that States and local communities need to fund vital public  services. Our bill ends this unfair redistribution.   The ONSHORE Act also stops Washington from imposing extra permitting  burdens and environmental reviews on energy development that takes  place on non-Federal lands. These requirements are a classic example of  Washington overreach. They don't help the environment; they just keep  oil and gas in the ground and keep hard-working Americans out of work.  This legislation will create jobs and expand our economy by creating an  environment where American energy can dominate.   I want to thank the cosponsors of this legislation for their  support--Senators Hoeven, Enzi, Lee, and Hatch. I also want to thank my  colleagues in the House for starting this conversation with their bill,  which is called the SECURE American Energy Act. I look forward to  working with my colleagues to pass this legislation as quickly as  possible.       By Mr. CORNYN (for himself and Mr. Warner):   S. 2320.
