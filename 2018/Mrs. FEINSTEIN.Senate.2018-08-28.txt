 Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I have been watching as Senators have  come to the floor over the past couple days to pay tribute to John  McCain, to share their stories, and to reflect on a full life of  service to his country.   I have known John McCain for 25 years, not as long as some of my  colleagues, but long enough to take the measure of the man and to  appreciate his dedication to his family, to the U.S. military, to the  Senate, to Arizona, and to the Nation.   He was a statesman and a global citizen, and our loss is all the  deeper because we are living in a time where people like John are in  short supply.   Like many others, I had my disagreements with John and found myself  on the wrong end of his temper, but more often, I saw him as a man of  ideals and a man who stood up for what he believed in.   For me, nowhere was this as strong and clear as on the issue of  torture, and I wanted to talk a little bit about that today and really  to share my appreciation for him.   It was June 2013, and John McCain and I were visiting Guantanamo Bay,  Cuba, to see the detention facilities that had been hastily put  together after the invasion of Afghanistan in September 2001. It was a  hot, sunny, sultry day. We had toured the base, received briefings and  boxed lunches from the commander, and looked at three separate  detention facilities.   It was clear that the officers and enlisted personnel were working  under difficult conditions, dealing with enemy combatants with little  contact with the outside world and no sense of what would happen to  them.   John McCain, as always, praised the troops for their service and took  whatever time was required to take pictures with them, but he, like me  and like Presidents Bush and Obama, had called for Guantanamo to shut  down.   I remember we were flying home on the last flight of the day--after  two boat rides, after seeing the facility where forced intubations were  done to feed hunger-striking detainees, and after hearing about the  daily infractions committed by the detainees against the guards.   The conversation turned to the conditions of detention we had just  seen and the detainees being held at Naval Station Guantanamo Bay.   John opened up about his years in the Navy and his time as a prisoner  of war.   I learned for the first time the depth and breadth of his suffering,  but also his perseverance and his intensity.   John told us about his years as a captive in Hanoi and how one of the  things he and his fellow prisoners did was work out a tap code, similar  to Morse code.   They tapped on walls, day after day, year after year. They tapped out  messages. I read earlier this week of an account of tapping out poems  that other POWs had learned in school.   So there we were on that airplane, flying to Washington from  Guantanamo Bay, and John starts tapping, speaking using his code. After  all those years, he could still use the tap code like second nature.   John was unusual, but in a very good way.   As the son and grandson of admirals, John was born and bred in  military tradition and the ideals of public service. He worried that he  wouldn't live up to his family's traditions or expectations. John often  joked about how bad of a student he was at Annapolis, but even though  his father was an admiral and he could have used the help, John never  sought nor accepted special treatment.   John was brutalized. Although both arms and a leg were broken in a  plane crash in Vietnam, he received no medical treatment. His torturers  regularly beat him, rebreaking one arm and cracking his ribs. He was  held in solitary confinement for years, in unimaginable conditions.   When the North Vietnamese offered to release John early, he refused.  Other servicemen had been in custody longer, and he wasn't going to  allow his father and his grandfather's position to bring him special  favor.   But John was able to emerge from that hell with a sense of humor and  such an amazing strength of purpose. How he did so is simply  remarkable.   I knew John for decades, but it was just in the last 5 years that I  worked particularly close with him on the issue of torture.   He was already recognized in the Senate as the leader on torture  issues, having recently authored the Detainee Treatment Act and  important amendments to the Military Commissions Act to ban cruel,  inhuman, and degrading treatment or punishment during the Bush  administration.   Starting in 2009, the Intelligence Committee began work on what ended  up being a 7,000-page report on the CIA detention and interrogation  program after 9/11.   By the time we were finishing the report, John was chairman of the  Armed Services Committee.   As an ex officio member of the Intelligence Committee, he was aware  of what our investigation had found, and he knew how controversial our  findings would be. Nonetheless, he approached me and said he wanted to  help. To say I was grateful would be an understatement.   John had an innate and immutable sense of what was right. More to the  point, he knew from personal experience what torture can do, and he  knew that torture doesn't work to elicit accurate information. It is  wrong, and we shouldn't practice it.   I remember the day we released the report. I spoke on the floor about  the report and everything we found, but no one could match the  eloquence of John, who spoke immediately after me. I was so grateful to  have a friend and a partner, literally standing across the aisle on  that day.   Here is what he said about the use of torture: ``I know from personal  experience that the abuse of prisoners will produce more bad than good  intelligence.   ``I know victims of torture will offer intentionally misleading  information if they think their captors will believe it.  [[Page S5983]]    ``I know they will say whatever they think their torturers want them  to say if they believe it will stop their suffering.   ``Most of all, I know the use of torture compromises that which most  distinguishes us from our enemies--our belief that all people, even  captured enemies, possess basic human rights which are protected by  international conventions the United States not only joined but for the  most part authored.''   There was no better spokesman against torture or for the report. When  John McCain spoke on this floor in support of this report, people took  notice and paid attention.   It wasn't just John's experience that made him so powerful on this  subject. You could tell that he wholeheartedly believed what he was  saying.   Here is how John wrapped up his remarks that day: ``We have made our  way in this often dangerous and cruel world not by just strictly  pursuing our geopolitical interests, but by exemplifying our political  values and influencing other nations to embrace them.   ``When we fight to defend our security, we fight also for an idea-- not for a tribe or a twisted interpretation of an ancient religion or  for a King--but for an idea that all men are endowed by the Creator  with inalienable rights.   ``How much safer the world would be if all nations believed the same.  How much more dangerous it can become when we forget it ourselves, even  momentarily.''   I ask unanimous consent that Senator McCain's remarks from December  9, 2014, be printed in the Record immediately following my remarks.   Of course, John also didn't just talk about those issues that he  cared deeply about; he also acted.   We knew the report would shine a light on what the CIA had done, but  it didn't do anything concrete to make sure this would never happen  again.   John knew how the prior White House and Department of Justice had  concocted twisted legal analyses that said techniques like stress  positions, sleep deprivation, and waterboarding did not violate  existing law. He had already passed legislation to prevent abuses by  the Department of Defense, going back to the Detainee Treatment Act of  2005.   The Office of Legal Counsel in 2002 had given the legal approval to  the CIA, even though laws were already on the books that clearly  prohibited these acts.   U.S. domestic law already banned the use of torture, which it defined  as ``an act committed by a person acting under the color of law  specifically intended to inflict severe physical or mental pain or  suffering (other than pain or suffering incidental to lawful sanctions)  upon another person within his custody or physical control.''   The United States was and remains a signatory to the Geneva  Conventions and the Convention Against Torture, which similarly banned  torture, as well as cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment and  punishment.   Nonetheless, the CIA had developed--through the use of two  contractors, so-called enhanced interrogation techniques, and the  Department of Justice had said they were acceptable.   John believed, as did I, that if lawyers could find legal loopholes  to allow the CIA to waterboard people in its custody, then the laws  needed to be tightened.   We came up with a simple fix to make the law explicit and crystal  clear. In an amendment that John sponsored to the defense authorization  bill, we applied the restrictions of the Army Field Manual across the  government, including to the CIA.   This manual not only bans specific interrogation techniques; it lays  out those techniques that are authorized for use. Never again could a  DOJ lawyer or a CIA interrogator mistake what was lawful from what was  not.   The amendment also mandated that the International Committee of the  Red Cross be allowed access to all detainees in U.S. custody, thereby  ending the possibility of secret, undisclosed detention.   With his leadership, the amendment passed by a strong 78-21 vote, so  that torture and cruel and degrading treatment will never be allowed.   Of course, John was prolific during his years in the Senate, and many  Senators have spoken about other aspects of his work.   He traveled the world as a champion for democracy, visiting countries  like Syria and Ukraine and doing all he could to improve the lives of  millions.   He was a critical player in the process to restart diplomatic  relations with Vietnam.   John was never afraid to reach across the aisle, most notably when he  joined with Russ Feingold on campaign finance reform legislation.   John had a firm sense of right and wrong, and you saw that every day  in the issues he worked on.   John McCain's life was one of strength and of commitment. He was a  great patriot and a fine, fine U.S. Senator. He worked for this country  to better it for 60 years. That is a pretty good record, and I am  thankful for the opportunity to have known him and worked with him.   To Cindy and the rest of John's family, my heart goes out to you, but  rest well knowing that you had a great man in your lives.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:            Senator John McCain Floor Remarks--December 9, 2014         Madam President, I wish to begin by expressing my       appreciation and admiration to the personnel who serve in our       intelligence agencies, including the CIA, who are out there       every day defending our Nation.        I have read the executive summary and I also have been       briefed on the entirety of this report. I rise in support of       the release--the long-delayed releasea--of the Senate       Intelligence Committee's summarized unclassified review of       the so-called enhanced interrogation techniques that were       employed by the previous administration to extract       information from captured terrorists. It is a thorough and       thoughtful study of practices that I believe not only failed       their purpose to secure actionable intelligence to prevent       further attacks on the United States and our allies, but       actually damaged our security interests as well as our       reputation as a force for good in the world.        I believe the American people have a right--indeed a       responsibility--to know what was done in their name, how       these practices did or did not serve our interests, and how       they comported with our most important values.        I commend Chairwoman Feinstein and her staff for their       diligence in seeking a truthful accounting of policies I hope       we will never resort to again. I thank them for persevering       against persistent opposition from many members of the       intelligence community, from officials in two       administrations, and from some of our colleagues.        The truth is sometimes a hard pill to swallow. It sometimes       causes us difficulties at home and abroad. It is sometimes       used by our enemies in attempts to hurt us. But the American       people are entitled to it nonetheless. They must know when       the values that define our Nation are intentionally       disregarded by our security policies, even those policies       that are conducted in secret. They must be able to make       informed judgments about whether those policies and the       personnel who supported them were justified in compromising       our values, whether they served a greater good, or whether,       as I believe, they stained our national honor much harm, and       little practical good.        What were the policies? What was their purpose? Did they       achieve it? Did they make us safer, less safe, or did they       make no difference? What did they gain us? What did they cost       us?        What did they gain us? What did they cost us? The American       people need the answers to these questions. Yes, some things       must be kept from public disclosure to protect clandestine       operations, sources, and methods, but not the answers to       these questions. By providing them, the committee has       empowered the American people to come to their own decisions       about whether we should have employed such practices in the       past and whether we should consider permitting them in the       future.        This report strengthens self-government and ultimately, I       believe, American security and stature in the world. I thank       the committee for that valuable public service.        I have long believed some of these practices amounted to       torture as a reasonable person would define it, especially       but not only the practice of waterboarding, which is a mock       execution and an exquisite form of torture. Its use was       shameful and unnecessary, and, contrary to assertions made by       some of its defenders and as the committee's report makes       clear, it produced little useful intelligence to help us       track down the perpetrators of 9/11 or prevent new attacks       and atrocities.        I know from personal experience that the abuse of prisoners       will produce more bad than good intelligence. I know victims       of torture will offer intentionally misleading information if       they think their captors will believe it. I know they will       say whatever they think their torturers want them to say if       they believe it will stop their suffering. Most of all, I       know the use of torture compromises that which most       distinguishes us from our enemies--our belief that all       people, even captured enemies, possess basic human rights       which are protected by international  [[Page S5984]]       conventions the United States not only joined but for the       most part authored.        I know too that bad things happen in war. I know that in       war good people can feel obliged for good reasons to do       things they would normally object to and recoil from. I       understand the reasons that governed the decision to resort       to these interrogation methods, and I know that those who       approved them and those who used them were dedicated to       securing justice for victims of terrorist attacks and to       protecting Americans from further harm. I know their       responsibilities were grave and urgent and the strain of       their duty was onerous. I respect their dedication, and I       appreciate their dilemma. But I dispute wholeheartedly that       it was right for them to use these methods which this report       makes clear were neither in the best interests of justice,       nor our security, nor the ideals we have sacrificed so much       blood and treasure to defend.        The knowledge of torture's dubious efficacy and my moral       objection to the abuse of prisoners motivated my sponsorship       of the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005, which prohibits       ``cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment'' of captured       combatants, whether they wear a nation's uniform or not, and       which passed the Senate by a vote of 90 to 9.        Subsequently, I successfully offered amendments to the       Military Commissions Act of 2006, which, among other things,       prevented the attempt to weaken Common Article 3 of the       Geneva Conventions and broadened definitions in the War       Crimes Act to make the future use of waterboarding and other       ``enhanced interrogation techniques'' punishable as war       crimes.        There was considerable misinformation disseminated then       about what was and wasn't achieved using these methods in an       effort to discourage support for the legislation. There was a       good amount of misinformation used in 2011 to credit the use       of these methods with the death of Osama bin Laden. And there       is, I fear, misinformation being used today to prevent the       release of this report, disputing its findings and warning       about the security consequences of their public disclosure.        Will the report's release cause outrage that leads to       violence in some parts of the Muslim world? Yes, I suppose       that is possible and perhaps likely. Sadly, violence needs       little incentive in some quarters of the world today. But       that doesn't mean we will be telling the world something it       will be shocked to learn. The entire world already knows we       waterboarded prisoners. It knows we subjected prisoners to       various other types of degrading treatment. It knows we used       black sites, secret prisons. Those practices haven't been a       secret for a decade. Terrorists might use the report's       reidentification of the practices as an excuse to attack       Americans, but they hardly need an excuse for that. That has       been their life's calling for a while now.        What might come as a surprise not just to our enemies but       to many Americans is how little these practices did aid our       efforts to bring 9/11 culprits to justice and to find and       prevent terrorist attacks today and tomorrow. That could be a       real surprise since it contradicts the many assurances       provided by intelligence officials on the record and in       private that enhanced interrogation techniques were       indispensable in the war against terrorism. And I suspect the       objection of those same officials to the release of this       report is really focused on that disclosure--torture's       ineffectiveness--because we gave up much in the expectation       that torture would make us safer--too much.        Obviously, we need intelligence to defeat our enemies, but       we need reliable intelligence. Torture produces more       misleading information than actionable intelligence. And what       the advocates of harsh and cruel interrogation methods have       never established is that we couldn't have gathered as good       or more reliable intelligence from using humane methods.        The most important lead we got in the search for bin Laden       came from using conventional interrogation methods. I think       it is an insult to the many intelligence officers who have       acquired good intelligence without hurting or degrading       prisoners to assert that we can't win these wars without such       methods. Yes, we can and we will.        But in the end torture's failure to serve its intended       purpose isn't the main reason to oppose its use. I have often       said and I will always maintain that this question isn't       about our enemies; it is about us. It is about who we were,       who are, and who we aspire to be. It is about how we       represent ourselves to the world.        We have made our way in this often dangerous and cruel       world not by just strictly pursuing our geopolitical       interests but by exemplifying our political values and       influencing other nations to embrace them. When we fight to       defend our security, we fight also for an idea--not for a       tribe or a twisted interpretation of an ancient religion or       for a King but for an idea that all men are endowed by the       Creator with inalienable rights. How much safer the world       would be if all nations believed the same. How much more       dangerous it can become when we forget it ourselves, even       momentarily.        Our enemies act without conscience. We must not. This       executive summary of the committee's report makes clear that       acting without conscience isn't necessary. It isn't even       helpful in winning this strange and long war we are fighting.       We should be grateful to have that truth affirmed.        Now, let us reassert the contrary proposition: that is it       essential to our success in this war that we ask those who       fight it for us to remember at all times that they are       defending a sacred ideal of how nations should be governed       and conduct their relations with others--even our enemies.        Those of us who give them this duty are obliged by history,       by our Nation's highest ideals and the many terrible       sacrifices made to protect them, by our respect for human       dignity, to make clear we need not risk our national honor to       prevail in this or any war. We need only remember in the       worst of times, through the chaos and terror of war, when       facing cruelty, suffering, and loss, that we are always       Americans and different, stronger, and better than those who       would destroy us.        Madam President, I yield the floor.
