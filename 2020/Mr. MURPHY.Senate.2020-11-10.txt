 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, a Republican candidate in California by  the name of Errol Webber lost his race for Congress by 72 points, and  yet he is not conceding that he has lost. He says:         I'm going to the Los Angeles County Registrar's Office to       audit the vote counting procedures. I will NOT concede. Every       LEGAL vote needs to be counted!    Just up the road in Maryland, a Republican candidate by the name of  Kim Klacik lost by 40 points, and she is refusing to concede. She  retweeted a post from President Trump in which she claimed that the  election was stolen, and she wrote:         I beat my opponent on day of & in-person early voting,       along with absentee. However, 97k mail in ballots were found       in his favor?    My colleagues, there is an epidemic of delusion that is spreading out  from the White House and infecting the entire Republican Party in the  wake of this election, and it presents a real threat to this country.   President Trump didn't win the election. Every single one of my  colleagues knows this. And he didn't just lose. He lost by a pretty  substantial margin. He lost by 4.3 percent of the popular vote, likely  around 70 electoral votes when all the counting is done.   And while the results haven't been certified yet, this isn't the  election in 2000. There aren't any hanging chads. We are not arguing  about 500 votes here or there. In Michigan, the margin today is  148,000. In Nevada, the margin is 36,000. In Pennsylvania, it is  47,000. In Wisconsin, it is 20,000. In Georgia, it is 12,000. In  Arizona, it is 14,000. Thousands and thousands of votes are these  margins.   Hillary Clinton, in 2016, lost by less than the President did in  Pennsylvania and Michigan and by about the same amount in Wisconsin,  and she conceded the day after the election. Now, this is important,  and I think we need to talk about it here because it has real  consequences for democracy and for national security.   Why hasn't the President conceded? Now, it is not because there was  voter fraud or because the election was stolen from him. We are a week  out, and the President is still desperately searching for evidence of  fraud. He won't find it because it doesn't exist. It doesn't exist in  Pennsylvania or Michigan or Wisconsin or Georgia.   The President has empowered the Department of Justice to now go out  and launch investigations of voter fraud despite a longstanding  precedent for the DOJ to stay out of elections if their actions could  be determinative. But the President is so desperate now to fill in his  mythology, his narrative, with facts that he doesn't have, that he is  sending the DOJ on this massive national fishing expedition.   He hasn't conceded--not because there is fraud. There hasn't been. He  is not conceding because he believes that there is a chance he could  remain as President without having won the election, so long as  congressional Republicans are willing to stick with him step by step by  step, and, so far, there is no evidence that congressional Republicans  are ever going to step away from President Trump's delusional assault  on democracy.   Senator McConnell said this week that the President is ``within his  rights'' to fight the election. That is of course true. The President  can keep filing frivolous legal challenges if he wants. We are not  going to stop him from doing that. But just because he has the right to  mount these legal challenges, that doesn't mean that Republicans here  have to support him in those efforts if they contravene the interests  of democracy and the interests of a smooth transition of power.   Today, Republicans support the President's refusal to concede. They  support his lawsuits. They call on election officials--most recently,  in Georgia--who refuse to bend their knee to Trump to resign, and they  endorsed the President's decision to refuse to begin the transition.   This may sort of seem like a sideshow now to the inevitability of a  transfer of power, but what is next? What if President Trump asks  Republicans here to contest the selection of electors? What if he gets  the message from Republicans in Congress that if you are willing to  support all the steps he has taken since Tuesday, that you will  continue to support his efforts to try to remain in office despite  losing both the popular vote and the electoral college? That is within  his rights, to ask you to support a contest of electors. But will you  do it? What so far have we seen to suggest that there is an end to your  decision to put your allegiance to this President above an allegiance  to the country?   The Secretary of State was asked today if he thought there would be a  smooth transition of power from President Trump to the winner of the  election, Vice President and President-Elect Biden. And Secretary  Pompeo said: ``There will be a smooth transition to a second Trump  administration.''   Listen, these guys aren't playing. This isn't just for show. They are  going to keep pushing the bounds of democracy until somebody stops  them. It is logical to ask: If Republicans have been willing to support  every conspiracy that the President has engaged in over the last week,  then why wouldn't they support the next set of attacks on democracy  that this President engages in?   How far are Republicans willing to go in their attacks against the  decision of voters?   Now, for the President, there is really no downside to what he is  doing right now. Either he steals the election or he grows his  political power, because we have learned in the last 24 hours that the  President is raising money today online from his supporters, not for a  fund that is designed to strictly finance a recount effort but for a  new political action committee that he has established that will fund  his political efforts over the next 4 years. The button you click may  give you the idea that you are supporting the President's recount but,  in fact, you are helping him to amass resources that will allow him to  be a major political presence for the next 4 years. So either the  President is successful in continuing this assault on the transition of  power or he is able to amass resources that help him into the future.   There is no downside for the President. There is a big downside for  the rest of us. There is a big downside for this country.   In the short run, the country's national security is threatened by a  messy transition. This has been covered, I think, well today, but,  traditionally, the President-elect would be able to start getting  briefings on national security threats, would start to get access to  classified information, and would begin to be able to do background  checks on individuals that he would like to be part of his national  security cabinet. Traditionally, those are among the first  confirmations that move through this body, the President's national  security team. All of that is being delayed by a President who refuses  to begin a transition and a Republican Senate that refuses to put  pressure on the President to change his mind.   But, also, and in some ways more insidious, is the attack on the rule  of law and the idea of peaceful transition of power itself. The  narrative that President Trump is spreading and that congressional  Republicans are facilitating right now that the election was stolen or  rigged, it isn't being written on a white board that is going to be  neatly and tidily erased as soon as 2021 shows up. No, the work that is  being done right now by the Republican Party to undermine faith in our  elections will have a very long, very long tale. And when the American  people or a large  [[Page S6632]]  percentage of them lose faith in elections, when they are told by  leaders they trust that elections that were actually held legitimately  are illegitimate, then, those individuals, of course, will naturally  lose faith in public institutions themselves. If all the people who got  elected were illegitimately chosen, then, so must be the actions they  take once they are in office.    Now, maybe that is consistent with the general Republican project  over the last several decades. I have watched as Republicans have  engaged in a withering assault on the public sector. The whole idea  from Republicans has been that government is illegitimate by its very  nature and can't do anything to help you or to solve your problems. But  that idea, if it is, in fact, the goal of my Republican colleagues to  delegitimize public institutions by delegitimizing elections, is really  dangerous for two reasons. One, don't assume that democracy can survive  this. If the 45 percent of the country that supports Donald Trump  doesn't really believe that elections are legitimate, I am not sure  that democracy hangs around for another 100 years. But, second, we are  living in a moment where it is really important for people to have  faith in public institutions. There is no way for us to turn the corner  on this pandemic unless people believe what leaders are telling them  about how to conduct themselves or about how we are going to administer  a vaccine or about why the business around the corner from you is  limiting the number of people who can enter it. In the middle of a  pandemic that has killed going on 250,000 Americans, losing faith in  public institutions is deadly.   The President is delusional. There was no voter fraud. He lost. The  American people, by a large margin, chose Joe Biden as President of the  United States, and this delusion is not a quaint sideshow. It is an  assault on our democracy that will have consequences for the future  viability of democracy but also for the viability of public  institutions to meet crises like the one that we stand in the middle of  today.   The President's behavior and the behavior of Republicans in Congress  who support him is dangerously unpatriotic. When we arrive in the  Senate we swear an oath to our country, not to our party, and right now  our President and congressional Republicans are not living up to that  oath.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
