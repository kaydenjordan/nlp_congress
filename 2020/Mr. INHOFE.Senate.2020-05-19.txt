 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent, at the  conclusion of the remarks by the Senator from Connecticut, that I be  recognized to speak for whatever time I may consume.    Madam President, I was sitting through the last two  speakers and listening to them. You can tell that it is an election  year. The Democrats want to defeat President Trump, and I think  sometimes a tactic to use is to get someone's strongest point and try  to turn it into his weakest point. In this case, we have heard in just  the last few minutes that the President is handling the coronavirus  completely wrong, that he is critical of and then he was friendly to--I  couldn't quite figure out the relationship with China. I know the  Democrats in this Chamber are generally perceived as the close friends  of China and President Xi and the rest of them.   Also, to talk about what Speaker Pelosi has done in terms of the bill  that was passed in the House and the criticism that we are not taking  up that bill, well, all that bill is--we are not supposed to be talking  about anything in all of this heavy spending except doing something  about coronavirus. This is something that no one had anything to do  with. We didn't know it was going to happen. We had no preparation for  it. I have never experienced it in my life. Yet I do remember so well  when this body, this Senate, was working on a coronavirus bill and we  were to be voting on it on a Sunday at 6 o'clock in the evening, and  the Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, came dancing in. It was the  first time I even knew she was in town because the House wasn't in  session, and she stopped it. She used her influence to try to stop it  and successfully did stop it. The vote was taking place at 6 p.m. on a  Sunday night, and nothing happened except a stall from then until 6  p.m. on Thursday night, when we finally did vote on it. In the  meantime, how many days passed? How many people died in the meantime?   Then, when they come up in the House and they come up with a bill  that is supposedly their answer to the coronavirus, it has nothing to  do with coronavirus. It has to do with the very liberal Democratic  agenda taking advantage of the fact that this crisis is on us in order  to use this to try to get things passed. I am talking about--now, I  don't have any notes down here with me. I don't know whether she is  using gun control or what other efforts they were using in that bill,  but it is one that has no place in the discussion when we are talking  about coronavirus.   The tragedy there, the people dying--and to credit this President, I  have to say, he has done a great job in addressing this. He is the one  who, every single day, is there with top medical people and afterward,  at the end of the day, having a news conference and getting from the  public what can we do better that we haven't been doing. He has handled  it in a very, very effective way. But that is not why I am here on the  floor    Madam President, as in legislative session, I ask  unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the consideration of S.  Res. 583, submitted earlier today.    I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed to,  the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be considered  made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.    I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, for the Committee on Armed Services I  report favorably the following nomination lists which were printed in  the Records on the dates indicated, and ask unanimous consent, to save  the expense of reprinting on the Executive Calendar that these  nominations lie at the Secretary's desk for the information of  Senators.    Mr. President, I have a request for one committee to meet  during today's session of the Senate. It has the approval of the  Majority and Minority leaders.   Pursuant to rule XXVI, paragraph 5(a), of the Standing Rules of the  Senate, the following committee is authorized to meet during today's  session of the Senate:                         Committee on Armed Services    The Committee on Armed Services is authorized to meet during the  session of the Senate on Tuesday, May 19, 2020, at 2:30 p.m., to  conduct a hearing on nominations.                            ____________________
