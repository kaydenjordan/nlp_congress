 Mr. President, as my colleagues and the Presiding Officer  may know, I spent many years of my life in the Navy. I spent some 23  years, starting at the age of 21, on Active and Reserve Duty in the  U.S. Navy as a naval flight officer, and I spent most of those 23 years  as a P-3 aircraft mission commander. I was even, for a limited period  of time, the air intelligence officer for my P-3 squadron when we were  deployed in Southeast Asia.   I flew hundreds of missions during both the Vietnam war and the Cold  War, conducting surveillance operations, gathering intelligence on the  Soviets and on others who undermine and destroy the American way of  life.   As a Cold War warrior, watching an American President yesterday  blatantly ignore attacks on a democracy and our intelligence agencies  was beyond galling. It was reprehensible--reprehensible.   Four days ago, Special Counsel Mueller indicted 12 Russian  intelligence officers for interfering in our democratic elections in  2016. That same day, last Friday--Friday the 13th--the Director of  National Intelligence, our old colleague, Dan Coats from Indiana, said  that our country's digital infrastructure is literally under attack.  Here is what he said:         The warning signs are there. The system is blinking. It is       why I believe we are at a critical point.    That was on Friday the 13th.   Yesterday, our President, with the entire world watching, chose to  attack not the Soviets, not the Russians, but Bob Mueller. He is one of  the finest people I have ever known and worked with. He attacked Bob  Mueller and rebuked the U.S. intelligence community--with whom I have  worked as a member of the Homeland Security committee for any number of  years, as has our Presiding Officer--instead of siding with the 17 U.S.  intelligence agencies, all of whom agreed unanimously, without dissent,  that the Soviets, the Russians, intervened in our election in 2016 in  an effort to throw the election to Donald Trump and to take it away  from Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee. There is no question that  is what they did.   Our President chose to ignore that, and instead of admiring and  speaking to the work of the intelligence agencies and concurring with  them yesterday, he decided to side with an authoritarian thug, Vladimir  Putin. That was a defining moment in our Nation's history.   I think it is a sad moment in our Nation's history. We ought to move  immediately to pass bipartisan legislation, introduced in the Senate  earlier this year, to allow Bob Mueller's critical work and that of the  people working with him to be completed without the constant threat of  political interference.
