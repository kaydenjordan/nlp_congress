 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1  minute in morning business    Mr. President, representative government is a two-way  street. To hold up my part of that commitment, I am on my 40th year of  holding at least one Q&A in every county every year. Over the past 2  weeks, I had Q&As in 29 counties. Iowans raised their concerns about  the virus, unemployment insurance, the rising cost of prescription  drugs, China, and access to rural broadband.   Iowans applauded Congress's swift action on programs like the  Paycheck Protection Program and getting much needed resources to our  rural healthcare workers.   As always, I will continue to bring Iowans' voices to the  policymaking tables, and I look forward to finishing my annual 99  county meetings later this year.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
