 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 1091. This  resolution  [[Page H10065]]  calls the atrocities committed against the Rohingya what they are-- genocide--and asks the government of Burma to release two innocent  journalists who were framed for helping to bring these crimes to light.   I want to thank my predecessor, as chair of the Subcommittee on Asia  and the Pacific, Congressman Chabot, and Ranking Member Engel for  introducing this resolution.   Since August 2017, 700,000 Rohingya have fled their homes in Rakhine  to neighboring Bangladesh to escape the horrible violence perpetrated  by the Burmese military. In total, almost a million Rohingya refugees  have been driven out of their homes in northern Rakhine and are  sheltering in Bangladesh.   They, the Rohingya, didn't just decide to pick up all their  belongings one day and leave. They are fearing for their lives, and so  they left.   The United Nations released a report just months ago asserting that  the Burmese military systematically targeted civilians in a manner  consistent with genocidal intent. This fact-finding mission and other  international NGOs have documented the violence, including torture;  rape; killing unarmed civilians, including women and children; and  burning down the Rohingya villages.   Make no mistake; this is genocide.   In a recent committee hearing on Burma, I spoke about the importance  of journalists documenting these atrocities. However, we are seeing  journalists inside Burma being punished and jailed for doing the basic  requirements of their job.   This resolution rightly calls for the release of Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe  Oo, the two Reuters journalists who were framed wrongfully and  sentenced by the Burmese government to over 7 years in jail after  investigating the very violence we are calling a genocide here today.   How many more times do we and the world allow this to happen again?  We either stand together as civilized nations, call this what it is-- genocide--or we look the other way again as nations of the world did in  World War II in Nazi, Germany, or during the Darfur genocide.   We either are serious about this or not.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to join my fellow colleagues as an original  cosponsor on this resolution and urge the rest of the House to join in  support. When we say never again, we must mean never again. The House  is today taking an important first step and speaking clearly on these  atrocities.    Mr. Speaker, with this resolution, the United States  recognizes its longstanding and multifaceted relationship with the  Republic of Korea, one that runs much deeper than the headlines of  today's news may convey.   Once among the world's poorest countries and devastated by war less  than 70 years ago, you would find it difficult to believe the stories  of Korea's past by visiting Seoul today. I led a bipartisan codel to  Seoul this September to meet with members of the parliament, Foreign  Affairs, Trade, and Defense Ministries, and North Korean defectors. The  U.S.-South Korea partnership is so much more than a military alliance.  Our partnership cultivated the Miracle on the Han River and showed the  world how a nation can transition from aid to trade.   As stated, South Korea is now our sixth largest trading partner and  tenth largest importer of agricultural products. South Korea has lived  under the threat of war since its founding, but it has managed to lift  its people out of extreme poverty and become an aid donor, a leader in  international fora, one of the greatest sources of investment in the  United States, and a shining example to many other countries in the  region.   As revisionist powers challenge the vision and values that underpin  the South Korean miracle, the United States needs partners more today  than ever before, partners that embody and promote the open border from  which we have both deeply benefited.   With this resolution, the House recognizes the United States' special  bond with the Republic of Korea, and the need to deepen and cultivate  this partnership to promote peace and prosperity of both nations well  into the future.    Mr. Speaker, had I been present, I would have voted ``yea''  on rollcall No. 428.                            ____________________
