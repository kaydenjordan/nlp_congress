 Mr. President, another wave of economic optimism is  breaking across America after last month's historic tax reform  legislation. Already, for weeks, we have seen special bonuses, pay  increases, and other tax reform benefits delivered to workers across  the Nation.   These immediate benefits are just the first fruits. Tax reform is  also planting the seeds of long-term wage growth and job creation by  making America a more attractive place for entrepreneurship and for  investment.   We learned last week that the automaker Fiat Chrysler is renewing  production lines in America where prohibitive business taxes once stood  in the way. Now, 2,500 new jobs are coming to Detroit, thanks to tax  reform. Just yesterday, I was pleased to announce that Humana, which  employs more than 12,000 Kentuckians, is accelerating pay incentives  and increasing its minimum hourly wage because of tax reform. The good  news keeps coming. Toyota and Mazda are doubling down on existing  investments in the United States, announcing plans to create 4,000 new  jobs in Huntsville, AL.   The world is noticing that America is open for business, and in large  part it is because we have shaken off an outdated, burdensome Tax Code.  Reforming the Tax Code was not easy. It was made even more challenging  when none of our Democratic colleagues in the House or the Senate--not  one--stood with taxpayers and job creators to vote for this once-in-a- generation tax relief, but thanks to Republican majorities in Congress  and a Republican White House, the benefits for working Americans are  just beginning.                            ____________________     Mr. President, now, on another matter, the Senate will  soon vote to reauthorize important provisions of the FISA Amendments  Act. This includes section 702, one of the most important tools used by  our national security community to combat terrorism and to keep  Americans safe. It gives our law enforcement and intelligence  communities the ability to collect communications from foreign  terrorists on foreign soil who wish harm to America and our allies.  This capability is absolutely vital to the success of defense and  intelligence operations.   To be absolutely clear, section 702 does not allow the targeting of  American citizens, nor does it permit the targeting of anyone of any  nationality who is known to be located here in the United States. Five  years ago, Congress reauthorized the title with overwhelming bipartisan  support. Today, it is time to do so one more time.   It is no secret that the world remains dangerous. Terrorist groups  remain as intent today as they did on September 11, 2001, on harming  Americans and those working with us overseas. As the tragedies of that  day become a more distant memory, we cannot grow lax and deny our  defense and intelligence communities the tools and resources they  require to prevent future attacks.   I look forward to renewing the bipartisan consensus on this issue and  voting to reauthorize this important provision very soon.  [[Page S214]]                                ____________________     Mr. President, now, on another matter, as we all know,  Congress has until Friday to reach an agreement that ensures continued  funding for the Federal Government. By now, it is clear we are not yet  ready to move ahead with a major agreement on long-term funding for our  Armed Forces, nor on our immigration policy. Serious, bipartisan talks  are underway on these issues and other key priorities. Compromise  solutions are not out of reach, but for now, Congress needs to keep the  government running. There is no cause whatsoever for manufacturing a  crisis and holding up funding for the vital services of the Federal  Government.   What is more, the near-term solution that Congress must pass this  week will not only provide uninterrupted government funding, it will  also contain a 6-year reauthorization of the State Children's Health  Insurance Program. This is a Federal program that covers nearly 9  million children in low-income families. It ensures that economic  hardship will not stand between struggling American families and  medical coverage for their children. S-CHIP enjoys widespread,  bipartisan support, with dedicated champions on both sides of the  aisle.   The funding bill we will take up in the Senate will reauthorize the  program for 6 years, even longer than the bipartisan compromise the  Senate Finance Committee reached just last year. So Senators face a lot  of hard decisions, but this is not one of them. A bill that prevents a  government shutdown and funds S-CHIP for up to 6 years should be a  simple choice for every Senator in this Chamber, and until very  recently, our Democratic colleagues agreed. ``No-brainer'' was the  exact phrase my colleague, the senior Senator from California, recently  used on the Senate floor when discussing S-CHIP renewal.   The newest Member of this body, the junior Senator from Alabama,  campaigned on this very issue. As Senator-elect, he insisted that his  future colleagues should ``stop playing political football with the  health care of our children.'' He called it ``absolutely unacceptable  for partisan fighting to delay renewing funding for CHIP.''   I hope my friends, the Democratic leaders, are listening to their own  Members because recently some have intimated that Democrats will  filibuster any funding bill whatsoever over the issue of illegal  immigration. I find it difficult to believe that my Democratic  colleagues would want to shut down the government for American citizens  and vote down a 6-year reauthorization of health insurance for American  children all over illegal immigration.   Bipartisan negotiations over the DACA issue and other issues in  immigration policy are certainly important, and they are ongoing. Our  responsibility is to continue those discussions, not to jeopardize them  by ginning up a manufactured crisis over an artificial deadline. We  have until March, at least, to complete our ongoing negotiations on  immigration. We have until Friday to fund the government.   I would urge my Democratic friends to honor their stated commitments  to join in a bipartisan effort to keep the government funded and  reauthorize S-CHIP for struggling families across our country.                            ____________________     Mr. President, now, finally, on an entirely different  matter, I would like to say a few words about Reb Brownell, a key  member of my team who is departing the Senate today.   Reb has served with distinction in my office for nearly 13 years. He  began as an aide on foreign affairs, defense, and veterans issues.  Since then, he has risen through the ranks, now serving as my personal  office deputy chief of staff.   Reb is a tireless worker and a loyal public servant. He has been my  point person on more important issues than I can name, including my  support for democracy in Burma and research on prominent Kentucky  leaders throughout history. I know he is especially proud of our work  to help Dr. Noelle Hunter bring her daughter back to America.   I will miss more than Reb's fine work. I will miss him challenging my  title as the biggest history buff in the office, and all his colleagues  will miss Reb's genuine warmth, his quick wit and good humor, and his  readiness to mentor young staffers. Of course, nobody is perfect. Reb  is a diehard Michigan State fan. Fortunately, he never let it get in  the way of serving the people of the Commonwealth of Kentucky.   I am sorry to see Reb go. I thank him for his service, and I wish him  and his wife Sandy every success in their future endeavors.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I understand that there is a bill at  the desk due for a second reading.    Mr. President, in order to place the bill on the  calendar under the provisions of rule XIV, I object to further  proceedings.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 11 a.m.,  Thursday, January 18; further, that following the prayer and pledge,  morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved  to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later  in the day, and morning business be closed; further, that following  leader remarks, the Senate resume consideration of the motion to concur  in the House amendment to accompany S. 139; finally, that the time  following leader remarks until 12:15 p.m. be equally divided between  the two leaders or their designees.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order, following the remarks of Senators Graham,  Flake, and our Democratic colleagues.
