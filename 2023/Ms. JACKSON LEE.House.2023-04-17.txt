 Mr. Speaker, I am delighted but sad but empowered  but anguished but yet fulfilled but yet rising but yet encouraged but  yet ready to fight this evening. I thank the gentlewoman from Florida  for her distinguished leadership and friendship.   Mr. Speaker, I am delighted as well with the gentleman from Illinois  for his shining leadership and transformational changes that are  happening in and around his district in Chicago.   I am honored to be here with my other colleagues that are here. I  thank Chairman Horsford and Chairwoman Beatty, emeritus of the  Congressional Black Caucus, and I am honored to again call the  Congressional Black Caucus the conscience of the Congress, and, yes,  the conscience of the Nation. We can say that because in our midst we  have had the Honorable John Lewis.   Mr. Speaker, I want to go down memory lane just a bit. As I do so and  before I speak to the irony of the connection of the Tennessee Three to  the historical record. Does anyone remember the Georgia 33, as we have  brought to highlight? There were 33 Black legislators right after the  Civil War, 1866 to 1868, proud and standing tall because they had some  way of gaining the right to vote and the people there--the freed  slaves, after the 13th Amendment was eliminated ending slavery in the  United States--our freed slaves could vote. Property owners, as I  believe.    They elected 33 Black legislators, and they were proud. You could see  them with their button-down suits, speaking the best English they  could, and fighting for their constituents. That is what we are to do  here. Listening to the people and having the ear of their constituents.   Yet, within a few moments of their great victory, election to the  Georgia Assembly they were expelled, thrown out because of the color of  their skin, which began the demise of reconstruction and the Black  codes and the horrors of the rage of the Klan and others leading into  the 1900s.   Mr. Speaker, I am reminded of George White who stood on the floor in  [[Page H1747]]  1901, who had been drawn out of this Congress, a Member of Congress,  and said: The Negro will rise like the phoenix.   Then in 1966--I am still stunned--a brilliant young man by the name  of Julian Bond was duly-elected by the constituents, he had their ear,  and they had his ear. A young man. He had all the willingness to do  what was right as an elected member of the Georgia Assembly, and he was  expelled for his supporting the fact of the SNCC, the organization that  he previously led, indicating that the Vietnam war violated  international law.   He didn't speak of the soldiers, which I have repeatedly said that  our soldiers put on uniforms unselfishly. We never accuse them. They  fight and they die. They died in Vietnam from all of our communities  from the South to the North to the East to West, from our backyards.  But because he expressed a democratic belief, meaning his right to a  belief that might have been different, and because of democracy he had  the right to speak, he was expelled.   Now we come to the fear and the absolute outrage of lack of  understanding. I am baffled by the expulsion of the Tennessee Three:  Representative Pearson, Representative Jones, and Representative  Johnson.   All they did was come to hear the cries of America's best, the youth,  the children, crying out again: How much more bloodshed can we take?  The Congressional Black Caucus has been a leading force joining with  our colleagues.   Mr. Speaker, let me say this tonight--we come from the same State-- let me just say this. We all tend to oratory, we are passionate and  emotional. After all these years and all the deaths of children, can we  find even a sense of Congress that will lead us to be able to condemn  gun violence as being the number one killer of our children through  homicide?   The very fact that four children died and other innocent persons in  Nashville just a mere couple of weeks ago, I want you to know that I  feel personal pain when the news rises up in the early morning hours of  what happened the night before, or the weekend, I have a personal pain.   My tenure here was a tenure during the assault weapons ban, but in  the midst there was Columbine. The numbers showed that they went down,  the assault weapon incidences. Now I am living with Sandy Hook. I am  living with Parkland, Virginia Tech. I am living with Texas Tech. I am  living with any number of those in Texas from the Walmart to the church  to Uvalde where I went and talked with the families and went to  funerals and cried and wondered why children were dead--19 of them.   These young men in Tennessee were walking the pathway of the Georgia  33 and Julian Bond. As history reflects, they did nothing wrong. These  three individuals, one who was not expelled, did nothing wrong as well.  They were representing their constituents. They were nonviolent. They  were in the midst of civil disobedience. They could not be heard. They  were on the floor where one could do a lot of things.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record an article titled ``The `All  Things Being Equal Test' Part II: Blatant Racism in the Tennessee  House.''                         [From Forbes, Apr 7, 2023]     The `All Things Being Equal Test' Part II: Blatant Racism in The                              Tennessee House                            (By Susan Harmeling)         The shocking but not surprising expulsion of two young       Black men by the Tennessee State Legislature while their 60-      year-old White colleague was spared ouster despite breaking       house rules in the exact same way is a blatant display of       racism, pure and simple. It may sound ridiculously obvious,       but it needs saying. Representatives Justin Jones and Justin       Pearson were clearly kicked out because they are Black, and       also supposedly not ``apologetic'' enough for their White,       male counterparts who decided to pursue the nuclear option       and remove them from office instead of using other, lesser       punishments such as censure. Representative Gloria Johnson,       who a few days earlier had joined Jones and Pearson in taking       to the house floor to demand an assault weapons ban following       the slaughter of three little kids in their school, was       protected by her whiteness, as she herself publicly stated.        This is an important moment in our society as it exposes       both an ugly truth and an opportunity for progress. The ugly       truth is obvious: two young, Black men in Tennessee--the       birthplace of the Ku Klux Klan--were expelled for breaking       rules of ``decorum'' while their White colleague who, again,       joined them every step of the way still has her job. As Rep.       Jones pointed out, there have been only two other expulsions       from the Tennessee House in the last 157 years. In l980, a       representative was found guilty of accepting a bribe while in       office and in 2016, another was expelled over allegations of       sexual harassment. Recently, neither an arrest on charges of       domestic violence nor admitted child molestation nor alleged       urination on the seat of a fellow legislator was enough to       warrant these offenders expulsion, but loudly protesting       inaction on gun violence after three 9-year-olds are       executed--and especially protesting such horror while Black--      was reason enough for a Republican supermajority to take this       extreme action. In a particularly repulsive and condescending       comment, Rep. Andrew Farmer, R-Seviervi11e, blamed Pearson       for throwing a ``temper tantrum with an adolescent       bullhorn''. He continued addressing Pearson, ``That yearning       for attention, that's what you wanted? Well, you're getting       it now.'' Farmer may as well have preceded his ugly rant with       the word ``boy'' for good measure.        But take heart! Farmer is right in one sense--these young       men are clearly going to get attention, just not the kind of       attention Farmer was hoping for. This is clearly not the last       we have heard from Jones and Pearson, both of whom are       extraordinarily talented young legislators and orators. In       fact, the Tennessee Republicans picked the wrong targets if       they are hoping for this issue to go away. I personally have       hope that their strong and powerful voices, particularly on       the epidemic of gun violence, will not be silenced by this       temporary, unjustified setback.        I would like to focus on the opportunity--and more       specifically the lesson--that this sorry episode presents.       Too often, white people (or any people whose own ``tribe''       acts in such a blatantly racist way) look for alternative       explanations for such behavior. But if it walks like racism       and quacks like racism, it is racism. Due to our tendency       toward homophily, our knee-jerk reaction is to start       explaining away the bad behavior of people who look like we       do. But we have to stop it. And the best way to stop it is to       put the episode through the ``all-things-being-equal'' test       (otherwise know as the ``but for'' test), as in, would these       young men have been expelled ``but for'' their race? Well, in       this case, our answer was served up on a silver platter       because Rep. Johnson was spared while her two colleagues lost       their seats.        Typically, it's a bit more subtle. Would I have been called       ``confident'' in teaching evaluations but for my gender? The       answer is no, because not one single one of my male       counterparts ever saw that adjective on their evaluations.       Their confidence was simply assumed. Would Joe Biden have       called Barack Obama ``clean and articulate'' but for Obama's       race? No, because in the next breath he called him the first       ``mainstream African American''. Would a young woman I       recently interviewed have been asked by an older male       colleague what she was making her boyfriend for dinner had       the gender roles been reversed? Again, very doubtful (she       swears she doesn't cook and never told this man that she       does). Would George Floyd still be here today but for his       race? Would a young, Black female former student of mine have       been told by her White male boss that she could get promoted       more quickly if she just ``told a few more jokes'' ``but       for'' her race and gender? You get the idea. . .        Assumptions, stereotypes, and the natural human desire to       hang around with our ``Amen Choir'' only serve to further       divide us and to keep certain members of society from       reaching their full potential. I suspect that those       conservative, White, male Tennessee legislators would be a       lot more comfortable with Reps. Jones and Pearson if they       tried harder to conform to their ways of dress, behavior,       speech and ``decorum''. In fact, Representative Pearson's       previous decision to wear a traditional, African dashiki on       the house floor really got some of those guys riled up.        But the promise of America is that it is a melting pot       where we are called by our better angels to treat all fellow       citizens with respect and tolerance. And the punishment for       rule-breaking (or law-breaking) should be proportionate to       the transgression, and the same for everyone. The quest for       fairness in all areas of society, from law to politics to       business to our many daily personal interactions, would       benefit from the regular application of the all-things-being-      equal test--``but for'' the individual's race, gender, age,       sexual orientation, etc, would things have played out in the       same way? In Tennessee, if you're a young, Black male in the       statehouse, the answer is clearly no.     Mr. Speaker, I come today to be able to join my  colleagues and to again ask for the question of justice and democracy  and freedom, and to be able to salute these three. To say that in their  name, from Tennessee, now from Alabama where teenagers were murdered,  can we not do our work on the floor of the House: from abandoning  assault weapons, from passing a sensible storage bill, the Emily  Vaughan storage bill, to getting rid of ghost guns, to making red flag  laws permanent and not voluntary--because of what happened in  Louisville, mental health concerns, and a number of other places. Can  we not do this?  [[Page H1748]]                                     time  2015    I simply close with respect to the late Representative John Lewis. I  simply close and pay tribute to him, for it was before your tenure, Mr.  Speaker, that we did take to the floor of the House to sit with his  leadership in the pain of another shooting of children way back during  Parkland. We couldn't take it anymore. I wonder if this is not the  moment when we can find common ground. I am going to look for my  friends on both sides of the aisle to see whether we can find common  ground on some form of gun safety legislation. Then I will say to those  Tennessee Three what John Lewis said: Never give in, never give out,  and never give up.   I pay tribute to them and all others who have never given up, never  given out, and never given in   God bless all of you, and God bless the United States of America.   Mr. Speaker, last week, we witnessed acts reminiscent of the  extraordinary punitive action against lawmakers that can be traced back  in Tennessee's deeply rooted racist history.   In fact, the third time since the Civil War era that the Tennessee  House has expelled a lawmaker from its ranks and threatens to further  inflame the partisan rancor within a bitterly divided state.   The silencing of the voices of two Black members for peacefully  protesting gun violence is not only racist and anti-democratic, but  also morally bankrupt, and out of step with the overwhelming majority  of Americans who believe that we need common sense gun control reforms  to save lives.   The expulsions of Tennessee State Representative Justin Jones and  Representative Justin Pearson--two Black duly elected members  representing minority districts--makes clear that racism is alive and  well in Tennessee, and in America.   If we want to progressively advance as a democracy, we must recognize  and acknowledge these ugly truths and work towards eradicating racism  when and where it rears its ugly head.   These expulsions showcase is a harsh and racist retaliation against  Representatives Jones and Pearson because they rightfully supported  peaceful student protestors and demanded that the Republican majority  in the legislature do more to protect communities against gun violence  in the aftermath of the Covenant School shooting.   I ask, why have we come this far to achieve progress for our  democracy to go backwards?   What occurred in the Tennessee Legislature and to our fellow  lawmakers was a blow to our democracy.   We must be cognizant of that.   This should concern every American because the hallmark of a vibrant  and healthy democracy is the very thing the Republicans in the  Tennessee Legislature shut down: Freedom of Speech.   It is hard to ignore the racial dynamic that played out. Its clear  race is involved when two Black members were expelled and not the white  member for the same alleged offense.   Tennessee Speaker Sexton comparing children, parents, teachers and  their representatives--who only want children to be safe from gun  violence in the classroom--to insurrectionists shows how morally- bankrupt Republicans are in our country.   There is absolutely no comparison between that peaceful protest, and  the violence in the U.S. Capitol on January 6th.   I stand today to acknowledge, support, and engage as much as possible  to make sure reinstatement is upheld, equal democracy is demonstrated  across all levels of government no matter the party affiliation, and we  move forward as a democracy.   We must be weary, however, that this extraordinary abuse of power in  Tennessee is an ominous sign of what is currently taking place and what  may still lie ahead in other state legislatures.   These anti-democracy efforts are spreading in red states around the  country, including: the Texas State TEA's move to take control of  Houston schools, removing the elected school board and superintendent;  and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis's abuse of power in removing a  prosecutor for political reasons.   In Florida, Governor Ron DeSantis abused his power by removing an  elected prosecutor because he didn't like his policy positions. A  federal judge said DeSantis acted unconstitutionally, but the judge  said he did not have the power to reinstate the prosecutor. DeSantis is  now considering removing a second prosecutor.   And in my home state of Texas, the state Government Education Agency  will soon take oversight of the Houston school system away from the  elected school board and superintendent. The takeover, an ACLU Texas  attorney explains, ``is not about public education but about political  control of an almost entirely Black and brown student body in one of  the country's most diverse cities.''   Like our ancestors and civil rights legends, we must stand up and  push back against these growing, dangerous attacks on our freedoms and  democracy.   Mrs. CHERFILUS-McCORMICK. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman  from the Seventh District of Georgia (Mrs. McBath).
