 Mr. Speaker, I rise with deep sadness to remember a  luminary in the field of cybersecurity.   Michael Assante passed away last Friday. The many tributes that have  poured in from people in the ICS security community are a testament to  his pioneering work and his kind soul.   I, too, have been touched by Mike's work. Mike and his colleagues at  Idaho National Laboratory first briefed me many years ago on the Aurora  vulnerability that showed how a bad actor could use malware to cause  physical damage to the electric grid and potentially knock out power to  millions.   That brief first piqued my interest in cybersecurity and led to my  cofounding the Congressional Cybersecurity Caucus with Congressman  McCaul.   Mike was many things--a brilliant researcher, a loving husband, a  ferocious fighter of the cancer that eventually claimed his life--but I  will always remember him, as will so many who went through his SANS  Institute courses, as an educator.   I cherished my time with Mike because I knew he would help me  understand how Congress could better secure the operational technology  underlying our daily lives.   Michael Assante made a difference. He can never be replaced, but I  will continue to honor his legacy by fighting to improve our Nation's  cybersecurity.                            ____________________
