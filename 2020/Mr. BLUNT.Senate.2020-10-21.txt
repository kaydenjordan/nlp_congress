 Mr. President, let me just follow right on with that  important topic of the vote we will have in a few days to send another  Justice to the U.S. Supreme Court.   I had the opportunity this morning to meet with Judge Barrett. The  conversation reminded me exactly why she is the right choice to fill  the vacancy on the Supreme Court now. I was asked the first weekend of  this discussion, before the President had made the decision, if I could  vote for her, and I quickly said yes, having watched her circuit judge  bipartisan confirmation, having seen how that discussion went. I have  had her on a short list that I have kept myself for a long time as  someone who would be an important addition to the Court.   She was first in her class at Notre Dame; clerked on the district  court in Washington, DC; clerked for Justice Scalia at the Supreme  Court; and was a law professor at Notre Dame for 15 years. At least  three times in that 15 years, she was chosen by students as the top  faculty member. She was bipartisanly confirmed on the Seventh Circuit  and has a history over the last 3 years of the kind of Justice she  would be.   The dean at the law school at Notre Dame had this to say about Judge  Amy Coney Barrett. He said:         Judge Amy Coney Barrett is an absolutely brilliant legal       scholar and jurist. . . . She lives a life of humility and       grace, devoted to her family and community.    Somebody else at the Notre Dame Law School said that when Professor  Barrett was in the room, the smartest person in the room was also the  most humble person in the room. I think we saw some of that when she  was before the Judiciary Committee as she answered those questions  understanding what her job was, understanding the job of a judge is not  to decide what the law should say but what the law does say; not to  decide what the Constitution should say but what it does say and even  more importantly, in her view of what a judge should look at, what  people thought it said when they wrote it, that textualist, that  originalist concept. She I think rightly perceived that if we want to  change the Constitution, there is a way to do that. If we want to  update it to what it might mean now, we have the chance to do that.  Certainly, if we want to change the law, we have the chance to do that.   If you really listened to the questions, particularly from our  friends on the other side, the Democrats on that committee, they were  all very much premised on: Well, what do you believe? What do you think  about this? What do you think about that?   That is not the point. She, I thought, very consistently, for 24  hours, made the point that the point is, it is not about what I  believe; it is about what the law says.   By the way, members of the committee--she didn't say this, but it was  obvious--it is your job to decide what the law says. It is the job of  the Court to decide how the law is applied and whether it meets the  test of the Constitution.   A widely respected scholar, a person of faith--by the way, I think in  the previous hearing, we all heard that comment ``The dogma lives  loudly in you.'' There may be a good way to use the word ``dogma,'' but  I don't think I have ever heard it used in a positive way. But if you  just substituted ``dogma'' for ``faith,'' what a great thing that would  be to say about somebody. The faith lives--your faith--the faith lives  loudly in you. No matter what your faith is, that is a great thing to  hear about yourself or to be able to say about somebody else. Lots of  people say that about Amy Coney Barrett.   She has written 79 opinions at the circuit court level, the court  level right below the Supreme Court. Everything she said as a circuit  judge, as a witness before the committee, and as a nominee before the  committee has been exactly what I think a judge should do.   The day she was nominated by the President, she said:         A judge must apply the law as written. Judges are not       policymakers, and they must be resolute in setting aside any       policy views they might hold.    Judge Scalia famously said that a really good judge will often issue  an opinion that they wish was a different opinion; an opinion that  doesn't meet their view of what they would like to see happen but meets  their view of what the law requires to happen.   The American Bar Association--sometimes not that friendly to  Republican nominees to the court--concluded that she was well  qualified. They asked for input from more than 900 people familiar with  Judge Barrett, and in the end, not one person uttered a negative word  about her. Certainly, there is nobody who has been elected to this body  who didn't have lots of negative words said about them. But just to  find 900 people and none of them have a negative thing to say I think  is a great indication of who she is.   One lawyer told the ABA that she is ``an intellectual giant with  people skills, and engaging warmth.'' Not every intellectual giant is  praised for their warmth or their people skills.   It is clear that she is well qualified. It is clear that she is a  brilliant lawyer. It is clear that she cares about her faith, about her  family, and about her community.   As Senator Ernst mentioned, she is the first nominee since Sandra Day  O'Connor who didn't graduate from Yale or Harvard. There is nothing  wrong with Yale or Harvard, but there is nothing wrong with having a  different background as you come to the Court, particularly if all of  your associations as a lawyer have been that ``she's mind-blowingly  intelligent''--that was one of her colleagues at Notre Dame--``and  she's also one of the most humble people you're going to meet.''  Brilliant and humble is a pretty good combination. America needs judges  that bring both humility and brilliance to the court. The Supreme Court  will benefit from her being there.   I certainly look forward to voting for Judge Amy Coney Barrett as she  moves from that job to Associate Justice Amy Coney Barrett, and I  believe we will be able to do that within the next few days.
