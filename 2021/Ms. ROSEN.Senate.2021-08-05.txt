 Mr. President, before I begin, I want to take a moment to  acknowledge the passing of Richard Trumka, just as my colleagues have  been speaking of him so wonderfully.   You know, during his time leading the AFL-CIO, he was a tireless  defender of workers and the rights of working Americans all across our  country. He recognized the capability of what Americans--of what they  could achieve by working together. He fought fiercely to help build  something better for our country and for our country's workforce.   My thoughts are with his family and his loved ones                                  H.R. 3684    Mr. President, let us all take inspiration and lessons from the trail  that he blazed, which is why I rise today to discuss a bill that would  also help to build something better for our country as well as our  country's workers: the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.   This bipartisan bill is an opportunity for the U.S. Senate to make a  major investment in our communities, in our States, in our country. The  goal of the G-22 bipartisan working group, which I was proud to join  earlier this year, has been to develop bold, comprehensive legislation  that will make a real, meaningful difference in people's lives, and  now--now--we are close to seeing that goal achieved.   This bill has been years in the making. During my time in Congress,  we have gone from one infrastructure week to the next with never much  to show for it until now.   It is not hyperbole to say that our bipartisan bill will be the most  significant investment in American infrastructure since we built the  Interstate Highway System. I know that for my State, for Nevada, these  investments--well, they are going to make a real difference because  this bill takes steps to support our traditional infrastructure: our  roads, our bridges, our rail, our transit.   You know, in Nevada, there are over 1,000 miles of highway in our  State that are in need of repair and well over two dozen of Nevada's  bridges that need to be restored. We have all experienced driving on  cracked roads and broken-down bridges. We know the toll it takes. And  this degradation--it poses serious safety concerns. It increases  commute times. It costs Nevada drivers hundreds each year in costs,  maybe thousands, due to poor conditions. And now, right now, we have an  opportunity to make critical upgrades and repairs both for those who  call the Silver State home and for the millions--millions--of travelers  that visit us from far and wide.  [[Page S5904]]    Our bill would also provide funding to expand our roads, bridges, and  highways in Nevada and across the whole country, from the Presiding  Officer's State of Maine all the way down to us in Southern Nevada.   As a member of the group who negotiated this bipartisan legislation,  I am proud that our bill provides flexible funding to States and  communities to address their unique challenges. In Nevada, that means  meeting the needs of a growing population and making our State  accessible to visitors who contribute to our economy and support our  job-creating businesses. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act-- well, it meets that need by providing growing Western States like mine,  Nevada, critical funding for surface transportation investments.   The bill would also make significant investments in accessible public  transport and rail systems to ease travel for people in our cities and  to connect our rural and suburban communities to our urban cores.   Through the bill's investment in western water systems, we can  transport water across communities to better meet needs swiftly and  develop important water recycling and reuse projects that will go a  long way to providing greater access to water--something especially  needed in my State and so many others as we deal with the current  historic drought conditions.   But beyond traditional infrastructure investments, this bill is also  forward-thinking in its scope and in its intent. The Infrastructure  Investment and Jobs Act--well, it just doesn't invest in solutions to  our current problems; it will help invest in the success of our  Nation's future and our ability to overcome emerging problems through  energy and cyber security infrastructure, like my Cyber Sense Act,  bipartisan legislation that is included in this legislation to ensure  the cyber security of technologies used in our bulk power system.   You know, in addressing these emerging challenges, it took hard work,  and it took compromise--exactly what our constituents expect of us but  which Congress far too often fails to deliver.   Many of you know that the process of bringing this bill together  involved numerous meetings, long hours, and many discussions across  party lines on all the issues involved. I was proud to take part in  helping put this bill together because I wanted to be the voice at the  table for Nevadans, that voice at the negotiating table that they need  me to be, and I wanted to make sure that we addressed the issues  important to our State. I am here to say that this bill does just that.   This bill includes investments that will uniquely benefit Nevada now  and for years to come by increasing access to broadband, by upgrading  our State's airports--two sections of the legislation that I took a  leading role in drafting.   I don't have to tell anyone, but fast, reliable access to the  internet--it is critical for all of our daily lives, and it has been  for decades. The pandemic--well, it only put a spotlight on our  current digital divide and the challenges that far too many Americans  face getting connected.    During COVID-19, many Nevadans went online, well, to conduct  business, to seek medical care, or pursue education, but our State's  broadband disparity limits many Nevadans, from rural and Tribal  communities to our underserved areas and our large cities, from using  or even having the most basic of internet services.   The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act is going to bring  broadband to communities that have long gone without access. It makes  an unprecedented investment in building out broadband infrastructure.  Never before has Congress taken such a bold step to get all Americans  connected. Our bill includes over $42 billion for State broadband  deployment grants to connect unserved and underserved communities to  high-speed internet.   Finally, we will tackle the ``last mile'' challenges that have  plagued so many of our communities for years. This bipartisan  legislation also includes my Middle Mile Broadband Deployment Act,  which I drafted to fund critical broadband infrastructure that connects  internet carriers to local networks and community institutions that  will serve as a launching-off point and connector for getting broadband  out to all households in their areas. It would also make the cost of  broadband more affordable to Nevada families, providing low-income  households support to help pay for this service via the new  infrastructure that we are building.   Initial estimates are that our bipartisan legislation will make  broadband access accessible to more than 120,000 Nevadans who currently  lack it, and it will provide subsidies to about a quarter of our  State's residents most in need so that they can afford it. Through this  bill, we are taking steps to get Nevadans connected for success in the  21st century and beyond.   The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act--well, it is also going to  help support a key industry in the Silver State: travel and tourism. It  does so by providing much needed funding for airports to expand and  upgrade their terminals and facilities. As we prepare for a  postpandemic world, these critical investments will allow us to bring  in travelers and tourists in even greater numbers. As they come, these  visitors will support our State's local businesses; they will boost our  communities and our economy.   As chair of the Senate Subcommittee on Tourism, Trade, and Export  Promotion, I made it my priority to fight for Nevada's travel, tourism,  and hospitality economy as a member of the G-22, and I will continue to  do so.   In addition to securing robust funding for our airports, I am also  proud that this legislation includes my bipartisan TOURISM Act, which  requires the Department of Transportation to update its national travel  and tourism infrastructure strategic plan to develop an immediate-term  and long-term strategy to use the infrastructure investments that we  make today--that we are going to make, this week, possible--to revive  the travel and tourism not just in Nevada but, of course, all across  this Nation as we come out of a deadly pandemic.   Through the investments provided in this bill, Nevada's travel and  tourism industry and hopefully all of our tourism can soar once more.  To make all of these things happen, this bill, our bill, invests in  creating jobs, jobs that will help repair and strengthen our  infrastructure and jobs that will build our country's new foundation.   With the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, we can rebuild; we  can revamp; we can work through all of our infrastructure. Through  that, we will create good-paying jobs, and we will improve the lives of  hard-working families and communities all across this country.   I urge all of my colleagues to choose to make this investment with  us. Join us, please, in investing in our families and investing in our  communities and investing in our States and in our country's future.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
