 Mr. Speaker, illegally obtained guns are  pouring over the streets of communities across the country, including  in my community of Buffalo, New York.   These illegal guns are responsible for tragic deaths. Last year,  30,000 Americans, including 262 children, were killed by gun violence.   The number of slain Americans are more than just statistics; they are  real people: fathers, mothers, grandparents, sons, daughters, and  grandkids. They had dreams, they had aspirations, and they had their  whole lives ahead of them.   This is an urgent call to action against gun violence. Members of my  community are coming together and they are calling on Congress to  repeal provisions that prohibit our government from knowing if firearms  have been lost or stolen.   Mr. Speaker, I support this call to action and urge this body to  continue to work to make our communities safer for all. Those whose  lives were lost would still be with us today if legislation this House  passed, commonsense gun reforms, universal background checks, and a ban  on assault weapons, were enacted into law.   We must do better. Repeal the Tiahrt amendment now.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, as has been said, John Lewis  grew up on a chicken farm to sharecroppers in Troy, Alabama. During  that time, there was great pain and suffering for our African-American  brothers and sisters in the segregated South.   John Lewis's mother, in the summer of 1951, when John was 11, wanted  to get him out of the heat of the segregated South, and she sent him to  a place called Buffalo, New York, my hometown. Mrs. Lewis had baked for  3 days, because stopping in a diner along the way was not an option for  the Lewis family.   John Lewis, when he got to Buffalo, he saw young kids, Black and  White, playing together in Olmsted Park, now appropriately called  Martin Luther King Jr. Park. He saw White women and Black women  drinking from the same water fountain. He saw his uncles, Black men,  working aside White men in the steel and flour mills of Buffalo, New  York.   It was from that experience in Buffalo, in the summer of 1951, at age  11, that John said that he believed the desegregation of the South was  possible, and he committed his lifework to that cause.   On March 7, 1965, as we know, John led a peaceful civil rights march  over the Edmund Pettus Bridge. The idea was to march from Selma to  Montgomery, the State's capital, a distance of about 55 miles. There  were 148 State troopers waiting at the foot of the bridge for John and  the peaceful demonstrators.   The State troopers said to cease and disperse. John led his fellow  marchers, and they kneeled and prayed. Then, they were attacked.   They broke John's skull. But before John went to the hospital to be  administered to, he insisted on waiting till the news media got there.  With blood pouring down his face, he admonished the President of the  United States to take up the civil rights cause.   On August 6 of that year, the Voting Rights Act was signed into law  by President Johnson.   John said, oddly, one time that he was grateful for the police  beating because had that event not occurred, had that not become Bloody  Sunday, it would have just passed as a local news story. Nobody would  have witnessed it, and nothing would have changed.   John always said, you sometimes have to give a little blood to redeem  the soul of a nation.   The Voting Rights Act of 1965 is a testament to the vision of John  Lewis, a man of goodness and a man of grace, who at the age of 11, in  the summer of 1951, was inspired by what he saw in Buffalo and had the  presence of mind and the courage to act on that inspiration.
