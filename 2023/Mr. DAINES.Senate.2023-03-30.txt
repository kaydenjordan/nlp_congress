 Mr. President, today I have the distinct honor of  recognizing Trina Jo Bradley of Pondera County for her lifelong  commitment to preserving and promoting Montana agriculture and her  tireless advocacy for common sense grizzly bear management.   Trina Jo grew up on a ranch on the East Front of Montana's Rocky  Mountains, where she received a unique, hands-on introduction to the  rich fulfillment that can be earned through a life in ag. She went on  to earn an associate of science degree in agri-business, was then  married to her husband Peter, and finally returned to the land she's  always known to raise their daughter Kadence, on the edge of the  Blackfeet Indian Reservation. The Bradley family run Angus cattle and  Quarter Horses amongst some of the most beautiful foothills featured  throughout the Treasure State.   In addition to her tireless work on the ranch, Trina Jo maintains an  esteemed record of service to Montana's agricultural community through  various leadership roles in organizations such as the Marias River  Livestock Association, Montana Cattlewomen, North Country Cattlewomen,  and the Rocky Mountain Front Ranchlands Group. In 2019, Trina Jo was  appointed to the State of Montana's Grizzly Bear Advisory Council to  apply her firsthand accounts with these apex predators in pursuit of  sensible grizzly bear conservation practices.   Much of Trina Jo's time is spent educating people on the dynamics of  working and living with a grizzly bear on personal property, including  the threat this species inflicts upon livestock and how families can  best protect children. She has been an outspoken advocate for grizzly  bear management to be returned to the State of Montana, with hopes that  the species will finally be delisted in the Northern Continental Divide  Ecosystem--NCDE--in northwest Montana.   It is my distinct honor to recognize Trina Jo Bradley for her  commitment to preserving our Montana way of life through her extensive  work in the agricultural sector and her leadership in the ongoing  discussion surrounding grizzly bear management. Keep up the great work,  Trina Jo. You make Montana proud.                            ____________________
