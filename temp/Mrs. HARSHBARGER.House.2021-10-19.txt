 Madam Speaker, I rise today to condemn the reckless  and irresponsible proposed spending by the radical left.   This reconciliation bill is nothing more than a socialist wish list.   It disincentivizes people from working and it is littered with Green  New Deal items we cannot afford.   The Biden administration has outrageously claimed this bill costs  zero, nada, nothing, zilch. If you believe that, then I have got a nice  piece of oceanfront property to sell you in east Tennessee where I come  from.   This deficit spending is a wrong prescription for our country.   Instead of calling this the build back better, they should call it  the build back broke.   It would raise inflation--you have to remember, inflation is  taxation--making everyday necessities even more expensive than they  have already become under the Biden economy; that is, if you can even  get the items you need due to the supply chain disruptions.   And it will fail to incentivize Americans to get back to work.   What we need to focus on are real solutions to restarting our great  American economy, not on increasing debt and government reliance.   I urge my colleagues in joining me in opposing this out-of-control  spending.   Our country's future depends on it and the future of east Tennessee  depends on it.
