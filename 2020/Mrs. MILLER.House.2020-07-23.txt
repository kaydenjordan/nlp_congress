 Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak in favor of three  amendments I have submitted in the Republican en bloc.   An amendment to stop my colleagues across the aisle from cutting  funding for our border wall. We still have a crisis on our southern  border, and we need to stop illegal drugs from entering our country.   An amendment to support innovation in the gas industry. American  energy is clean, affordable, and efficient. We must capitalize on our  American energy dominance to rebuild our economy, expand trade, and  create stable jobs.   And an amendment to make sure our police remain funded. We cannot let  our liberal colleagues defund the police. This overcorrection will lead  our country to a dark place. Our police officers protect our  communities and keep us safe. I am proud to support our police.
