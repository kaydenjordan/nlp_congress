 Mr. Speaker, as chairman of the Congressional Coal  Caucus, I rise today in strong support for this action.   After 8 long, tortuous years, our coal communities have endured a  withering attack from Washington bureaucrats focused on this agenda of  anticoal. What has been the result?   Across this country, in the coal fields of this country, 400 mines  have closed down, 83,000 coal miners have lost their jobs, 246 power  plants have closed down, and our electric utility bills have gone up 45  percent.   Then, right before President Obama left town, his administration  punctuated its war on coal with this damaging further rule. This rule  is nothing more than an organic manifestation of a Washington  bureaucracy drunk with power. If it is left unaddressed, this rule  would shut down an additional number of coal mines, and 78,000 men and  women would lose their jobs because of this rule.   For the last 2 years, our Coal Caucus, bipartisan members, have made  stopping this rule our number one priority, because it has nothing to  do with the health of America, the safety of America, and the life of  Americans.   Simply put, it was President Obama's attempt to drive a final nail  into the coffin of an industry that made America great.   Look, enough is enough. This war on coal has to come to a stop, and I  think this election set the tone for that.   Now that we finally have a President who understands the painful  impact of excessive and unnecessary regulations, we should pass this  CRA as quickly as possible so he can sign it.   It is time to give the families of the coal fields all across America  a chance to get relief from the unelected bureaucrats in Washington.   I thank the chairman for his work in getting this. I thank him for  the cosponsorship that we have had with Congressmen Johnson and Jenkins  to help us out on this, to get this before us. We have to do this for  the people of West Virginia and around the country.
