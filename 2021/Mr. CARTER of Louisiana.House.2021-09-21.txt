 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my  support for this continuing resolution, especially the disaster  supplemental portion.   This bill contains crucial funding for my home State of Louisiana and  for the residents of the Second Congressional District affected by  Hurricane Ida. Louisianians have been through a lot, and this bill  recognizes that struggle. It also helps us to begin working on those  challenges.   This Congress is stepping up and funding projects that will not only  repair the damage but also make our communities better and safer. The  $3 billion in Army Corps funding for flood and storm damage reduction  projects will change the future of the communities across my State and  across this Nation. It will build projects that will make communities  stronger, safer, and more resilient.   The $5 billion in CDBG funding for long-term disaster recovery will  help communities affected by storms like Laura in the past year and  start places affected by Ida on the road to recovery.   It is not enough to repair these things to how they were. We need a  recovery that reaches beyond and prepares every community to be better,  to be weather ready, and ready for the next series of storms. This  Congress and the administration are taking the steps toward doing just  that. I will continue to fight for more resources for the people of  Louisiana and for the Second Congressional District.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this continuing  resolution and to do the right thing by the people of America.
