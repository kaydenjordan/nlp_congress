 Madam President, last month the Senate confirmed the newest  Justice to the Supreme Court, Amy Coney Barrett. As members of this  body, one of our great privileges and weightiest responsibilities is to  fulfill the role of ``advice and consent'' provided in the Constitution  to examine and, if merited, confirm the President's nominees. In the  case of the Federal judiciary, not only will these nominees out serve  many of us in the Senate, their rulings will shape the fabric of our  Nation the way that affects generations.   It is with a great understanding of this that I consider judicial  nominees and also why I am proud to have been able to vote in support  of Justice Barrett's confirmation. Much has been said about her legal  abilities and credentials and how she has consistently distinguished  herself as a student, a law clerk and practitioner, academic, and judge  on the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals. Yet two characteristics beyond  her stellar resume enabled me to decisively cast my vote for her to  serve on the Supreme Court of the United States: her respect for the  Constitution and her character.   Throughout her career, Justice Barrett has shown she will uphold the  Constitution and that she understand the checks and balances that are a  part of our democracy. She has stated multiple times that ``It is never  appropriate for a judge to impose that judge's personal convictions,''  and her writing and her statements and her opinions for the Seventh  Circuit demonstrate her respect for the rule of law; for the  responsibilities of the legislative, executive, and judicial branches;  and for interpreting the law in accordance with the ``the meaning it  had at the time people ratified it.'' This understanding is crucial for  judges to ensure that the legislature has its proper role, that the  Constitution is followed as written and amended when changes are  necessary, and that our system has the proper checks and balances.   With regards to her character, Judge Barrett's career and life  demonstrate the kind of person she is. She has received public awards,  including the Notre Dame Law School's Distinguished Teaching Award  three times, being selected by graduating law students as a professor  ``who exhibits excellence in leadership, friendship, legal knowledge,  legal teaching, and professional ability.'' She has received the  accolade of her fellow clerks on the Supreme Court, including the  clerks of the late Justice Ginsburg, who called her ``smart, honorable,  and fair-minded.'' She was lauded by fellow professors at Notre Dame as  someone who has ``in abundance all of the other qualities that shape  extraordinary jurists: discipline, intellect, wisdom, impeccable  temperament, and above all, fundamental decency and humanity.'' It goes  without saying that these are the qualities of an individual who we  want serving on the highest court of our land.   For a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court, an individual must  be the entire package. I am confident that Justice Barrett's  credentials, judicial philosophy, and character will serve our Nation  well for decades to come, and I am honored to have supported her  nomination.                            ____________________
