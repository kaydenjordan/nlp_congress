 Mr. President, I am proud to recognize the  Sophomore Student Council at Gorham Middle & High School as December's  Granite Staters of the Month. When a vendor accidentally sent extra  chocolate as part of the Sophomore Student Council's fundraiser, the  students launched a new effort. Instead of reselling the surplus  chocolate to benefit their class, they decided to sell the extra  chocolate to benefit their school's food pantry.   Like most events this year, the Sophomore Student Council modified a  fundraiser that they would typically hold in-person to be an online  event. One of the participants in the fundraiser, the aunt of Sophomore  Student Council Representative Emma LaPierre, bought three boxes of  chocolate to benefit her niece's class. However, instead of receiving  the expected three boxes of chocolate, she received three entire cases  of chocolate. The vendor, World's Finest Chocolate, was alerted to the  mistake, but due to safety concerns around the COVID-19 pandemic, said  that they could not take the chocolate back. Emma, along with other  members of the Sophomore Student Council, decided that rather than sell  the extra chocolate to profit their class, they would use the  additional funds to benefit their school's food and supply pantry.  After selling the chocolate at a reduced rate, the students  successfully raised $200 for the pantry, which provides weekend meals,  snacks, and school supplies to any student in need. Following the  students' efforts, a local paper published an article about the  fundraiser, which inspired a couple in the community to send a $100  check to the school to benefit their food and supply pantry.   Emma and the other students in Gorham's Sophomore Student Council  exemplify the way that small acts of kindness can make a big difference  in a community. Their selfless decision to raise money on behalf of a  community-wide resource, rather than keep the funds for their class,  helped to spur other acts of kindness in their community from which the  whole school and community benefited. I am honored to recognize their  efforts and proud that their efforts reflect the Granite State's core  value--the belief that individuals should step up when they see a  problem--and that when they do, their actions have a ripple effect that  strengthens the entire community. The Gorham Sophomore Student Council  has done just that.                            ____________________
