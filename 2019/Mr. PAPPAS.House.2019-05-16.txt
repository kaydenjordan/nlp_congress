 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, I want to thank my colleagues for introducing this  legislation that works to improve our healthcare system and lower the  skyrocketing costs of prescription drugs. This bill will bring much  needed relief to the millions of Americans who are struggling to afford  the care that they need.   The people from my home State of New Hampshire know that we must move  beyond a political debate over the ACA to bipartisan action that will  improve coverage and lower costs.   Just last week, I was proud to vote to protect Americans with  preexisting conditions and introduce an amendment to safeguard coverage  for those suffering from substance use disorder.   The amendment I am offering today strengthens this legislation and  the ACA by ensuring the administration is actively working to expand  Americans' access to care.   Specifically, my amendment requires the Department of Health and  Human Services to set enrollment targets, goals that can be tracked and  pursued with smart investments of resources.   This commonsense practice was employed by the previous  administration, yet the Trump administration has failed to do so.   While they should be promoting enrollment for affordable coverage,  Health and Human Services has slashed the advertisement and outreach  budget by 90 percent and it cut in-person enrollment assistance funding  nearly in half.   These actions have very real consequences. Recent reports indicate  that more than 1.1 million Americans lost healthcare coverage in 2018.   In my State of New Hampshire, more than 10,000 individuals lost  coverage over the past 3 years.   These cuts have hindered organizations such as the Bi-State Primary  Care Association in New Hampshire.   The organization is responsible for helping nearly 110,000  underserved Granite Staters navigate the complexities of our healthcare  system and find coverage in the enrollment period, which lasts only 6  weeks.   In the words of Executive Director Tess Kuenning:         The loss in funding means a loss of a trusted impartial       adviser educating and providing information so people can       make an informed decision about health insurance coverage.    Without collecting and monitoring enrollment numbers, it is  impossible to hold the department accountable or track how they are  deploying resources to support enrollment.   In fact, the nonpartisan GAO slammed the administration for refusing  to set targets and having no way to evaluate overall performance.   As a small business owner, I can't fathom how leaders can work  towards success without clearly defined goals. How do you measure  progress? How do you know how to best utilize your resources? How do  you know if you need to make a course correction?   The American people deserve to know their government is working to  expand access to care, not seeking to limit it.   In the greatest Nation on Earth, no American should miss the  opportunity to have healthcare, economic security, quality of life, and  the peace of mind that comes with it.   Mr. Chair, I urge the adoption of this amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I urge adoption of this amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
