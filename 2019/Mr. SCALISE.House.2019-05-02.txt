 Madam Speaker, I rise for the purpose of inquiring of  the majority leader the schedule for the next week to come.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer),  the majority leader.                                time  1230     Madam Speaker, I would point out that the President's  executive order on section 1332 does nothing to change the protections  in law for people with preexisting conditions under ObamaCare. As the  gentleman knows, the law protects people with preexisting conditions  from facing any kind of discrimination, and the section 1332 waivers  have nothing to do with that.   What they do is allow some States--and there have been a number of  States who have requested--the ability to be more innovative and focus  on lowering premiums while protecting preexisting conditions.   Those States that have taken advantage of that waiver have used it  to, number one, provide healthcare in different ways, more innovative  ways for their Medicaid population.   That is something we should all encourage because Medicaid in many  States is the worst form of healthcare. In many cases, doctors don't  even take Medicaid policies and don't see Medicaid patients, so they  can't get access to care.  [[Page H3431]]    These waivers are a way to help open more access to care at lower  costs, in many cases, while protecting preexisting conditions.   With that said, when the gentleman laid out the schedule, I didn't  see anything on the President's request for supplemental funding for  the border crisis. Specifically, there was a $4.5 billion request that  came down from the White House for additional funding to address this  wave of people who are coming into our country illegally.   In many cases, they have run out of detention beds. They are  overwhelming the system, and it has been reported very widely. That is  why the President made the $4.5 billion request.   I wanted to ask the gentleman if that might be included in this  supplemental for the disasters that we would surely like to be  addressed.   I yield to the gentleman from Maryland.    Reclaiming my time, Madam Speaker, at the final end of  your spending bill, we got a start on addressing the problem of border  security. We had very intense negotiations, and the President laid out  the multitude of things that need to be done to get full control over  the border, which we do not have.   That was a start. As the gentleman knows, it surely hasn't stopped  the flow of people who have been coming across, especially these  caravans, these organized caravans, in the thousands per day, which is  overwhelming our system. I wish it would stop.   I wish we would address all the interior security problems and magnet  laws, like catch and release and the asylum loopholes, that are  encouraging people to come here illegally, in many cases overwhelming  our own system.   As the gentleman reviews that supplemental, hopefully, we can come to  an agreement on how to, at least in the interim, address the problem.  But ultimately, long term, we need a solution. We will continue to work  on that.   I yield to the gentleman from Maryland.    Madam Speaker, that debate will go on. Hopefully, we can  start addressing some of the long-term problems.   Madam Speaker, I wanted to ask the gentleman, finally, about  legislation to confront this BDS movement, a major threat to our ally  Israel. It attempts to undermine its economy. There is legislation, and  of course, there is a bipartisan resolution, the Schneider-Zeldin  legislation, which I strongly support, that at least calls out the BDS  movement.   As we have also seen, we need teeth. We need real tools that we can  provide to not just our friend Israel, but also States, many States  that are also trying to confront this problem and push back against the  BDS movement. The McCaul bill addresses that, similar to a Senate bill  that passed with over 70 votes--very bipartisan.   In fact, I believe there are amendments being put together to make  the McCaul bill identical to the Senate bill. Then the question is, can  we get some kind of commitment--and I know we have talked about this  before--to bring that bill to the floor so that we can finally, truly  confront this growing problem of the BDS movement across not only the  world but within our country, and do it with real teeth, like the  bipartisan McCaul bill?   I yield to the gentleman from Maryland.    Madam Speaker, I appreciate it. I understand that there  hasn't been any determination yet, but there is a growing frustration  that this needs to be addressed by the Congress. There is a move to  initiate a discharge petition to get that bill brought to the floor, so  those discussions will continue.   Hopefully, we can address the problem of BDS not only in a resolution  but also in legislation that has teeth in law to help those States that  want to confront it and also to help, in a bigger way, our ally Israel.   My final point is on the process that we have seen. Of course, this  week, there was only one bill that came under a rule. As far as  amendments go, we have seen a growing trend toward shutting out  Republican amendments.   If I can just go through it with the gentleman, as we have looked in  this Congress, of the amendments that have come out of the Rules  Committee, 74 percent of those amendments were Democratic amendments;  14 percent were Republican amendments; and 12 percent were bipartisan.   If I can compare it to the last Congress when we were in the  majority, there were, in fact, more Democratic amendments than  Republican amendments allowed. Forty-five percent of the amendments  were Democratic; 38 percent were Republican in our Republican majority;  and 17 percent were bipartisan.   When you compare last Congress when we were in the majority, we let  more Democratic amendments to the floor than Republican amendments.   So far, we have seen a complete reversal of that, where our  amendments have been shut out at a very high level, again, 74 percent  to 14 percent.   I would ask if the gentleman can look at addressing this problem and  try to bring some parity to the floor process as it relates to that  disparity, and I yield to the gentleman.    I hope when we get to that appropriations process that  there would be open rules, as we did.   And I guess the gentleman doesn't have to worry about his majority  breaking the record of closed rules, because this week we only had one  rule, and, in fact, again, a modified rule, where over 30 of our  amendments were shut out. Hopefully, more legislation starts moving  through the process.   When we look at last Congress, we passed over 50 rules last Congress.  So far, this Congress, only 34 rules. We actually had 30 bills signed  into law at this point in the last Congress, 30 bills signed into law  under our majority, only 16 signed into law here. Hopefully, we see  more productivity as well as more openness in that process.   I yield to the gentleman from Maryland.    Well, as eyes are glazing over, for clarity, there were  many rules where every single Democrat amendment was included. So if  you want to call it a modified rule, closed rule--for people watching,  when Republicans and Democrats go to the Rules Committee to try to  amend a bill, when every single Democrat amendment is allowed in, that  is an open process.   Today, for example, the only rule today, over 30 Republican  amendments were shut out--over 30 were shut out. So, many times we had  rules where every single Democrat amendment was allowed. In the last  Congress, more Democrat amendments were allowed than Republican  amendments.   But this, hopefully, can get addressed and corrected, and maybe when  we get to an appropriations process, it will be more fair in that  regard.   With that, I look forward to next week, hopefully get some of those  things done.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
