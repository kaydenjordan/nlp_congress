 Madam Speaker, I thank Representative Case for  organizing this Special Order today, and I thank him for his  outstanding work as the co-chair of the Blue Dog Task Force on Fiscal  Responsibility and Government Reform.   I am lucky to serve alongside him as co-chair, and I also want to  thank Stephanie Murphy for her tireless leadership in Congress and with  the Blue Dogs.   Madam Speaker, Washington has an addiction problem. It is hooked on  deficits, and it is hooked on debt. Our entire Nation, our children,  and their children will pay the price for this addiction.   On March 2, 2019, the debt limit was reinstated as $22 trillion as  Representative Case so appropriately outlined. To operate the  government at this limit, the Treasury Department deployed  extraordinary measures, accounting maneuvers, allowing government  operations to continue. But if those measures run out and our cash  reserves are depleted, the Federal Government would reach the  unprecedented day on which our Federal Government cannot meet all of  its obligations in full and on time.   The consequences of defaulting on our obligations are unknown, but  could be economically devastating, not only for the United States, but  globally.   As Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said recently about the  prospect of not raising the debt limit: ``It is beyond even considering  that the United States would not honor all of its obligations and pay  them when due. It is just something that can't even be considered,'' he  said.   We know that the costs of barreling towards this fiscal cliff are  already mounting. American taxpayers foot the bill for additional  borrowing costs that come from delays in extending the debt limit.   In previous years, uncertainty has caused interest rates on some  Treasury bills to spike in anticipation of going over the fiscal cliff,  resulting in many millions, if not billions of dollars in added  interest costs.   As we have done more than 100 times, we are now preparing to vote to  raise the debt limit. Raising it does not authorize new spending. It  enables the government to pay its bills and avoid the sorry reality of  becoming an untrustworthy borrower. What better time to pair that vote  with a plan to reform government spending?   It is not as if we woke up this morning to suddenly face this fiscal  calamity. It has been building for decades, as we just saw. Both  parties in Republican and Democratic administrations have contributed  to the problem. The question is: What are we going to do about it? And  when will we start to get our borrowing and our spending addiction  under control?   The Blue Dog Coalition, of which I am a proud member, has a well- deserved reputation for talking the talk and walking the walk when it  comes to fiscal responsibility.   Look at the Blue Dog priorities on fiscal responsibility and you will  see a comprehensive list of pragmatic steps that we can take, some of  which we have already taken.   For example, Blue Dogs support the House paygo rules. It is one of  the first things the Blue Dogs fought for when we got sworn in this  year. And I was pleased to see the House keep paygo rules.   We don't want those rules to be waived, but if they are, there should  be a vote held on a waiver. Blue Dogs support a constitutional  amendment to require a balanced budget every year, except in times of  war, in times of national emergency, or recession.   I was proud that my first bill introduced in this Congress was this  exact balanced budget amendment that the Blue Dogs have endorsed. We  want to return to regular order. Passing a budget every year and on  time and avoiding omnibus appropriation packages that do not align with  that budget.   As a former mayor myself who had to balance a budget every year and  do so in a bipartisan fashion, I was then, as I am now, accountable to  the taxpayers for every dollar we spent. Do elected officials face  tough tradeoffs? Yes, absolutely. That comes with the job. Just as  hardworking families and small business owners must do, you must work  together, and we, in Congress, must work together to set priorities and  make sure the checkbook balances at the end of each month.   It is important that we fully offset the cost of all new spending or  reductions in fiscal revenues with spending cuts or revenue increases.  We must make those tough choices. We need strict, enforceable spending  caps to ensure a fiscally responsible budget.   The Blue Dogs also support better oversight over our government  spending. The Government Accountability Office, or GAO, and the  inspectors general are important entities throughout the Federal  Government that hold Federal agencies accountable to taxpayers and  recommend improvements.   We believe that Congress should know what it is voting on by having  every conference report and bill that comes to the floor of the House  accompanied by a cost estimate prepared by the nonpartisan  Congressional Budget Office, and that should be done at least 24 hours  in advance of the floor vote. We believe that committees should  identify proper and related offsets before the legislation is reported  out of committee.   A $22 trillion debt burden is a heavy lift to eliminate, for sure.  But at the very least, we should be able to agree not to take on new  policies that add to that debt.    We teach our kids that if they want something badly enough, they need  to figure out how to pay for it. Tax reform should be deficit neutral.  Spending plans should be fully paid for. Even emergency spending, which  should be passed quickly to respond when our communities need it most,  should include a plan to pay for it, and we can think ahead and plan  ahead for those emergencies.   We should get away from the ad hoc emergency spending and figure out  how to establish a rainy-day fund which 45 States currently have. Every  man, woman, and child in America owes $68,000 as Representative Case  has highlighted as their share of the national debt. We will all be  morally bankrupt, as well as financially bankrupt, if we don't stop  kicking the can down the road and make future generations liable for  our lack of fiscal discipline today.   And so my colleagues often ask me why deficits matter? My answer is  because future generations will be forced to bear the burden of our  failure if we don't act today. And the longer it takes for us to act,  the more difficult those decisions become.   The cost of paying interest on our debt is the fastest growing part  of the budget. We will spend more on interest than on defense by the  year 2025. That is 6 years from now. Let that sink in. The government  is projected to spend $383 billion on interest payments for its debt  this year alone. This year, $383 billion.   So why do I care about the debt and deficits? It is because a strong  fiscal house means we have a stronger country. That $383 billion spent  on interest payments in our debt is $383 billion we can't spend on  other priorities, such as clean energy and transportation, and  affordable healthcare. The interest we pay on the debt is simply going  on to our credit card. It is becoming part of the debt.   So if you care about healthcare, if you care about climate change and  [[Page H7144]]  building a 21st century infrastructure system, if you care about  affordable housing and any other investment that the government can  make, then I urge you, care about the debt, and care about our  deficits. Because every dollar spent on paying down the debt and its  deficits or interest on that debt is one more dollar that could have  been invested in priorities that strengthen our country, that  strengthen our national defense, and strengthens the American people.   It is clear that we are on a dangerous and unsustainable course. The  decisions will not be easy. But our children and our grandchildren are  counting on us to make this right. We were elected to make tough  decisions.   I thank the gentleman for yielding to me.    Will the gentleman yield?    I would be happy to.    Yes, absolutely. We recognize that there may be  emergencies that are unforeseen and unplanned for. And in those cases,  the language of my proposed amendment would allow for deficit spending  to help our communities in times of need, in times of national  disasters or other emergencies. And I think that is important.    That is correct.    Madam Speaker, that is correct. In my own State of Utah  that has a balanced budget requirement, and has established a rainy-day  fund, as I mentioned, such that when those emergencies arise, they have  funds available to account for that.   I would urge us to not only have that flexibility built into the  language of the amendment, but to plan ahead. While we don't know what  the next emergency will be or where it will strike, we know that dark  days are ahead of us, and that there will be natural disasters and  other emergencies and we should plan ahead for those.    Well, one thing, I had a council of nine members: five  Republicans and four Democrats. And one thing I know from experience is  balancing a budget is hard. We have to make really tough choices. There  are certainly things that may not be meritorious expenses that are easy  to say no to, but by and large, we have to make some really tough  decisions.   We can't do it all, even though we might want to do it all. You  cannot do it all. And what it takes is, first of all, have a bipartisan  relationship where people put their priorities on the table, discuss  what they want to accomplish, and how they want to get there.    And then everyone has to continue to work together to refine  proposals, to make sure that you cut the fat out of proposals and make  sure that they are well refined, and every dollar spent is justified.   Ultimately, we have been able to balance a budget. We have to make  tough decisions, but we are able to balance a budget, because there is  that expectation, that requirement that we must get there, and so we do  get there.    Madam Speaker, we did have that experience, and I would  add, it made us better. The county that I presided over as mayor, we  had a AAA bond rating. The faith in our ability to pay our debts meant  we paid lower interest rates. People knew that we would not default on  those debts, and we saved tax dollars because people knew that we could  balance our budget.   I would like to add one point to the gentleman's consideration.  Fiscal responsibility is important. It is important for our States. It  is important for this country.   But another element that I found in the process of balancing a  budget, when we had to make those tough choices, when, at the end of  the day, the ledger had to balance, what we were forced to do was go  back and look at every expenditure we made and ask ourselves:   Can it be done more effectively?   Can we stretch our dollars further?   Is the program or endeavor that we are engaged in the lowest-cost  alternative?   Are tax dollars being spent wisely?   Are programs invested in our citizens, whether it is a program to  reduce recidivism or to improve early childhood learning?   We were expected to look and evaluate the effectiveness of each and  every program because we were having to make competing choices. We were  choosing between one good and, hopefully, a better good, and that  required us to quantify empirically the outcomes we were receiving from  our programs.                                time  1445    That was good for fiscal responsibility. More importantly, it was  good for the people we were serving because the programs we were  delivering were expected to improve. We held those programs to a high  standard on behalf of the citizens who we served.    Waste in plowing snow or fixing streetlights is one  thing, but in programs that serve our residents, there is a human cost  to programs that aren't held to a high standard. It takes a toll on  individuals and on families--on people--who were promised one outcome.  If a program fails to deliver on that, there is a human cost.    The rules of the House require that any legislation that  would have a fiscal impact has to be paid for. We can't simply add that  on to the tab and put it on the taxpayers' credit card. Every  legislation has to be paid for upfront.    That is exactly right. I describe it as saying that the  first rule when you find yourself in a hole and are not sure how to get  out is to stop digging.    That is right. Every activity, whether it is reducing  revenues or increasing spending, should be neutral as it relates to the  Federal deficit.    Exactly. That is correct.    One of my concerns is the willingness with which both  sides, both parties, will waive paygo. It takes a simple majority to  waive paygo. We have seen that happen from time to time, whether it is  exigent circumstances like emergencies, but other things that we can  plan ahead and should look ahead for.    Yes.    Exactly.
