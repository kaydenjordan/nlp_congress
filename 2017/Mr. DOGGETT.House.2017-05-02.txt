 Mr. Speaker, I commend the leaders of the Foreign  Affairs Committee for their leadership on this important matter. We  need stronger international action like this to send a message to the  North Korean regime.   Our sanctions approach should be at least as strong against North  Korea as it has been against Iran; and to be effective, sanctions must  include all countries. Chinese trade during the last year with North  Korea has actually increased. It is clear that it is shirking its  responsibility. If it were to limit energy and access to hard currency  reserves to North Korea, the regime would likely collapse.   Intensified sanctions of the type contemplated by this measure are  particularly important because, despite all of the recent saber  rattling from Donald Trump, we have no acceptable military solution.  Any military attack on North Korea would result in the death of  hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of the 25 million Koreans in  the greater Seoul area and the over 100,000 Americans that are in that  region.   Only this week, General McMaster, President Trump's national security  adviser, conceded that a preventive military strike would result in a  human catastrophe. We cannot eliminate the risk of North Korea, but we  can better manage it, and this measure is a step in the right  direction.   The arsenal of our democracy is more than just our military might.  Let's apply every bit of international pressure possible and hope that  the great self-described dealmaker Donald J. Trump can begin direct  negotiations to secure an agreement with North Korea that achieves at  least as much as President Obama did with Iran.
