 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, today President Biden had the first of his  meetings with Russian President Vladimir Putin. He certainly has many  important messages to convey to Mr. Putin about ongoing cyber attacks  against us and our allies, the murdering of peaceful political  opponents, and potential areas where we may be able to work together to  deal with nuclear proliferation. The important discussion comes after  several days where President Biden reaffirmed our relationship with our  most important allies, those in the G7 and NATO. There were important  announcements about leading the global COVID vaccine effort and  standing up to the outrages perpetrated by nations around the world.  But perhaps what was most important was that President Biden reasserted  America's role as a leading champion of democracy, security, and  international norms.   I hope this spells an end--and I believe it does--of the unimaginable  events that occurred in the previous administration: Coddling a foreign  dictator such as Putin, dismissing our closest allies, and threatening  the critical North Atlantic Treaty Organization.   President Biden knows that America's leadership and its example are  critical in leading shared efforts to stop this pandemic, tackle  climate change, push back on rogue nations, and maintain global norms  of behavior. President Biden also knows that how we manage our  democracy here at home affects our ability to lead abroad.   The last administration bullied our allies, who watched in disbelief  as it cozied up to the autocrats around the world. I have often said  that a great deal of America's influence around the world comes from  the power of its ideals and values--critical and precious assets that  we must nurture and never take for granted.   Our historic peaceful transfer of power has been a marvel for  generations for much of the world. I will never forget the power and  emotion felt walking with my friend the late Senator John McCain  through Ukraine's Maidan square, looking at the makeshift memorials to  those who lost their lives hoping for a free and democratic Ukraine.   John McCain once said:         America's greatest strength has always been its hopeful       vision of human progress.    I couldn't agree more. I couldn't be more proud that President Biden  is reaffirming this belief on the world stage this week. So let me take  this moment to commend the President and his team for a timely,  critical, and important visit with international allies and adversaries  in recent days. It won't solve all the problems we face, but we can be  proud of this example of American leadership, generosity, and decency.

Madam President, today the Senate will take another step  toward building a Federal judiciary that reflects the experiences of  all Americans by voting on the nomination of Judge Lydia Griggsby to  serve on the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland. Once  confirmed, she will be the first Black woman--and first woman of  color--to serve in this position.   Since 2014, Judge Griggsby has served as an outstanding and even- handed judge on the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. In fact, many of us  in this Chamber are familiar with her intellect and sound judgment.  Prior to being nominated to the Court of Federal Claims, Judge Griggsby  served as chief counsel for privacy and information policy on the  Senate Judiciary Committee under then-Chairman Leahy. Before that,  Judge Griggs by spent 10 years at the Department of Justice as an  Assistant U.S. Attorney. Judge Griggsby's long and distinguished career  has earned her a unanimous rating of ``Well Qualified'' from the  American Bar Association.   She also received broad, bipartisan support in the Judiciary  Committee, with five Republicans joining all Democrats to advance her  nomination. And she has the strong support of her home State Senators,  Senator Cardin and Senator Van Hollen. In 2014, the Senate confirmed  Judge Griggs by by voice vote. I hope she will once again receive broad  bipartisan support today.   I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of her nomination.
