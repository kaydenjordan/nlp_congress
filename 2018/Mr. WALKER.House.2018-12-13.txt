 Mr. Speaker, I stand today to recognize the service of  Guilford County's longest-serving sheriff in history, B.J. Barnes.   Sheriff Barnes is retiring after more than two decades of service to  the people and to the community of central North Carolina. Beginning in  1970, Sheriff Barnes felt the call to serve and enlisted in the United  States Marine Corps at only 19 years old.   After beginning a career in law enforcement, he was elected sheriff  in 1994. His reforms to the Guilford County justice system over the  years have not gone unnoticed, from updating ramshackle jails to  bringing our county necessary forensic technology, Sheriff Barnes  always fought, and succeeded, in keeping Guilford County safe.   His service forever changed our community, and, we, along with his  peers throughout the State and the country, will always remember his  relentless dedication, his integrity, and his compassion.   Twenty-four years and six terms later, Sheriff Barnes retires with an  outstanding record and will continue to be a source of influence for  Guilford County.   Heroes like Sheriff Barnes are the fabric of our community, and I am  blessed to call him a friend and mentor.                            ____________________
