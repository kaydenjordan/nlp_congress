 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4035, the Real Justice for Our  Veterans Act of 2021.   Unfortunately, many of our Nation's veterans suffer from substance  abuse disorders, mental health conditions, and trauma. According to  data from the Department of Justice's Bureau of Justice Statistics,  approximately 60 percent of combat veterans in our Nation's prisons  have reported mental health disorders.   Veterans treatment court programs are modeled after other specialized  treatment court programs, such as drug treatment courts to provide  services specific to meet the unique needs of veterans. Veterans  treatment courts are not only designed to benefit veterans in the  criminal justice system, but taxpayers as well.   These treatment programs lower recidivism for participants who  complete them, saving money that otherwise would have been spent on  incarceration.   H.R. 4035 will expand data collection on these treatment programs to  ensure that our veterans are getting the most effective treatment  possible.   H.R. 4035 also authorizes pilot programs to make grants to improve  retention rates in veterans treatment court programs. It allows  veterans in jurisdictions that do not operate veterans court programs  to participate in drug courts instead.   Congress must do everything in its power to protect our Nation's  veterans and ensure that they get the very best treatment. This is  exactly what this bill does.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 921, the Jamie Zapata and Victor  Avila Federal Officers and Employees Protection Act.   In 2011, members of the Los Zetas drug cartel gunned down ICE Agents  Jaime Zapata and Victor Avila in an attempted carjacking. Agent Zapata  was killed.   The perpetrators of this terrible crime were members of the Los Zetas  hit squad on a mission that day to shoot and steal vehicles for cartel  operations.   The murder and attempted carjacking occurred in Mexico. So the  perpetrators were extradited to the United States to face trial for the  murder and attempted murder of the American agents.   In 2017, the cartel members were convicted under section 1114 of  title 18 of the United States Code, which prohibits the killing of an  officer of the United States. They were sentenced to life in prison.   On appeal, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that because the  crimes occurred on foreign soil, section 1114 did not apply.   In light of this ruling, Federal law enforcement officers and civil  servants stationed overseas are made more vulnerable to attack. The  decision created a circuit split and opened a loophole in Federal law  reversing centuries of precedent that the law was intended to apply  extraterritorially.   The bill simply codifies centuries of precedent and legal  understanding by clarifying the extraterritorial application of three  Federal statutes to protect our Federal law enforcement officers and  other Federal officials. The bill passed the Senate by unanimous  consent in May.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Pfluger).    In closing, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support  this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 1502, the COPS Counseling Act of  2021.   With recent attacks on law enforcement agencies from the left,  including calls to defund the police, officers around the country have  suffered from persistent and increasing physical and mental stress.   Police departments are experiencing dropping retention rates and  officers are left with fewer colleagues to support them while also  facing more crime. As a result the need for new and better performing  peer support groups with State and local law enforcement agencies has  risen.   This bill would help alleviate some of that strain from dealing with  the ever-increasing amount of violent crime over the last year by  supporting and encouraging the use of peer support groups. Some people  feel like there is a stigma related to addressing mental health needs,  making mental wellness difficult to address.   Peer support programs can help address this challenge in the law  enforcement community. Officers who are in  [[Page H5946]]  need of help may be most comfortable reaching out to their fellow  officers especially if their confidentiality is protected. This bill  requires the Department of Justice, in consultation with the Department  of Health and Human Services, to develop a report of best practices for  peer support programs. These best practices required under the COPS  Counseling Act will help State and local law enforcement agencies  establish new peer counseling programs and enhance existing ones.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1315     Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Rutherford).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Reschenthaler).    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 1511, the Protecting America's  First Responders Act of 2021. This bill is about taking care of our  Federal, State, and local public safety officers who are working on the  front lines every day to protect us. Our Nation's law enforcement  officers need our support now more than ever.   Over the past year, we have seen violent crime rise in nearly every  major urban area. During this spike in violence, we have seen city  councils defund their police departments, taking vital resources away  from the brave men and women who protect us day in and day out. On top  of that, our law enforcement officers are dealing with all of the  complications of the COVID-19 pandemic.   According to the Fraternal Order of Police, over 700 public safety  officers have tragically lost their lives due to COVID-19. That number  will inevitably continue to rise.   The Department of Justice's Public Safety Officers' Benefits Program  provides assistance to officers and their families in the event that  they lose their lives or are catastrophically injured in the line of  duty. The PSOB Program reviews over a thousand claims submitted every  year.   The program provides a one-time, lump-sum payment of $370,000 for  officers who lose their lives or are catastrophically injured in the  line of duty. The payment amount is adjusted annually based on the  Consumer Price Index. Each claimant's payment amount is determined by  the date of the injury or death, but the claim may take years to  adjudicate.   This bill corrects this inequity by requiring that payment amounts be  determined by the date of adjudication for any claim that has been  pending for over a year. This will help these law enforcement officers  and their families account for increased cost of living and other  expenses that are subject to inflation during these lengthy  adjudication periods.   The PSOB Program also provides interim payments for death claims if  the claimant is likely to receive an award under the program, but the  interim payment amount has not increased since 1976. This bill will  increase those interim payments for death claims from $3,000 to $6,000  and require annual adjustments based on the Consumer Price Index to  ensure that Congress will not need to make further adjustments in the  future.   The PSOB Program also provides educational benefits of $1,200 a month  to children of public safety officers who have been killed or disabled  in the line of duty. Here, too, many of these claims for education  benefits are not adjudicated in a timely fashion, and many children do  not receive these benefits. This bill will provide backpay to the  children of fallen and disabled public safety officers who qualify for  benefits but failed to receive benefits due to a delay in processing  these claims.   Finally, this bill will update the PSOB Program's definition of  disability to ensure that law enforcement officers who are permanently  unable to secure meaningful, gainful employment following a  catastrophic injury in the line of duty remain eligible for benefits.   This is a critical and necessary piece of legislation, and I am proud  to support a bill that takes care of the men and women of our law  enforcement community.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers and am prepared to  close.   I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
