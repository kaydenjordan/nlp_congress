 Mr. President, I rise today to re-introduce the  ``Border Water Quality Restoration and Protection Act.''   For over two decades, cleaning up the Tijuana River Valley has been  one of my top priorities for Southern California. The wastewater, trash  and sediment that continues to flow into San Diego and Imperial  Counties is an alarming danger to public health and our economy.  Although we have made recent strides in cleaning up this pollution,  there is much work remaining.   That's why I am proud to introduce this important legislation, once  again, to help address this decades-long issue. I am very pleased  Senator Padilla has joined me as an original cosponsor and I look  forward to working with him on this important issue.   Polluted water from the Tijuana and New Rivers flows north across the  border into the United States causing unsanitary water conditions,  pollution and beach closures across Southern California. It also  jeopardizes military training exercises for Navy Seals in Camp  Pendleton.   Three-quarters of the 1,700-square-mile Tijuana River watershed lies  in Mexico. However, the watershed, along with all its pollutants,  drains into San Diego County and the Tijuana River Valley.   In addition to jeopardizing human health and safety, two of the most  drastic effects from this cross-border water pollution are harm to  wildlife and damage to the tourism industry, integral to Southern  Californian communities. As the coronavirus pandemic continues to  threaten our nation's health and economy, it is critical we work to  address the pollution in the region so California can welcome visitors  back to their beaches when it is safe to do so.   The beaches in the region are central to San Diego's tourism economy.  In recent years, beaches in the communities of Coronado and Imperial  Beach were closed for more than 200 days in a single year due to  pollution.   Health and safety of residents and workers are also at risk. In  recent years, local Border Patrol union officials reported that 80  officers suffered from contamination, rashes, infections, chemical  burns and lung irritation due to toxic cross-border flows.   In addition, pollution from Mexico harms sensitive areas that provide  critical habitat for more than 300 species of birds as well as marine  animals like leopard sharks and bottlenose dolphins. The region is home  to multiple parks and public lands, including the Tijuana River's  National Estuarine Research Reserve, the River Mouth State Marine  Conservation Area and River Valley Regional Park Preserve.   The harmful effects of pollution in the Tijuana River Valley on our  residents, businesses, economy and environment are simply unacceptable.   In February 2020, the Government Accountability Office issued a  comprehensive report, ``International Boundary Water Commission:  Opportunities Exist to Address Water Quality Problems.'' My office  worked closely with the GAO to utilize their findings to craft  meaningful change through this legislation.  [[Page S1029]]    Simultaneously, we were able to secure $300 million in the U.S.- Mexico-Canada trade agreement to address pollution in the Tijuana River  Valley Watershed.   With significant funding and detailed findings by the GAO  investigation, we developed this legislation in concert with federal,  state and local agency input. As beaches in both the United States and  Mexico continue to close due to high levels of pollution, it is as  imperative as ever to advance a solution that engages all stakeholders.   The Border Water Quality Restoration and Protection Act includes key  reforms to advance concrete solutions.   One of the problems is that no one agency is in charge of this  problem. A whole range of agencies--EPA, International Boundary and  Water Commission, State Department, Department of Homeland Security,  Customs and Border Protection, Defense Department--all have  jurisdiction or interest in this international issue.   What we need is one agency in charge, taking input from the others so  decisions can be made. This approach is similar to other large,  regional environmental challenges like the Great Lakes, Gulf of Mexico,  Everglades and Chesapeake Bay. Here in California, we have also seen  great success with this model of interagency coordination at Lake  Tahoe.   Here's how the bill would work:   The EPA would be officially named the agency with overall control of  this effort.   The EPA, along with its federal, state and local partners, would be  directed to identify a list of priority projects. It also would be  authorized to accept and distribute funds to build, operate and  maintain those projects.   The bill would permanently authorize the Border Water Infrastructure  Program to manage storm water runoff and water reuse projects.   State and local authorities would also be authorized to contribute  funding to federal projects, which is currently not allowed.   The International Boundary and Water Commission would be authorized  to mitigate storm water from Mexico and the pollution that comes with  it and is required to construct, operate and maintain projects on the  priority list developed by the agencies within the U.S. that improve  water quality.   We need a new and comprehensive approach to this issue that has  plagued border communities for too long. This bill creates a formal  process to consider effective, long-term solutions and additional  wastewater infrastructure to mitigate cross-border pollution and I hope  the Senate can move on this bill quickly.   I want to thank California Environmental Protection Agency,  California Natural Resources Agency, San Diego and Imperial counties,  cities of Imperial Beach and Coronado, Mayor of Chula Vista, Mary  Casillas Salas, the City of San Diego and the Port of San Diego for  supporting this legislation. These communities, and others, have been  negatively impacted by this issue for far too long.   It's past time that we finally solve this problem to safeguard local  health and economic growth.   Once again, I thank Senator Padilla for his cosponsorship. Thank you,  Mr. President. I yield the floor.                                  ______                                         By Mr. SCOTT of South Carolina (for himself, Mr. Murphy, Ms.          Collins, Mrs. Gillibrand, Mr. Tillis, Mr. Blumenthal, Ms.          Baldwin, Mr. Marshall, and Mr. Warnock):   S. 578.
