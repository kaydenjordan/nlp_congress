 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that  notwithstanding rule XXII, at 4 p.m. on Tuesday, June 11, all  postcloture time on the Morrison nomination be considered expired;  further, that if confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered made  and laid upon the table and that  [[Page S3281]]  the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action. I further  ask that following the disposition of the Morrison nomination, the  Senate vote on the cloture motions for Calendar Nos. 42, 43, 44, 46,  and 49; finally, that if cloture is invoked on those nominations, the  confirmation votes on the nominations occur at a time to be determined  by the majority leader, in consultation with the Democratic leader, on  Wednesday, June 12; and that, if confirmed, the motions to reconsider  be considered made and laid upon the table and that the President be  immediately notified of the Senate's action.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session and be in a period of morning business,  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 104, S. Res. 81.    I ask unanimous consent that the committee-reported  substitute amendment to the resolution be agreed to; that the  resolution, as amended, be agreed to; that the committee-reported  amendment to the preamble be agreed to; that the preamble, as amended,  be agreed to; and that the motions to reconsider be considered made and  laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 105, S. Res. 184.    I ask unanimous consent that the committee-reported  amendment to the resolution be agreed to; that the resolution, as  amended, be agreed to; that the committee-reported amendment to the  preamble be agreed to; that the preamble, as amended, be agreed to; and  that the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the  table.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 241, submitted earlier today.    I know of no further debate on the measure.    I ask unanimous consent that the preamble be agreed to  and that the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the  table with no intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m., Tuesday,  June 11, 2019; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the  morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved  to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later  in the day, morning business be closed, and the Senate proceed to  executive session and resume consideration of the Morrison nomination  under the previous order. Finally, I ask that the Senate recess from  12:30 p.m. until 2:15 p.m. to allow for the weekly conference meetings.    If there is no further business to come before the  Senate, I ask that it stand adjourned under the provisions of S. Res.  240 and do so as a further mark of respect for the late Dr. Lloyd John  Ogilvie, former Senate Chaplain.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 7:04 p.m., adjourned until  Tuesday, June 11, 2019, at 10 a.m.                            ____________________
