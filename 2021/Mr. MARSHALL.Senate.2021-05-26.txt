 Madam President, I call up my amendment No. 1973, as  modified, with the changes at the desk and ask that it be reported by  number.    Madam President, over the past year, COVID-19 has  spread to all corners of the world, killing more than 3 million people  in its path, including more than 550,000 Americans. We were originally  told this virus initiated in a wet market or that it may have come from  a bat that directly infected a human. However, the preponderance of  evidence now suggests this virus may have leaked from a lab in Wuhan.   With the World Health Assembly meeting this week, I ask this body to  fully express support for a complete investigation into this outbreak.  It is outrageous and inconceivable that a comprehensive investigation  has still not occurred.   If China continues on its path of coverup, we must begin planning a  full investigation, including with partners around the world. It would  be utterly irresponsible to suffer through the worst pandemic in a  century and not have the origins fully investigated.   Our bipartisan amendment will deliver the message that the Chinese  must show us the data and be transparent with the world, and if they  don't, we will fight to get to the bottom of this pandemic.   I thank Senator Gillibrand for introducing this amendment with me and  ask that all Senators join us in approving it, and we hope, we believe,  that this can pass with a voice vote.   Thank you. And I yield.
