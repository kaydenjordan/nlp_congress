 Madam President, last night President Trump delivered the  State of the Union Address, and he talked about a lot of issues,  including immigration and national security, healthcare, and  prescription drugs. He talked about the need for bipartisanship. While  I don't always agree with the President, I do agree that we should seek  bipartisanship where we can, and today I would like to address one area  that is ripe for bipartisan action.   I am so pleased that Senator Brown, Senator Van Hollen, Senator  Warner, Senator Cardin, and Senator Kaine have all played key roles in  the effort I am going to talk about this afternoon, and many of them  will be joining me today on the Senate floor. In addition, Senator  Casey will be joining us, and I am so glad that he is adding his voice.   So many Americans suffered during the wasteful and unnecessary  government shutdown that recently ended, but for one group of  Americans, the shutdown isn't over. These Americans are employees of  Federal contractors. Now, in previous shutdowns, Federal contractors  didn't receive backpay, and they haven't received backpay after this  shutdown, either. Now, that is not fair, and several of my colleagues  and I are determined to fix this. So over the next hour or so, my  colleagues and I will come together on the Senate floor to talk about  the importance of providing backpay to the employees of Federal  contractors who lost over a month's worth of wages.   Thousands of Federal contract employees work shoulder to shoulder  with Federal employees to make the government work. They clean office  buildings, provide security, serve millions of meals a year, and do  countless other jobs.   In an op-ed published today, Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley, the  sponsor of the House companion to our bill, and I shared a story that  we heard from Tamela Worthen, a security guard at the Smithsonian  Institution. Tamela said that she was worried that she would fall  behind on her mortgage and car payments, ruining the good credit that  she had worked so long and hard to build. As she spoke, beads of sweat  started rolling down her face. We were wondering: Was she nervous about  speaking in front of a crowd?   But, no, as Tamela explained, she is diabetic and has high blood  pressure. Without her regular paycheck, she hadn't been able to afford  the copay for  [[Page S904]]  a doctor's appointment to have her blood tested and her prescription  renewed. So she was going without her medicine.   Too often, these Federal contract workers are invisible to the  public, but I want them to know that those of us speaking on the Senate  floor today haven't forgotten about them.   Now I would like to read a little bit of a letter that I got from a  constituent in Minnesota named Annie. Annie is a chemist who works as a  Federal contractor at the Environmental Protection Agency in Duluth,  MN, and she wrote me a powerful letter about how the shutdown affected  her. Here are a few pieces of what she shared.   Annie wrote:         I look forward to my job because I am surrounded by       colleagues who are passionate about their work and want to       make a significant change towards bettering our environment.       . . . This work contributes to a large collaborative effort       of tracking and monitoring the health of the Great Lakes, a       priceless freshwater resource.    Annie went on to say:         My frustration with the shutdown stems not only from a       personal angle, but also from the halt it has put on       environmental research.    She says:         I am losing wages that I count on each month to make       significant payments towards my student loans and       contributions to my savings, including my retirement savings.       I can honestly say I never thought I would be applying for       unemployment, especially at 31 years old, but today I did       just that. Of course, collecting unemployment is better than       no wages at all, but it is still a far cry from earning my       normal income.    Annie finishes by saying:         The irritation I feel about the shutdown extends beyond       lost wages. I am very passionate about my work, and I believe       that what I do is important and contributes to a critical       subject: The environment.    Now, Annie makes a great point. Federal contract workers like Annie  do important work for people in Minnesota and across the country, and  it is wrong for Annie to go without pay because of a shutdown fight  that had nothing to do with her.   The Senate recently passed legislation to provide backpay to Federal  employees authored by Senator Cardin, and I am very honored to be able  to support Senator Cardin in that work. That bill passed without a  single Senator objecting.   Now, I strongly support providing backpay to Federal employees, and  it is just common sense that the contractors who work side by side with  these Federal employees should get the same backpay that they deserve  as well.   The shutdown was wasteful, and it made pawns of hundreds of thousands  of people. Yet Federal contractors have never been made whole in any  shutdown, including this last one, and we think that needs to change.   Why should these hard-working people be forced to pay the price for  the shutdown?   So we are working to fix this, and we have bipartisan legislation to  do so.   Here is what our bill would do. It would use an existing contracting  process that is known as equitable adjustment to make sure that  contractors can provide backpay to workers, with full backpay to low- wage workers and partial backpay to those who are earning higher  incomes.   Our effort is gaining support every day. In the Senate, we now have  bipartisan support with a group of more than 40 cosponsors and  counting, and nearly 70 organizations, including the AFL-CIO, the  National Partnership For Women and Families, Oxfam America, the United  Methodist Church General Board of Church and Society, and the United  Steelworkers that have all written in support of providing backpay for  these workers.   This is what their letter of support says in part: ``These federal  contract workers help keep our nation running, even if their paychecks  aren't cut directly by the U.S. government, and they need their  paychecks just as badly as federal employees and deserve the same  considerations when the government shuts down.''   So I want to say thank you to everyone who continues to make their  voices heard on this important issue. I am especially thankful to the  workers who shared their stories, like the great-grandmother who is  taking care of her two great-grandchildren, the employee who was  furloughed from two different jobs who now can't afford his electric  bill, and the worker at risk of losing their home because they couldn't  pay their mortgage.   Providing backpay to contractors is an important opportunity for  Republicans and Democrats to do what is right and to come together. If  you think it is wrong that hard-working people didn't get paid because  of a shutdown that had nothing to do with them, then it is time for you  to make your voice heard. Let's fix this, and let's fix it through  hashtag ``BackPayNow.''   Thank you very much.   I yield to Senator Cardin from Maryland.    Will Senator Cardin yield?    Senator Cardin, I want to take a moment to thank you so  much for your leadership on this and for making sure that Federal  employees get the backpay they deserve. I know that when this issue  first became clear to me, you were one of the first people I called  over the Christmas holiday to talk about what we might do to fix this  problem. So I greatly appreciate your partnership on this, along with  the partnership of so many of my other colleagues here but particularly  your help on this. Thank you very much.    Thank you.   Thank you, Madam President.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I thank Senator Van Hollen for being here  to talk about this.   When I first became aware of this issue, which was over what was the  Christmas holiday for us--Federal employees and Federal contractors  were already not working and not getting paid--Senator Van Hollen was  one of the first people whom I called to try to figure out what we  might do to resolve this, to solve this problem.   I thank you for your leadership and for all of the help that you have  given me and all of us to try to figure out this problem. Thank you  very much. It has been wonderful to work with you on this.   I also note that I am very grateful to see my colleague Senator Casey  here, who, I believe, also has some things to say about this.   I thank the Presiding Officer.
