 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Veteran  Service Recognition Act to stop the deportation of immigrant veterans.   I thank my colleague, Representative Mark Takano, for bringing this  important bill forward and our Immigration and Citizenship Subcommittee  chair, Zoe Lofgren, for her tremendous leadership on this issue.   Mr. Speaker, immigrants have defended the United States in every  major conflict since the Revolutionary War. One of the first casualties  in the Iraq war was Lance Corporal Jose Antonio Gutierrez, who was not  an American citizen when he died fighting for us. He signed up for the  Marines, wanting to give back to the country that gave him everything.   Today, there are 45,000 immigrants serving in the United States armed  services. Yet, hundreds of immigrant veterans are estimated to have  been deported.   Mr. Speaker, this is unacceptable. Immigration and Customs  Enforcement is supposed to consider veteran service to the country when  making removal decisions.   A 2019 GAO study found that ICE attorneys ``. . . did not  consistently follow its policies involving veterans who were placed in  removal proceedings . . .'' in part because ICE officials were ``. . .  unaware of the policies. . . .''   Mr. Speaker, we can't leave this to chance. Even one deported veteran  is one too many. Yet, hundreds of immigrant veterans are estimated to  have been deported.   When people sign up to defend this country, we should be helping them  to become U.S. citizens as quickly as possible, and that is exactly  what this bill does.   Mr. Speaker, that is why I am so proud to support the Veteran Service  Recognition Act to take crucial steps to stop the deportation of  veterans and provide relief to veterans who have already been deported.  No one who has put their life on the line for the United States should  be deported. It is that simple, Mr. Speaker.   Vote ``yes'' to support veterans.
