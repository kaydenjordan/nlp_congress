 Madam Speaker, 73 years ago, in the aftermath of the  Holocaust, a courageous group of Jewish leaders declared the creation  of the State of Israel. Eleven minutes later, President Truman  announced the U.S. recognition of the new State.   Truman was persuaded that in an area like the Middle East, where  there had never been any tradition of democratic government, it was  important for the long range security of our country that a nation  committed to a democratic system be established there.   Even today, Israel remains the only democracy in the Middle East with  fair elections, a free press, free speech, a court system that is open  to all, and protects the rights of women and minorities.   Israel has welcomed millions of immigrants fleeing persecution and  war from across the globe. Its thriving economy has a vibrant, high- tech sector and medical breakthroughs that have benefited the world.  Israel has literally made the desert bloom with innovative irrigation,  desalinization, and agricultural techniques.   Israel is our most reliable ally in the Middle East. Our countries  share military exercises and intelligence and have developed cutting- edge missile defense systems and border security technology.   Israel's brave founders created an extraordinary nation that has  provided immeasurable value to our country and the world. May our  countries be blessed with many more years of friendship.                            ____________________
