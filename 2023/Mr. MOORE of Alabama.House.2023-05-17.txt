 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and insert extraneous material on H.R. 2494.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chair, as we celebrate National Police Week, it is only  appropriate that we pass H.R. 2494, the POLICE Act of 2023.   H.R. 2494 makes an alien removable if they assault a police officer.  43,649--that is the staggering number of law enforcement officers who  were assaulted by performing their duties in just 2021. That represents  an 11.2 percent increase from 2020.   In both 2021 and 2022, at least 64 law enforcement officers were shot  and killed in the line of duty. In my home State of Alabama, five law  enforcement officers were shot and killed. That is a 21 percent  increase over the number killed from 2010 to 2020.   To make matters worse, many of those incidents involve criminal  aliens who take advantage of our immigration system and then turn  around and assault the very people who protect us every day.   In a single 2-month operation in 2020, Immigration and Customs  Enforcement arrested aliens with criminal histories with 1,500  convictions and charges for assault.   In 2019, ICE arrested aliens who accounted for 45,804 assault  convictions and charges.   The reports speak for themselves. Just 2 months ago, an illegal alien  violently assaulted a U.S. Border Patrol agent as she attempted to  arrest him. In November 2022, two aliens were arrested for pushing,  dragging, and punching a Border Patrol agent in another incident.   These acts of violence are not limited to just Border Patrol. Just  last fall, a criminal alien was sentenced to 30 years in prison for  stabbing a New York Police Department officer, taking his gun and then  shooting at other officers.   In 2020, a criminal alien shot and killed a Houston police sergeant  as he responded to a domestic violence call.   Despite these acts, the immigration statute does not explicitly make  assaulting a law enforcement officer a deportable offense. H.R. 2494  changes that by creating grounds of removability specific to aliens who  assault law enforcement officers.   Although many such offenders can be removed based on other grounds,  such as an aggravated assault felony or a crime involving moral  turpitude, H.R. 2494 ensures that criminal aliens cannot escape the  immigration consequences of their actions through legal loopholes.   Determining whether an alien is removable from the country is not as  straightforward as it should be. In a case from last year, a Federal  judge observed that the process to determine whether an alien had been  convicted of a crime that would make him removable presented ``a single  legal question about a single conviction.''   Despite seemingly easy questions, the analysis ``has spawned, over 11  years and counting: four decisions by the [Board of Immigration  Appeals], four decisions by three different immigration judges,  approximately six rounds of briefing, and a split opinion by [a  Federal] court.''   This bill would avoid those absurd results of that approach to make  crystal clear that an alien who assaults a law enforcement officer can  be removed from the United States.    Democrats have argued that this bill would encompass too much conduct  due to State definitions of assault. That couldn't be further from the  truth.   Listen to what the bill requires: first, either an admission or a  conviction of an assault or an offense; the assault must have been  against a law enforcement officer; and that assault must have been  while the law enforcement officer was performing his or her duties,  because of the performance of those duties, or because of his or her  status as a law enforcement officer.   Democrats' far-fetched hypotheticals make light of assault against  law enforcement officers and do not align with reality. If an alien  admits to assaulting a law enforcement officer but a far-left  prosecutor refuses to prosecute that crime, why should that alien  escape immigration consequences?   Make no mistake, criminal aliens who assault dedicated men and women  of law enforcement should find no safe harbor under our immigration  laws.   H.R. 2494 gives adjudicators a tool to ensure that these criminal  aliens can quickly be removed from this country. In doing so, we make  America safer, not only for our citizens but also for the hardworking  men and women of law enforcement who serve our community every day.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman  from New York (Mr. Garbarino).    Mr. Chairman, let me say this: I think this  bill is very important and extremely timely. We know that we have had 5  million encounters on the U.S. southern border since Biden has been  President, and in that situation with title 42 expiring, we expect more  and more law enforcement is going to have to interact with aliens. Some  we know are probably on some watch list somewhere, and they have a  criminal history.   I think that it is timely. I think that our friends across the aisle  need to join  [[Page H2397]]  us in supporting police officers this week and get on board to support  this bill, as well.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I urge our colleagues to pass this  bill into law and support our policemen and -women in uniform.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to  the amendment.   Mr. Correa is a good friend of mine, I think one of my closest  friends across the aisle, so I am going to have a little debate on his  amendment.   H.R. 2494 requires that an alien either be convicted of an offense  involving assault of a law enforcement officer or admit to assaulting a  law enforcement officer.   Contrary to the Democrats' talking points on the other side, not  every ground of removability in the Immigration and Nationality Act  requires a conviction.   In fact, here are some of the removable offenses that do not require  conviction: smuggling, marriage fraud, drug abuse or drug addiction,  trafficking, document fraud, terrorist activities, and participation in  violations of religious freedom.   By requiring at least an admission of assault, this bill conforms to  the pattern of other grounds of removability even exceeding many of  those already listed.   The language of this bill also tracks closely with the language for  certain grounds of inadmissibility as well, such as crimes involving  moral turpitude and controlled substance offenses.   In a world of increasing threats against law enforcement officers-- whom we all support--it makes no sense to require a conviction. If an  alien has admitted to assaulting a law enforcement officer, then why  can't the alien's own admission be used to show that alien is  deportable?   Listen to what the bill requires: an admission or a conviction of an  assault offense; the assault must have been against a law enforcement  officer; and that assault must have been while the law enforcement  officer was performing his or her duties or because of his or her  status as a law enforcement officer.   Even then, DHS would have to charge the alien as removable, the  immigration judge would have to sustain that charge of removability,  and then the alien would be allowed to appear for relief to remain in  the United States.   This amendment would strike the reasonable provision that would allow  criminal aliens to be removed if they admit to assaulting a law  enforcement officer.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I move that the Committee do now  rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Moore of Alabama) having assumed the chair, Mr. Moylan, Acting Chair of  the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported  that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R.  2494) to make the assault of a law enforcement officer a deportable  offense, and for other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon.
