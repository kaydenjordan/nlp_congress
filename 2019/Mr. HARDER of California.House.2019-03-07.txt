 Madam Chair, I thank Chair Lofgren for her  leadership on this issue.   Madam Chair, I rise today to urge my colleagues to support my  amendment to limit the influence of lobbyists on elected officials.   Here is a stat that blows me away. D.C. is home to 11,000 registered  lobbyists. That is 25 lobbyists per Member of Congress.   During one of my first nights in D.C., I got invited to dinner with  some of my freshman colleagues. I thought it was going to be a chance  to talk about the issues that I hear from families in my community: the  cost of healthcare, education, maybe jobs. But imagine my surprise when  the only thing these lobbyists wanted to talk about was what would  benefit their clients.   This happens in the city every day. Thousands of lobbyists here, in  one city, creating an ecosystem of easy access where they can push  their client's agenda in front of elected representatives.   My amendment is simple. It says that if you are a lobbyist and you  reach out to a Member of Congress, you must make clear that you are a  lobbyist, you must make clear who your clients are, and you better tell  us who pays you. This is common sense.   Back home, I hear a common frustration that Washington doesn't  listen. This problem is real and it has got to stop. My community has  had enough with back-room deals. This amendment is one step in the  right direction, and I urge this body to vote in favor.
