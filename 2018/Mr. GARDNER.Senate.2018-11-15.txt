 I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I stand here today to honor the  distinguished veterans of the Northern Colorado Honor Flight who have  made their 21st and final flight to Washington, DC. The Colonel Stan  Cass Memorial Flight, in honor of Northern Colorado Honor Flight's  founder, consisted of over 120 distinguished veterans.   Military service is an exceptional duty to the country. Though these  memorials honor our veterans' service, no statue or monument can truly  express the level of gratitude we feel for the veterans who risked  their lives for our rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of  happiness. When the United States has been threatened, our veterans  have stepped up and answered our country's call without reservation or  fear.   Twice a year, veterans are able to travel to our Nation's Capital,  where we are able to recognize them for their selflessness, fortitude,  and bravery. Thirteen years after the founding of the Honor Flight  Program, it spans across our country and recognizes veterans from every  generation and every branch. In the past decade, Honor Flight Northern  Colorado alone was able to take almost 3,000 veterans to Washington,  DC.   Please join me in honoring the veterans of the 21st Honor Flight:  Robert Hauser, Donald Reisner, Kenneth Sweeney, Philip Bell, Wilbur  Doeksen, Edmund Giese, Jr., Orville Markham, Roy Nichols, Lawrence  Powers, Wesley Te Winkle, Gloria Atteberry, Walter Babcock, Terrill  Bashline, Roger Bates, James Beemer, Anthony Benavidez, Michael  Bernard, Gary Blomenkamp, Roger Boltz, Donald Bonenberger, Jimmy  Bracking, Richard Bryson, Gerard Bucknall, Bruce Cameron, Cecily Cass,  Larry Chartier, Archie Cloud, Jr., William Corbett, Steven Crall,  Gregory Cranston, Gary Crego, Gary Cyr Sr., Thomas Danton, Raymond  Davis, David DeCamp, Raymond Delgado, Salvatore Delprete, Ronald  Dickerhoff, Brian Donahue, Alvin Dorsey, Eugene Eddy, Richard Fischer,  Norman Fulton, Gary Garrison, James Gerk, William Gill III, Gregory  Goettsch, Larry Goettsch, Allan Gott, Dallas Greenfield, Dennis  Hammonds, Rodney Hansen, Gerald Henderson, James Hernandez, Edwin  Hollingsworth, Donald Holt, Michael Hughes, Kenneth Iliff, Foy Jolley  Jr., Gary Jones, Thomas Keen, James Kennedy, Stephen Kennedy, James  Kepler, David Kinion, Mark Kintzley, Galen Konken, Nicholas Kricken,  Donald Lambertson, Alec Leavitt, Roland Lei, Samuel Leighton, Robert  Magnuson, Joseph Markham, Michael McCormick, Arthur Meek, Wayne  Moeller, Juan Montoya, Marino Montoya, Charles Morgan, Richard Myron,  Edward Nelson, Clayton Obland, John Ochoa, Dean Olson, Harleigh  Peppler, Charles Powers, Albert Pribble, Rodger Price, Roger Ramsey,  Paul Richmann, Kenneth Ricker, Robert Riggs, Philip Rouse, John  Rowland, Robert Rowton, Steven Rylant, Rodolfo Sanchez, John Sanger,  Martin Sattler, William Schenk, John Schroetlin, Kenneth Schroetlin,  Donald Shaffer, Bert Smith, Gerald Smith, Robert Starck, William  Starck, Duane Steinbrecher, Billy Thornton, Robert Tomlinson, Larry  Torrez, Garlin Trower, Jr, Ernest Tyler, John Vaughn, Eugene Vigil,  Antonio Villarreal, John Ward, Howard Willich, William Woods, Steve  Zivicky, William Zoller, and Brian Ivers.                            ____________________
