 Mr. President, I come to the floor today to oppose the  confirmation of David Chipman, President Biden's nominee for Director  of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.   Many Hoosiers are concerned about the nomination of Mr. Chipman, and  rightfully so. His statements have made one thing clear: If confirmed,  he will fail to uphold the constitutional right to bear arms.   He has stated under oath that he supports mandatory Federal  registration of common semiautomatic firearms and ultimately supports a  ban on AR-15 rifles.   Semiautomatic sporting rifles can be found in the homes of millions  of law-abiding Americans, Hoosiers included, who use them for hunting,  recreational shooting, and defending their families.   The ATF has a responsibility to clearly articulate its decisions to  the public. In his confirmation hearing, Mr. Chipman revealed that he  is not able to articulate what an assault rifle even is. His beliefs  represent, in my opinion, a direct attack on our Second Amendment  rights.   It is no surprise that organizations that have never opposed an ATF  nominee before are loudly opposing the nomination of David Chipman.   Mr. Chipman's nomination comes as the ATF is already in need of more  accountability for politicized decisions. American gun owners,  manufacturers, and small business owners deserve clarity and the right  to appeal politicized decisions made by the ATF.   Currently, the ATF engages in a secretive, behind-the-scenes  classification review process to decide if a firearm will be regulated  by the National Firearms Act. No law-abiding American should have to  wonder if they are going to suddenly be made a criminal by a  bureaucratic decision. It doesn't make sense.   That is why I joined Representative   Dan Crenshaw in the House to  introduce the ATF Accountability Act. Law-abiding gun manufacturers and  small businesses should be able to appeal the legal status of  classifications within a regular timeframe.   I yield the floor at this time.    Mr. President, here in a moment, I am going to ask for  unanimous consent on the ATF Accountability Act and the Protecting the  Right to Keep and Bear Arms Act.   Governor Cuomo has declared gun violence a public health emergency in  New York. ``We want to do with gun violence what we just did with  COVID,'' Governor Cuomo says.   During the pandemic, Governor Cuomo and other elected officials used  the public health emergency to infringe upon Americans' constitutional  rights. They barred Americans from exercising their freedom of religion  by closing churches. They infringed upon Americans' right to assemble  by banning many gatherings, and now gun control activist organizations  are pressuring President Biden to declare gun violence as a public  health emergency.   Doing so would allow the administration to take Executive action to  hold up gun sales.   Declaring a public health emergency should not give the executive  branch the right to infringe upon our Second Amendment. This is why I  introduced the Protecting the Right to Keep and Bear Arms Act to stop  this. This bill would prevent the White House from declaring an  emergency for the purpose of imposing gun control.   I took an oath to represent Hoosiers and protect their Second  Amendment rights. That is why I will oppose the nomination of David  Chipman and why I will ask for unanimous consent to pass the ATF  Accountability Act and the Protecting the Right to Keep and Bear Arms  Act.   Mr. President, as if in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent  that the Judiciary Committee be discharged from further consideration  of S. 1920 and the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration;  further, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be considered read a  third time and passed and that the motion to reconsider be considered  made and laid upon the table.    Madam President, a quick response to that before I ask  unanimous consent on the next item is that that is an argument I hear  so often, that the city that supports some of the toughest State gun  laws and local laws that ends up having the statistics that no one  would want to have across our country and then would try to cast that  blame on a neighboring State tells me that you are looking in the wrong  place to solve the problem.   The ATF here, we are just wanting clarity--that is the purpose of  this act, and I suggest that my friend from Illinois look at some of  the more basic issues that might be underlying what is happening there.                      Unanimous Consent Request--S. 1916    Madam President, as if in legislative session, I ask unanimous  consent that the Committee on the Judiciary be discharged from further  consideration of S. 1916 and the Senate proceed to its immediate  consideration; further, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be  considered read a third time and passed and that the motion to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.
