 Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of  Orly Munzing, an extraordinary Vermonter and longtime advocate for  family farms and resilient communities.   Orly founded Strolling of the Heifers in 2002 in Brattleboro, VT, to  help bring awareness to the plight of small dairy farms. During Orly's  tenure as executive director of Strolling of the Heifers, she  transformed a small town parade into a widely renowned event  celebrating sustainable agriculture and family farms. I am proud to  have marched in many of these parades over the last 17 years to  celebrate our farms and our communities in Vermont and around the  country. Under Orly's leadership, Strolling of the Heifers has  continued to expand, now including the farm-to-table culinary  apprenticeship program to provide underserved community members with  the vital skills necessary for obtaining good quality jobs in the food  sector.   In addition to Strolling of the Heifers, Orly founded the nationally  recognized Locavore Index, the first tool to measure the growth of the  local food movement. She also created Windham Grows, a program to  provide valuable skills and resources to farm and food entrepreneurs.  Just this past year, Orly received the Innovation & Spirit Award from  the Vermont Businesses for Social Responsibility as recognition of this  work.   Prior to all these important accomplishments, Orly worked for 24  years as a learning specialist in the public school system and  consulted with teachers on cutting-edge educational techniques. For  decades, she has been a truly tireless champion who has made  significant strides to create more healthy and prosperous rural  communities. At a time of increased recognition of the profound impact  agriculture and food have on the vibrancy of rural lands, our health,  and the health of the planet, it is heartening to know that dedicated,  passionate people like Orly are making a real difference in our  communities.   Mr. President, I am not only enormously grateful for all of Orly's  many contributions over the years, but I am also proud to call her a  good friend. I wish her all the best in her retirement and know she  will continue to fight for more environmentally sound and fundamentally  just communities.                            ____________________
