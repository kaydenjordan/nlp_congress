 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order of  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise today in defense of net neutrality.  In April the House of Representatives took an important step in passing  the Save the Internet Act, legislation that would overturn the Trump  administration's Federal Communication Commission's wrongheaded  decision and restore net neutrality protections. Another way of saying  it is that net neutrality is nondiscrimination online. That is what it  is. It is the principle of nondiscrimination online so that large  companies just can't discriminate against smaller voices, smaller  companies, and startups.   In the Senate, we have already successfully passed the same proposal  last year. In April of 2018, my Congressional Review Act resolution  passed in the Senate on a bipartisan vote of 52 to 47. In April 2018,  on a bipartisan basis, we debated net neutrality and the Senate decided  to join the majority of Americans and support a free and open internet.   In that vote we sent a message to President Trump about what that  means: an internet, free of corporate control and open to all who want  to communicate, engage, and innovate. We made it clear that Congress  will not fall for President Trump's special interest agenda and his  broadband baron allies who just want to block, slow down, or  discriminate against content online just to charge Americans more on  their cable bills.   Unfortunately, the rules for the Congressional Review Act that allow  just 30 Senators to force the majority to schedule a vote is not an  option in this Congress. So, instead, on this, the 1-year anniversary  of President Trump's net neutrality repeal going into effect, we will  call for an immediate vote on the Save the Internet Act. Unfortunately,  our Republican colleagues are failing to listen to the voices of their  constituents and plan to block the vote from happening.   Let's be clear. Net neutrality is just another way in which the  Republican Party refuses to side with the ordinary people in our  country--regular families, small businesses, and startup software  companies. How do they get access to the internet in a way in which  they cannot feel that corporate pressure restricting their ability to  use this incredible invention to further the democratization of access  to opportunity or, at the same time, to innovate in a way which  continues to change not only our own country but our own world?   We can't let big companies discriminate against individual consumers.  We can't let big companies stifle speech. Once you pay your monthly  internet service bill, you can go anywhere you want on the internet  without your provider slowing down or blocking your path to a website  of your choosing.   This is a fight. It is a fight for innovation, for  entrepreneurialism, for the American economy, and a fight for free  speech--the cornerstone of our democracy--and a fight for the most  powerful platform for commerce and communications in the history of the  planet. The Save the Internet Act does exactly what the American people  want. It restores the rules that ensure that families aren't subject to  higher prices, slower internet speeds, and even blocked websites  because the big broadband providers want to pump up their profits.   Under Senator McConnell's leadership, the Republicans are trying to  bury this bill in a legislative graveyard. Instead of acting on  legislation, which, again, passed the Senate a year ago--it just passed  in the House in April of this year--Leader McConnell has been doing  little but confirming unqualified, extreme-right nominees for the Trump  administration.   Just listen to the bills the Senate Republicans refuse to act on: the  Violence Against Women Act, no votes out here on the Senate floor;  voting on democracy reform, no votes out here on the Senate floor; gun  background checks, passed in the House but no vote here in the Senate;  paycheck fairness; the Paris climate agreement--no, no, no.   But the Senate majority leader and his Republican colleagues can keep  populating the legislative graveyard at their political peril because  this is the agenda that the American people want to see the Senate  debating, and they want to see these laws put on the books to protect  families in our country. That is because the issues they are blocking  are enormously popular, most with strong bipartisan support.   Take net neutrality. Now, 86 percent of Americans do not approve of  the  [[Page S3303]]  Federal Communication Commission's action to repeal net neutrality  rules, including 82 percent of Republicans, and we are not going to  have a vote out here on the Senate floor.   On background checks for gun purchases, 97 percent of Americans  support requiring background checks for all gun buyers, but we are not  going to have a vote out here on the Senate floor.   On staying in the Paris climate agreement, nearly 70 percent of  registered voters believe the United States should keep its promise and  stay in that historic agreement to combat climate change, but the  Republicans will not allow us to even have a vote on that out here on  the Senate floor.   The only place where these issues don't have Republican support is in  Senator McConnell's office. Across the country, there are huge  bipartisan numbers on each and every one of those issues. It is time  that we do right by the American people, and we can start with the Save  the Internet Act to protect the internet as we know it.   More than 100 outside advocacy organizations wrote to Senate  leadership today urging a vote on the net neutrality legislation. They  want action now, and Democrats are committed to fighting on their  behalf.   I am joined today by some of our greatest fighters for net neutrality  in the Senate and across our country. The ranking member of the  Commerce Committee, Maria Cantwell from Washington State, will be out  here in a few minutes, but now I am joined by Senator Ron Wyden of  Oregon.   Senator Wyden and I introduced net neutrality legislation 15 years  ago in the House and in the Senate. Nobody understands this issue  better than Senator Wyden does. Partnering with Senator Cantwell, we  are going to continue this battle. Whether it is on the floor of the  Senate or in the House or whether it is in the courts, we will not stop  fighting until net neutrality is restored.   So, from my perspective, right from the very beginning, Senator Wyden  and I have been on the right side of history. We have been fighting for  an issue that has overwhelming public support, and we are not going to  give up until we have won this fight.   At this point, I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I think Senator Cantwell and Senator Wyden  have done an excellent job in laying out the parameters of the problems  that exist if we do not have net neutrality enshrined as the law of the  land.   We believe the principles of nondiscrimination--the principles that  ensure that the internet is open and accessible to the smallest voices  as well as the largest voices. We need laws to protect the smallest  voices. We need protections to ensure that they are going to be heard,  that they can innovate, that they can take their entrepreneurial zeal,  their insights into the additional changes that can be made in this  longstanding--now a 20-year history of dynamic changes that have taken  place in the online commercial world and that they will be able to  innovate.   They should not have to get permission to innovate. They should not  have to get permission to be able to change the way in which people  communicate in our country. We shouldn't have to hire lawyers to  negotiate with the lawyers of the biggest companies in the United  States in order to ensure that investors aren't going to lose all their  money as the small company gets tipped upside down and has all of their  resources absolutely devastated by anticompetitive activity. That is  what this is all about--democracy and capitalism, entrepreneurial  spirit, the ability to innovate, the ability to be able to go to the  marketplace.   In order for capitalism to work, it has to have a conscience.  Capitalism without a conscience allows for unfettered large  corporations to take advantage of small companies, startups, and  individuals in our society. It has to have a conscience. Net neutrality  is the conscience for the online world we live in. It ensures that  there is fairness, openness, and it ensures that the apertures that are  there cannot be narrowed just because of the corporate agenda of an  individual huge company.   That is the essence of this whole debate. It is something we believe  is at the heart of what this 21st century platform of commerce should  include. It will be, in a lot of ways, the defining issue of whether  this entire era is one that is characterized by fairness or one that is  characterized by monopolistic or duopoly practices.                     Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 1644    Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Cantwell and Senator Wyden and  myself, I ask unanimous consent, as in legislative session, that the  Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 74, H.R.  1644, a bill to restore the open internet order  [[Page S3305]]  of the Federal Communications Commission; that the bill be considered  read a third time and passed; and that the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate.    Mr. President, despite the Republican objections today,  Senator Cantwell, Senator Wyden, and I, and tens of millions of people  across this country will not stop fighting until net neutrality is  fully restored. Whether in the Halls of Congress or in the courts of  our country, this is going to be a fight that is fought until it is  finally won.   I yield the floor.
