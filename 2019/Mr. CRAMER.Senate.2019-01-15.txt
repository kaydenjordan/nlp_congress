 Madam President, I thank my friend and colleague, Senator  Hoeven.   Before I get into my prepared comments, let me first associate myself  with his words and his eloquent appreciation and congratulations to the  folks at NDSU and to the football team. Let me just say that I don't  care what President Trump says--in Bison Nation, we never get tired of  winning.                                March For Life    Madam President, for the first time, I rise as a Member of this  prestigious body, as a U.S. Senator, to talk about a critical issue  that faces our Nation, which is every citizen's right to life.   It is no coincidence that I rise today, the week of March for Life.  This coming Friday is the 46th annual March for Life, during which  citizens from across the country and hundreds from North Dakota,  especially students from places like Shanley High School and the  University of Mary and other institutions around our State, will unite  to fight against the largest, deadliest, and most silent war this world  has ever known. This, my colleagues, is the war against the unborn.   During my time in the House of Representatives in the last 6 years  and throughout my campaign for the Senate last year, I promised the  people of North Dakota that I would fight for life at all stages. I  unite, today, with those who will march this Friday, who will walk with  heavy and hopeful hearts and who will pray for the 60 million discarded  children who have been denied their very first breaths.   Colleagues, I stand here to call to mind a child's right to life and  protection within the womb of his or her mother. Since Roe v. Wade,  which the Supreme Court decided in 1973, over 60 million children have  been denied their right to life. There have been 60 million children  who have been refused love, comfort, a hug, care, opportunity, and  breath. They were torn from experiencing the beauty of the world that  we are so fortunate to see. They were torn from family and unknown  friends.   To deny 60 million innocent children the right to these things is the  highest injustice to our people and the highest offense to our God. I  speak on behalf of the citizens of North Dakota and of all citizens who  will gather this week to say that it is absolutely unacceptable that  within this country, life is treated as a commodity rather than a gift  from an omnipotent Creator.   Some of my pro-choice colleagues and friends may say that in taking  this stance, I am standing against women's rights--nothing could be  further from the truth--and that this is an issue of a woman's right.  It is an issue for the millions of women who have been denied the right  to life. I fully support women's rights. I just began supporting them 9  months earlier than some of my colleagues on the other side of this  important issue.    To my colleagues who are pro-life who are supportive of this fight, I  remind them that abortion is a great injustice, but it is particularly  common in situations and communities that  [[Page S196]]  have suffered other injustices. If we are going to be pro-life, I think  we must be pro all of life and address the factors that cause women to  decide to end the life of their unborn children.   The United States has seen a great evil throughout its history. We  have seen and experienced slavery, discrimination, and human  trafficking. All of these things are illegal, and these things are  issues on which we as a country take a moral stance. However, abortion  is legal. Sixty million lives have been ended legally in our country.   Here, in Washington, DC, nearly 40 percent of pregnancies end in  abortion. In New York City, an African-American child is more likely to  be aborted than born. As one Nation under God, we, as a country, should  know better. We must know better, and I believe we do know better. No  government should limit the lives of its youngest and most innocent  citizens.   As a Senator, I give you my promise to fight for life, and I ask my  colleagues to join me. This is my promise to the people of North Dakota  who have chosen me as their Senator and my promise to my fellow  citizens, especially those who have never had the chance to speak with  their voices.   Within my first few weeks here, I have signed onto several pro-life  priorities. I have signed a letter asking President Trump to veto any  legislation that undermines the right to life. Additionally, I  cosponsored the Protect Funding for Women's Healthcare Act, a bill that  would end Federal funding for Planned Parenthood and shift that money  to women's health services.   In North Dakota, we don't have any Planned Parenthood clinics, but we  have 16 community health centers and over 20 federally qualified health  centers. Shifting this money toward these health centers would help the  women in my State to receive better and more accessible healthcare. Let  me say that again. Shifting funding away from the abortion clinics and  toward these community health centers would provide more funds to the  health centers that care for women across the State of North Dakota.   Additionally, I have cosponsored the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion  and Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act and the Title X Prohibition  Act, two bills to protect the taxpayer from funding the abortion  industry.   I have cosponsored the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act,  which would guarantee that a child who survives an abortion will  receive the same medical care as a premature child of the same age, and  the Child Interstate Abortion Notification Act, which protects the  rights of parents to be notified if their child is going to have an  abortion.   Finally, I have cosponsored the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection  Act, which would ban abortion after 20 weeks.   My fellow Senators, I stand here because of the citizens of North  Dakota and of the United States who desire to see these bills and many  other important pro-life bills pass and signed into law. They want an  end to this injustice.   I recognize my responsibility to fight for the youngest, most  vulnerable members of our society and our future generations. Today, I  stand with my constituents and with the entire population of the United  States, especially the men and women who have been robbed of their  right to life. I urge my fellow Senators to take a stand on this  pressing issue as well. With our united efforts, the killing of our  unborn citizens will continue to diminish.   Our work is fruitful. In every legislative session we see more and  more laws passed at the State level to protect unborn life. From 2008  to 2014, the abortion rate in the United States dropped by 25 percent.  Each year, we are making great strides and giving a voice to the  voiceless.   This fight is not a political fight but a fight for humanity itself.  It is a war against all of us and against all of our children, no  matter our ideologies. We have to learn to prioritize the issues in our  own parties and work across the aisle. We have to look at each other  with open minds and open hearts to solve this crisis that has plagued  our country. We must do better at reaching out and uniting with one  another in defense of one of the most fundamental rights--the right to  life.   The truth is this: We must uphold this right because ``we hold these  Truths to be self-evident, that all Men are created equal, that they  are endowed''--at the time of creation--``by their Creator with certain  unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit  of Happiness.'' Without the first--that is the right to life--we can  have neither liberty nor the pursuit of happiness. We have been denying  the first for far too long. So let's join together now to give the  future of our country, our next generations, the right to life.   With that, I yield the floor.
