 Mr. President, I am here today on the Senate floor  for ``Time to Wake Up'' speech No. 253.   If you felt like the heat this summer was particularly brutal, you  were not imagining things. July was the hottest month ever recorded,  according to NOAA. The Secretary General of the World Meteorological  Organization noted, ``July has rewritten climate history, with dozens  of new temperature records at [the] local, national and global level.''   NOAA says 2019 is on track to tie for the second hottest year on  record. Overall, the past 5 years are expected to take the title of the  hottest 5-year period in recorded human history.   This rapid heating of our Earth is wreaking havoc on our environment  and public health. Here is a list from NOAA that you can find on their  website, Selected Significant Climate Anomalies and Events, July 2019,  all around the globe.   In 1 day--1 day--the Greenland ice sheet lost 12\1/2\ billion tons of  ice, melted into the sea. Throughout the world, from France to India,  to the Arctic Circle, temperature records shattered. On July 4, the  people of Anchorage, AK, experienced their first ever 90-degree day. At  one point in July, excessive heat warnings asked nearly 170 million  Americans to avoid the outdoors and take shelter in air conditioning,  where available.   According to Deke Arndt, head of climate monitoring for NOAA, these  record heat waves are, and I quote him, ``almost entirely due to  climate change.'' Jack Williams, a professor with the Center for  Climatic Research at the University of Wisconsin, told NBC news the  ``[h]eat waves of today are going to be the normal events of  tomorrow.''   Where there is heat, there is apt to be fire. In the United States,  wildfires rage on a remarkable scale. According to a new report by the  major data analytics company CoreLogic, over 8.7 million acres burned  in the United States in 2018. That is about the land area of the 75  largest cities in the United States combined.   This summer, the Arctic experienced a record-setting wildfire season.  Places that have not traditionally burned in parts of northern Canada,  Alaska, Greenland, and Siberia were engulfed in flames visible from  space.   In this map, the North Pole is about here. This looks down at Alaska  here and Russia here, the Siberian Arctic. As you can see, fires were  everywhere. Guillermo Rein of Imperial College London told Wired:         Arctic fires are rare, but they're not unprecedented. What       is unprecedented is the number of fires that are happening.       Never before have satellites around the planet seen this       level of activity.    As of August 28, fires cut across more than 6 million acres of  Siberian forest and 2.5 million acres of Alaskan tundra and forested  land.   These forests aren't just scarring the Arctic landscape; they are  also releasing tons more of carbon dioxide, causing more climate  change. Researchers estimate the Arctic fires have released more than  180 million tons of CO2. For comparison, my home State of  Rhode Island was responsible for around 9.75 million tons of carbon  dioxide through our fossil fuel combustion in 2016--roughly 20 times as  much, just from these fires.   NASA scientists are also tracing soot from these fires. The soot  absorbs sunlight and warms the atmosphere; and when the soot settles  and covers Arctic ice, it absorbs more sunlight and speeds up the  melting and the warming. Once these forces are set in motion, the  vicious cycle of warmer temperatures, wildfires, ice melt, and then  ever warmer temperature is hard to break.    Far from the Arctic, fires rage in another iconic ecosystem: the  Amazon. So far this year, the Amazon region has seen over 40,000 fires.  Unlike the Arctic, our changing climate is less to blame for the  devastation than humans.   Again, natural forest fires in the Amazon are rare, but warmer and  dryer conditions under climate change do make the fires larger and  longer lasting than in the past. The true culprit in Brazil is manmade  deforestation, accelerating under the new Brazilian President.  Enforcement against illegal logging and clearing has declined. In the  first 6 months of this year, over 1,300 square miles of Amazon forest  were destroyed in Brazil, sometimes at a rate of more than three  football fields' worth of forest per minute.   The journal Science Advances warns that deforestation in the Amazon  is close to a threshold beyond which the rainforest will undergo  irreversible changes. Without the healthy forests of the Amazon, the  world will lose one of its most important terrestrial carbon sinks-- areas that naturally absorb carbon from our atmosphere. The Amazon  captures about 5 percent of annual global carbon dioxide emissions. A  2015 study published in Nature shows that the amount of carbon dioxide  the Amazon absorbs is already falling, has fallen since the 1990s by  nearly one-third.   In Brazil, the air has gotten so thick with smoke that in Porto  Velho, a city in the upper Amazon basin, over 400 children landed in a  local hospital with respiratory problems in the first 3 weeks of  August. Public health officials and resources are overwhelmed. A  pediatrician in Porto Velho said: ``Every year we have some fires and  issues with smoke, but this was the worst year of them all.''   The tragedy in Brazil is reminiscent of forests burned in Southeast  Asia to make way for palm oil plantations. Sumatra, Borneo, and parts  of Malaysia saw over 70 percent of their peat forest lost to manmade  deforestation. In Indonesia, nearly 106,000 acres burned in just the  first 5 months of this year.   I am from the Ocean State. Wildfires, of course, don't burn in the  ocean, but unprecedented heat waves are surging through our seas,  laying waste to coral reefs in much the way wildfires ravage forests.  The harm to the Amazon rainforests and to the Arctic steppes from  wildfire finds an aquatic echo in the death of the Great Barrier Reef  and reefs all over the world from climate-driven, unprecedented ocean  heat waves.   Our willful blindness to these obvious calamities playing out on  God's Earth, which are largely due to malign influence from the fossil  fuel industry and its great armada of front groups it uses to do its  dirty business, needs to stop. The willful blindness has to come to an  end. From the Equator to the Arctic, an Earth aflame will have life-or- death consequences for generations to come.   Even our news media are turning their collective backs. In late  August, as these fires raged, Media Matters chronicled that not one-- not one--of the five influential Sunday news shows covered them. They  are basically political gossip shows. Indeed, Media Matters showed  cable news devoted to wildfires in the Amazon only 7 percent of the  time they devoted to the Notre Dame Cathedral fire. In other speeches,  I pointed out how the royal baby has swamped climate coverage in our  pathetic media.   Whether in Indonesia or Brazilian rain forests or Arctic tundra, the  costs of the corporate greed and paid-for political ignorance that are  stopping us  [[Page S5497]]  from acting are on full display. Our planet suffers as a consequence.  We avert our eyes in the pursuit of cheap fossil fuel. But nothing  comes without a cost, and our debt is coming due. Pope Francis drove  home this point in a recent Sunday address, saying: ``We have caused a  climate emergency that gravely threatens nature and life itself,  including our own.''   Our world is on fire. I am sorry to quarrel with Billy Joel, but this  time, we did start the fire. If that can't get the attention of my  colleagues in Congress, I do not know what can.   We must wake up.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
