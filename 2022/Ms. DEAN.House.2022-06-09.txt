 Madam Speaker, do we not hear the cries of the fourth  grader in Uvalde who said, ``All of my friends are dead''?   Would you like to do something about gun slaughter in this country?  Then join us.   One commonsense way we can do this is by passing my friend and  colleague, Congresswoman McBath's, Federal Extreme Risk Protection  Order Act, red flag laws.   We know that in 46 percent of shootings, the attacker expressed  interest in harming others. There was a cry for help, a warning.  Someone knew that violence could erupt. Someone had the ability to  intervene. We have a responsibility to intervene.   Representative McBath's bill would do just that, intervene when  someone is a risk to themselves or others. We do not have to live this  way. Fearful for our children at school, at movies, the grocery store,  or the TLA on South Street in Philadelphia.   We do not have to live this way, and we don't want to: 79 percent of  Americans support red flag laws and 67 percent of gun owners.   Stop sentencing our children to having to lament that all of their  friends are dead.  [[Page H5425]]                                     time  1000
