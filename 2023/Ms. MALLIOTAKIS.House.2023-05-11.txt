 Mr. Speaker, my parents came to this country as  immigrants. Many of my constituents came to this country as immigrants.  I think fundamentally Republicans and Democrats agree that we are a  Nation of immigrants. Yet, what we are seeing currently at our southern  border is a travesty. It is not helpful to the migrants, it is not  helpful to our Nation, and it has certainly created so many problems  that we are facing right now.   We have seen over 5 million illegal crossings at the southern border,  another 1.3 million got-aways. CBP has seized 14,000 pounds of fentanyl  at our southern border, enough to kill over 3.1 billion people.   In 2021, more than 71,000 individuals died from synthetic opioid  overdoses, and this is roughly 200 people every day. In my city of New  York, we have seen overdoses skyrocket since Joe Biden put in place his  open border policy, 2,700 in his first year alone. That is the highest  in decades. We are seeing fatal overdoses in New York City, on average,  every 3 hours. A couple weeks ago, we saw a 16-month-old baby in my  district overdose from fentanyl, as well.   The only people that are truly benefiting from this policy are the  cartels that are making $13 billion a year from human and drug  smuggling.   We also need to be concerned about who is attempting and is entering  our country. In the first 6 months of fiscal year 2023, 80 people on  the terrorist watch list were stopped attempting to cross the southern  border on top of 98 last year. That is more than the previous 5 years  combined.   We can say that we want to support immigration, but it must be legal  immigration.   This is completely unsustainable, it is dangerous, and that is why I  stand before you to ask in a bipartisan manner that we get behind H.R.  2 and vote to pass it today and that Senator Schumer brings it for a  vote in the Senate.   In New York City, Immigration and Customs Enforcement is now saying  that they are fully booked through October 2032 because two-thirds, at  least, of the individuals crossing into our country claiming asylum do  not qualify, and they are clogging up the system for those who truly  are eligible for asylum.   We have seen 60,000-plus migrants come to New York City since last  spring. Remember, they have crossed and they entered our country not by  the proper channels but by crossing our southern border, and Joe Biden  has allowed them to do it.   Our mayor is spending billions of dollars to house these individuals  in city hotels. At the same time, he is saying we are going to cut city  services by a billion dollars every year for the next 4 years, and we  are going to cut everything from libraries to programs for our  children, fire, sanitation, parks, and homeless services. We have  homeless New Yorkers, and the mayor is saying that he has to put  citizens of other countries in shelters instead of our own. It is just  completely backward and unsustainable.   As I walked here today, I just got notice that the mayor decided to  halt this ridiculous policy. He was basing all of this, by the way, on  a right-to-shelter law under Mayor Ed Koch that was meant for homeless  New Yorkers. He has abused that, and that is what we are seeing take  place today.   We can work to address this issue. Let's protect the taxpayers. Let's  protect our Nation's security. Let's put forward the border security  plan that is before us today, and then let's also work to make sure  that we know who is entering in and out of our country through proper  visas, employer visas, family-sponsored visas. I am willing to work  with everybody on that, as well. We must stem the flow. Let's stop  putting the drug cartels before American citizens, and let's move  forward today and pass this bill.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, since House Republicans have been in  control, we have brought transparency to the people's House. We are the  ones who are protecting taxpayers. We are the ones exposing waste,  fraud, and abuse, including as high as $400 billion in COVID relief and  unemployment fraud.   Sadly, my home State of New York ranks near the top of the list, with  an estimated $11 billion in this fraudulent unemployment benefits.  These taxpayer dollars went to fraudsters, many overseas, as far as  China, Russia, and Nigeria. They even went to dead people.   They spent it on Rolex watches, fancy furnishings, and designer goods  at Louis Vuitton, Chanel, Burberry, Gucci; $10 million on a villa in  the Dominican Republic; $3.5 million on a mansion in New Jersey; a  charter jet to get the fraudster who purchased it to and from;  Porsches, Ferraris, Bentleys, BMWs, and Mercedes Benz. One person even  received $1.5 million over a span of 10 months.   Meanwhile, my district offices in Staten Island and Brooklyn had to  help dozens of constituents who had their identities stolen and could  not get the unemployment benefits they desperately needed.   New York had to take an $8 billion loan from the Federal Government,  which it has not paid back yet, by the way, to cover all of this. Now,  our small businesses are paying the price with higher  unemployment assessments.    The bottom line is, this bill would help crack down on this type of  fraud, would give law enforcement the statute of limitations it needs  for criminal charges or civil actions, incentivizes States to help us  crack down and recover these fraudulent payments, and stops  unemployment insurance payments to incarcerated and deceased people.   Mr. Speaker, I don't know how anyone can't support this bill. Thank  you.
