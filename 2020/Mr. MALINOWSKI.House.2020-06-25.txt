 Mr. Speaker, I will proudly vote for the George Floyd  Justice in Policing Act because I believe that Black lives matter,  because I believe that nobody in America should have to fear an  encounter with police simply because of the color of their skin, and  because I believe that what we need right now above all is trust, trust  between law enforcement and the people, all the people they are sworn  to protect.   Trust is not built by police who use force as a first resort, it is  not built by police who look like they are the 82nd Airborne  parachuting into a war zone, it is not built by hiding problems so  abusive officers get assigned to train rookie cops or those fired for  misconduct can get rehired somewhere else.   Trust is built from better training, transparency, and the  accountability that every true public servant welcomes.   Now, this may not be a perfect bill, but it is surely the start of a  process that will make us better. So, please, let's get this process  started.   If we also want to fund the police, if we want to support the good  cops who are out there, then please ask the Senate to support the  HEROES Act alongside police reform, the whole point of which was to  help our State and local governments keep our first responders on the  job.
