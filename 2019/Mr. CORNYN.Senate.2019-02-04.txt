 Madam President, I would like to begin by expressing my  appreciation to the Senator from Nebraska for her comments on the INF  Treaty that President Trump has withdrawn the United States from. There  wasn't much of a treaty left, really, after Russia repeatedly violated  it, and China is not even bound by it. It is very important, when we  are talking about these issues, that we understand the facts and the  state of the world as it is.   I read a recent summary by the RAND Corporation of their analysis of  Russia and China. They called Russia a rogue, not a peer, and China a  peer, not a rogue. There is a lot behind that, but I think it really is  true that the only way we are going to deter the Russians is by  maintaining our strength. The way we do that is by doing what is  necessary to protect the United States and our allies. In this case,  that means taking a treaty that has already been violated by the  Russians and no longer bounds China and building the appropriate  missiles to deter anybody from taking advantage of any perceived  weakness in the United States, insofar as it comes to protecting  ourselves or our allies.   I would like to express my appreciation for those comments and  support them.                             Honoring Donna Doss    Madam President, it is with a heavy heart that I come to the Senate  floor this morning to express my deepest condolences for the friends,  family, and colleagues of U.S. Border Patrol agent Donna Doss, who was  killed in the line of duty this last weekend.   On Saturday, February 2, Agent Doss responded to a call for  assistance from a Texas Department Public Safety trooper on Interstate  Highway 20, near Abilene, TX. While on the scene, she was struck by a  passing vehicle and died shortly thereafter of her injuries.   During her more than 15 years of dedicated service, Agent Doss has  made immeasurable contributions to public safety, both in Texas and  beyond. Her career with the Border Patrol began at the Brackettville  Station in the Del Rio Sector, where she worked to disrupt and  dismantle several of our narcotic organizations as a Drug Enforcement  Administration task force officer.   Her career then led her to Washington State, where she led the  Criminal Alien Prosecutions Unit for the Spokane Sector.   Then, in 2011, Agent Doss made her way back to Texas to serve in the  Laredo Sector, first, as supervisory Border Patrol agent and, later, as  operations officer.   Since March of 2017, she served as resident agent in Abilene, where  she was responsible for all of the enforcement operations across eight  counties.   In addition to leading a distinguished career, Agent Doss was a  loving wife, daughter, sister, and stepmother. Her loss is another  solemn reminder of the courageous sacrifices law enforcement officers  and their families make every day. We are grateful to all of those who  put their lives on the line when they put on their uniform every  morning, ready to face the unknown challenges that lie ahead. I am  particularly grateful to the men and women in green who make up our  Nation's Border Patrol, like Agent Doss.   I want to thank Agent Doss' family for her selfless service and  sacrifice, and I send my heartfelt condolences to Agent Doss' family,  friends, Acting Sector Chief Matthew Hudak, the agents of the Border  Patrol Del Rio Sector, where she honorably served, and the entire  Border Patrol family during this difficult time.                                     S. 1    Madam President, in a moment we will hold a cloture vote on the  strengthening America's Security in the Middle East Act and soon have  an opportunity to pass this legislation, which has been balled up for  some time because of the intervening shutdown. Importantly, it  reaffirms our longstanding commitment to the stability in the Middle  East. This vote has been a long time in coming. The four bills that  comprise this legislation enjoyed bipartisan support last year, but we  ran out of time before we could get them passed.   Exactly 1 month ago today, as we were kicking off this new Congress,  the majority leader announced his intent to package these four  noncontroversial bills together and bring them to the floor. Here we  are a month later, and this is how noncontroversial things get handled  in these strange times we live in. For weeks, our Democratic colleagues  have blocked us from voting on this legislation, not because they  disagreed with the contents but because they claimed no work should be  done during a governmental shutdown, even though 75 percent of the  government was up and running and funded, including the legislative  branch, of which Congress is a part.   They used this as an excuse to showboat and to not do their job. Of  course, something changed when they saw an opportunity to take a vote  on an entirely political matter involving Russia. All of a sudden, they  decided it was OK to do other things during the shutdown as long as it  had the potential to embarrass our political adversaries, including  President Trump. Nevertheless, I am glad that today we will finally be  able to vote on this bill.   In the face of the ongoing troubles in the Middle East, it is  important to reaffirm our commitment to our allies and condemn the  brutalities of our enemies. While this legislation is far from the  comprehensive solution to the challenges faced in the Middle East, it  is important to take steps in the right direction where we can.   First, this bill strengthens our relationship with Israel, the lone  democracy in the region. Israel faces near-constant attacks from Iran,  Syria, Hezbollah, Hamas, and other terrorist groups. To ensure that  Israel is poised not only to withstand but to counter threats from  these shared adversaries, this bill authorizes needed military  assistance, including things like missile defense and loan guarantees.   It also includes measures to enhance Israel's ability to address  threats in its vicinity, like drones, which are increasingly used by  Iran, which is bent on the destruction of the State of Israel. This is  a major step to ensure that the nation of Israel is poised to tackle  both the threats of today and tomorrow.   Secondly, this bill provides support to Jordan by reauthorizing  legislation to deepen our defense cooperation. Jordan has borne the  brunt of much of the upheaval in the Syrian civil war, with many  refugees calling Jordan their home temporarily because they are  displaced from their home country. Jordan continues to face grave  challenges posed by the chaos in Syria, and our assistance is  desperately needed.   As I said, Jordan has absorbed a disproportionate number of refugees  who have been escaping the Syrian civil war. Some 740,000 refugees are  currently in the relatively small country, making it the second highest  refugee host per capita in the world. The impact of the Syria crisis is  immense, and our assistance with humanitarian relief is critical.   Third, this legislation provides flexibility for State and local  governments that disagree with the Boycott, Divest, and Sanctions, or  BDS, movement. This movement is designed to isolate Israel, both  economically and politically, by encouraging governments and  businesses, including academic institutions, to cut ties with the  Jewish state.   At least 34 States, including mine--the State of Texas--have already  enacted legislation to combat BDS. This legislation doesn't require  States to take any sort of particular stance. It simply clarifies the  right to counter boycotts of Israel without fear that they are somehow  in jeopardy of Federal law.   Finally, this bill takes steps to address the ongoing crisis in Syria  at large. It holds accountable those responsible for the crisis in  Syria by imposing new sanctions on anyone who supports Syria either  financially or  [[Page S822]]  militarily, specifically targeting military aviation,  telecommunications, and energy industries. It also provides needed aid  to impacted communities and condemns the heinous human rights  violations of the Assad regime.   In addition to these four pillars of this legislation, I am glad we  have the opportunity to vote this afternoon on an amendment to affirm  that American leadership is needed in our ongoing fight in Syria and  Afghanistan. We simply cannot afford to leave a vacuum in places where  terrorists flood when they take advantage of the chaos and the upheaval  in the Syrian civil war. These are places where they can lodge, grow,  and train and then export their terrorist attacks, not only around the  region but, as we saw 9/11, even around the world.   There is no doubt that we made great progress on our fight against  ISIS and al-Qaida, but as the majority leader noted when he offered  this amendment last week that ``our response to this progress must not  be to take our foot off the gas pedal, but rather to keep up those  strategies that are working.''   One of our colleagues, the Senator from Florida, Mr. Rubio, said that  terrorism is like a tumor. It is like a cancer. You can try to  eliminate it, but if you are unsuccessful in eliminating it, even  though you have shrunk it, it will come back as soon as you remove the  pressure. Though we made incredible gains in the fight to eradicate  these terrorist groups, the threat has not been entirely eliminated,  and our job may never be finished. This is what some people have called  the ``long war.'' Sadly, it is necessary in order to keep ourselves  safe, as well as our allies.   Fully defeating these groups and the radical ideology will require  our continued commitment. We simply can't unremember the lessons of 9/ 11, which are that things that happen overseas don't stay overseas and  that when you have power vacuums or safe havens for terrorist  organizations to exploit, that endangers not only people in the region  but also us here at home. We cannot allow a resurgence of ISIS or al- Qaida and somehow let the gains we have fought so hard to make slip  through our fingers.   During a time of ongoing instability in the Middle East, it is  imperative that our allies remain confident in our commitment and our  partnership and stand ready to continue to fight for our shared  interests.   As I indicated, this bill will not solve all the problems in the  Middle East. It will not provide justice for innocent civilians killed  by the Assad regime or rebuild the communities destroyed at the hands  of terrorist groups. But it is an important step to ensure our allies  are prepared to fight alongside us and defend our shared national  security interests.   This legislation will support and protect our allies, safeguard U.S.  interests in the Middle East, and take a stand against the despicable  human rights violations committed by the Assad regime. I look forward  to supporting the majority leader's amendment this afternoon and voting  yes on this legislation when that opportunity arises.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following  [[Page S837]]  interns from the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources be  granted privileges of the floor through March 15, 2019: Grant Cummings  and Alexandra Ongman.
