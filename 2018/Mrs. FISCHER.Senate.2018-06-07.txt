 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise to continue my tribute to  Nebraska's heroes and the current generation of men and women who have  given their lives while defending our freedom in Iraq and Afghanistan.  Each of these Nebraskans has a powerful story of answering the call to  serve.                     Sergeant First Class Tricia Jameson    Today I honor the life of Nebraska Army National Guard SFC Tricia  Jameson.  [[Page S3282]]    Tricia grew up in St. Paul, which is a small town in central  Nebraska's farm country. She had a love for animals and wanted to  pursue a career as a veterinarian. Tricia usually kept to herself and  was not outspoken, but she displayed great determination when something  was important to her.   In elementary school, upon learning that she and other young girls  could not play organized softball, she started a letter-writing  campaign to change the rules. The community soon took notice and  revised the policy to include girls her age. When her friend took his  own life because he was picked on at school, Tricia again took up her  pen and wrote a letter that was published in a local newspaper, whereby  she condemned bullying and honored the life of her friend. She  advocated for what is right and how others should be treated. In  looking back, it seems obvious that her selfless spirit would, one day,  lead her to serve her country.   Tricia attended St. Paul High School, where she was a determined  athlete. She participated in volleyball and set athletic records that  still stand to this day. Her family then moved to Omaha. She spent her  senior year at Millard South High School and graduated in 1989.   Like many young people, Tricia saw the benefits of joining the  National Guard as it could provide extra income and help her with her  college tuition. She joined in 1994. It didn't take long before her  grit and determination caught the eye of her superiors. They rewarded  her with a promotion to become a full-time training instructor at Camp  Ashland.   As combat intensified in Afghanistan and Iraq, so too did the need to  improve battlefield medical knowledge. Sergeant Jameson was assigned to  improve the combat lifesaver course. The course teaches soldiers basic  medical skills for application on the battlefield. With the same dogged  determination that was evident throughout her life, Sergeant Jameson  raised the program into a world-class operation. Hundreds of soldiers  who learned from Tricia in that program would go on to save lives on  battlefields across the world.   In 2005 Nebraska's 313th Medical Company needed to replace two  soldiers. So it reached back to Nebraska for volunteers, and when her  country called for her service, Sergeant Jameson eagerly stepped  forward. She quickly got her personal affairs in order and was sent to  her deployment training. By June of 2005, she was in Iraq and on duty  with the 313th Medical Company at Camp Speicher. Her impact was felt  immediately as the camp was stretched thin to support combat operations  in northern and western Iraq.   Staff Sergeant Jameson's first mission on the road was a long one.  She was the vehicle commander of an M997 ambulance that was headed to  Trebil, near the Jordan border. Staff Sergeant Jameson and her battle  buddy, SPC Rachelle Spors, had just left with a convoy when an urgent  call came to help marines who had been injured in combat a few miles  away. Without hesitation, Tricia was speeding toward the battlefield to  attend the fallen when their field ambulance was struck by an IED. That  day, Tricia gave her life while serving her country.   The Nebraska Prairie Soldier newspaper wrote of Tricia's service:  ``Hundreds of family, friends, veterans group members, state  governmental leaders and uniformed co-workers flooded into St. Bridget  Catholic Church in Omaha, to help lay a fallen hero to rest.''   Her name and reputation live on as soldiers save lives, just as she  did, on the battlefield.   For her service to our Nation, SFC Tricia Jameson earned many  military decorations, including the Purple Heart and the Bronze Star,  posthumously.   Today I ask that we take a minute to remember Tricia and her selfless  spirit.   I wish to thank her family, her mother Pat, and her brother Rob, who  share their own heroic burden. SFC Tricia Jameson loved her family. She  embodied the pride of her State and the values of our Nation. I am  honored to tell her story.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
