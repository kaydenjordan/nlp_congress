 Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the life of one  of New Jersey's most distinguished State senators.   New Jersey State Senator Ronald Rice passed away on March 15. He  spent more than 35 years serving the people of New Jersey's 28th  District, and he was the longest serving Black legislator in our  State's history.   Senator Rice started as a Newark City Council member before he became  a State senator, but his service to our community and our country  extended beyond politics. Senator Rice was a sergeant in the Marine  Corps and a decorated Vietnam veteran. He spent 8 years as a police  detective and 4 years as Newark's deputy mayor.   As a State senator, he was known for his strong advocacy for social  justice and civil rights. His dedication to equality was known  throughout the State.   Senator Rice was an exceptional public servant, and I know his work  for Newark and the people of New Jersey will be missed.                            ____________________
