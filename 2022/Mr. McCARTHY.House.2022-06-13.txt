 Mr. Speaker, this is the third time I come to the floor  to protect our Supreme Court Justices and their families. Speaker  Pelosi said this bill would come to the floor this week, but it is not  listed on our schedule.   The Speaker also said last week in her press conference that ``no one  is in danger. . . .''   Think about that, Mr. Speaker. The Speaker of the House of  Representatives, last week, in a press conference, said no one is in  danger. This is just after a day or 2 when a man came clear across the  country from California to kill Justice Kavanaugh. He was on the  street, had a weapon. He had zip ties. He had a plan.   At the same time, the Speaker says no one is in danger. But at the  same time, the Senate already unanimously passed a bill with agreement  from all 100 Senators. That wasn't passed last week; that was last  month.   For 1 month, the majority of this House, Mr. Speaker, has held that  bill,  [[Page H5450]]  a bill that every single Senator, Republican and Democrat and  Independent, passed in the Senate. It simply states that we will  protect the Supreme Court.    Mr. Speaker, you have probably noticed, as you came on to this  Capitol, the intensity of force you see out in front of the Capitol. Is  that because something is happening here today? No. It is in  anticipation of a decision by the Supreme Court.   Everybody in the country knows that there could be a decision--not  knowing which way it would go--but the anticipation is that people need  protection in the Capitol.   At the same time that is happening, that you are protecting the  Capitol, you are holding a bill to deny protection to those Justices.   It makes me wonder why. Why? Why, if 100 Senators approve it, would  it hold here for an entire month?   Why, even after holding it for a month, somebody travels all the way  across the country with one thing in mind, to kill a Supreme Court  Justice, gets arrested, and still the Speaker of the House will not  move that bill that the majority actually holds?   Just so the country can understand, no one on this side of the aisle,  the Republican side of the aisle, objects to this bill. We agreed that  we would agree to a unanimous consent.   All somebody had to do was make the motion and that could be on the  President's desk; it could be signed; and they could be protected.   But for some reason, Mr. Speaker, the Democrats on the other side of  the aisle, even though 100 Senators had agreed with us, everyone in  your party on the Senate side said ``yes,'' you still say ``no.''   I do not understand that. I do not understand why we would risk that.  I do not understand why you will make sure the Capitol is protected  right now, knowing that something could happen in the Supreme Court  this week, but you won't protect those Justices.   Now, the Speaker came to the floor at a press conference last week  and said nobody, no one, is in danger. How can you make that statement  in the same week someone is arrested in your neighborhood trying to  kill you? It makes no sense.   Mr. Speaker, if for some reason that we continue to come to the  floor, that you feel some pressure on that bill, but you change it, the  country will know why because if you change the bill and move it back  to the Senate, you are trying to kill it. You are trying to delay it.  That is exactly what you are doing.   You can take a bill that every single Senator voted for and send it  to the President to be signed. If you think something else needs to be  added, run it by itself.   But if you want to ping-pong it and delay the process, I think that  is wrong. I think you are jeopardizing people's lives. I think you are  jeopardizing the safety of the Supreme Court. I think you are playing  more games than anybody in this country can understand, and we do not  understand why because there has been no clear answer.   Why would you hold the bill for more than a month?   Why would you hold the bill after somebody is arrested who traveled  across the country to kill a Justice? Why would you continue to hold  the bill now?   If you change it, you are showing the country what you really  believe. You don't want the bill to pass. You want to delay it longer.   There is no excuse. There is no reason to delay this bill. This  should be law, and the Justices should be protected.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to take from the Speaker's table  S. 4160, the Supreme Court Police Parity Act, and ask for immediate  consideration in the House.    Mr. Speaker, later in this day, it could. There is no  excuse why this bill continues to be held, and there will be no excuse  if you try to change it to delay it. That is just a tactic, Mr.  Speaker, and I believe you thought it would be wrong as well.                            ____________________
