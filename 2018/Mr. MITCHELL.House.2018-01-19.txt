 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the Born-Alive Abortion  Survivors Protection Act, which I proudly cosponsored.   This week, we are reminded of our Nation's most vulnerable people as  we solemnly remember the 1973 Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision.  Unfortunately, abortion has resulted in the deliberate death of too  many babies, including babies born alive. We must protect these  children.   Today, by this bill, we do protect these children who are born after  a botched abortion attempt.   The CDC reported that, during a 12-year period, over 370 babies died  after being born alive during a termination of pregnancy. The  intentional neglect of care for these lives is unconscionable.   We must respect mothers and their children by ensuring necessary  medical care is given to babies born alive after a failed abortion  attempt. How hard is that?   Any doctor denying care to these newborns must be held criminally  accountable. This legislation does that.   Madam Speaker, it is our duty to protect all lives, and I took an  oath to do just that.                                time  1015
