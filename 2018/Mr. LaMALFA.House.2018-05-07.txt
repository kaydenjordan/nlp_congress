 Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to recognize all the  teachers around the country who work so tirelessly to educate our  children.   This is Teacher Appreciation Week, and Tuesday, May 8, is National  Teacher Appreciation Day, but we should show them our appreciation each  day.  [[Page H3765]]  We trust them with our most prized assets for many hours a day: our  children. Most of us who go to work Monday through Friday entrust the  teachers with the daily caretaking, development, and, of course, the  education of our kids, and sometimes that task can take on a lot more,  even parenting, when kids come from broken homes.   A teacher's job is indeed difficult. As parents, it can be easy to  lose sight of the significance and influence teachers have on our kids'  lives on a daily basis. I know this firsthand.   My wife is a teacher; my sister is as well. I know firsthand, my  wife, the many hours spent after school, using her own dollars to help  make her classroom a better learning environment for those kids,  because it comes from the heart.    I want to thank her, my sister, and all those teachers all around the  country for giving that extra that it takes when sometimes society  falls short in its own ways.   Congratulations on Teacher Appreciation Week.                            ____________________
