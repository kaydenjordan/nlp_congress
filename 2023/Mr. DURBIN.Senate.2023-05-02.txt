Born in New York, NY, Mr. Farbiarz received his A.B. from Harvard  University in 1995. After graduation, he studied as a Fiske Scholar at  Trinity College, Cambridge University, from 1995 to 1996 before earning  his J.D. from Yale Law School in 1999. He then clerked for Judge  Michael B. Mukasey on the U.S. District Court for the Southern District  of New York from 1999 to 2000 and Judge Jose Cabranes on the U.S. Court  of Appeals for the Second Circuit from 2000 to 2001.   Mr. Farbiarz began his legal career in 2001 as an associate at a law  firm in New York City, where he worked for 3 years and tried two cases.  In 2004, he joined the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District  of New York--SDNY--as an assistant U.S. Attorney. Over the course of a  decade, Mr. Farbiarz led more than 100 investigations, tried 7 cases,  and argued 13 appeals before the Second Circuit. Within 5 years, he  rose to serve as the deputy chief of the Terrorism and National  Security Unit for 1 year and was further elevated to serve as the  cochief of the Terrorism and International Narcotics Unit for 4 years.   After leaving the SDNY, Mr. Farbiarz became a senior fellow at New  York University Law School from 2014 to 2016 and worked as an adjunct  instructor at Columbia Law School in 2014. Most recently, Mr. Farbiarz  has served as the general counsel of the Port Authority of New York and  New Jersey since 2016.   The American Bar Association has unanimously rated Mr. Farbiarz  ``well qualified'' to serve on the District of New Jersey. Senators  Menendez and Booker strongly support his nomination as well.   I will be supporting this outstanding nominee, and I urge all of my  colleagues to do the same.                            ____________________     I announce that the Senator from California (Mrs.  Feinstein) is necessarily absent.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, ``Always ready, always there.'' That is  the motto of the Illinois National Guard. And for 300 years, in times  of war and peace, it has lived up to that promise.   As the Illinois National Guard celebrates its 300th anniversary, we  thank our citizen soldiers for their service and their sacrifice.   If you want to see the selfless character of the Illinois National  Guard, just take a look around the Senate because you will spot my  colleague Senator Tammy Duckworth, former Lt. Col. Tammy Duckworth of  the Illinois Air National Guard.   Senator Duckworth almost gave her life when the Black Hawk helicopter  she was copiloting was hit by an RPG in Iraq. But it didn't diminish  her will to serve our State and our Nation, and I am lucky to have her  as my colleague.   The Illinois National Guard traces its history of service to May 9,  1723, when a local militia completed its first exercise in Kaskaskia,  IL. Back then, Illinois was still a French territory. Since then, the  citizen soldiers of the Illinois National Guard have protected our  State and Nation at home and abroad.   When the Mississippi River overflows its banks or when we are faced  with other natural disasters, it is the Guard that we call. And its  members have served with honor and distinction throughout its history.   During the American Revolution, Illinois' militia members fought  under the heroic command of Col. George Rogers Clark to oust the  British from Illinois.   Illinois' most famous member of the National Guard was a man named  Abraham Lincoln, who served during the Black Hawk war in the 1830s.   During the Mexican-American War, a young Army officer served as  assistant quartermaster in the 21st Illinois Infantry Regiment. He went  on to lead the Union forces to victory in the Civil War. His name was  Ulysses S. Grant.   Later, Illinois' 370th Infantry Regiment earned the distinction of  being the only Army unit commanded mainly by African-American officers  in World War I, and members of the Illinois Army National Guard served  bravely in World War II, the Korean war, Vietnam war, Operation Desert  Storm, Iraq, and Afghanistan.   More recently, Illinois National Guard members were activated during  the COVID-19 pandemic as the world grappled with that virus; and after  the U.S. Capitol was attacked on January 6, National Guard members were  dispatched to help restore order.   In the most challenging times, the Illinois National Guard continues  to be ``Always ready, always there.'' I am confident they will be for  many years to come.   This month, their sacrifices are remembered throughout our State; and  on behalf of a grateful State and Nation, I want to commend Maj. Gen.  Rich Neely, the adjutant general of the Illinois National Guard, and  all the men and women of the Illinois National Guard on the occasion of  this momentous anniversary.    Mr. President, today, the Senate will vote to confirm  Judge Robert Kirsch to the U.S. District Court for the District of New  Jersey.   A graduate of Emory University and Fordham University School of Law,  Judge Kirsch clerked for U.S. District Judge William J. Zloch on the  Southern District of Florida before devoting his entire legal career to  public service.   Judge Kirsch was selected for the prestigious U.S. Attorney General's  Honors Program, in which he served as a trial attorney in the civil  division.   Thereafter, Judge Kirsch spent over a decade as an Assistant U.S.  Attorney in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of New Jersey,  defending the United States in civil actions and prosecuting a range of  criminal cases including financial and corporate fraud, as well as drug  trafficking, weapons offenses, and bank robbery.   Since 2010, Judge Kirsch has had a distinguished career as a judge on  the New Jersey Superior Court, serving as a criminal division judge, a  civil division judge, and a family division judge.   The American Bar Association rated Judge Kirsch as unanimously ``well  qualified.'' In addition, he has the strong support of his home State  Senators--Mr. Menendez and Mr. Booker--as well as the New Jersey legal  community.   Judge Kirsch's significant courtroom experience, as both a longtime  litigator and on the bench, makes him well-positioned to serve on the  District of New Jersey with distinction. I urge my colleagues to  support Judge Kirsch's nomination.    I announce that the Senator from California (Mrs.  Feinstein) is necessarily absent.
