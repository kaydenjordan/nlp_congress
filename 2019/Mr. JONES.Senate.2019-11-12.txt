 Madam President, I rise today to recognize Alabama  Agricultural & Mechanical University, AAMU on their 50th anniversary as  a university. As an 1890 land-grant institution and one of Alabama's 14  historically Black colleges and universities, HBCUs, Alabama A&M has  long upheld a legacy of impressive scholarship and service. It is an  honor to celebrate the achievements of an institution of such  importance to my State.   Alabama A&M first opened its doors on May 1, 1875, as the Huntsville  Normal School following its founding by a  [[Page S6506]]  former slave, Dr. William Hooper Councill. With just $1,000 in annual  appropriations, 61 students, and 2 instructors in its first year, the  institution evolved throughout multiple iterations of its 144-year  history into what it is today. Due to its success with industrial  education and private funding from the Slater and Peabody Funds, the  Alabama Legislature authorized a name change to the ``State Normal and  Industrial School in Huntsville.'' In 1891, the school became a  recipient of the Federal land-grant fund in order to further fund  training in agricultural and mechanical arts at the college level.  Following several name changes and a location move from Huntsville to  Normal, AL, the school became a junior college in 1919 under the name  ``The State Agricultural and Mechanical Institute for Negroes.'' Twenty  years later, the school was permitted by the State board of education  to offer work at a senior college level. In 1941, the first graduation  class since 1920 received bachelor degrees. The school became a fully  accredited member of the association in 1963, following a ``Class A''  rating by the Southern Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools in  1946. Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical University received its final  name on June 26, 1969, per a resolution from the Alabama State Board of  Education.   The campus, situated on The Hill near downtown Huntsville, has  received visits from 19 Nobel laureates. Students at AAMU have access  to advanced degree programs including Ph.D. degrees in applied physics,  food science, plant and soil science, and reading and literacy. Alabama  A&M University is one of the leading producers of African Americans  with PhDs in physics.   AAMU has also graduated many notable alumni from star athletes, to  world class entertainers, to leaders and pioneers in the civil rights  movement. Jearl Miles-Clark, an Olympic Gold medalist who competed in  the 400 and 800 meter races and the 400 meter relay, graduated from  AAMU in 1989. NFL legend, John Stallworth, played football at AAMU and  was an All-Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Conference receiver in  1972 and 1973 before joining the NFL as a wide receiver for the  Pittsburgh Steelers. Stallworth went on to compete in four Super Bowls  and was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2002. American  Idol winner and popular R&B artist Ruben Studdard received a football  scholarship to attend AAMU, where he majored in music education. Joseph  Lowery, a United Methodist minister and leader in the civil rights  movement, also attended AAMU. Lowery later succeeded Martin Luther  King, Jr, as the third president of the Southern Christian Leadership  Conference. Vivian Malone Jones, one of the first two Black students to  enroll at the University of Alabama, earned her first bachelor's degree  from AAMU in business education. She later went on to receive the first  bachelor's degree awarded by the University of Alabama to a Black  student, following her study of business management. These are only a  handful of the remarkable scholars and activists, AAMU has had a hand  in educating and training.   Under the leadership of its 11th president, Dr. Andrew Hugine, Jr.,  the university comprises over 70 buildings on more than 1,000 acres, is  home to more than 6,000 students, is a designated ``Gold Military  Friendly'' institution and serves as a regional, State, national, and  international resource while maintaining its mission of educating the  underserved and uplifting the people of Alabama, the Nation, and the  world through excellence in education.   Please join me in celebrating Alabama A&M on this auspicious occasion  and wishing both their students, faculty, and administrators future  success in all of their endeavors for another 50 years.                            ____________________
