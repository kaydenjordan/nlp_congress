 Mr. Speaker, in light of the recent terror attacks  throughout the world and in our country, many people are very, very  fearful.   The Nation and the Jewish community mourn another senseless attack  after the shooting in California during the Passover celebration, while  still grieving those lost in the attack at the Pittsburgh synagogue  last year.   We stand with our Jewish brothers and sisters against the face of  terror. These despicable attacks of hate have no place in our world. We  all have a place in America. Hate, however, does not.   The American people have the right to pray together; they have the  right to love together; and they have the right to worship together  without fear.                            ____________________
