Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, despite being under the weather, I decided to come down  here to thank my colleague and the dean of our delegation,  Congresswoman Dina Titus, for leading this bipartisan effort.   This legislation would establish the Classified School Employee of  the Year RISE Award Program to recognize the achievements and  contributions of classified school employees to student education in  schools across the country.   Classified school employees are critical members of the education  workforce, making up one out of every three public school employees who  assist students in our Nation's public schools. Classified school  employees provide essential services, such as transportation,  facilities maintenance and operations, food service, safety, and  healthcare.   It is past time that the U.S. Department of Education recognize the  tireless efforts of our Nation's outstanding classified school  employees. The stature of the Secretary of Education in recognizing the  RISE Award will provide national leadership and partnership to  encourage broad participation in the development, selection, and  recognition process.   Classified school employees across the country do extraordinary and  inspirational things in their schools and communities to promote  quality education, foster positive learning environments, and ensure  student success. The RISE Award will recognize the contributions of  classified school employees to student success.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes,'' and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman  from Nevada (Ms. Titus), the lead sponsor of H.R. 276.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   In closing, I would like to thank Representative Titus for her  leadership in bringing forth this bipartisan piece of legislation.   When it comes to delivering the promise of a great public school for  every child, it is a team effort. Classified employees keep the lights  on, students fed, and learning environments safe and welcoming.   This past year, we have seen unprecedented activism from teachers and  school staff demanding better support for public schools across the  country. While the media often speaks first about the contributions and  working conditions for classroom teachers, it is important to recognize  that behind every teacher is an army of classified school employees.   Passing this bill to recognize the contributions of classified school  employees is an important first step, but I urge this body to do more.  We must come together and continue to work across the aisle to invest  in public education. We must invest in the staff who support our public  schools and in students who count on public schools to reach their  academic potential.   Mr. Speaker, I hope that swift passage of H.R. 276 is just the  beginning, and I look forward to future action in this Chamber in  support of public schools. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes,'' and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
