 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support the Strengthening  Career and Technical Education Act.   I devoted 35 years to workforce education so I know the career and  economic opportunities possible through technical education. The Bureau  of Labor Statistics reports that there are 90 distinct career paths in  my home state--Michigan--offering an average salary of $50 thousand or  more that do not require a 4 year college degree. That salary is well  above the state median annual wage of $45 thousand.   Yet we lack effective technical training opportunities to reach those  paths. Too often young people are unaware of those opportunities and  far too often access to career and technical education is lacking. CTE  programs give students the opportunities to experience those careers  and build skills needed for careers.   This bipartisan legislation updates federal law to support CTE  programs and to improve access. I urge all of my colleagues to support  this legislation.
