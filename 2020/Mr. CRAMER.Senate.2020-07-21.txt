 Madam President, I thank Chairman Inhofe for his  leadership and eloquence. I rise today in defense of the heroes on the  thin blue line and in opposition to amendment No. 2252 to the National  Defense Authorization Act, which Chairman Inhofe just spoke to.   Over the past few months, America has watched as we have seen a rise  in civil unrest turn into violence in cities all across our country.  Anarchists and domestic terrorists have exploited the peaceful protests  of millions of well-intentioned Americans in order to inflict chaos and  instill fear in our communities. Standing on the frontlines as a shield  from absolute anarchy are our local law enforcement officers who, by  and large, have applied the appropriate force required to protect  American families as well as First Amendment rights.   Unfortunately, some have made the political calculation that they  would benefit more from chaos than from peace. They believe defunding  and abolishing police departments and restricting their access to  protective gear are politically better than an honest look at what our  justice system really needs to succeed.   The 1033 Program has been utilized for years to provide State and  local law enforcement with valuable tools already purchased by the  Federal Government to promote public safety. It would be the epitome of  waste to gut this program and let these valuable tools rust in a pile  or a closet someplace.   As the chairman stated, the police and sheriffs associations oppose  amendment No. 2252, and for good reason. Patrick Yoes of the Fraternal  Order of Police says:         It is important for Senators to understand that equipment       received through the 1033 program is demilitarized and       repurposed for public safety use. Simply because a piece of       equipment was originally purchased with our tax dollars by       the Department of Defense does not make it military       equipment. A tool is defined by its use. The equipment is       used to defend and protect officers and civilians from       threats and to carry out law enforcement and public safety       objectives.    It is stunning to me that some of my colleagues are more appalled at  where law enforcement gets some of their tools and equipment than they  are at the violence that our police officers have to endure every day.  The amendment offered today would bury law enforcement, especially  those from poor communities, in unnecessary bureaucracy, effectively  preventing them from procuring the equipment needed to keep our  communities and citizens safe. This unworkable messaging ploy is born  out of Democrats' belief that vilifying the police will somehow help  them win the election in November.   Thankfully, there is an alternative, amendment No. 2411, offered by  the chairman from Oklahoma. It is a thoughtful, commonsense approach  with a focus on trained prevention and deescalation. It puts the right  equipment in the right hands and places commonsense restrictions on  what transfers can occur, all while saving the taxpayers' money.   I urge my colleagues to support amendment No. 2411 and call on the  Members of this body to reject any attempts to prevent these brave men  and women from doing their jobs to safely secure our communities.   I yield back.
