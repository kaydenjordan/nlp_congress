 Madam Speaker, November is Native American Heritage  Month, and I would like to share with you a story, one unknown to most  Americans, but one that Virgin Islanders learn at a young age. It is  the Caribbean story of Europe's drive for conquest and the resistance  of the Native Americans of the Virgin Islands, the Tainos and the  Caribs.   In 1493, Columbus and his men landed on Ayay, known now as Saint  Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands. There they met a group of Taino  people who had been taken captive by the Caribs. While en route back to  their ship with these captives, Columbus' men encountered the fierce  Carib villagers, and the first recorded violent conflict between  Europeans and Native Americans of the Western Hemisphere ensued,  killing one of Columbus' men.   Men and women fought with bows and canoes against gunpowder on ships.  It is our story of Native pride of resistance, of remembering what is  yours.   However, the Taino and Carib peoples have left us with so much more.  When you use such words as barbecue, guava, canoe, hurricane, potato,  maze, savannah, you are connecting with indigenous people who centuries  ago journeyed from South America to settle in the archipelago that has  given, and continues to give, much to this country and the world.                            ____________________
