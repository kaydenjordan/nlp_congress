 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the devastation in Texas and Louisiana from Hurricane  Harvey warrants swift congressional action. I am pleased we are here  today to ensure that FEMA can continue to support the States affected  by this disaster.   The $7.4 billion for FEMA and $450 million for the Small Business  Administration in H. Res. 502 are only a first step in a long process  that will require a long-term Federal presence.   I represent areas, Mr. Speaker, affected by Superstorm Sandy and  understand, firsthand, the need for Federal intervention when storms  overwhelm State and local capacity. Following Sandy, the last  administration requested and Congress approved funding for resiliency  to ensure that future generations can mitigate the damage from storms  that have grown in intensity.   We can argue about the effects of climate change on storms, but we  must all agree that our communities must receive much-needed mitigation  funding to protect lives and livelihoods in future storms and to  prevent more costly damage.   Despite the fact that some of the Representatives for areas affected  by Hurricane Harvey heavily criticized and voted against the assistance  provided in the wake of Superstorm Sandy, I wholeheartedly support the  funding in this resolution and expect a much larger request from the  administration, including funding to mitigate damage from future  storms.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Cuellar), a member of the Appropriations  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gene Green).    Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), who we know was struggling  with her fellow Texans and trying to be as helpful as she could during  this horrible, horrible disaster.                                time  1045     Mr. Speaker, before I yield to our next speaker, I would  just thank Mr. Culberson. I just want to thank you, Mr. Culberson,  because, of course, we are all totally supportive of this aid package,  but I remember that you were the only Member from the majority in Texas  who supported our Sandy package. I just wanted to, at this time, thank  you again for your generosity and your warm heart for every American.    I yield to the gentleman from Texas.    Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Al Green).    Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Roybal-Allard), a very distinguished  ranking member from the Homeland Security Subcommittee on the  Appropriations Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  the Virgin Islands (Ms. Plaskett), who understands the impact of a  disaster of this kind not only in her district, but in other areas  where there has been so much suffering.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Crowley), the chairman of the Democratic Caucus.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Engel).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), who has been right there helping, reaching out  to all of those families who are in desperate need.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1115     Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 8 minutes.   Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to this bill, which would  turn back the clock on American excellence, following President Trump's  lead on divesting from education, health, foreign assistance, science,  and infrastructure.   The process for this bill has been outrageous, and this debate,  frankly, is an utter waste of time. Just hours ago, Congressional  leadership and the President agreed to pass a package including  Hurricane Harvey assistance as well as a debt limit extension and a  continuing resolution to keep government running until December 15. We  should be working to pass that measure now so that we can work toward a  bipartisan budget agreement instead of wasting days on a bill that  undercuts economic growth and priorities on which families rely, and is  so hyperpartisan it will never earn the Democratic support needed to be  enacted.   Breaking from longstanding tradition that enables Members to advance  amendments in an open process, the Rules Committee required amendments  be submitted 12 days ago during the District work period and reported a  restrictive, structured rule for relatively few of them so far.   The majority denied consideration of many amendments that would  address timely, high-profile challenges, some of which cut to the core  of our democracy, and would have been allowed under an open rule. In  one of the most egregious examples, the majority blocked an amendment  to provide safeguards to ensure the integrity of government reports on  violent domestic extremism, the likes of which erupted in  Charlottesville in recent weeks, resulting in the death of a young  woman exercising her right to freedom of speech.   Not only were amendments to address the President's revocation of  DACA deemed out of order, in an affront to the Appropriations Committee  and to this institution, the majority removed a bipartisan amendment  passed in committee that would have allowed DREAMers to work for the  Federal Government.   My friends, we have a responsibility to pass the DREAM Act now. It is  absurd that, after years of receiving bipartisan majority support,  Republican leadership has refused to allow a vote.   The Rules Committee should make in order amendments to protect the  integrity of our elections and the independence of the special  counsel's Russia investigation.   This bill also fails on the merits. The nondefense bills are below  sequestration levels set in law, slashing funding for teacher training,  apprenticeship grants to help young adults train for good jobs, law  enforcement grants that help keep our communities safe, environmental  protections that ensure we drink clean water, breathe clean air,  highway and transit grants that improve the quality of life for our  constituents, and a number of scientific and research programs that are  important for global competitiveness.   This bill is littered with riders with deep-rooted opposition, like  cutting funding for Planned Parenthood. If the majority is serious  about governing, loading must-pass spending bills with these policy  riders is a surefire way to fail.   Turning to the State and Foreign Operations division of the bill, I  want to thank Steve Marchese, Erin Kolodjeski, and Matt Washington with  the subcommittee; Liz Leibowitz and Dean Fischer from my office; Craig  Higgins, Susan Adams, Clelia Alvarado, David Bortnick, Winnie Chang,  Lacy Kilraine, Megan O'Donnell, and Alex Pinson with the majority.   Diplomacy and development efforts are critical to protecting our  country's national security and building stronger and more stable  communities around the world. That is why cuts in this division are so  deeply troubling.   As demonstrated through both the President's unworkable request and  the subcommittee's unsustainable allocation, the majority does not  fully embrace the vital role diplomatic and development activities add  to our national security and economic interests abroad.   On the positive side, the bill sustains our bipartisan and unwavering  support for our close ally and partner Israel, as well as Jordan. And I  do appreciate Chairman Rogers protecting resources for basic education,  water, sanitation, democracy, and some vital women's programs, which  provide communities the foundations for inclusive economic growth and  poverty reduction.   While he rejected the most extreme proposals in the President's  budget, the allocation is insufficient to respond to global challenges.  We must reverse dangerous and shortsighted cuts for programs such as  multilateral cooperation, international family planning, and climate  change, as well as the expansion of the Global Gag Rule to all global  health programs, and the prohibition on U.S. contributions to UNFPA.   The Rules Committee should have made in order amendments I submitted  to strike the expansion of the Global Gag Rule and the ban on funding  for the United Nations Population Fund, and to restore essential  funding for international development and diplomacy.   Despite the administration's professed hope that other nations will  fill the gaps created by cuts in this bill, we are at risk of that void  being filled by those who oppose our values and interests, leaving the  world far different from what we want for our children and  grandchildren.   It is time for the majority to set aside its most extreme proposals,  including the border wall and interior immigration enforcement, and  work with Democrats to write bipartisan legislation that could actually  be enacted.   Mr. Chairman, I urge a ``no'' vote, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Serrano), the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Commerce,  Justice, Science, and Related Agencies.
