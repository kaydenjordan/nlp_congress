 Mr. President, I voted in support of S. Amdt. 1788,  which would reduce defense spending by 10 percent and invest that money  into healthcare, education, and poverty reduction in communities with a  poverty rate of 25 percent or more. To govern is to choose, and as we  face unprecedented challenges at home, this defense budget is out of  step with the values, priorities, and needs of the American people.   The unchecked growth in the defense budget is unsustainable, and the  Trump administration has exacerbated these challenges. We have a duty  to ensure the readiness of our forces, and I have supported efforts to  rebuild our Armed Forces after years of costly overseas engagements.  But massive spending increases without clear strategic direction do not  make us safer. We need to be thoughtful about our spending choices,  recognizing that every dollar spent on defense is a dollar not spent on  healthcare, education, workforce training, and other critical areas of  need.   The National Defense Authorization Act as it is currently written  would spend $740.5 billion on defense. This represents 53 percent of  total Federal discretionary spending and exceeds the defense budgets of  the next 11 nations combined, including our allies in Australia, South  Korea, Germany, Japan, France, and the United Kingdom. It is more than  twice the combined defense expenditures of China and Russia. Topline  defense spending has risen by more than $100 billion since President  Trump took office; after the $74 billion cut proposed in this  amendment, defense spending would still be above the fiscal year 2017  level.   Some of my colleagues have expressed unease about the across-the- board nature of these cuts, and I agree that a targeted approach is  preferable. But I have seen the consequences of delaying difficult  decisions and believe we can no longer wait to have difficult  conversations about our defense budget. In addition, the National  Defense Authorization Act is not an appropriations bill, and this  amendment simply reduces the total amount of money authorized to be  spent on defense in the upcoming fiscal year. The Appropriations  Committee, on which I serve, will still have the task of making  thoughtful, targeted reductions in areas of lower priority, while  preserving funding for high-priority items. I encourage my colleagues  to confront these challenges for the good of our country and make  adjustments as needed during conference negotiations with the House  while remaining under the cap set by this amendment.   I am glad that this amendment protects salaries and healthcare from  cuts, and would have preferred that it go further in making targeted  cuts in order  [[Page S4415]]  to reduce the impact elsewhere in the defense budget. In particular, we  should have taken this opportunity to scale back our country's  trillion-dollar nuclear modernization efforts. Modernizing our nuclear  weapons in a manner that makes them easier to use in more scenarios  while abrogating our treaty responsibilities and doing nothing to bring  Russia back to the nuclear negotiating table is a recipe for disaster.   However, my concerns with the particulars of this amendment do not  change the plain fact that our national defense budget has grown out of  control. In the midst of the worst economic downturn since the Great  Depression, a pandemic that has taken the lives of more than 143,000 of  our fellow Americans and shows no signs of slowing down, and the  impending crises of homelessness and joblessness that we face if the  Congress fails to provide relief, we simply cannot afford to continue  this level of overinvestment in defense at the expense of other  critical national priorities. For that reason, I supported this  amendment.                            ____________________
