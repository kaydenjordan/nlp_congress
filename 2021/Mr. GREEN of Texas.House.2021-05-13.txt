 Mr. Speaker, as a practitioner, I rise.   Having practiced law, I saw firsthand how predatory debt collection  works. I know of the threats to get persons demoted. I know of the  threats to cause people to lose their jobs. I know of the many threats  to cause people to go to jail if they didn't pay a debt.   This is unlawful. It ought not happen, but it does. We know that  there is no debtors' prison in this country, but people still threaten  people with going to jail if they don't pay debts.   Yes, servicemembers ought to be protected. I stand for them. But I  also stand with the hardworking Americans who, through no fault of  their own, will sometimes find themselves owing debts.   This must pass. I support H.R. 2547.
