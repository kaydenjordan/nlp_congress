 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the Great  American Outdoors Act.   My friend, Senator Daines, deserves a lot of credit. He has  successfully advanced this historic legislation, historic because of  its long-term dedication to our public lands.   People from around the world come to tour our outstanding National  Parks, including millions of visitors every year to Yellowstone and  Glacier. Unfortunately, too many of our parks have fallen into  disrepair. This bill begins to rebuild and repair our parks.   It is also a fitting complement to our successful efforts to  permanently reauthorize the Land and Water Conservation Fund. It  provides dedicated funding to increase public access to public lands  across Montana.   I know how important LWCF is to Montana, and I will continue working  to keep public lands in public hands and increase access.   I urge my colleagues to join me today in voting for the Great  American Outdoors Act.                            ____________________
