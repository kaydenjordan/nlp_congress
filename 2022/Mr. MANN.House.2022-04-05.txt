 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to deliver the next installment  of my farm bill impact series--the state of agriculture.   We are at the end of the first quarter. National Agriculture Month  just ended, and as Congress prepares to authorize the farm bill, we  should examine the state of agriculture.   Agriculture is not just a business; it is a rich heritage and a  lifestyle. Sadly, the distance from farm to fork has never been  greater, and there are fewer legislators who have experience on the  farm. Since Congress will reauthorize the farm bill in 2023, I am  standing here today to remind Congress that for this legislation to be  effective in ensuring the food security, and, therefore, the national  security, of our Nation, we need to get in the field and consider the  perspectives of farmers, ranchers, and agriculture producers.   Last month, House Agriculture Committee Republican leader G.T.  Thompson and I did just that on a tour of my district. We went to  farms; we toured facilities; we ate at dinner tables; and we listened.  We did it because hearing from producers is crucial to legislating well  on matters that concern their livelihoods. Today, I will report to  Congress on what they have been telling me about the economic, human,  and natural resources surrounding their work, and what Kansas producers  believe to be the state of agriculture.   A farmer or rancher's economic health depends on things like cash and  assets on hand, protections against the government taxing the farm at  transfer or death, and well-crafted farm bill programs like crop  insurance.   You don't have to look far to know that producers are facing the  highest input prices in 40 years. Fertilizer is four to five times  higher than it was at this time last year, if you can even get it.  Equipment is back-ordered for 6 to 8 months. Parts are at least double  the cost. On our trip, Republican leader Thompson and I hosted a  roundtable with Kansas commodity groups, and all of them told me that  if we cannot get input prices and inflation under control, today's farm  and tomorrow's crop will be in a much worse condition at this time next  year.   The day-to-day trials of operating a successful farm, ranch, or  agribusiness are challenging enough without worrying about these  skyrocketing prices. Now, President Biden's budget proposal threatens  the stepped-up basis and imposes capital gains taxes on farms or  ranches that have been held in the family for 90 years or more. This  new farm-killer tax would inflict hundreds of thousands of dollars in  new capital gains taxes on hardworking Americans and jeopardize family- owned businesses.   The one saving grace for most farmers is that the 2018 farm bill  protected  [[Page H4159]]  and strengthened their opportunity to utilize crop insurance programs,  even when conditions are dire. Largely, farmers want to keep crop  insurance in place in the 2023 farm bill. One Kansas farmer even told  us that Congress needs to ``use a scalpel, not a sledgehammer, as we  refine crop insurance.''   Agriculture's human resources include labor on the farm and employees  at the local Farm Service Agency office. On the farm, folks are hurting  for workers. We visited one of the first feed yards in the State, and  the family owners haven't seen a labor shortage with looming  retirements this bad since before the feed yard's inception in 1951.  Another co-op owner told us their workforce is down 10 percent with  more than 70 open positions.   At the local USDA offices, where Kansans go if they need help from  the government, staff is also short. Traditionally, there has been a  fully staffed USDA office in every county in America, but President  Biden's policies have kept employees at home and turned those offices  mostly all virtual. I met with farmers who are at a complete loss  trying to navigate convoluted government websites instead of talking  face-to-face with USDA employees.   There is a workforce shortage in every industry, and agriculture is  no exception. From the farm to government services for the farm,  agriculture has been experiencing record employee turnover due to  unnecessary vaccine mandates, enhanced unemployment benefits, and more.   And in terms of natural resources, we all know America's farmers and  ranchers are the original conservationists. America has vast amounts of  natural resources available to its stewards. The biggest threat to  agriculture's natural resources isn't availability or the weather, but  Federal Government overreach.   Late last year, President Biden withdrew the Navigable Waters  Protection Rule, which sought to undo the harm caused by the Waters of  the United States rule from 2015, through which the Federal Government  aimed to control nearly all bodies of water, regardless of their size  or connection to larger waterways. Because of this mess, farmers and  ranchers have had to conduct their business under three different  definitions of what amounts to ``water'' in just 6 years.    President Biden has also halted drilling on Federal lands and halted  construction on the Keystone XL pipeline, exacerbating the price and  shortage of American-made fuel. On our trip, Republican leader Thompson  and I saw a live oil well operated by a company that produced 60,000  barrels of oil last October from 363 active wells, and right next door,  we saw an ethanol plant ready to supply America with dependable liquid  fuel if President Biden would just ditch his unrealistic and ill-timed  electric vehicle push. You can't plow with a Prius.   While I recognize things like protections against the harmful Waters  of the U.S. rulings and oil and gas drilling do not live within the  confines of the next farm bill, I also recognize that the protections  and proper use of America's resources are vital to the strength of  American food and agriculture.   The state of agriculture is strong because of the strength of  American farmers, ranchers, and agriculture producers. Congress has the  responsibility to get them the resources they need to protect the  resources they have to feed, fuel, and clothe the world. We must do our  job.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the memory of Bob  Foote, a tremendous Kansan who passed away on March 25.   Bob was a man of many talents. He built one of the largest cattle  operations in America, feeding 550,000 head a year and employing 400.   He and his was wife, Gail, also built an amazing family who will  carry on his legacy and lead Foote Cattle Company into the future.   Bob had tenacity, grit, and confidence. He wasn't afraid to embrace  an aggressive approach to business. His motto was ``Get It,'' which he  would say to remind those around him to never give up and keep pushing  forward.   Bob was a staunch conservative who would often be found giving one of  his trademark Bob Foote lectures on politics. He was a true patriot.  Most importantly, now that he has gone into Heaven, he was a man of  great faith.   From the farm and headquarters in eastern Kansas to ranchland in the  Flint Hills and feed yards in western Kansas, I am hard-pressed to  think of any ag producer who had such an impact on Kansas agriculture.   Whether he was buying cattle or sharing his faith and work ethic with  his grandchildren, Bob believed that he should use the talents that God  gave  [[Page H4186]]  him to be the best man that he could possibly be.   He is now able to reunite with his beloved Colleen and, together,  watch over his legacy, the Foote Cattle Company, and gaze proudly on  his beloved Gail and his sons, Scott, Brad, and Greg, as they continue  to lead the industry and Kansas agriculture forward.   Bob Foote, may you rest in peace.                            ____________________
