 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous materials on the topic of my Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, it is a great honor for me to come to the  House floor tonight to commemorate National Bible Week. This is an  opportunity to celebrate the tremendous influence of the Bible on the  freedoms we enjoy today in America.   We are truly blessed to live in a nation where we are free to worship  and read the Holy Scriptures without fear of persecution. There are  many places throughout the world where such freedoms do not exist.   Americans have the right under our wonderful system of government to  respect and study the Bible or any other system of belief that they so  choose or even none at all. That is the beauty of the American way, and  I believe it goes all the way back to the Bible.   In 1941, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt declared the week of  Thanksgiving to be National Bible Week. The National Bible Association  and the U.S. Conference of Bishops have designated the specific days of  November 18 to 24 as National Bible Week this year. This is the week  set aside to recognize the Bible as a foundational building block of  Western civilization, the Judeo-Christian heritage, and the legacy that  motivated and shaped the founding of the United States.   In this hour, we will hear from Members of Congress from all  throughout the United States from various faith traditions and  denominations speak about what the Bible means to them. We are here, in  keeping with tradition, to recognize National Bible Week.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Washington (Mrs.  Rodgers), who is a good friend and colleague.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her words of  wisdom, her personal experience, and for being here tonight.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Babin).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas for  sharing his heart with us tonight.   Throughout American history, many of our great leaders have turned to  the Bible for guidance, faith, and hope.   President Abraham Lincoln once said of the Bible: ``I have but to  say, it is the best gift God has given to man. All the good the Savior  gave to the world was communicated through this book. But for it we  could not know right from wrong. All things most desirable for man's  welfare, here and hereafter, are to be found portrayed in it.''   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.  Thompson), as we go across the country and hear from folks all over  this great country of ours.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania for  his words, and I thank him for reminding us about the Pilgrim  tradition, especially as we enter this week of Thanksgiving.   It is interesting, in American history, we have two different strains  of life going on in this country: We had people starting in Jamestown  looking for gold, looking to make money, putting up with slavery; but  we had people in Massachusetts who wanted to just have religious  freedom, and they had a whole different view of the world and of God  and the Bible. They were the start of the abolitionist movement. So I  am glad that Mr. Thompson brought us the Pilgrim tradition tonight.   Ronald Reagan, when he designated National Bible Week, said, when he  was in office: ``When I took the oath of office, I requested the Bible  be opened to II Chronicles 7:14.''   Cathy McMorris Rodgers mentioned this earlier. It reads: ``If my  people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray,  and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear  from Heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land.''   This passage expresses my personal hopes for the future of this  Nation and the world.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Estes).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Kansas, in the  Nation's heartland, for sharing his thoughts with us tonight. I am  going to share my own story.   When I was a freshman at the University of Kansas--also there in  America's heartland--in the 1970s, someone approached me and asked me  if I knew what the Bible was about. I said: Yeah, sure I know what is  in it.''   But do you know what? I said that without ever having read any of it  for myself. Kind of presumptuous on my part.   Mr. Speaker, I wonder if there are any people listening in here to us  today who are in the same position. Maybe they think they know what it  is about, but they have never looked at it for themselves.   The only honest thing I could do at that point was to read for  myself. So I read the Gospel of John, and as I read it, I discovered  that I didn't know what was in there at all. It was totally different  than what I had expected.   And I found a man in there who said: ``I am the way, the truth, and  the life. No one comes to the Father but through me.'' So I ended up  discovering for myself a relationship with Jesus Christ, who became my  Lord and Savior.   Mr. Speaker, that is what I know from personal experience. It is  better to read the Bible for oneself and not just take someone else's  word for it. For me, it made all the difference in the world. My life  has been totally different as a result.   As David said in Psalms: ``The unfolding of your words gives light;  it gives understanding to the simple''--Psalm 119:130.   So, as we celebrate National Bible Week, we remember the importance  of faith in both our private and our public lives. We recognize the  Bible's powerful message of hope. We cherish the wisdom of the Bible,  and we thank God for providing this holy book that has truly been, in  the words of Scripture, a lamp unto our feet and a light unto our path.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. King), another  person from the heartland of America.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman. Many of the early  American settlers, we reference them many times. They came to the New  World with the express purpose of following the Bible according to the  convictions of their own consciences.   One of the first acts of Congress during the tumultuous beginning of  our Nation was the authorization of an American published Bible. The  war with the British had cut off any supply of Bibles from England.   Our Founding Fathers understood how important it was for the American  people to have Bibles. Robert Aitken, a private citizen, brought this  need to the attention of Congress. In his letter, he wrote: ``This work  is an object worthy the attention of the Congress of the United States  of America, who will not neglect spiritual security, while they are  virtuously contending for temporal blessings.''   So in 1782, Congress reviewed, approved, and authorized the first  known English language Bible to be printed in America. They passed a  congressional resolution. I am not sure how many votes this would get  if we brought this today. I know I would support it.   ``Resolved: That the United States in Congress assembled, highly  approve the pious and laudable undertaking of Mr. Aitken, as  subservient to the interest of religion, as well as an instance of the  progress of the arts in this country, and being satisfied from the  above report of his care and accuracy in the execution of the work,  they recommend this edition of the Bible to the inhabitants of the  United States, and hereby authorize him to publish this recommendation  in the manner he shall think proper.''   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Arrington).    Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Arrington for his  heartfelt comments and for being here tonight and sharing with us.   One reason many people respect the Bible is that so many prophecies  for telling future events have come true exactly as foretold. It is one  of the reasons I look at whenever I ask myself: Is the Bible really  true? Is it just a collection of stories and legends, or is it rooted  in history and fact?   So when I look at the prophesies of the Bible, that gives me the  answer. In the Old Testament, there are many predictions that were  given to prove that the speaker who claimed to be divinely inspired  really was or not. If, and when, those predictions or prophesies came  true, it validated the words of that speaker.   In the Book of Daniel, for instance, there are scores of detailed  prophesies that were literally fulfilled. So skeptics who want to  criticize the Bible have fallen back on the position that Daniel must  have been written of after the facts about which they talk about.   But, the Book of Daniel is found in its entirety in the Greek  Septuagint and partially in the Dead Sea Scrolls, which were discovered  in later years and now we know predated the events that were talked  about in the Book of Daniel. So Daniel gave prophesies that came true  in history.   So the critics of the dating of the Book of Daniel are the ones who  are not being honest. The rise and fall of empires, the capture and  destruction of cities, the destiny of kings, all of these are  prophesied about in minute detail, and history has literally confirmed  hundreds of such prophesies as having come true.   So that is one of the reasons I believe in the Bible and know it to  be true, and not just a nice collection of stories.   I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Allen).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia for his  words and for being here tonight.   We have been on the Pacific Coast. Now we are with Georgia on the  Atlantic Coast. We have been hearing from Texas, people from Texas down  at our Mexican border, and we are about to hear from someone from  Wisconsin, our border with Canada in the north of our country. And as  Mr. Grothman comes forward, I want to just say a word about  archaeology.   It is a historical fact that there are archaeological discoveries  that have validated accounts in the Bible, which gives trustworthiness  to the Bible that we acknowledge during this National Bible Week.   Time and time again, archaeology has shown that Biblical  personalities, locations, and events actually existed in time and  space. They weren't just made-up stories.   Claims by critics that a Bible statement was simply made up have been  debunked by later archaeological discoveries more times than we can  say. The Jewish archaeologist Nelson Glueck has said: ``It may be  stated categorically that no archaeological discovery has ever  controverted or controverted a Biblical reference.''   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Grothman).    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Grothman for his words tonight,  and I appreciate him being here.   Listen to what President Harry Truman said during his address at the  Attorney General's Conference on Law Enforcement Problems: ``The  fundamental basis of this Nation's law was given to Moses on the Mount.  The fundamental basis of our Bill of Rights comes from the teachings  which we get from Exodus and St. Matthew, from Isaiah and St. Paul. I  don't think we emphasize that enough these days.''   He continued: ``If we don't have the proper fundamental moral  background, we will finally wind up with a totalitarian government  which does not believe in rights for anybody except the state.''   Now, we have been hearing from people from the Atlantic to the  Pacific, from the Canadian to the Mexican border. Mr. Speaker, I yield  to the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. Hartzler), my friend and  colleague from the Nation's heartland.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Missouri for  her passionate and powerful words.   Our last speaker now before we conclude our hour is from the great  State of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Gohmert).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas for his  words, and I thank him and all the others who have spoken here tonight  from all over this great country of ours for their heartfelt comments.   It has been an honor and a pleasure for me to commemorate National  Bible Week this evening. I am grateful to my colleagues who joined me  to honor, respect, and commemorate the Word of God.   Mr. Speaker, the prophet Isaiah, thousands of years ago in this book  right here, the Bible, in Isaiah 40:8 says: ``The grass withers, the  flower fades, but the word of our God stands forever.'' Those are  powerful and true words.   Civilizations have risen and fallen, generations have come and gone,  yet here today, on November 20, 2019, we are still celebrating the  enduring Word of God given to us starting thousands of years ago.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
