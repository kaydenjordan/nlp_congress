 Madam Speaker, I rise today to highlight that September is  [[Page H7892]]  National Suicide Prevention Month. This is not an easy subject to talk  about, especially since each person's circumstances differ. Yet, as the  number 10 cause of death in the U.S., it is vital that people  understand the issues concerning suicide and mental health so that  anyone can help a person in crisis.   That is the focus of the advocacy message surrounding National  Suicide Prevention Month this year, which is ``Be the one to.'' Be the  one to, because we can all follow the five action steps to make an  impact on someone's life:   Be the one to ask.   Be the one to keep them safe.   Be the one to be there.   Be the one to help them connect.   Be the one to follow up.   The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline website also provides tips  to better identify potential warning signs before applying these five  steps, as well as other resources.   For those in crisis, know that you are not alone and help is  available. The lifeline is run 24/7 and can be reached at 1-800-273- 8255.                            ____________________
