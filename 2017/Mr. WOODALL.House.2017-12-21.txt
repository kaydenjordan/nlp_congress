 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 670 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 670         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to take from the Speaker's table the bill (H.R.       1370) to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to require       the Secretary of Homeland Security to issue Department of       Homeland Security-wide guidance and develop training programs       as part of the Department of Homeland Security Blue Campaign,       and for other purposes, with the Senate amendment thereto,       and to consider in the House, without intervention of any       point of order, a motion offered by the chair of the       Committee on Appropriations or his designee that the House       concur in the Senate amendment with an amendment consisting       of the text of Rules Committee Print 115-52. The Senate       amendment and the motion shall be considered as read. The       motion shall be debatable for one hour equally divided and       controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the       Committee on Appropriations. The previous question shall be       considered as ordered on the motion to its adoption without       intervening motion.        Sec. 2.  Upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in       order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 4667) making       further supplemental appropriations for the fiscal year       ending September 30, 2018, for disaster assistance for       Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria, and calendar year 2017       wildfires, and for other purposes. All points of order       against consideration of the bill are waived. The amendments       printed in the report of the Committee on Rules accompanying       this resolution shall be considered as adopted. The bill, as       amended, shall be considered as read. All points of order       against provisions in the bill, as amended, are waived.       Clause 2(e) of rule XXI shall not apply during consideration       of the bill. The previous question shall be considered as       ordered on the bill, as amended, and on any further amendment       thereto, to final passage without intervening motion except:       (1) one hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the       chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on       Appropriations; and (2) one motion to recommit with or       without instructions.        Sec. 3.  On any legislative day of the first session of the       One Hundred Fifteenth Congress after December 21, 2017--         (a) the Journal of the proceedings of the previous day       shall be considered as approved; and        (b) the Chair may at any time declare the House adjourned       to meet at a date and time, within the limits of clause 4,       section 5, article I of the Constitution, to be announced by       the Chair in declaring the adjournment.        Sec. 4.  On any legislative day of the second session of       the One Hundred Fifteenth Congress before January 8, 2018--         (a) the Speaker may dispense with organizational and       legislative business;        (b) the Journal of the proceedings of the previous day       shall be considered as approved if applicable; and        (c) the Chair may at any time declare the House adjourned       to meet at a date and time, within the limits of clause 4,       section 5, article I of the Constitution, to be announced by       the Chair in declaring the adjournment.        Sec. 5.  The Speaker may appoint Members to perform the       duties of the Chair for the duration of the periods addressed       by sections 3 and 4 of this resolution as though under clause       8(a) of rule I.        Sec. 6.  Each day during the periods addressed by sections       3 and 4 of this resolution shall not constitute a calendar       day for purposes of section 7 of the War Powers Resolution       (50 U.S.C. 1546).        Sec. 7.  Each day during the periods addressed by sections       3 and 4 of this resolution shall not constitute a legislative       day for purposes of clause 7 of rule XIII.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to my friend from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern),  pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, most of what you just heard from the  Reading Clerk you could have heard during the previous 4 hours of  testimony that we have been taking in the Rules Committee this morning.  I understand there was no other game in town going on this morning, so  if folks were tuning in to C-SPAN, they were treated to my friend from  Massachusetts, our ranking member from New York, our chairman from  Texas, and all the gang there on the Rules Committee as we worked  through this.   But forbid the thought if someone else had something else on their  mind this morning, I want to go through just briefly what you heard  from our Reading Clerk.   This is a single rule that provides for consideration of two  measures. The first is the Senate amendment to H.R. 1370. It is  continuing appropriations to make sure the lights stay on and the  checks go out the door. It makes in order a motion to concur in the  Senate amendment with an amendment consisting of the text of this  continuing resolution.   To debate that, Mr. Speaker, we provide an hour of debate divided  between the chair and the ranking member of the Appropriations  Committee. I think every Member of this Chamber understands the nature  of this legislation, but we provided that time nonetheless.   The second measure is H.R. 4667. It is the disaster aid package.   Mr. Speaker, as you know, this House has been working through, in a  bipartisan way, funding our neighbors who have been so dramatically  affected by disasters, whether in the Virgin Islands, in Puerto Rico,  in Florida, in Texas, or the devastating wildfires in California. This  has been a national focus, and billions of dollars have already gone  out the door to meet the initial emergency needs. This is an additional  appropriations measure.                                time  1230    It comes under a closed rule, Mr. Speaker, but it does self-execute  two amendments that had been offered: an amendment by Mrs. Mimi Walters  and an amendment by Miss Gonzalez-Colon.   It also provides for an hour of debate, equally divided between the  chair and ranking member of the Appropriations Committee, and it  provides for a motion to recommit for the minority.   The rest of what you heard from the Reading Clerk, Mr. Speaker, was  that typical language that you hear at the end of the year when Members  are going to be traveling, to allow for the housekeeping that takes  place here, to allow the House to continue to function as the  traditional authorities provided in December and January during the  district work period.   With that, Mr. Speaker, again, I think we have exhaustively debated  these issues. I urge my colleagues to support the rule. Let's get on to  the underlying measures.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this time of year folks get rightfully exorcised about  the issues of the day.   We all came here to do something for the men and women whom we  represent back home. Every time we get to the end of a year, we think:  I have got to get it done; I have got to get it done; I have got to get  it done. I recognize those passions are going to exist.   I actually don't believe for a minute that my friend from  Massachusetts believes my vote in favor of the tax bill had anything to  do with fundraising or my donors. He might believe that about somebody  in this Chamber--I hope that he does not--but I know he doesn't believe  it about me. It just isn't true.   I have been fighting for tax reform since the day I was elected. In  fact, I ran for this job to fight for tax reform. We do the American  people a disservice when we suggest something nefarious is going on.  Sometimes we just disagree, Mr. Speaker, and those disagreements are  okay. In fact, those disagreements are expected. Our Founders intended  them, and they created this institution to sort those disagreements  out. So I hope we won't sell either ourselves or the American people  short in that regard.    But I do want to agree with my friend that this is frustrating. It is  frustrating to be here for a continuing resolution, Mr. Speaker.  Remember that we passed the National Security and Defense  Appropriations bill in July of this year. We have waited patiently for  the Senate to be able to take it up, and it has not.   We passed all of the appropriations bills, Mr. Speaker, before the  end of the fiscal year, back in September, and we have been waiting for  the Senate to take those up. It has not. It is an incredibly  frustrating time.   Now, my friend suggested a solution would be bipartisanship. I could  not agree with him more. It takes 60 votes to move something through  the Senate. I just barely have over 50 Republicans. The only way these  funding bills are going to move through the Senate is with bipartisan  support. For anyone in this Chamber to deny that is going to be to deny  the reality of math. Bipartisanship is the solution.   I remember, Mr. Speaker, when my President invited the Democratic  leadership down to the White House to work on exactly this issue a  month ago. Folks got frustrated with the tweet he sent out that morning  and decided they were going to stay home.   I understand the frustrations. What I don't understand is missing out  on an opportunity to build this bridge. It happens above my pay grade,  I am going to confess. To the 700,000 people I represent back home, Mr.  Speaker, let me go ahead and confess this deal is taking place way  above my pay grade.   But it is probably right there at the pay grade of the President of  the United States, the Speaker of the House, and the minority leader.  When folks don't show up to the table for the conversation, it makes it  harder to get there.   Is there always a good reason to stay home?   I am sure there is.   Are there more good reasons to be there?   I think the answer is: Yes.   Mr. Speaker, I will advise my friend from Massachusetts that I don't  have any speakers remaining this morning. Folks have been exhaustibly  elucidated by the 4 hours of discussion we had this morning, and I am  prepared to close when he is.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1245     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, here, in these cold days outside, it is easy to create a  lot of rhetorical heat on the inside. I would argue that legislative  light is what we need more often than not.   We brought the Children's Health Insurance Program bill to the floor  that my friend from Texas just referenced, Mr. Speaker. We didn't just  bring it to the floor; we brought it through committee. We brought it  through committee, and we passed it. We brought it to the House floor,  and we passed it. We sent it to the Senate, and there it sits.   But when it passed the House floor, my friend from Texas voted  ``no.'' He voted ``no.''   Now, do I believe for a moment that is because he hates children? I  do not.   Do I believe for a moment that it is because he doesn't want folks to  have access to healthcare? I do not. I believe he had legitimate policy  reasons for deciding not to reauthorize the program then that he has  just taken to the floor and talked about the merits of reauthorizing.   It is okay to disagree on those issues, and it is even okay to  highlight those differences. What is not okay is to describe this  Chamber as a Chamber that doesn't care. What is not okay is to describe  this as a Chamber that doesn't act.   My friend was absolutely right: it is a bipartisan priority to fund  the Children's Health Insurance Program, and we did. The Senate has not  acted. It hasn't gotten the full reauthorization done. If we pass the  continuing resolution today, that funding will continue.   Let's disagree on those things that we disagree about, but let's be  honest with ourselves about the legitimacy of those disagreements.  Let's try to find more light than heat in this new year.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   My friend from Florida is a good accountability partner up on the  Rules Committee. I have learned from his intellect, and I have learned  from his experience in this Chamber. I value that, and I value his  friendship.   When he says that more closed rules have been passed in this Congress  than any other, he is absolutely right. He is absolutely right. And  that is worth talking about, as my friend does regularly in the  committee.   Unfortunately, we usually just have that half of the conversation.  What we don't talk about is that many of those closed rules were for  bills that were so well worked out in a bipartisan way in committee  that there were no amendments offered, that we had already come  together in such a collaborative, productive, admirable way that we  ought to be bragging about instead of denigrating that we didn't have  amendments that were offered.   Other bills, Mr. Speaker, were bills that might not have been so  generally agreed upon. But when my friend the chairman of the Rules  Committee sends the call out to all 435 Members of Congress and says:  If you have any ideas, bring them to the Rules Committee. For many of  those bills, Mr. Speaker, there wasn't one idea suggested, not one idea  suggested to change the underlying bill.                                time  1300    So did it come under a closed process?   Well, of course, it did, if closed means we ask everybody for all of  their ideas and no one had one, so there was no idea to debate on the  floor.   Mr. Speaker, there are so many ways that we can do better with one  another, but I would suggest to my friends that the way to do better  with one another is to build that on a foundation of trust, not a  foundation of recriminations.   We have an opportunity in this new year, Mr. Speaker, to turn a page  in this institution. I want to say, in my time on the Rules Committee,  Mr. Speaker, I have never had a chairman who worked as hard to open the  process and hear from Members as the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Sessions), the current chairman.   Time and time again, where other folks would have walked away from  the table, the chairman has stayed there to get input, to hear ideas.  Time and time again, when the process would have been truncated, he has  extended it to make sure folks had a chance to have their voice heard.   I am grateful for that, Mr. Speaker. I am grateful to the chairman  for that model that he sets in that committee.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Sessions) to speak on this rule.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, we talk a lot about what isn't in the bill today, and we  could actually talk a lot longer about what isn't in the bill. It is a  fairly narrowly focused bill, but what is in there, in addition to  funding to keep the government operating, is funding for our community  health centers that we all care so much about; is funding for the  Children's Health Insurance Program--that is a bipartisan issue across  this Chamber--is funding for the Special Diabetes Program. Mr. Speaker,  that is so important to so many families. I can go on and on and on.   Are there things that are not in this bill?   Of course there are, and I look forward to coming back with my  colleagues to address each and every one of those, but there is so much  good that is in this bill, Mr. Speaker. If we conclude this debate to  pass this rule, we can get on and make those things a reality.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, you likely did, as I did yesterday, get a wonderful  Christmas card from our friend from California, which I very much  appreciated. She was there with her beautiful family. I appreciate the  sincerity of her words today.   I will just remind this Chamber that we are having that conversation  for  [[Page H10356]]  one reason and one reason only. That is because, when Democrats had the  White House, the U.S. House, and the U.S. Senate, but--much like  Republicans today--didn't have 60 votes to get around the filibuster,  instead of President Obama and the Democratic leaders in the House and  the Senate trying to find a bipartisan pathway forward that could get  60 votes, they chose to craft an administrative solution, one that I  thought was illegal, one that I thought was unconstitutional, but chose  to go it alone.   Mr. Speaker, that is not a blame statement. It is an explanation of  some systemic challenges that exist in this place.   I can assure my colleagues, and I am happy to have someone disabuse  me of the notion, but I have yet to see the issue that we have solved  by blaming each other more for it. I have yet to see that pathway to  success.   The pathway I have seen is when folks turn the cameras off, when they  roll up their sleeves, when they decide they don't much care who gets  the credit for a solution, they just want to solve it.   I will put another one on my colleagues' plate, because, again, I  don't doubt their sincerity. Raju is one of my constituents. He is here  on an H1-B visa. His wife, Manju, is here on an H-4 visa. He came to  this country legally 11 years ago. Every few years, he has to renew his  visa, which costs thousands of dollars. When his visa expires, when his  driver's license expires, he has to go back and do it. He is not  complaining. That is what the law of the land said. When he agreed to  come here, he agreed to follow the law of the land. He can't start his  own business. He can't change employers. He is a captive of the visa  program that he came in on. There is no pathway, Mr. Speaker, for Raju  and Manju to get the same benefits that my colleagues are arguing so  passionately for for 800,000 additional people.   Mr. Speaker, the human stories don't begin and end with the DACA  program. Again, a problem that President Obama created; not solved, but  created.   I can go line by line by line of folks who are facing similar  challenges, and I question where the justice is when I can name  constituent after constituent after constituent who has done everything  right, who has paid every dime the government has asked, who has  applied for every piece of paperwork that the government has asked, who  has stood in every line that the government has asked, and there is no  pathway forward for them.   Let's not pretend that there is not common ground that we can come  together on. Let's confess that perhaps we haven't spent enough time  trying to do it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I would advise the gentleman from  Massachusetts that I have no further speakers and I am prepared to  close when he is.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I would advise the gentleman that it  appears I have committed all of my time.                                time  1330     Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   There has been a lot of productivity this week. There has been a lot  of work that has gone on this week. I am looking around up there at the  dais with you, Mr. Speaker. I see a lot of unshaven faces. I'm not just  taking about Josef. I am talking about folks who intended to shave and  might not have made it home last night to get that done.   It takes an incredible amount of staff time to do this. So what Mr.  McGovern and I do up in the Rules Committee, our staffs have been there  past midnight time and time again this week and then back in at dawn.   I wish that more of the American people, Mr. Speaker, could see the  hardworking, dedicated staff, the team that goes into making all of  this possible, because I think it would make them proud. I think, in a  season like this, it would lift them up and make them feel better about  who we are as a people and the things that we could accomplish  together.   One of those young people, Mr. Speaker, is Nate Blake on the Rules  Committee. He is sitting right here behind me. He is leaving us after 5  years of service. I want to put that into perspective, Mr. Speaker.    There is not a staff member up here that can't leave today and get  better hours and more money going anywhere else in town. You will work  on Capitol Hill for one reason and one reason only, and that is that  you believe, if only you work hard enough and long enough, you would  make America just a little bit better.   Mr. Blake is one of those believers. We will miss him on the  committee. It is a great honor for me that his very last rule is to be  one of mine, and I thank him for his service.   Mr. Speaker, they often say everything's been said but not everyone  has said it. We don't need to go down that path today. This House has  done its job. It has done its job in a collaborative way. It has done  its job in a way that the American people can be proud of.   If we pass this rule, we will not only fund the government, send  money to the troops, send money to community health centers, send money  to education, send money to courts, send money to the environment; we  will not only take care of those funding responsibilities; we will also  provide those dollars needed for those men and women spread out from  Florida to Texas to California to Puerto Rico to the Virgin Islands.  There is a real human being behind each and every one of these dollars  that will go out the door today.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues, vote ``yes'' on this rule so  we can get to that underlying legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
