 Madam Speaker, last week, I joined several of my  Republican colleagues on an official trip to view the southern border  in Arizona.   We received an operational briefing from the Border Patrol stationed  in Yuma and toured their processing center. We also went on field tours  to see the halted construction of the border wall and a staging site  used by cartels for smuggling children across the border.   I was horrified by what I saw. When President Biden halted  construction of the border wall, he left giant strips of the border  wide open for cartels to smuggle illegal drugs and even human  trafficking victims into our country, women and children being abused  in ways that are unimaginable.   I was appalled to learn how the cartel recycles the child victims so  that they are basically the conduit to bring adults across. Then, when  they are done with that child inside this country, they take them back  and recycle them again through the process.   They prey on families by telling them what they think they owe to the  cartel and use their children in such a way. The filth, the trash left  behind, the containers of drugs and pills you find there in the  arroyos, in the washes, it is horrific all the way around. We must  control our border.
