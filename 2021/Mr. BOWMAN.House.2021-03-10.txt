 Mr. Speaker, I have had the privilege of working in  public education for 20 years. I started my career in 1999. That was  the same year of the Columbine High School shooting. Throughout my  career, unfortunately, we have had to continually deal with school  shootings.   In our schools we have to prepare children as young as 4 years old  for the possibility of a school shooting. We have Columbine, we have  Parkland, we have Virginia Tech, and we have Sandy Hook.   I thought 9 years ago when Sandy Hood occurred that the country would  stop, pause, and reflect on what is happening in our Nation. It was a  mass shooting of our 6-year-old children--our babies. This law will  begin the process of protecting our most vulnerable and protecting our  babies.    Mr. Speaker, I am proud to rise today to discuss the  introduction of our Care for All Agenda.   Just as our physical infrastructure is crumbling, we suffer from lack  of care infrastructure. In America today, millions of people cannot get  care for themselves or their loved ones. We are failing children, older  adults, people with disabilities, and all Americans.   And we don't care for the people who take care of us. Millions of  care and domestic workers, disproportionately women of color, are  exploited and paid poverty wages.   With bold, holistic public investments in the care economy, we can  heal these wounds. We can substantially raise wages and benefits for  workers. We can create millions of new zero-carbon care jobs. And we  can create universal programs to guarantee care to all people. These  investments are a crucial part of the Green New Deal. We cannot have a  truly just, sustainable America without a healthy foundation of care.   The Care for All Agenda, introduced with 30 of my colleagues, and  with the support of over 90 movement partners, lays out how centering  care can be the rebirth of our Nation.   Join us in building a care community and society based on care for  people, communities and the planet we all share.  [[Page H1315]]                                ____________________
