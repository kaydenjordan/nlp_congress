 Mr. Speaker, it is my highest privilege to serve with  Chairman Roe and Ranking Member Walz on the VA Committee, and I am  grateful for the honor to serve as chairman of the Subcommittee on  Economic Opportunity.   I want to thank Chairman Roe for his leadership on an issue that I  believe gets at the root cause of many of the problems, maybe most of  the problems that plague the Department of Veterans Affairs: the lack  of accountability. Where you don't have a culture of accountability in  an organization, you have mediocrity; and mediocrity and excellence in  service do not and cannot coexist.   We are talking about serving our veterans, the men and women who are  willing to sacrifice everything for our freedom and security. These  folks gave their best to our country, and they deserve the very best  from our country.   Having almost half a million delinquent disability claims is not our  very best; having veterans wait in line for months to see a physician,  not our best; having hundreds of billions of dollars in improper  payments is not our best; waiting 6 months to a year to terminate  somebody for misconduct and poor performance is definitely not our  best.   People all over this country, hardworking Americans, get up every  day; they work hard; they perform; they deliver results; and if they  don't, they lose their job. If they are small-business owners, they go  out of business. We ought to have no less expectation for our Federal  Government and its employees, especially those who serve our veterans.   The VA Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act gives the  Secretary the tools he needs to hold his employees accountable for  serving our veterans and to change the culture from one that accepts  mediocrity to one that expects excellence.   I applaud Chairman Roe and Ranking Member Walz for helping our  country take a big step towards delivering on our promises to our  veterans.
