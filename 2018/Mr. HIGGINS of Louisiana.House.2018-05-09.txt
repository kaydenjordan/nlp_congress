 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of  H.R. 2152, the Citizens Right to Know Act.   As a cosponsor of this bill, and a law enforcement for over a decade,  I believe this bill is common sense and a needed piece of legislation.   May I share respectfully with my colleagues on both sides of the  aisle who may be in doubt of this bill, if you are in support of  pretrial diversion programs, then you should support this bill.    The existence of pretrial diversion courts is manifested in our  Nation due to a righteous need for proper adjudication at all levels of  the economic strata and all portions of our culture and society.   But the pretrial diversion program comes after arrest. Arrest is made  by the police officer investigating the incident. Innocence is presumed  until adjudicated guilty or otherwise, and within 48 hours of arrest,  probable cause has to be presented in the form of an affidavit to a  magistrate court, and that judge will determine if that American has  been righteously incarcerated, his freedom taken from him, our most  precious right as Americans.   We stand in the body which gave birth to the concept of a man and a  woman's right to be free, and I support that.   The diversion programs across America, however, through their rather  brief history within our judicial system, have failed to provide  sufficient data to the jurisdictional authorities that gave birth to  them, and that data has not been shared at the Federal level which  supports them financially through the harvesting of treasure from the  American people that we serve.   I respectfully submit to my colleague that I am a compassionate  American man that believes in innocence until proven guilty, and I  would like for diversion court programs to continue and grow across our  country to better serve the needs of we the people, to recognize the  fact that all of us, in some way, are failed and fallen, and we should,  of course, with compassion, move forward through the judicial system.   The pretrial diversion programs that exist across our country depend  upon a cornerstone of confidence among the jurisdictional authorities  that they operate within and the Federal Government that funds them,  that they are operating within parameters that are accepted across the  country as abiding by laws local, State, and Federal.                                time  1500    To not share data that is readily available by these courts with the  Federal Government that funds them is an angle that could be used to  defeat these courts that we support. So the compilation of data  righteously collected and disseminated is something that we should  support if we further support these very court systems.   So this legislation before us today would give Federal and State law  enforcement agencies vital data on criminal offenders, repeat or  otherwise, who  [[Page H3862]]  are placed within the diversion court systems. This information is  crucial to both promoting public safety and giving policymakers better  insight into the effectiveness of pretrial programs, which I support.   I would like to thank Congressman Poe for his leadership on this  issue, and I urge my colleagues very respectfully, on both sides of the  aisle, to support this legislation.
