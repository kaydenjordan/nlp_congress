 Mr. President, it was just 1 year ago that President  Trump was sworn into office, promising the American people he would  break through the gridlock to get results for workers and families;  that he would work with Democrats and Republicans; that he would be  this great dealmaker--``the best,'' he said.   This past year has proven quite the opposite, and nothing has made  that clearer than what we have seen these past few days. This has been  a year of chaos and dysfunction, of bullying and attacks, of hatred and  division and controversy and crises. That is just what we have been  seeing on the President's Twitter feed before breakfast.   On the heels of so much utter dysfunction and disarray coming from  this Republican government, it is fitting, even while deeply  disappointing, that President Trump's first year has ended with him  pushing our country into a completely unnecessary government shutdown.  There is no reason--absolutely no reason at all--why we should be in  this position. Democrats have spent months--months--trying to get the  President and Republican leaders to work with us. We have spent months  pushing Republicans to work with us to pass a long-term extension of  the Children's Health Insurance Program that gives millions of kids  access to care. We have spent months pushing Republicans to work with  us to pass funding for community health center programs so many of our  patients and families depend on. We have spent months pushing  Republicans to work with us to pass disaster relief for our families  and communities who have been hit so hard. We have spent months pushing  [[Page S410]]  Republicans to work with us to support our veterans and to combat  opioid and substance abuse. We have spent months pushing Republicans to  work with us to increase investments in education and healthcare and  other domestic and defense priorities.   We have spent months, and really years, pushing Republicans to work  with us to protect the hundreds of thousands of Dreamers across our  country--young men and women who have known no home but America, who  have spent their entire lives reciting our Pledge of Allegiance, who  think of our great country as their great country, who now, through no  fault of their own, are facing a prospect of being torn from their  homes, from their families and their friends, and deported to a country  many of them can't even remember.   Months and months have been spent trying to get Republicans to work  with us. Months and months we have been urging Republicans to join us  at the table. Months and months we have been trying to solve problems  with solutions that had bipartisan support. Democrats and Republicans  were on the same page on all of these issues. For months and months,  President Trump and the Republican leaders have refused. They have sat  in their partisan corner. They have ignored the Democrats and  Republicans who wanted results. They have pushed us to the precipice  and then right into this completely unnecessary shutdown.   I know this has been discussed on the Senate floor at length today,  but it bears repeating. This shutdown is a choice made by Republicans-- the party that controls the Senate, the House, and the White House. It  is a choice made through their inaction, months and months of refusing  to work with us, and it is a choice made through their actions trying  to jam through a partisan bill at the last minute they knew couldn't  pass, blocking our last-minute efforts to keep the government open for  a few days while we negotiate an actual deal, moving the goalpost in  the last-minute negotiations between President Trump and the Democratic  leader from New York, and now spending their time trying to point  fingers and place blame instead of facing up to their responsibilities  as the governing party.   I know President Trump said this year that our country ``needs a good  shutdown.'' I hope he remembers what he said in 2013 because back then  President Trump said:         Problems start from the top and they have to get solved       from the top--and the President's the leader. And he's got to       get everybody in a room and he's got to lead.    He went on to say:         When they talk about the government shutdown, they're going       to be talking about the President of the United States, who       the President was at that time.    And that in a government shutdown, ``I really think the pressure is  on the President.''   I don't say this often, but President Trump was absolutely right in  2013 about the Trump shutdown of 2018. President Trump is not the only  one in the White House, but it is Republicans who run the Senate and  they run the House, all of them. The onus is on them to get this done,  and they have a Democratic Party that is ready to work with them to get  this done right.   Before I close, I do want to make one final point, very much  connected. This weekend is not just 1 year since President Trump's  inauguration; it is also the anniversary of the women's march, when  millions and millions of people across the country stood up to make it  clear, wearing those bright pink hats, that they weren't going to just  sit by and watch. I was at that incredible women's march in DC a year  ago, and I remember thinking to myself, this is what a democracy looks  like--people getting involved, getting engaged, speaking up, speaking  out, fighting back, and standing strong. For those women and men at the  marches this weekend and for the millions and millions more who are  looking at what is happening in our country and feel so strongly that  this just isn't right, Democrats agree, and we have your back.   I am going to keep fighting as hard as I can. I am going to keep  making it clear, I stand ready to work with anyone from any party who  is willing to stand with me to restore respect and get results. I  believe there are enough Members on both sides of the aisle who are  more focused on reaching out hands than pointing fingers, and we can  get this done. We can reopen our government. We can address the many  challenges facing the people we represent, and we can get back to doing  the work the people we represent sent us here to do.   Before I close, I do want to mention one thing. A number of my  colleagues have been working hard to make sure our military and their  families are protected no matter what. We have a bill--the Pay Our  Military Act--that would do exactly that. My friend, the Senator from  Missouri, has been working so hard to get this done. I know my friend  the junior Senator from Illinois has as well. So many of us believe  this is the right thing to do right now, at a time when there is  uncertainty. Unfortunately, the Republican leader has blocked our  efforts so far. I just want to say I am really hopeful he reverses  course and allows us to get this done. It is the right thing to do, and  it is the least we can do for the men and women who sign up to serve  our country and protect all of us.    I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
