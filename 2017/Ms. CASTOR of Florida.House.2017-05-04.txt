 Mr. Speaker, this bill will be devastating to  families all across America. The Republican bill rips coverage away  from millions of Americans. The last projection was 24 million. They  didn't wait for the new  [[Page H4143]]  projection, which is going to be much higher.   The Republican bill hurts Medicare, and it shortens the life of the  Medicare trust fund just when we have more baby boomers retiring and  calling on Medicare. It imposes a huge age tax because it makes  affordable insurance much less affordable if you are about age 50 or  older.   A dirty little secret here that most people have not discussed is the  harm it does to the Medicaid guarantee. For over 50 years in America,  we have said that if you are disabled, if you have a family member with  Alzheimer's, or if you have a child with a complex medical condition,  you are not going to be destitute because your health care is so  expensive. That is one of the fundamental guarantees of Medicaid for 50  years. They take that away and go to the heart of the medical care that  is provided under Medicaid as well. It is shameful.   But it got worse. As we approach this day, they didn't have the  votes, so they made it worse by going to the heart of the Affordable  Care Act which ended discrimination against our neighbors with a  preexisting condition.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.    They also said essential health benefits are  not going to matter. What good is an insurance policy if you buy it and  you can't go to the emergency room? We have got to vote ``no'' on this  bill.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.    We have got to fight back against this crass  power play that transfers all the wealth in this country. Vote ``no.''   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman is no longer under  recognition.   The Chair would ask Members to respect the gavel and the time  yielded.
