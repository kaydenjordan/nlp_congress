 Mr. President, the COVID-19 pandemic has revealed just  how important the Federal Government can be in helping workers,  families, and businesses during a time of crisis. Congress has passed  trillions of dollars in urgent relief, and we have relied on Federal  Agencies to implement that aid quickly, reliably, competently.   So, while it might not normally be as high profile as other Cabinet- level Agencies, the Small Business Administration has recently been in  the spotlight. Over the last 12 months, the Small Business  Administration has overseen two pandemic-related programs that will  dole out more than $1 trillion to our Nation's small businesses,  nonprofits, and religious institutions. Moving forward, it will play a  prominent role in implementing the American Rescue Plan.   Today, the Senate will vote on President Biden's nominee to take on  that important job: Ms. Isabella Guzman.   Ms. Guzman could not be more ready. She comes from a family of small  business owners herself. Her dad ran his own veterinary clinic. Not  only is Ms. Guzman a veteran of the Small Business Administration, in  serving as the Deputy Chief of Staff in the Obama administration, she  has just finished a stint as a top official at California's Office of  Business and Economic Development, helping support the fifth largest  economy in the world.   For many Americans, opening and operating a business of their own is  part of the American dream. I have every confidence that, under Ms.  Guzman's leadership, the SBA will help small business owners hold onto  their dreams until our economy comes roaring back                       American Rescue Plan Act of 2021    Mr. President, this morning, I also want to continue the theme of  highlighting aspects of the American Rescue Plan that have not received  enough attention.   We have heard a lot about the progress we have made on vaccines. I  read, this morning, that 109 million Americans have received at least  one vaccination, so we are well on the path to getting Americans  vaccinated, and checks have gone out the door. I was on a call with  people from central Brooklyn--Bed-Stuy and Brownsville--last night, and  many had already received their checks. It was very much needed. It was  very much welcomed.   As President Biden announced yesterday, on the vaccines, we have had  100 million shots in people's arms and 100 million checks in people's  pockets. Let's say that again. That sounds good to me--100 million  shots in people's arms and 100 million checks in people's pockets. The  Democrats are delivering what we promised.   Now, we have heard a lot about how the American Rescue Plan will help  Americans who need it the most. The 20 percent of Americans at the  lowest levels of income will receive the highest levels of support. It  is about time. We had the mirror image of that when our Republican  colleagues ran the Senate, where the top 1 percent did the best and the  bottom 20 percent was totally ignored. That is backward. God bless the  people who are in the top 1 percent, but they don't need the help. It  is the people struggling to feed their families, pay the rent, and help  the kids in school who need the help. We are doing it for the first  time in a while. Experts predict that child poverty could be cut in  half. Meanwhile,  [[Page S1532]]  the top 1 percent of Americans will see an income boost of zero  percent. As I said, God bless them, but they are doing fine already.  They are doing fine already.   And we have heard a lot about how the American Rescue Plan will prime  the American economy to come roaring back. Economists are already  projecting that economic growth could double as a result of the  American Rescue Plan. When over 75-85, I think it is--percent of  Americans get some checks, the money goes out. It starts revitalizing  our economy. People shop in the stores, eat at the restaurants, even  begin to travel and see their relatives, maybe, for the first time if  people are vaccinated.   Wow, this is great news. This is great news. I think that America is  turning the corner, and I think the attitude of Americans is turning  the corner as well. People now see a brighter future for this country  and their regions.   Today, though, as I said, there is so much in this bill that, every  day, I want to focus on something else that may not be focused upon.  Since the Senate is set to vote on the confirmation of the new SBA  Administrator, today is a good opportunity to expand on just how the  American Rescue Plan will help our Nation's 30 million small  businesses.   We all know that small businesses have been some of the hardest hit  entities by the pandemic. Early in the crisis, 80 percent of small  businesses--four out of five--reported having to close their doors at  one point. Just the other day, I heard of a local New York business  owner who was forced to close up shop after surviving most of the  pandemic. You could hear the pain in his voice. He poured his entire  soul into this business. I know. This hits home for me.   My dad was a small business man. He struggled. He had a little  exterminating business all through my growing years--from the day I was  born until the day I left the house. My brother, sister, and I still  have vivid memories of Dad's pacing the floor on Sunday nights at 2  a.m. because he hated going to work on Monday morning--so many  challenges, so much thrown at him, and not much he could do about it.  He was wondering how he would actually provide for his family. Praise  God, he retired at around 70. He is now 97. He has been a happy man for  these last 27 years. God is good, as the Presiding Officer knows better  than most of us, but he struggled.   So, when I hear about the anguish of small business people, I will  never forget. I would work there sometimes--weekends, summers. He sent  me out to collect checks from a landlord who had had three or four  smaller buildings, and my dad's company had done the exterminating. The  guy hadn't paid for 6 months. I traveled, and it took me about an hour  to an hour and a half on two buses to get to this man's door. I  knocked. He opened the door.   I said, you know: I am Chuck Schumer, the son of Abe Schumer of  Century Exterminating. You owe us 6 months. We have been doing a good  job of exterminating your house.   Do you know what he said to me?   Your dad is a small business man. He can't afford a lawyer. He can't  afford anything to go after me. I am not paying.   This is the anguish that small business people face, so we need to  help them. We need to help them.   That is one of the many reasons I am so proud of the American Rescue  Plan--because it provides tens of billions of dollars in support for  small businesses that have suffered during the pandemic. The American  Rescue Plan is nothing short of a lifeline for Main Street businesses  from one end of this country to the other: Main Street businesses in  rural America, Main Street businesses in suburban America, and Main  Street businesses in urban America and in our inner cities. It is a  lifeline.   For starters, the American Rescue Plan provides $30 billion for  restaurants and bars through the RESTAURANTS Act--the first bipartisan  amendment added to the bill--sponsored by Senators Sinema and Wicker.   The American Rescue Plan also includes more than $1 billion in  additional support for our Nation's small theaters and venues, adding  to a grant program I helped create in December called the Save our  Stages Act. These independent art venues, restaurants, and places like  that--churches--are the hardest hit because that is where people  gather. When they are not gathering, there is no income whether it be  the money they pay the small business, the checks they pay at the  restaurants or the money they leave on the collection plates, when they  are not there, in our religious institutions. So this is a good thing.   I want to say one more thing about Save our Stages. It not only  includes more money for Save our Stages; it includes an amendment I  authored to allow venue owners to apply for aid through Save our Stages  without losing eligibility for traditional small business grants  through the PPP. So that is a change that our arts institutions and our  independent venues and theaters should know--that they could get both  the PPP and Save our Stages.   Now, these venues, the small businesses of many types, the  nonprofits, they are the lifeblood of our communities. They were the  first to close; they will be the last to open.   I am hopeful that the support we passed in the American Rescue Plan  will help our small businesses, our theaters, our music venues, and our  restaurants to hold on until we can all gather safely once again.   That is not all. The American Rescue Plan provides $15 billion in  flexible, targeted grants to help small businesses that have had a hard  time accessing relief over the last 12 months, including most  nonprofits and churches. Up to 90 percent of minority-owned small  businesses will qualify for this funding, closing the racial gap and  keeping local economies from deteriorating further.   We invest $10 billion in State, local, and Tribal small business  financing programs.   We expand the employee retention tax credit so that businesses of any  size can more easily keep their workers on the payroll because that one  doesn't have an employee number limit.   Finally, we bolstered and expanded the popular Paycheck Protection  Program to include more nonprofits, including labor and agricultural  organizations that unfortunately, in December, our Republican  colleagues wouldn't let in.   In a nutshell, the American Rescue Plan provides a colossal boost for  our Nation's small businesses and will make sure that all of them, not  just those with the right connections, can access relief. It will help  millions of Americans keep their jobs, retain their incomes, and  support their families during this recovery.   Now, we know many of these businesses are not out of the woods yet.  There is still some time until our country can fully open up, until  families eat inside their favorite restaurant or colleagues can meet at  a bar for happy hour, until we can see one of our favorite performers  put on a concert. But we are already seeing signs of hope.   As a Washington Post headline announced recently, ``Companies are  scaling back layoffs because of [the American Rescue Plan].'' Let me  say that again, proudly and happily. ``Companies are scaling back  layoffs because of [the American Rescue Plan],'' and the Senate, I  assure the American people, is going to keep working to make sure that  the support for our businesses remains intact over the next few months.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
