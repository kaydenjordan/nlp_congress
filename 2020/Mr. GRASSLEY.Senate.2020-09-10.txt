 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1  minute in morning business.    Today, the Senate will vote on moving forward with  relief for Americans. That relief is necessary because of COVID-19.   The bill contains new funds for testing and contact tracing, aid for  schools and colleges to keep our kids safe, and it also includes  childcare assistance. It has more money for developing the coronavirus  vaccine and treatments, funding for the Postal Service, and help for  farmers. It allows for small businesses to access more Paycheck  Protection Program funds with more flexibility and provides for  enhanced unemployment benefits.   Now, surely these are items we can all agree on and ought to agree on  right now. We know how to work together to produce results for  Americans. We saw that in March when we successfully passed the CARES  Act. That is a good model to follow now.   Back in March, Republicans in the Senate proposed a framework, then  worked across party lines through the relevant committees to produce a  consensus product that received overwhelming support in the Senate. I  was glad to lead the bipartisan negotiations on the part of the Senate  Finance Committee for that CARES package and have been standing ready  to repeat the process if Democratic leaders would just agree to agree.  Why can't we repeat the same process now?   Democrats seem to think that they can hold out until Republicans  either agree to their partisan wishes or Republicans take the blame for  the lack of relief. If the Democrats are right, it would be a partisan  win for their party, but at the same time, it would be a tremendous  loss for the American people.   Let's agree to move forward like we did last March.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
