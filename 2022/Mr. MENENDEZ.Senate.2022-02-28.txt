The estimated total value is $122 million.        This proposed sale will support the foreign policy and       national security objectives of the United States. Australia       is one of our most important allies in the Western Pacific.       The strategic location of this political and economic power       contributes significantly to ensuring peace and economic       stability in the region. It is vital to the U.S. national       interest to assist our ally in developing and maintaining a       strong and ready self-defense capability.        The proposed sale will improve Australia's capability to       meet current and future threats by providing modern       protection for large air mobility platforms. These       countermeasures are crucial to defeating modern threats.       Australia will have no difficulty absorbing these articles       into its armed forces.        The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not       alter the basic military balance in the region.        The principal contractors will be Northrup Grumman       Corporation, Rolling Meadows, IL; and The Boeing Company,       Long Beach, CA, and San Antonio, TX. There are no known       offset agreements proposed in connection with this potential       sale.        Implementation of this proposed sale will require the       assignment of 0.5 Full-Time Equivalent (FTE) additional U.S.       Government representatives and 0.5 FTE U.S. contractor       representatives to support Australia from the U.S. for a       duration of five (5) years to support program management and       engineering activities necessary to field and sustain LAIRCM       on multiple Royal Australian Air Force platforms.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.                            Transmittal No. 22-15       Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to           Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act                             Annex Item No. vii         (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:        1. The AN/AAQ-24(V)N LAIRCM system is a self-contained,       directed-energy countermeasures system designed to protect       aircraft from infrared-guided surface-to-air missiles. The       LAIRCM system features digital technology micro-miniature       solid-state electronics. The system operates in all       conditions, detecting incoming missiles and jamming infrared-      seeker equipped missiles with aimed bursts of laser energy.       The LAIRCM system consists of the Guardian Laser Transmitter       Assembly (GLTA), LAIRCM System Processor Replacement (LSPR),       multiple Advanced Threat Missile Warning Sensors (ATW), the       Control Interface Unit Replacement (CIUR), and the Classified       Memory Card User Data Module. The AN/PYQ-10 Simple Key Loader       is also a necessary device.        2. The Guardian Laser Transmitter Assembly (GLTA) is a       laser transmitter pointer/tracker subsystem designed to track       the inbound threat missile and point the laser jam source at       the missile's seeker. The GLTA automatically deploys the       countermeasure.        3. The LAIRCM System Processor Replacement (LSPR) analyzes       the data from each Missile Warning Sensor and automatically       deploys the appropriate countermeasure via the GLTA. The LSPR       contains Built-in-Test (BIT) circuitry.        4. The AN/PYQ-10 Simple Key Loader is a portable, hand-held       device used for securely receiving, storing, and transferring       data between compatible cryptographic and communications       equipment.        5. The Advanced Threat Missile Warning Sensors (ATW) detect       and declare threat missiles. The sensors are mounted on the       aircraft exterior to provide omni-directional protection. The       sensors detect the rocket plume of missiles and send       appropriate data signals to the LSPR for processing.        6. The Control Interface Unit Replacement (CIUR) displays       the incoming threat for the pilot to take appropriate action.       The CIUR also provides operator interface to program the       LAIRCM system to initiate built-in-test (BIT), to display       system status, and to provide the crew with bearing to threat       missile launch.        7. The Classified Memory Card User Data Module contains the       laser jam codes. The Classified Memory Card User Data Module       is loaded into the LSPR prior to flight; when not in use, the       Classified Memory Card User Data Module is removed from the       LSPR and put in secure storage.        8. The highest level of classification of defense articles,       components, and services included in this potential sale is       SECRET.        9. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain       knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements, the       information could be used to develop countermeasures that       might reduce weapon system effectiveness or be used in the       development of a system with similar or advanced       capabilities.        10. A determination has been made that Australia can       provide substantially the same degree of protection for the       sensitive technology being released as the U.S. Government.       This sale is necessary in furtherance of the U.S. foreign       policy and national security objectives outlined in the       Policy Justification.        11. All defense articles and services listed in this       transmittal have been authorized for release and export to       the Government of Australia.                                   ____                                                               ____________________     Madam President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export  Control Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of  certain proposed arms sales as defined by that statute.
