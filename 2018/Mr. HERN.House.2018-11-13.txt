 Mr. Speaker, Members of this esteemed body, it is my honor  to represent the citizens of Oklahoma's First Congressional District.   Mr. Speaker, I want to first thank my wife, Tammy, of 25 years. I  would not be here today without her. My oldest son, Kelby, is here with  his wife, Dana; and my youngest son, Kaden, is here.   I also want to thank my colleagues from Oklahoma who have gone above  and beyond in welcoming me to this body: Congressman Lucas, Congressman  Cole, Congressman Russell, and Congressman Mullin. I cannot thank them  enough.   The most recent advice they gave me was to keep this very brief, so  brief I will be.   I have lived the American Dream, growing up without running water to  now serving my great country and fellow Oklahomans in Congress.   Now, we as a body need to work together to make sure that that dream  can be achieved by so many generations to come. Let's get to work.                            ____________________
