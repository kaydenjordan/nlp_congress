 Madam Speaker, just over 2 years ago, the Carr fire  burned through Shasta County, taking the lives of eight people and  burning nearly 230,000 acres.   Now, I am here to report, in the same county of Shasta, the Zogg fire  has broken out over this weekend, burning uncontained. As of this  morning, 146 structures have been destroyed, three people have lost  their lives, over 40,000 acres burned and counting.   Cal Fire and Shasta County--with the assistance of many other units  across the State--are working hard to extinguish the Zogg fire, but a  lack of firefighting personnel and equipment has made this a difficult  one to contain. It is not an unfamiliar story.   Firefighters, first responders, and Californians alike are struggling  to grapple with the 27 major fires that are burning across our State  right now. With no rain in sight, the end of these disasters is not  near. There is a dire need for a better way to contain these fires, or  better yet, completely prevent them in the first place.   Until we increase the pace and scale of forest management and other  tools that we use in the West, these never-ending fires will continue  to destroy all of our land.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, Mr. Shimkus is always one of the guys I  enjoyed the most around here. We didn't get to hang out a lot or share  any of the same committees, but he is always an upbeat and friendly  fellow to get along with around here.   I didn't want tonight to go by without at least saying something to  you about how I appreciate you and enjoy you. You take on really  difficult issues.   The education you have helped provide me and other Members on the  situation down at Yucca Mountain is appreciated, the battle on that,  because that is extremely important to get a handle on how we deal with  that issue around the country, which hadn't been handled very well. You  are a true leader on that, and I thank you for that.   Many, many blessings in your next endeavor. As a friend, I am glad to  be here tonight with you.
