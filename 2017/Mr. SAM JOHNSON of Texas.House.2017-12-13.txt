 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to strongly urge  President Trump to nominate a Social Security Commissioner without  further delay.   The Social Security Administration has been without a Senate- confirmed Commissioner for over 1,700 days. That is almost 5 years.  This is totally unacceptable. The American people need a Commissioner,  and they need one now.   Without a Commissioner, Social Security is just spinning its wheels.  Important decisions are being put off and service has deteriorated.   I ask the President to act now to nominate a Commissioner so that  Social Security can provide the service Americans want, need, and  deserve.                            ____________________
