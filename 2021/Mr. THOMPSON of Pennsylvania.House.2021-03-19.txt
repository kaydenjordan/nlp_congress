 Mr. Speaker, last week, I introduced  the Whole Milk For Healthy Kids Act with Mr. Antonio Delgado. This bill  addresses the importance of providing whole milk in school cafeterias.   It is proven that milk is the number one provider of nine essential  nutrients, as well as a great deal of long-term health benefits,  including better bone health, lower blood pressure, reduced risk of  cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. These benefits are crucial  for the healthy development of our Nation's youth.   Over the years, milk has been unfairly demonized, leading to the loss  of nearly an entire generation of milk drinkers. The goal of this bill  is to give children a wide variety of milk options and bolster milk  consumption, a win-win for growing healthy children and America's dairy  farm families.   Mr. Speaker, it is time to follow the signs and allow whole milk back  into the school cafeterias. With bipartisan support, it is my hope that  we can bring this bill to the floor and pass this critical legislation  to encourage the healthy development of our Nation's youth and support  our dairy farm families across the country.                            ____________________
