 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of this  resolution demanding that the administration release the whistleblower  complaint to Congress.   Every American ought to be extremely concerned by circumstances  surrounding this urgent complaint and outraged that this President and  members of his administration are hiding it.   Congress has a constitutional duty, Madam Speaker, to obtain this  information by the deadline required by law. The administration is  blocking our ability to gather the information necessary to respond to  the public's needs. In this case, these needs are inseparable from our  security, our safety, and the well-being of our Nation.   Congress is entitled to the full complaint, not only for the sake of  national security, Madam Speaker, but to ensure that our ability to  hold public servants accountable remains.   This isn't about partisan politics. This is about protecting our  democracy and its people.   Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this  resolution.
