 Mr. Speaker, today the House took  sweeping bipartisan action to address PFAS contamination that has  proliferated across communities in America. These forever chemicals  have been linked to negative health effects, including cancer, impaired  child development, and even infertility.   Granite Staters have already seen the harmful consequences of PFAS  contamination, and I am pleased that the legislation we passed today  will safeguard communities, clean up contaminated sites, and protect  public health.   Importantly, the bipartisan bill we passed today includes language I  authored to turn off the tap for new PFAS chemicals being approved by  the EPA. Enough is enough. There are already too many dangerous PFAS  chemicals in our environment, and the last thing Americans need is more  of these forever chemicals.   The PFAS Action Act also included a bipartisan amendment offered by  my good friend and colleague Chris Pappas and myself, which would  authorize significant grant funding to public water treatment  facilities to safeguard our drinking water.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the Senate to take up this important bill.                            ____________________
