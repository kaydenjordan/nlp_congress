 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 5525,  the so-called spending reduction and border security act.   You want border security, Mr. Speaker, let's do comprehensive  immigration reform. Let's do it the way Ronald Reagan did it back in  the day: He looked at everybody, all the families, and allowed the men  to work and contribute to our economy.   This is a reprehensible and irascible spending bill that slashes  critical resources from working-class families.   House Republicans are defunding law enforcement. The so-called party  of public safety is now defunding law enforcement. So if something is  happening in your district or your neighborhood and you call the police  and they are late, law enforcement should blame it on these cuts. The  response time will be impacted dramatically.   Social Security offices will be closing. Yes, I have seen the lines  going around the block with seniors as early as 6 o'clock in the  morning.   Guess what? They will be closing.   This bill is taking food out of children's mouths, and the mouths of  families, impacting Title 1 schools with poverty levels--never seen  before poverty levels, and Title 3 students, English language learners,  and taking thousands upon thousands of teachers out of the classroom.  Is this the way to avoid a shutdown?                                time  1245    This is a way to hurt families--working-class families, middle-class  families--that depend on these vital programs, Mr. Speaker, to survive  and move forward.   Nearly 150,000 teachers and service providers will be removed from  the classroom serving low-income students and students with  disabilities.   In addition to that, approximately 275,000 kids will lose access to  Head Start--Head Start, the only surviving program from the sixties  that gives a head start to children will be cut.
