 Mr. Chairman, I thank my friend for bringing this  amendment. It is an important amendment to people that matter very  much.   John Dingell is a man of integrity. I feel I know his heart. He has a  huge heart, and we disagreed on many issues, but I know him as a man of  integrity.   He was told he had to push through the cap and trade that would have  gotten into costing people for this so-called cost of carbon, and he  said it is not only a tax, it is a great big tax, and he lost his  chairmanship.   But what John Dingell knows, what I know is when you start creating  taxes on fuel, the people that get hammered the worst are the Nation's  poorest among us. That is who it gets passed to. That is who gets  crushed. Let's don't do this to the hardworking, poorest among us.  Let's vote for the Mullin amendment.
