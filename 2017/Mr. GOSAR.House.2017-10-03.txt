 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to include extraneous material on the topic of my Special Order.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Arizona?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to include extraneous material on the topic of my Special Order.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Arizona?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I rise to bring this Chamber's attention to  the devastating wildfires that have ravaged the Nation this year.   The National Interagency Fire Center reports that there have been  49,563 fires that have burned 8,422,251 acres so far in 2017. Wow.  Another 80 million throughout the country are at high-risk status,  including one-quarter of the 193 million-acre National Forest System.   Though the Forest Service has spent a record $2.3 billion to fight  fires in 2017, these resources are being spent on the back end.   Mr. Speaker, the country has literally been on fire, particularly  Western communities. It is far past time that this Chamber pass H.R.  2936 and get serious about combating catastrophic wildfires before they  get started.   Mr. Westerman's bipartisan bill adopts a forward-thinking, active  management strategy and also provides allocation reforms that would  cease the practice of fire borrowing.   I will likely have more comments later, but we have a few folks  pressed for time, so I am going to end my comments there.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Tipton), my  friend.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the vice chairman for his comments.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Stewart).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the vice chairman for his comments.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Stewart).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the vice chairman for his comments.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Stewart).    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Utah, who has seen the  challenging aspects and destruction from the fires, for his remarks.   I also now want to acknowledge my friend from Montana, who is  actually still seeing the ravaging of the fires. In fact, Seeley Lake,  Montana, set a record for the worst air quality ever recorded there, 18  times greater than the EPA safe particulate limit. Wow, that is a  record that we have got to stop.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Montana (Mr. Gianforte).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Montana, who I am  sorry to see have such a hard time this year in forest management, for  his remarks.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr.  McClintock), my friend and colleague.   Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Gosar of the  Western Caucus for arranging this Special Order tonight and especially  for his exemplary leadership as chairman of the Western Caucus.   The wildfire crisis facing our forests across the West comes down to  a very simple adage. Excess timber comes out of the forest one way or  the other. It is either carried out or it burns out, but it comes out.   When we carried out our excess timber, we had healthy resilient  forests and we had thriving, prosperous communities. Excess timber  sales from Federal lands not only generated revenues for our mountain  communities, but created thousands of job.   But in the 1970s, we adopted laws like the National Environmental  Policy Act and the Endangered Species Act that have resulted in  endlessly time-consuming and cost-prohibitive restrictions and  requirements that have made the scientific management of our forests  virtually impossible.   Timber sales from our Federal lands has dropped 80 percent in the  intervening years, with a concomitant increase in forest fires. In  California alone, the number of saw mills has  [[Page H7738]]  dropped from 149 in 1981 to just 27 today.   Timber that once had room to grow healthy and strong now fights for  its life against other trees trying to occupy the same ground.   Average tree density in the Sierra Nevada is three to four times the  density that the land can actually support. In this weakened condition,  trees lose their natural defenses to drought and disease and  pestilence, and they ultimately succumb to catastrophic wildfire.   Three years ago, an estimated 25 million trees in the Sierra fell  victim to these stressors. Two years ago, that number doubled to 50  million trees. Last year, more than 100 million dead trees are now  waiting to burn in the Sierra.   Well, after 45 years of experience with these environmental laws--all  passed with the promise that they would improve our forest  environment--I think we are entitled to ask: How's the forest  environment doing?   All around us the answer is damning. These laws have not only failed  to improve our forest environment, but they are literally killing our  forests.   The same politicians responsible for these failed laws have recently  conjured up two new excuses. One is climate change. The other is that  we are putting out too many fires.   Putting out too many fires?   That invites an important question: Exactly which fires did they  propose that we allow to burn?   Perhaps the King fire that almost wiped out the towns of Georgetown  and Foresthill on its way to Lake Tahoe in 2014?   Or perhaps the Detwiler fire this year that almost wiped out the town  of Mariposa on its way to the Yosemite Valley?   Or any one of the more than 1,000 fires in the Sierra that CAL FIRE  has put out this year, any one of which could have grown into a  megafire but for the vigilance and competence of our fire agencies?   Which of these fires would they allow to burn into a conflagration?   True, controlled burns play an important role in clearing out  underbrush, but as firefighters bitterly complained to me at the  command center at the Detwiler fire this year, these same laws make it  virtually impossible to get permits to do the controlled burns.   The other reason that we hear is climate change. Well, let's put that  to the smell test. Throughout our vast forests, it is often very easy  to visually identify the property lines between well-managed private  forests and the neglected Federal lands.    Now, I have seen it myself on aerial inspections. The private managed  forests are green, healthy, and thriving. The neglected Federal forests  are densely overcrowded and often scarred by fire because we can't even  salvage the fire-killed timber while it still has value. You can  literally tell from the condition of the forest where the property line  is. How clever of our climate to know exactly what is the boundary line  between private and government lands.   And if carbon dioxide is the problem, doesn't it make sense to mill  fully grown trees to sequester the carbon and replace them with young,  growing trees that absorb much higher levels of carbon?   But, again, these same laws prevent this.   This is not complicated. Our forests are catastrophically overgrown.  Drought is a catalyst. It is not the cause. In overgrown forests, much  snow evaporates in dense canopies and cannot reach the ground. The  transpiration volume in an overgrown forest is a big problem in a  normal rain year; in a drought, it becomes lethal.   Pestilence is a catalyst; it is not a cause. Healthy trees can  naturally resist bark beetles; stressed trees cannot.                                time  1930    A properly managed forest matches the tree density to the ability of  the land to support it, but we cannot properly manage our forests  because of the laws now in place.   Mr. Westerman's Resilient Federal Forests Act and other measures will  restore proper scientific management of our national forests, but we  are running out of time to enact them, because we are running out of  forests to save.   Mr. Speaker, I again thank the gentleman for yielding today, I thank  him for his leadership, and I thank him for arranging this hour  tonight.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California for his  thoughts. He brought up some specific facts that need reiteration just  because they are so plentiful.   The Forest Service only harvested 2.5 billion board feet in 2016,  compared to over 10 billion board feet in 1990. To make matters worse,  litigation and other challenges have caused a significant reduction in  active sawmills nationwide from over 1,300 in 1995, to just over 220  today.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Walden).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman so greatly for his  indulgence in coming down and expressing the problems that have been  faced in Oregon and thank him for the timely hearing tomorrow in Energy  and Commerce. We certainly appreciate it.   We need to enlighten all Americans as to the tragedy that is going on  in our public Western lands.    I yield to the gentleman.    I yield to the gentleman.    I want to highlight one thing that the gentleman actually  brought to attention. Catastrophic fires also cause significant damage  to the environment. Robust data from NASA has concluded that one  catastrophic wildfire can emit more carbon emissions in a few days than  total vehicle emissions in an entire State over the course of the year.  Phenomenal. We just have to make sure people understand.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments.    Mr. Speaker, I now yield to the gentleman from Washington  (Mr. Newhouse), my dear friend.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Washington.   Mr. Speaker, the two speakers have now brought up the issue that the  House has repeatedly passed resolutions and ideas in regards to funding  and taking care and mitigating our forest tragedy. There is an old  adage around here that the Democrats may be the opposition, but the  Senate is always the enemy. What we are here to do is light a fire  under the Senate. Their talk is cheap; their actions speak. So let's  light a fire.   To do that, I now yield to the gentleman whose Resilient Federal  Forests Act is the topic for this evening, H.R. 2936.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Westerman.)    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Arkansas for his  excellent leadership. He is very modest.   Listen, folks, I made a comment. Around here in Washington, D.C., we  talk about the Democrats being the opposition and the Senate being the  problem. Well, as you know, this is a very bipartisan bill. He is very  modest.   Let's go back through what H.R. 2936, the Resilient Federal Forests  Act, actually does.    It allows for the streamlined review of projects up to 30,000 acres  if the management strategy is put forward by collaborative  stakeholders. Imagine that, something so simple.   It also requires litigants opposing active management projects to  propose an alternative proposal as opposed to just saying ``no.''  ``No'' isn't a solution. It is what you are for.   It removes incentives for extreme special interest groups to file  frivolous lawsuits--boy, once again, coming to the table with a  solution.   It empowers local stakeholders and decisionmakers. So often we  overlook the people on the ground, on Main Street, who have to live  with the consequences for bad policy decisions.   It also empowers Tribal communities to be part of the solution and to  help reduce the risk of wildfire. We see this time and again, that the  Native Tribes that are in charge of their forests have pristine  management practices.   H.R. 2936 also maintains current protections for our environmentally  sensitive areas, including wilderness and roadless areas. What a  concession.   We need to be clear about larger risk areas and get to these in a  more timely manner that we really want to handle.   This bill is good for forest-dependent species as it allows for  improvements to their habitat.   This bill adopts a forward-thinking, active management strategy that  combats dangerous wildfires before they get started, which includes  reforms that would end the practice of fire borrowing.   I want to thank the gentleman for his excellent piece of legislation.  It is time that it moves forward.   Once again, it is not the House that is the problem, but our  colleagues across the street. Once again, talk is cheap; actions speak.  Americans need help.   The fact that these disasters are quite natural might lead one to  think they are inevitable, but according to forestry officials and  experts, it is our stunted Federal forestry management and underfunded  and misallocated Forest Service accounts that are to blame.                                time  2000    Our system is broken. These fires start naturally and decimate our  natural ecosystems, but the ultimate cause at the level of their  severity and recurrence is manmade.   The facts about the relationship between management and wildfires  speak for themselves. Forest Service data indicates that active forest  management reduces wildfire intensity, while improving forest health.  In spite of this, only 1 to 2 percent of high risk areas are actively  treated and subject to forest management.   The United States Forest Service expends too many resources fighting  fires after they break out to work to prevent them in any significant  way before they start. By performing routine thinning, culling  hazardous fuels on the forest floors, and conducting controlled burns,  they could accomplish exactly that, but such a course of action would  require ample resources and wise allocation. As you could guess, my  professional diagnosis is that both of those are in short supply.   I hope my friends on the other side of the aisle are able to hear  what I say next. If you care about carbon emissions, you should care  deeply about this issue, no matter where you live in the country, no  matter where you live.   NASA data shows that one wildfire can emit more carbon in a few days  than total vehicle emissions in a State for the whole year. To put it  in perspective, controlled burning releases roughly 10 percent as much,  and is only one part of an overall active management strategy.   So the correct choice in this situation is obvious: we spend a little  more on the front end so that we can save ourselves much of the  economic, environmental, and familial displacement costs on the back  end. These costs are year after year, and they are catastrophic when  they are left untreated.   Treatment is the right course of action, but it requires a little bit  of planning, due diligence, and yes, action on our part. I know  Congress is a big fan of the word, but when you look at the track  record, Congress isn't a big fan of actually acting.   In response to this dire situation, Members of Congress from across  the country will be sharing their thoughts and experiences within their  home States. They will be discussing this during the year, and this  past year of terrible wildfires. These are stories that need to be  recounted.   They will also be speaking about the solutions that we have come  together  [[Page H7742]]  with, for forestry officials and stakeholders across the country.  Tackling this problem has become a collaborative and holistic national  policy effort, and the policy proposals we have produced are reflective  of this fact. They are also bipartisan.   But, Mr. Speaker, we can't let this just be a rhetorical exercise. We  are united in demanding Congress do something. This Chamber has the  knowledge and aptitude to deliver policy solutions. Now we need the  political will to turn that knowledge into congressional action. Only  then will huge portions of the country finally see some relief from  these disasters.   When your home is on fire, it is straightforward, it is a nonpartisan  issue. You call the fire department, and after the problem is dealt  with, you make sure that you eliminate what caused the fire so that you  don't see it again.   Mr. Speaker, our Nation was on fire this year, and I demand that we,  as this Chamber, unite in the same spirit of decisive problem solving  as we do for our natural disasters. Let's put these fires out, and then  let's stop the brunt for next year's fires before they start.   In my four terms as a Congressman from Arizona, I have had to witness  the largest catastrophic fire in Arizona history, and also the most  catastrophic life-taking, the Yarnell fire. The first was the Wild Well  fire in northeast Arizona, and the second was the Yarnell fire that is  now in the movie theaters that took the lives of 19 firefighters. That  is a travesty.   This is something that gives when it is managed right. The people  back home know the right answer. Let's give them the tools, the working  power, and the policy that allows them, instead of being victims, to be  stalwart solutions for a policy that gives back.   As the gentleman from Arkansas said, as Teddy Roosevelt said: Leave  our natural resources better than we found them.   Mr. Speaker, the speakers tonight shared their stories. We want  America to hear those loud and clear. These are natural disasters no  different than hurricanes, but these, in one case, are different. They  are manmade.   Let's bring this commonsense policy that Mr. Westerman has put  forward. He is a true advocate and smart in regards to those reforms;  that is why we want to make sure that H.R. 2936 gets moved through this  Chamber, and then put the onus back on the Senate, so that we actually  reward the people for good policy and making sure that the victims are  turned upside down and made stalwart solution makers.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
