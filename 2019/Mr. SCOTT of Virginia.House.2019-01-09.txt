 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from  Florida for her distinguished service as the Secretary of Health and  Human Services, and I thank her for yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution. Legal  scholars from across the ideological spectrum agree that this latest  challenge to the Affordable Care Act is legally frivolous. However,  because of the devastating impact that it will have on Americans, it is  critical that we use our authority to intervene on their behalf.   If Republicans successfully dismantle the Affordable Care Act, the  consequences will be felt by all Americans, including the millions of  people with employer-sponsored coverage. They will lose protections for  patients with preexisting conditions; they will lose prohibitions on  annual and lifetime coverage limits; they will lose access to low- or  no-cost preventive care; and they will lose the popular provision which  allows young people to stay on their parents' insurance policies up to  the age of 26.   These protections are all a product of the Affordable Care Act, and  they are all at risk. We can't take the chance on this lawsuit being  successful and then wait for a replacement, because we already know  what the replacement will be. The House-passed replacement for the  Affordable Care Act from a few years ago would have resulted in  millions of fewer people with insurance and according to CBO, the costs  would go up 20 percent the first year, insurance would cover less than  it covers now; and those with preexisting conditions would lose their  protections. That is what would happen if this lawsuit is successful.   This vote is about fulfilling our responsibility to act in the best  interests of the American people. I encourage my colleagues to support  the resolution.
