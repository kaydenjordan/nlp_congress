 Madam President, today I wish to discuss the impact  of Parkinson's disease in the U.S. and across the world.   While significant progress has been made in managing certain symptoms  and identifying potential risk factors, we still lack a clear  understanding of the underlying causes of Parkinson's disease. To that  end, I continue to support the strongest funding possible for  biomedical research under the National Institutes of Health and its  Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies--BRAIN-- Initiative, as well as the Parkinson's Research Program at the  Department of Defense. These investments are necessary to sustain  efforts by our Nation's scientists at the helm of innovative research  and discovery, with the hope and resolve that we will one day find a  cure.   I would like to highlight a recent study entitled ``The Economic  Burden of Parkinson's Disease,'' which was brought to my attention in a  meeting with constituents led by Dan Lewis, a longtime advocate for  Parkinson's research. Commissioned by the Michael J. Fox Foundation for  Parkinson's Research, this study places the annual economic impact of  Parkinson's at $52 billion in 2017, nearly double the previous  estimates. Approximately half of that total reflects the medical costs  of Parkinson's patients, primarily paid by Medicare.   The other half reflects the real indirect costs shouldered by  patients with Parkinson's, their caregivers, and our society. The  effects of living with Parkinson's disease permeate so many aspects of  patients' lives, from personal finances to workforce participation to  caregiver time and effort. With a rising aging population, the burden  will only grow from here; the number of people with Parkinson's disease  is projected to double by 2040.   By shedding light on the human and societal impact of Parkinson's,  this study illustrates the critical need for sustained research toward  better treatments and a cure. I ask unanimous consent that this study  be printed in the Congressional Record and encourage all Senators and  staff to review it.   Thank you.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                    [From the Lewin Group, July 5, 2019]          Economic Burden and Future Impact of Parkinson's Disease                              Executive Summary         Parkinson's disease (PD) is a slowly progressive       neurodegenerative disorder that affects approximately one       million Americans. In addition to the debilitating symptoms       of PD itself, patients also experience a number of       comorbidities, such as anxiety, depression, increased rates       of infection, cardiac and gastrointestinal diseases, and       injuries from falls. As a result, individuals with PD have       higher medical needs, often miss work, retire early, and       require the assistance of a caregiver. As such, the direct       and indirect economic burden of PD is likely to be       significant.        As part of its initiative to understand the economic burden       of PD, the Michael J. Fox Foundation commissioned The Lewin       Group to estimate the economic impact of PD in the U.S. in       2017. This study aims to provide the most comprehensive       assessment of the total burden of PD to date, including       filling the knowledge gap in some of the less well-understood       cost components, such as future earnings loss due to       premature death, productivity loss in both the labor market       as well as in social life, and caregiver burden.                               Study Highlights         This study provides the most comprehensive assessment of       the economic burden of PD in the U.S. in 2017. The estimated       total economic burden of PD in 2017 was $51.9 billion,       including a direct medical cost of $25.4 billion and an       additional $26.5 billion in indirect and non-medical cost.       These findings show that the true impact of PD has been       previously underestimated in the literature (see the       Discussion section).        Another highlight of the study is the Social and Financial       Impact of Parkinson's Disease Survey (i.e. the PD Impact       Survey). This primary survey was specifically designed and       administered for this study to deepen the understanding of       the full spectrum of PD impact. The survey was able to       collect detailed data on a broad set of indirect and non-      medical costs of PD that were previously unavailable,       especially the impact of PD on unpaid caregivers. This survey       was one of the largest surveys conducted so far on relatively       rare neurodegenerative diseases and received almost 5,000       responses from the PD community.                                Study Findings         PD prevalence estimated using nationally representative       surveys for younger and elderly U.S populations revealed a       much higher prevalence than previous literature. Exhibit ES-1       shows the estimated PD prevalence:        An estimated 1.04 million individuals in the U.S. have PD       in 2017.        PD is much more prevalent in the 65 population than in the       younger population. More males than females have PD .        PD prevalence rate is more than double among non-Hispanic       White compared to other groups, although this result is not       risk-adjusted and is subjected to small sample size       limitations.        Vast majority (89%) of the persons with PD are eligible for       Medicare. Among the estimated 919,000 individuals eligible       for Medicare coverage, 82,000 (9%) are younger than age 65.        PD is associated with significant amount of excess medical       cost: $25.4 billion in 2017, higher than the previous U.S.       based estimates. Exhibit ES-2 shows the estimated direct       medical cost of PD.        The vast majority of the medical cost of PD is borne by       populations with Medicare coverage (90%), 7% by those with       private insurance, and 3% by those with other insurance       including Medicaid, other insurance, or no insurance). Note:       the five-year combined MEPS data identified a total of 20       PWPs who are in the Other group, the small sample size       prevented further breakdown.        On average, the excess medical cost of PD is $24,439 above       not having PD. Average per person excess cost is $22,671 and       $19,489 for the privately insured and Other group of persons       with PD who are younger than 65 years of age, respectively;       and $24,811 for the Medicare beneficiary population with PD.        Hospital inpatient care, non-acute institutional care       (including SNF, nursing home, hospice, etc.), and outpatient       (including ancillary care) are the three largest cost       categories.        The estimated total indirect and non-medical cost of PD is       $26.5 billion in 2017, with near $20 billion to persons with       PD and another $6.6 billion to unpaid care partners. Exhibit       ES-3 shows the estimated indirect and non-medical cost of PD:        Average indirect and non-medical cost per PWP is $19,242       for PWP only and $25,558 for PWP combined with caregiver       burden.        Total indirect cost is $14.2 billion with the combined PWP       and caregiver absenteeism cost being the largest share,       followed by presenteeism cost and premature death related       earnings loss. The cost of absenteeism and presenteeism for       the care partners even surpass those for the PWPs.        Total non-medical cost is $7.5 billion with the paid non-      medical daily care being the largest share, followed by home       modification cost.        Disability income, although considered transfer cost, is       approximately $4.8 billion.        The full report can be found at https:// www.michaeljfox.org.   ____________________
