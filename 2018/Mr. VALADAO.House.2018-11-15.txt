 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to someone I  have gotten to know over the last few years pretty well.   Damon Nelson became an immediate friend, an ally, and a mentor. There  are so many different words to describe what Damon was to a lot of us.   When I came in as a freshman, I still remember his help setting up  offices, helping me interview potential staff, and giving me direction  on every decision that we had to make. It was amazing to watch, as an  incoming Member with brand-new staff, the way that he would take his  time to mentor every single one of them from top to bottom.                                time  1030    Damon treated everyone as an equal. He treated people with respect  and dignity. He truly loved this country, loved this institution, and  loved the process of helping others be successful here. He never, ever  looked down on another person. He had a sense of humor even until the  very end. Every chance I could, I would get down into the Permanent  Select Committee on Intelligence and just spend some time with him in  the office talking and laughing about whatever topic was going on that  day.   He is going to be truly missed by a lot of us. He was truly a great  guy who really added a lot to this institution. He made my time here in  Congress much, much better, and even helped set us up for as much  success as we have had over the last 6 years, and it is all because of  guys like Damon. I am grateful to have known him and grateful to have  served with him. I really do wish his family the best.                            ____________________
