 Madam Speaker, as Americans like me continue to fight to  save lives, no matter faith or ethnicity, I hope we remember all lives  lost.   I still remember the celebrations across Palestinian villages of Al  Shaima, who earned the highest high school exam score, making Gaza  proud. Al Shaima was a symbol of hope because even though she grew up  in a refugee camp, she still succeeded with the highest score.   She was killed with members of her family when missiles hit the al- Nuseirat refugee camp in Gaza.   Yousef Maher Dawas was a young poet and writer. He died alongside  members of his family. His last words, Madam Speaker, were: ``We are  not numbers.''   Viola and Yara, sisters, were killed at Saint Porphyrius Greek  Orthodox Church, where a missile hit while hundreds of people were  crowded into the compound seeking shelter. They were members of former  Congressman Justin Amash's family. They were among at least 16 people  killed at the church.   Madam Speaker, please know that silencing me silences Palestinian  voices who are asking to live, so we must ask and demand a cease-fire  now.
