 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.J. Res. 76 because  we can no longer allow the denial of debt relief to students defrauded  by predatory colleges.   We can no longer allow a system that looks to line the pockets of the  failed for-profits at the expense of students. We can no longer allow  Secretary DeVos to ignore a court order as she attempts to turn over  every action of the previous administration at the expense of the  American taxpayer and the American public.   People have been defrauded; people have been robbed; and we need  justice.   Nearly 8,000 Michigan borrowers are waiting for relief from paying  their Federal student loans, including Erica Maupin, who was going to  school to become a paralegal until she was defrauded by a Corinthian  College. Erica had to abandon her dream, and now she doesn't know how  she is going to provide for her family and pay off her debt because the  Federal Government isn't keeping its promise.   I am glad that the House is taking this step today. We should all be  proud that the House is taking this action. However, we should also  recognize it comes at the expense of a great step backward of the  current administration.   Because of the step backward that they took, we now have to take  another two big steps forward to right this wrong and to bring justice  to people like Erica, to people like the Michiganders who are waiting  for their justice are are waiting for their debt relief, and for our  For the People Agenda.
