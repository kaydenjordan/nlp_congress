 Mr. Speaker, today's bill that is on the floor is  nothing more than a harsh measure that seeks to cast a broad net and  cast immigrants in general in a poor light by labeling them criminals  based on the suspicions but not the actual facts. What is more, this  harsh and reckless measure provides virtually no procedural safeguards  for people to challenge a police officer's opinion as to whether or not  they are involved in a gang. A mere suspicion can mean that somebody  can be facing removal.   Instead of dealing with such draconian legislation, we should really  be talking about the positive contributions that immigrants make to  this country and the fact that we have over 800,000 DREAMers in this  country who are waiting for this Congress to act. They have been hoping  and they have been waiting for years for this Congress to provide a  legislative solution to allow them to continue to live in their  communities, to contribute to the economy, to pay taxes, and to be a  part of a country that they consider their own.   Many of these DREAMers were brought to this country as children, and  they had no say in the matter. They speak the language here, not even  that of their home countries of birth. Many of them have no families or  ties there. Many of them are outstanding students who are studying law,  medicine, and engineering. They want to put their talents to work for  this country, and yet here today we are talking about a bill that would  basically seek to condemn all immigrants as gang members and try to  deport them as quickly as possible.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter by the U.S. Conference  of Catholic Bishops in opposition to the bill that we are debating  today and in support of allowing DREAMers a legislative path to remain  in this country, to continue to serve in the military to fight and die  for this country, to put their God-given natural talents to work to pay  into the system, and to generate good economic results.           Committee on Migration, Migration and Refugee Services,             USCCB,                                Washington, DC, September 12, 2017.        Dear Representative: I write on behalf of the U.S.       Conference of Catholic Bishops' Committee on Migration       (USCCB/COM) to express our serious concern regarding H.R.       3697, the ``Criminal Alien Gang Member Removal Act,'' which       is being considered by the full House for a vote this       Wednesday, September 13, 2017. We urge you to reject H.R.       3697 as it is a very broad bill that could contribute to       victims of criminal gangs facing detention and being barred       from seeking protection in the U.S.        The Catholic Church has significant interest in the       protection of vulnerable immigrants and asylum seekers. The       Catholic Church's work in assisting immigrants stems from the       belief that every person is created in God's image and should       be treated with dignity and compassion. While the Catholic       Church recognizes governments' sovereign right to control       their borders, we believe this right should be balanced with       the right of immigrants to access safety and due process.       Jesus himself was a migrant, and the Holy Family, a migrant       family fleeing persecution from King Herod. The USCCB works       to fulfill the teachings of the Church on migration through       our work providing resettlement services to refugees,       services to unaccompanied immigrant children, and case       management services to human trafficking victims in the       United States.        Violence in El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala (the       Northern Triangle of Central America) remains the primary       force driving citizens to flee and seek protection. We have       seen firsthand from our work with unaccompanied children and       their families the increasing threat posed by gangs and       forcible gang recruitment in the Northern Triangle. Moreover,       the United Nations' refugee-protection agency (UNHCR) found       that the majority of children fleeing the Northern Triangle       ``were forcibly displaced because they suffered or faced       harms that indicated a potential or actual need for       international protection.'' Alarmingly, however, H.R. 3697,       would deny critical protection to many of these children and       their families.        H.R. 3697 establishes both an expansive definition of       ``criminal gang'' and a low threshold for association with       such a group. The bill allows those whom the government       merely has ``reason to believe'' have ever been gang members       or those who have participated in any activities of a       designated group as inadmissible, deportable and subject to       mandatory detention. Additionally, because of such a       perceived ``association'' by  [[Page H7329]]       the government, these individuals would be unable to access       several vital forms of legal relief, including asylum,       Temporary Protected Status, and Special Immigrant Juvenile       Status.        Given these severe consequences, we are particularly       concerned that H.R. 3697 provides no exemption for children       or other individuals who were victims of gangs and or       individuals who were forced to engage in gang-related       activities under duress. We fear that under H.R. 3697 there       will be victimized children who will be considered       ``associated'' with criminal gangs. This concern is       reinforced by the stories of the children we serve daily.       They are children like Mariana who was 16 when the local gang       began to target and harass her in her home country of El       Salvador. Mariana lived in constant fear after the gang began       to threaten her and her family, ultimately forcing her to       smuggle a package of drugs to another neighborhood in El       Salvador. After this incident, Mariana fled to the U.S. to       escape the growing daily threat of the gang and also to avoid       forcible recruitment. Mariana is living with her mother now       while she complies with her immigration proceedings. Sadly,       we know Mariana is just one of many children from the       Northern Triangle trying to flee gang violence. H.R. 3697       would deny such children safety, forcibly returning them to       situations where their wellbeing and even their lives would       be at risk.        We should not be turning our back on children and families       who have fallen victim to and are fleeing from the very       criminal organizations which our country is so diligently       working to eradicate. Rather, these victims are deserving of       our compassion, care, and protection and should be encouraged       to tell their stories so that we may adequately bolster our       prevention and child protection work. Our committee       understands and appreciates your commitment to the safety and       security of our nation. H.R. 3697, however, is not the       answer. We must resist the urge to mischaracterize and       mislabel victims in search of a safe haven. We urge you to       reject H.R. 3697 and instead work towards immigration reform       that addresses root causes and safe repatriation and       integration. And we pray that the all victims of criminal       gangs--regardless of their immigration status--find peace and       justice.            Sincerely,                                          Most Rev. Joe S. Vasquez,                            Chairman, USCCB Committee on Migration.     Mr. Speaker, if you look at the class of DREAMers today  that contribute to this country, many of them work and go to school.  Many of them are breadwinners for their families. They want to stay,  and yet we have given them no opportunity to do so. They are patriotic,  they are talented, and what they contribute to our country economically  is tremendous.   If you think about the number of DREAMers who have bank accounts, who  have credit cards, and who purchase goods that are produced here in the  United States, to simply embark on a path of mass deportations isn't  going to help our economy, and it is going to rip apart these families.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.    Speaker Ryan and House Republicans need to decide  whether they will be complicit in the Trump administration's cowardly  assault on DREAMers and immigrants or whether they will join the  overwhelming majority of Americans in calling on Congress to protect  these courageous and patriotic young people from the Trump  administration's mass deportation agenda.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to please vote ``no'' on the  underlying bill and please stop giving lip service to these talented  young people. Provide them with a path to hope and a path to be able to  contribute to this country.
