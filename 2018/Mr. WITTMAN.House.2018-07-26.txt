 Mr. Speaker, I am proud of this conference report and  the  [[Page H7703]]  items included in it. I want to thank Chairman Thornberry and Ranking  Member Smith for their leadership in pushing this across the finish  line.   In my subcommittee, we authorized an additional three battle force  ships, including the next Ford-class aircraft carrier.   We have also kept an eye on the future and prioritized funding for  the B-21 Raider bomber program and the Columbia-class ballistic missile  submarine, programs that are essential for our national security and  comprise two parts of our Nation's nuclear triad.   While we still have work to do, I think that this conference report  does a good job of continuing to build off of last year's progress.   Some have questioned whether a Member of Congress can be both a  fiscal hawk and a defense hawk. I am convinced that a Member can be  both. For example, we have also authorized long-term contracts for  ships, aircraft, and weapons. With these contracts, in addition to the  accelerated procurement of the next Ford-class aircraft carrier, we  understand the Navy can save almost $3 billion. These savings are  significant.   While I am proud that this may be the first time in more than two  decades that an NDAA will be enacted before the start of the fiscal  year, we still have work to do to secure funding for this bill.   Specifically, I believe there is no more debilitating action that  Congress can perform than delaying an accompanying Defense  Appropriations bill. The House has passed ours, but we need our  colleagues in the Senate to do the same during their time in D.C. in  August. If we lose this rare opportunity to pass a Defense  Appropriations bill before the end of the fiscal year, we will once  again be holding our military hostage for other domestic priorities.   I was thrilled to see Speaker Ryan continue to lead on this issue  when he indicated yesterday: ``We really just want to get the military  funded on time, on budget, on schedule this year, and that's the  primary concern.''   We need to get back to basics, perform our constitutional duty, and  let our servicemembers know that we have their backs while they are  serving on the front lines, that we are dedicated to their service, and  that we will take care of their families until they return.   Let's pass this defense authorization bill and turn to getting the  Defense Appropriations bill done on time.                                time  1100
