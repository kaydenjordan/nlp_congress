 Mr. President, today I wish to recognize and  extend my sincerest congratulations and happy birthday wishes to Ethel  Edna Tilley, who celebrates her 100th birthday on October 19.   Ethel, who likes to go by Edna, was born in Ramsgate, England, in  1918 and immigrated to the United States with her mother and sister  when she was 8 years old. Her father worked for 3 years in America  before their family joined him and settled in Everett, MA. Edna met her  husband Charlie at the County Road Church in Chelsea, MA. They later  married in the same church, while Charlie was home on leave during his  service in World War II. After the war, they moved to Saugus, MA, where  they raised their two children, Geraldine and Robert.   At 40 years old, Edna fulfilled her lifelong dream and became a  teacher. Together with her husband, Edna remodeled the first floor of  their home and opened the Country Kindergarten. Her kindergarten became  a nursery school and daycare center serving hundreds of children for 22  years.   She retired from teaching only to go back to work 2 years later, at  the U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service in Durham, NH.  Throughout her life, Edna also served as a Sunday school teacher, a  Sunday school superintendent, a factory worker, and a key-punch  operator at a bank. Additionally, Edna taught dance classes with her  husband before he passed away in 1996.   Today, Edna lives in Fremont, NH. She loves to paint, and she gives  away items she makes to friends and family. She has four grandchildren  and two great-grandchildren. Her family describes her as kind,  generous, and pure in heart.   I hope you join me, Edna's friends and family, and many people across  the Granite State in wishing Ethel Edna Tilley a very happy 100th  birthday.                            ____________________
