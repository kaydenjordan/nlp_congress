 Mr. Chair, I am so glad that my amendment to fund the  Research Facilities Act was included in this government spending  package. We need to address our deferred research maintenance backlog  and increase investments in next-generation agriculture research.   This research is critical, as farmers in my district face daunting  challenges. For example, the ability for researchers to conduct  experiments on plants under various environmental stresses is critical  for understanding how crops respond to new climate conditions. Modern  facilities can also help researchers screen new crop varieties and  understand the impacts of a changing climate on things like nutrient  density and susceptibility to pestilence.   Many farmers in Washington State rely on the tremendous research done  [[Page H6842]]  at institutions like Washington State University. Ensuring that they  have modern facilities, cutting-edge facilities, will make it easier  for them to attract and keep world-class researchers.   These investments will reposition the United States for leadership,  long-term success, and competitiveness around the world, and make sure  we are leading in agricultural research and food research.
