 Section 4:   ``The President, Vice President and all civil officers of the United  States, shall be removed from office on impeachment for, and conviction  of, treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.''    Mr. Speaker, the American people gave my party control of  the entire Congress and the White House because of the promise- breaking, job-killing bill known as ObamaCare, the craziest thing in  the whole world, according to President Bill Clinton. On November 8, we  were ordered to repeal ObamaCare, and that is just what we are going to  do.   Fearmongers on the other side are telling Americans they will lose  their health insurance like that. That will only happen if we follow  their example and pass a bill that becomes law before we have the time  to read it. House Republicans will take time to listen to doctors,  nurses, hospitals, patients, the American people to give them the  health care they deserve at a lower cost, higher quality with the  doctor of their choice. We have our orders. It is time to go to work.                            ____________________
