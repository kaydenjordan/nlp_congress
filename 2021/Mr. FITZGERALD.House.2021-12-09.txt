 Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R.  5314. The bill is simply another political attack by the Democrats on  President Trump. It also destroys the separation of powers between the  President and Congress.   I introduced an amendment to the bill to require Congress to be  notified when the AG terminates a special counsel, but unfortunately,  the Rules Committee failed to adopt it.   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle spent the last several  years peddling bogus allegations that President Trump colluded with  Russia. Now the Durham investigation has proved these allegations were  a sham that wasted years of time and resources, and now we know the  Clinton campaign paid Fusion GPS to draft the dossier as opposition  research.   Fusion GPS relied on information from Igor Danchenko, a Russian who  worked at the Brookings Institution. Mr. Danchenko based his  information on tales from Chuck Dolan, a public relations executive who  worked for the Hillary Clinton campaign in the past. The whole scheme  was a vicious circle that began and ended with the Clinton campaign.   We cannot have a bill that works to prevent overreach by one branch  of government. I urge my colleagues to oppose the bill.
