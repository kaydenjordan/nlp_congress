 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 2-- this harmful, partisan, Republican legislation--for many reasons, but  especially because it will endanger people seeking asylum.   This bill takes us backwards after years of acknowledging the need  for comprehensive immigration reform. The expansion of family detention  in this bill will hurt children and families. It is costly, and it does  not work as the majority claims.   Mental health and medical experts agree that jailing immigrant  families exposes children to high levels of trauma and distress. We  should be expanding effective programs like Family Case Management, but  this bill guts the program and will undermine its proven record of  close to 90 percent compliance.   We live in a country of immigrants, and our Nation is stronger  because of its diversity.   I urge all of my colleagues to oppose building walls and detention  centers and support comprehensive, humane immigration reform that will  strengthen our economy, enhance our security, and reflect our core  values as Americans.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record an article from Social Science &  Medicine about the high levels of mental health distress experienced by  children who are held in immigration detention.              [From Social Science & Medicine, Apr. 29, 2019]  Mental Health of Children Held at a United States Immigration Detention                                   Center   (By Sarah A. MacLean, Priscilla O. Agyeman, Joshua Walther, Elizabeth                K. Singer, Kim A. Baranowski, Craig L. Katz)                               1. Introduction         Immigrant children who are newly arrived in the United       States demonstrate more positive developmental outcomes, such       as resiliency and positive academic attitudes, than their       U.S.-born peers (Marks et al., 2014). However, several       environmental factors could contribute to the development of       psychological distress in these children and their families       once in the U.S. In addition to exposure to acculturation       stressors (Alegria and Woo, 2009; Suarez-Orozco and Suarez-      Orovco, 2001), immigrants may also encounter deleterious       medical and mental health outcomes associated with perceived       discrimination (Pascoe and Smart Richman, 2009). Latinx       immigrants also face health disparities driven by state-level       immigration policies (Philbin et al., 2018). Furthermore,       immigration policy and fears associated with deportation may       increase the risk of emotional distress among immigrants who       enter the U.S. without inspection or who remain without a       valid visa (Cavazos-Rehg et al., 2007; Martinez et al.,       2015). The forced dislocation from family, communities, and       employment associated with deportation from the U.S. is also       related to negative mental health outcomes (Bojorquez et al.,       2015; Morris and Palazuelos, 2015).        Beginning in 2014, there have been significant increases in       the number of individuals and their families from Guatemala,       El Salvador, and Honduras seeking asylum in the U.S. (Mossaad       and Baugh, 2018). Many women and children fleeing these       nations have reported experiencing human rights violations in       their countries of origin associated with gang-related and       intimate partner violence in the context of un-responsive law       enforcement and government presence (UNHCR, 2014, 2015).       Asylum seekers may experience a range of mental health       outcomes associated with their experiences of persecution       (PHR, 2012). They may continue to be emotionally affected by       trauma experienced in their home countries, as well as the       dangers and violence they often encounter during migration       (Temores-Alcantara et al., 2015). In addition, the very       process of seeking asylum may also contribute to their       psychological distress, as survivors are required to       participate in potentially retraumatizing asylum interviews       or adversarial immigration hearings (Schock et al., 2015).        The U.S. has also increased its capacity to detain       immigrant families seeking asylum through the creation of       more detention centers specifically designated for women and       children over the past five years (Eagly et al., 2018).       Asylum seekers in expedited removal are held in U.S.       immigration detention while they await a screening interview       for credible fear, where an asylum officer evaluates whether       the asylum seeker has a credible fear of persecution or       torture upon returning to their country of origin (HRF,       2018). This step is the first to determine eligibility for       asylum. Adults and children being held in immigration       detention demonstrate high rates of deleterious mental health       outcomes such as depression and anxiety (Keller et al., 2003;       Mares and Jureidini 2004). Studies conducted outside the U.S.       have shown that detained immigrant children present with a       high prevalence of depression/anxiety (10 percent) and post-      traumatic stress disorder (PTSD, 20 percent) (Buchmuller et       al., 2018; Sen et al., 2017). Research findings also indicate       that children held in immigration detention settings may       experience social, emotional, and behavioral difficulties at       higher rates than those seen in the community (Sarkar and       Gupta. 2007; Zwi et al, 2018).        To our knowledge, there have been no large empirical       studies that have evaluated the mental health of children in       immigration detention in the U.S. Previous studies       documenting the mental health of children in U.S. immigration       detention, though compelling, have been largely qualitative       and anecdotal (Brabeck et al., 2014), or have been from the       perspective of lawyers in the field (Bailey et al., 2014).       Furthermore, experts assert that the controversial policy of       forcibly separating children from their parents at the U.S.-      Mexico border is detrimental to children's health and       wellbeing (MacKenzie et al., 2017), therefore prospective       research on the effects of this policy is needed. Given the       significant environmental factors that may contribute to the       development of psychological difficulties in these children,       we sought to understand the current state of mental health in       this population.                                  2. method         We conducted a cross-sectional evaluation study of children       held at an immigration detention center over two months in       mid-2018. This center detains women who are accompanied by at       least one child under the age of 18 in U.S. Immigration and       Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody. We interviewed a       convenience sample of 425 mothers who presented to the       visitation center of the detention center. Mothers were       eligible to participate if they spoke English or Spanish and       if one of their children detained with them was between 4 and       17 years of age. The purpose of the study was stated       explicitly to mothers, and they were informed that their       participation and responses would not impact their legal       proceedings. Mothers who volunteered to participate provided       informed written consent and were interviewed in private       rooms or other areas of the visitation center that ensured       confidentiality. Nine mothers refused to participate. During       the time period of this study, 17 percent of the children       included in the sample had been previously separated from       their mothers. At the time of interviews, a subset of these       families had been recently reunited. All consenting mothers       completed a demographic survey that included items related to       country of origin, age of children, and date of arrival at       the detention center. Mothers were then asked questions about       their eldest child with them at the detention center.        Each mother completed the English or Spanish parent-report       version of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire       (SDQ), a 25-question screening instrument widely used       internationally in children age 4-17 years (Goodman, 2001)       and among refugee children (Zwi et al., 2017). The survey       includes items that assess the child's behavior and possible       responses are recorded as ``not true'' (0), ``somewhat true''       (1), and ``certainly true'' (2). Based on these responses,       each participant received a score indicating total       difficulties and a score for the subscales of emotional       problems (e.g., feeling unhappy or having excessive fears),       conduct problems (e.g., being disobedient), hyperactivity       (e.g., being restless or easily distracted), and peer       problems (e.g., preferring to play alone). Participants also       received a prosocial score, which assesses behaviors such as       sharing with other children and volunteering to help others.       Consistent with the scoring of the SDQ, the resulting scores       were assigned to the ``normal,'' ``borderline,'' or       ``abnormal'' category for total difficulties and each       subscale. Cutoff scores were originally designed such that       roughly 80 percent  [[Page H2267]]       of children's scores fall within the ``normal'' range, 10       percent within the ``borderline'' range, and 10 percent       within the ``abnormal'' range (Goodman, 1997).        A subset of 150 children age 9-17 years also assented to       participate in the study following the informed written       consent for their participation by their mothers. These       children were part of a convenience sample of children who       were in the visitation center at the time of their mothers'       interviews. The children completed the UCLA Post-Traumatic       Stress Disorder Reaction Index (PTSD-RI) Symptom Scale, a 27-      question screening tool used widely to assess symptoms of       PTSD in children (Steinberg and Beyerlein, 2013), including       refugee children (Ellis et al., 2006). Children were asked       how frequently they experienced core symptoms of PTSD in the       past month, with possible responses of ``non'' (0),       ``little'' (1), ``some'' (2), ``much'' (3), and ``most'' (4).       A symptom was considered ``present'' with a rating of 3 or 4.       Participants met the criterion for Category B       (reexperiencing) if ; 1 symptom was present and for Category       C (avoidance) if ; 1 symptom alterations in cognition and       mood) if ; 2 symptoms were present and for Category E       (increased arousal) if ; 2 symptoms were present. A probable       clinical diagnosis of PTSD was determined by meeting the       criteria for all 4 categories (Steinberg & B Beyerlein,       2013). Because a clinical assessment to establish a formal       diagnosis of PTDS was not included in this study, the term       ``probable PTSD'' will be used when referring to prevalence.        We describe sociodemographic characteristics with       frequencies and percentages. We examined the prevalence of       outcomes for the SDQ and PTSD-RI subscales. Cronbach's alpha       for the SDQ and PTSD-RI were 0.768 and 0.908, respectively.       Covariates included age, gender, country of origin, and       previous separation from the child's mother. We considered       results to be significant if p < 0.05. All analyses were       performed using IBM SPSS (version 224).        The research protocol, survey, and consent forms were       reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board at       the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. All participants       provided written, informed consent.                                  3. results         Most mothers were from Honduras (50 percent), El Salvador       (23 percent), or Guatemala (22 percent), which is consistent       with the overall population of residents at this detention       center. The average age of the mothers and children were 33       (SD = 7) and 10 (SD = 4) years, respectively. At the time       of interviews, families had been detained at the center       for between one and 44 days, with an average detention of       nine (SD = 6) days.        Based on their mothers' responses to the SDQ, the children       in this study demonstrated high rates of emotional problems       (32 percent), peer problems, (14 percent), and total       difficulties (10 percent) that fell within ``abnormal''       range. Rates of conduct problems and hyperactivity were each       8 percent. Children did not differ significantly based on       gender or country of origin. Children aged 4-8 years showed       higher rates of conduct problems (15 percent), hyperactivity       (14 percent) and total difficulties (21 percent) that fell       within the ``abnormal'' range compared to older children (all       ps < 0.001). Compared to children who never had been       separated from their mothers, children who had been separated       showed higher rates of emotional problems (49 percent vs. 29       percent, p = 0.003) and total difficulties (15 percent vs. 9       percent, p = 0.015) that fell within the ``abnormal'' range.       Notably, the majority of participants' scores (98 percent)       fell within the ``normal'' range on the prosocial scale.        Among the subset of 150 children who completed the PTSD-RI,       the mean age was 13.4 (SD = 2) and 37 (25 percent) had been       previously separated. Many met the criteria for avoidance (57       percent), reexperiencing (52 percent), negative alterations       in cognition and mood (42 percent), and increased arousal (22       percent). Based on the presence of symptoms of these 4       subscales, 17 percent of the children had a probable       diagnosis of PTSD. An additional 19 percent and 18 percent       met two and three of the criteria, respectively. Results of       the PTSD-RI did not differ significantly based on age,       gender, previous separation from mother, or country of       origin. Based on overall responses to both the SDQ and PTSD-      RI, we found that 44 percent of children presented with       symptoms that fell within the ``abnormal'' range on at least       one of the SDQ subscales or a probable PTSD diagnosis.                                4. Discussion         The children of mothers who were interviewed at this       detention center showed higher rates of emotional and       behavior difficulties, as well as PTSD, compared to children       in the general U.S. population; notably, the mean emotional       symptoms subscale and total difficulties scores for the       participants were higher than those seen in U.S. primary care       populations (Biel et al., 2015; Simpson et al., 2005;       Youthinmind, 2004). While approximately 5 percent of children       in the U.S. have emotional or behavioral difficulties, the       rate of abnormal total difficulties in the study population       was 10 percent (Simpson et al., 2005). Furthermore, the       lifetime prevalence of PTSD among adolescents in the U.S. is       estimated at 4.7 percent, far below the 17 percent seen in       this sample (McLaughlin et al., 2013). Average total       difficulty scores for the participants (8.90 [SD 5.88]) were       higher than those seen in Spanish-speaking Latinx Americans       who are not in detention (6.80 [SD 5.001]) (Strand et al.,       2015). The high rates of abnormal emotional (32 percent) and       peer problems (14 percent) seen in this sample are consistent       with high rates of abnormal scores for these subscales in       refugee children in Australia (23 percent) and 21 percent,       respectively) (Yalin Sapmaz et al., 2017; Zwi et al., 2017).       The high rate of probable PTSD (17 percent) in this study       group is also consistent with a high rate (20 percent) among       children held in immigration detention in the United Kingdom       (Sen et al., 2017). Of note, 98 percent of children had       normal scores on the prosocial scale, which includes items       such as being considerate of others' feelings and       volunteering to help others.        Due to the cross-sectional nature of this study, we cannot       draw causal connections between arrival in the U.S., time in       immigration detention, and the development of behavioral or       emotional difficulties. Regardless of cause, the distress       seen in these children highlights the need for immediate       mental health treatment, as early intervention in children       who demonstrate signs of psychological difficulties is shown       to improve long-term emotional health (Terr, 2013).        Of particular concern, these results demonstrate heightened       distress among detained children aged 4 to 8. Young children       are particularly vulnerable to the effects of their       environment, and trauma experienced early in life has a       significant effect on emotional and behavioral development       (Oral et al., 2016). These children, especially, would       benefit from early, developmentally-appropriate, and       specialized interventions to address these significant       stressors. Given the range of exposure to violence reported       by children fleeing Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador       (UNHCR, 2014), as well as the high rates of violence       experienced by migrants from these countries during their       journey to the U.S. (MSF, 2017), it is essential that these       young people receive treatment specific to ameliorating the       impact of posttraumatic stress.        Children who had been separated from their mothers       demonstrated a significantly greater number of emotional       symptoms and total difficulties when compared to detained       children who had not been separated from their mothers,       suggesting that separation is associated with an increase in       psychological distress. When the U.S. government began       separating more migrant children from their parents in May       2018, the American Academy of Pediatrics, American College of       Physicians, and American Psychological Association each       released statements condemning the policy (Kraft, 2018;       Lopez, 2018; Stewart, 2018). These professional       organizations, as well as individual clinical practitioners,       warn of the deleterious mental health outcomes associated       with forcibly removing children from the security of their       families in both the short and long-term (Mackenzie et al.,       2017). Our results, although correlational in nature, appear       to confirm these findings, at least in the short-term, and       reinforce expert opinion that separating immigrant children       from their parents causes emotional harm.        Current published guidelines from ICE, last updated in       2007, indicate that each person held in immigration detention       should receive an intake screening and referral to a mental       health provider, either in the detention center or at an       outside location if deemed necessary (ICE, 2007). Given that       some of the children in this study expressed severe emotional       distress and anecdotally expressed difficulty obtaining       further mental healthcare within the facility, current       screening methods and/or current treatment services are       likely inadequate in quality and scope. Therefore, further       clarification from ICE is required regarding the nature of       available treatment, as well as the extent to which       clinicians who receive referrals have training in child       psychology or psychiatry, demonstrate cultural-competence,       and integrate a trauma-informed lens in their interventions.       Moreover, given the continued stressors associated with       detention, these children would benefit from specialized       mental health treatment outside of immigration detention       settings. Indeed, many experts recommend that children be       placed in the community while their immigration cases proceed       and we believe our findings add further credence to this       position (Linton et al., 2017).        Limitations. Given the design of this study and the       restrictions of conducting research in an immigration       detention center, our results must be interpreted in the       context of several limitations. The participants represent a       convenience sample of the population of families, and only       those mothers who presented to the visitation center could be       recruited for participation. In addition, due to the nature       of the setting, some mothers completed the SDQ in their       child's presence, which may have influenced the mothers'       responses. Additionally, only a subset of older children was       asked to complete the PTSD-RI, as many were attending classes       at the facility's school at the time of their mothers'       interviews.                                5. Conclusions         Despite the limitations, this is one of the first studies       of the mental health of a particularly vulnerable population       of children being held in immigration detention in the U.S.       Our results demonstrate that detained children, and       especially those previously separated from their mothers,       experience significant psychological distress. Prior studies       have demonstrated that detention is deleterious to the mental       health of immigrants  [[Page H2268]]       (Keller et al., 2003; Sen et al., 2017). We theorize that the       trauma in this population is observed as a continuum,       involving the premigration experiences of the subjects in       their countries of origin, their migration experiences, and       their subsequent detention in the U.S. Against this       background of trauma, detention and denial of adequate mental       health treatment are detrimental to the development of these       children.
