 Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R.  1, ironically titled the For the People Act. A more accurate name would  be the ``For the Politicians Act.''   This bill would, essentially, ban the interstate crosscheck system  which 27 States, including Tennessee, use to prevent voter fraud by  ensuring voters are not registered in multiple States.   Is that for the people or for the politicians?   Another provision would mandate that States use unaccountable,  unelected commissions to draw their districts, further isolating  Americans from their elected officials.   Is that for the people or for the politicians?   Still, another section would create a 6-to-1 taxpayer-funded match  for political donations, giving politicians a massive boost for their  campaign coffers from taxpayer dollars.   Is that for the people or for the politicians?   H.R. 1 is not for the people; it is for the politicians. I urge my  colleagues to vote ``no.''                            ____________________     Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Chair, I continue to reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I just want to share a thought  on this.   It is interesting that recently we just raised the alcohol purchasing  age to 21. We don't allow a 16-year-old to buy a beer, and the  decisionmaking is because of their ability to reason at that age. That  is why we moved their ability to buy a simple beer to age 21. And now  the other side wants to grant a 16-year-old the ability to decide the  future of the country. I think this is foolish.    Madam Chairwoman, I have an amendment at the  desk.    Madam Chairwoman, I rise today to offer my  amendment expressing the sense of Congress that free speech should be  protected.   H.R. 1 is a misguided bill with many problems. One problem, in  particular, has united everyone from the Heritage Foundation to the  ACLU. It is the bill's assault on free speech.   The ACLU itself says H.R. 1 will ``chill speech essential to our  public discourse.'' When the ACLU admonishes a Democrat bill, everyone  should take notice.   My amendment is simple. It reaffirms the First Amendment to the  Constitution of the United States. The First Amendment, after all,  guarantees the most fundamental right of our Democratic society:  ``Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech.''   Our Founding Fathers knew that in order for the American experiment  to work, the people must be free: free to participate in the democratic  process, free to vote in elections, free to help candidates and causes  they believe in, and free to speak up when their elected officials are  no longer representing them.   The freedom of speech enshrined in the First Amendment has helped  make America the most exceptional country in the history of the world.  Unfortunately, H.R. 1 tramples on that very freedom.   Madam Chair, I offer this amendment to express the sense of Congress  that the freedom of speech must be preserved and protected because,  without it, the American experiment won't ever be the same again.   A vote against this amendment is a vote against free speech. If you  don't believe me, ask the ACLU.   I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this  amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chairwoman, how much time do I have  remaining?    Madam Chair, I just want to make a few  specific comments in regard to the amendment and how it impacts H.R. 1  in general.   First, there are no special interest protections in this amendment,  none whatsoever. I remind my colleagues of what the ACLU actually said  about H.R. 1. It places a chill on ``speech essential to our public  discourse.''   Further, I would like to stress that the Court has long affirmed the  rights of individuals and organizations to have free speech.   With those comments and clarifications, Madam Chairwoman, I reserve  the balance of my time.    Madam Chairwoman, I would just like to read  that point five. This is what it actually says: ``Political speech,  including the financial contributions to political or issue advocacy  campaigns, is a vital part of our Nation's free exchange of ideas and  avenues of free expression must be preserved and protected.''   That is all it says, let the American people decide. That is  essentially what it says, that free speech should be protected.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    In conclusion, Madam Chairwoman, again, as I  look at that point five, or paragraph five, supporting the free  exchange of ideas and avenues of free expression, I struggle to see  where disclosure issues are raised in that paragraph.   But as my colleagues, I have no one else to comment on the bill. I am  ready to have the amendment considered, and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
