 Madam Speaker, once again, Members returned to  Washington this week. And, once again, important bipartisan work on  issues like lowering prescription drug prices, encouraging rural  broadband build-out, passing the USMCA trade bill, and improving  America's aging infrastructure has stalled because of the very partisan  efforts to impeach President Trump.   This week, the Democratic majority will hold more secret meetings in  the Capitol basement, release more selective, cherry-picked leaks  designed to confuse the American people, and continue their guilty- until-proven-innocent sham to impeach the President.   They have been plotting this since he was walking down Pennsylvania  Avenue on January 20, 2017, and probably even before that. But, the  Russian collusion hoax failed miserably, and the Robert Mueller  testimony gave them nothing. So, now, they are on to plan B.   They say they have the evidence to impeach, but we have already heard  that song. Democratic leaders have claimed to have evidence before.  Let's see if they can actually produce their evidence this time.   Let's get on with working for the American people.                            ____________________
