 Mr. President, I will be very brief, just to respond to my  good friend from Arizona who said that the Senate not taking up Pompeo  would be contradicting the will of the people. That is not the case at  all. This is about whether the Senate is going to be a rubberstamp and  whether the Senate is in effect going to abdicate its responsibility to  do oversight.   Let me just mention four points real quickly.   No. 1, this nomination has not been considered in the Intelligence  Committee. It could have been. It was not.  [[Page S351]]  No. 2, we have not been able to get answers to our questions. A major  question in particular, this body voted to sideline a law that  collected phone records on law-abiding Americans. Congressman Pompeo  has proposed something that makes the law we sidelined look like small  potatoes. He is talking about collecting lifestyle information on all  Americans. We are trying to get an answer about whether there are any  legal boundaries at all. We have not been able to get them. That is  argument No. 2.   Argument No. 3 is that we have never confirmed on inauguration day a  CIA Director. That is the history of this particular nomination. No. 4,  I want to talk about the realities of national security because I share  the view of the chairman of the committee that this is a dangerous  time. That is not up for debate. There are lots of people out there who  do not wish our country well. If we were to have a tragedy tonight or  tomorrow--heaven forbid that happens to our great country--if it did,  we would have the talented senior people at the CIA there to protect  our country, and I would submit, however you feel about Mr. Pompeo, the  reality is that if he got confirmed tonight or tomorrow, and heaven  forbid there was that tragedy, we would still be relying on those  trained, talented professionals at the CIA who have been there, in some  cases for decades, to protect our country when we are vulnerable.   That is what this is all about, ensuring that we actually have some  discussion here when there are outstanding questions. Senator Leahy,  Senator Blumenthal, and I have all said we just believe there ought to  be some debate. There hasn't been any in the Intelligence Committee.  There hasn't been any on the floor. I have gone through the history of  this nomination and explained what would happen if a tragedy were to  befall our great country. That is why I think we ought to have a debate  in broad daylight, not when Senators are trying to figure out if their  tux is going to fit and we can't get people into a real discussion.    I object, Madam President.    Reserving the right to object.    Madam President, this would ensure that there would be a  debate about the CIA and its future Director in the light of day. I am  not going to object, and I withdraw my reservation.
