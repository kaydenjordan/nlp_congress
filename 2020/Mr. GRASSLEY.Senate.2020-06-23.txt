 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1  minute in morning business.    Madam President, we are taking a very important vote  tomorrow on a bill called the JUSTICE Act. I am proud to cosponsor this  police reform bill, and I also applaud Senator Tim Scott for his  leadership in improving police accountability while at the same time  preserving the essential service that law enforcement provides. These  are the people who maintain the peace in the respective communities  around the United States.   We are ready to work with Democrats on police reform. I hope the  Democrats finally are willing to come to the table.   A successful vote to proceed to the JUSTICE Act speaks volumes. A  vote against proceeding shows the American people that politics are  more important than people, talking points more important than change,  and gridlock more important than solutions.   Surely, Democrats want police reform. I hope Democrats will vote in  favor of opening debate on the JUSTICE Act. George Floyd and countless  others so murdered deserve the Senate's action and consideration of  this bill.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
