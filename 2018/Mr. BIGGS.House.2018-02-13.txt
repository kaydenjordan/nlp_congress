 Mr. Speaker, tonight, I recognize the incredible expansion  of Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport.   After originally serving as an Air Force base for over 50 years, and  closed due to the BRAC process, Gateway reopened in 1994 and now  provides commercial airline service to more than 35 destinations. This  airport is a significant economic asset to Arizona's economy,  contributing $1.3 billion every year.   Each month, Gateway sets new records. Last year, the airport saw a 9  percent increase in passenger traffic, making 2017 the second busiest  year in the airport's history. I fully expect Gateway to shatter  expectations in 2018.   The construction of SkyBridge Arizona will help facilitate trade  between the United States and Mexico. We anticipate this project will  create thousands of jobs and unleash millions of dollars for our  economy.   I thank the board of directors, staff, employees, and East Valley  residents who are committed to Gateway Airport's success. Gateway  Airport would not be the pride of the East Valley without their  dedication.                            ____________________
