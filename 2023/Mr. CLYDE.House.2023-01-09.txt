 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Last week I was part of the 20 conservative Members who fought for a  significant institutional change in order to restore the people's voice  in the people's House.   Of the many victories we secured for the American people, the Thomas  Jefferson motion to vacate the Chair is the most important to me, as it  holds the Speaker accountable to the people.   This Jeffersonian motion stood strong for more than 200 years before  then-Speaker Pelosi removed it in 2018, consolidating power in the  hands of a select few in leadership.   By restoring this historic rule, every solitary Member has the  authority to hold the Speaker accountable for following all of the  rules, including passing single-subject bills, allowing Members at  least 72 hours to read the legislation before voting on it, and  reinstating the Holman rule which allows amendments to decrease funding  for certain government programs all the way down to the individual job  description.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my Republican colleagues and Speaker McCarthy  for working in good faith to produce and pass a rules package that  ensures this body is working for the people and not for itself. I  encourage every Member to vote for it. Fixing a broken Washington,  D.C., is a major win for every citizen.                                time  1800
