 Madam Speaker, I rise today to condemn the xenophobic  anti-Asian rhetoric that President Trump and his allies have been using  to distract us from their woefully inadequate response to COVID-19.   By referring to COVID-19 almost exclusively as the ``China virus,''  the President is fueling racism and inspiring violent attacks on Asian  Americans and Asian immigrants. Rather than condemning this divisive  language and unifying our Nation in response to the pandemic, my  Republican colleagues are blindly following suit.   This partisanship is so pervasive that Congresswoman Meng's simple  resolution condemning this anti-Asian sentiment could not be passed  unanimously out of this Chamber. This is a disgrace. A disgrace.   The COVID-19 pandemic has become a defining moment in our Nation's  history. Instead of unifying to confront this disease head-on,  Republicans have instead weaponized this to revive the racist blemishes  of the past.   Madam Speaker, I urge passage of this resolution.
