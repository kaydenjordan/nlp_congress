 Mr. President, with the passing of Willie K,  Hawaii has lost a music legend. Through his raw talent and unmatched  musicianship, Willie K blazed a trail that redefined music in Hawaii  and across the country.   Born William Kahaialii--and known affectionately as ``Uncle Willie''  throughout our State--Willie K wouldn't be tied down to any single  genre or instrument. Instead, he did it all. Willie could play or sing  almost anything.   Willie's love for music came from his family. Raised in a family of  musicians in Lahaina, Willie started performing at just 8 years old.  Taught by his father and renowned guitarist, Manu  [[Page S2584]]  Kahaiali`i, Willie mastered the blues at a young age. He became a  virtuoso instrumentalist--learning how to play every instrument that  might be needed in a show from a guitar to a bass to a ukulele. And his  voice was one of a kind. No style was off limits, even opera. He was  able to effortlessly bridge blues and Hawaiian, local and mainstream,  music and culture.   Over the course of his career, Willie recorded numerous albums and  performed with icons like Prince, Steven Tyler, Willie Nelson, and  Santana. Always humble, he described himself as ``a working  musician''--despite earning 19 Na Hoku Hanohano awards, a Hawaii  Academy of Recording Arts Lifetime Achievement Award, and a Grammy  nomination.   Willie devoted his life to music and understood its power. He went to  great lengths to help other local artists in Hawaii succeed and  organized his BBQ Bluesfest annually. Even after he began to feel the  effects of his illness, he continued to share his music.   Willie showed us all so many things. He was talented, energetic,  passionate, and authentic. But what really separated him from the rest  was his unrelenting zest for life and aloha spirit.   My thoughts and deepest sympathies are with his ohana and all those  who loved him. He will be well remembered and greatly missed.   May his memory be a blessing. May his music live on.                            ____________________
