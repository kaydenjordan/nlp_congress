 Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman Takano for  yielding.   As chair of the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs' Subcommittee on  Economic Opportunity, and as a Representative for tens of thousands of  veterans around Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton, I strongly believe  that we have got to do more to support those who have served our  country. We can't allow men and women who have served to fall into  homelessness, end up without a job, or go without the basic services  that they deserve.   Today, we are taking a significant step in making sure veterans are  no  [[Page H4762]]  longer left behind. I am so proud to lead the DELIVER Act, a robust,  action-forward package to help get our veterans back on their feet. The  legislation includes six of my bipartisan bills to help get veterans  the housing and employment opportunities they deserve.   It includes the Homeless Veteran Coronavirus Response Act, a bill I  introduced with my friend, Representative Gus Bilirakis--I don't see  Gus here, but I am grateful to him--to expand and strengthen VA  services to homeless veterans during the COVID-19 pandemic.   It includes the Veteran HOUSE Act, a bill I co-led with my friend  Representative Scott Peters, also from San Diego, to expand the HUD- VASH program to homeless veterans discharged under conditions other  than honorable.    It includes the Reducing Veteran Homelessness Act, a bill I  introduced with Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy to ensure that  homeless veterans and their families receive the resources and services  they deserve by filling gaps in the HUD-VASH case management system.   It includes the Housing for Women Veterans Act, a bill I introduced  with Representative Fitzpatrick to require the VA to complete an  analysis of its programs that provide assistance to women veterans who  are homeless to identify the areas in which such programs are failing  to meet their needs.   It includes the Veterans Economic Recovery Act, a bill I introduced  with Ranking Member Roe.   And we are all going to miss Dr. Roe. We are grateful for all that he  does.   That bill will, as Dr. Roe just said, create a rapid retraining  program for unemployed veterans and reservists.   And it includes the Chief Petty Officer William ``Bill'' Mulder  Transition Improvement Act, a bill I introduced with my friend  Representative Arrington to make the transition process easier for  servicemembers returning to civilian life.   I have said it before, and I will say it again: Even one homeless  veteran is one too many.                                time  1330    We have a moral obligation to make robust Federal investments in  programs to help get veterans off the street, and we have got to do a  better job of ensuring that our Nation's heroes have the housing  assistance and services they need. Each of the bills that we have  talked about today will make a real difference for the veterans I serve  and countless others across the country.   You hear a lot about how things in Washington are broken and how we  can't get a lot done around here, but I am very proud of the bipartisan  progress we have made today for our veterans. I am hopeful the Senate  will take the bill up quickly and get it on the President's desk.   I am just so grateful to everybody that has been involved, both the  Members and their staff. It was really a wonderful, bipartisan,  bicameral effort.   I reserve the balance of my time.
