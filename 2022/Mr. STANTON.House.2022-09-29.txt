 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding me the  time.   Today, I rise in support of H.R. 3843, the Merger Filing Fee  Modernization Act of 2022.   This bipartisan legislation will strengthen antitrust enforcement and  better protect U.S. consumers, workers, and businesses. I support the  full slate of bills in this package, and I am pleased that it includes  legislation that I introduced with the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr.  Fitzgerald).   Our bill, the Foreign Merger Subsidy Disclosure Act, will create a  more transparent picture for our antitrust enforcers by requiring  merging companies to disclose foreign government subsidies. We know  that China continues to use state-owned entities to acquire our  emerging technologies and intellectual property in an attempt to  surpass and suppress United States companies.   Our bill provides an important guardrail so that China and other  government-backed competitors can't discreetly buy up U.S. companies,  unduly influence our free market economy, steal intellectual property,  and stifle competition.   Our bill will ensure that these investments are not undermined. This  is good, commonsense policy. It is a step in the right direction.   Mr. Speaker, I intend to vote ``yes'' on this package, and I urge my  colleagues to do the same.
