 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R.  1, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.   Mr. Speaker, as a CPA and a member of the House Ways and Means  Committee, reforming our Tax Code has been a priority of mine during my  entire service here in Congress.   Our current Tax Code is broken, and I have heard from thousands of  Kansans in my district who are frustrated with the status quo.   This legislation will not only reform our broken Tax Code, but it  will permanently lower rates for hardworking individuals, families, and  businesses while retaining or expanding many popular provisions, such  as the dependent care assistance program. It also includes strong  safeguards that keep the wealthy from gaming the system in an effort to  pay less than their fair share.   On average, this legislation will help provide tax relief for all  income groups across the board. If you don't believe me, read the  analysis from the Tax Foundation and the Joint Committee on Taxation.  They agree.   While individuals and families receive a much-needed tax break, they  will also notice that their wages are going up and more jobs are being  created.   Just the other day, AT&T announced they will be making a substantial  investment in the United States once we enact tax reform.   Folks are tired of the status quo. They are tired of a Tax Code that  is confusing. Once figured out, you realize that it actually penalizes  hard work and success.   The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act accomplishes our goals of ensuring that  rates are cut for low- and middle-income Americans, simplifying the tax  system and expanding American competition within the global economy.   This is a rare opportunity to enact the kind of legislation that our  constituents need and deserve to grow the economy and put more money in  the pockets of hardworking Kansans.   Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman and the entire committee for their  good work on this important legislation.
