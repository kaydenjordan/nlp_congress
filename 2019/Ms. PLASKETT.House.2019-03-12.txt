 Madam Speaker, I rise to highlight the budget proposed  by the President of the United States.   A budget is a statement of our values as a Nation--a moral document-- what we prioritize and what we hope to accomplish. The President  released his budget proposal yesterday and, while I  [[Page H2657]]  cannot say I am surprised, President Trump's budget, once again, shows  his disregard for the values of the health and well-being of families  across America.   Just 3 months after signing the farm bill, President Trump proposes a  14.8 percent cut to USDA's--agriculture's--annual budget. This would  hinder the Department's ability to implement the bipartisan farm bill  Congress just passed overwhelmingly.   With sharp cuts to the Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education  Program and elimination of the Value Added Producer Grants, these cuts  will hurt farmers in the Virgin Islands, as well as other places in our  country.   Far from building a stronger Nation, the President's budget would  devastate the pillars of economic security for farmers, seniors, and  families across America. I wholeheartedly reject this destructive  budget request.                            ____________________
