 Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of the citizens of  the First Congressional District of Virginia to say that America's  glass is still half full.   While we face this unprecedented challenge, we see across our Nation  the resolve and the spirit of America. It is alive and well.  [[Page H1845]]    This is a challenge for us here in Congress to show the same spirit  and resolve, to get the job done for the American people. While this  bill is far from perfect, it will demonstrate that we can come together  and show what we have seen in the days past of what is going on across  America.   America's best days are still to come, and we continue to be the  greatest Nation the world has ever known. May God continue to bless our  great United States of America.
