 Madam Speaker, on January 6 we witnessed a violent coup  attempt in our Capitol fueled by the big lie.   Our country continues to face a slow-moving coup in the form of voter  suppression.   I have seen firsthand in my home State of Arizona voter suppression  laws targeting people of color and a State senate that would rather  waste taxpayer money on a sham audit instead of upholding our sacred  democratic right to vote.   The Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis Act is critical to protecting the  vote in my State and States across the country where restrictive laws  are being put into place to strip people of their right to vote.  Arizona will stand strong together this weekend. Thousands will gather  this Saturday in Phoenix for democracy and voting rights.   Passing this bill today answers their call by guaranteeing access to  democracy for every Arizonan.   Today the House showed where it stands. We won't shrink from  protecting our democracy and the voting rights of all Americans. It is  past time for the U.S. Senate and Senator Sinema to do the same.                            ____________________
