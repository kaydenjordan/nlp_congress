 Madam Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the majority  party's attempts to take away Americans' Second Amendment rights.   The legislation before the House this week is a constitutional  overreach that would limit the rights of law-abiding citizens and does  not address the serious issue of illegal gun transfers.   Madam Speaker, criminals do not follow the law. According to the  Department of Justice, 77 percent of State prison inmates convicted of  a firearm crime either obtain their firearm through theft, off the  black market, from a drug dealer, or on the street.  [[Page H2295]]    This legislation would make criminals out of law-abiding citizens,  instead, and infringe upon Second Amendment gun rights. I urge my  colleagues to protect the constitutional right of the American people  to keep and bear arms.                            ____________________
