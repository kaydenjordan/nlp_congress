 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, this week is the week that we honor  veterans, on what we call Veterans Day, so in honor of Veterans Day, I  would like to spotlight one Iowa community's exemplary support of our  veterans and Active-Duty military.   This is a town of 2,000--Britt, IA--in North Central Iowa. This year,  Britt's Dean Welsh VFW Auxiliary Post 4370 received the Veterans and  Family Support Award. This annual award from the national VFW  recognizes select local auxiliaries for their exceptional work for our  servicemembers.   This community's now-far-reaching efforts started with a phone call.  A volunteer with the Britt VFW auxiliary was talking to her  granddaughter, who was serving on the USS Oscar Austin. She mentioned  that some of her fellow crew members hadn't received care packages.  Within 1 week, Britt residents shipped 39 packages to that crew of the  USS Oscar Austin.   That was 11 years ago. Now, a decade later, the Britt VFW is sending  care packages to crew members on the USS Fitzgerald, USS John McCain,  USS Chafee, and Iowa National Guard units deployed to Kuwait and to  Poland. They are also preparing to send packages to the USS Carl  Vinson. Volunteers fill these packages with various items, including  beaded American flag key chains that they make by hand. Britt VFW  members gift thousands of their key chains to veterans they cross paths  with throughout the year, whether at community events or even in their  daily lives.   Britt VFW's example should be a reminder to all of us of the  importance of honoring our veterans and servicemembers, and we will be  doing that this weekend.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, throughout my years of public service,  I have had the honor to meet citizens from all walks of life across my  home State. As Iowa's senior U.S. Senator, today I pay tribute to a  dynamic civic and business leader who passed away earlier this year.   Donna Lee Nelson was an indomitable pillar in her community who  leaves behind a legacy of leadership, service, and entrepreneurial  spirit for which the city of Waterloo and the Cedar Valley will benefit  for generations to come. She also was the family matriarch, lovingly  recalled as a ``force of nature,'' and her long list of achievements  and traveling adventures will be fondly remembered by her family and  friends for years to come.   Donna and her husband Verner D. Nelson, Sr., celebrated their 70th  wedding anniversary in January. That was a remarkable milestone and  testimony to their faith-filled partnership. They were high school  sweethearts who together launched a business enterprise that started  with insurance and ventured into many others, including construction,  trucking, and real estate.   Looking back at her 89 years of life, Donna certainly didn't let any  grass grow beneath her feet. She traveled all over the world but never  lost sight of home. The city of Waterloo benefited from what you might  call her Midas Touch with her tireless, decades-long efforts to  preserve the vitality, culture, heritage and history of downtown,  including the Black's Building and the old YMCA.   Her selfless approach to leadership and ability to mobilize others  carried  [[Page S5357]]  over from business and industry to philanthropy, as well. Donna was  recognized by more than 20 achievement awards, including being named  Citizen of the Year in 1985 and Eight over Eighty in 2015. Donna  chaired and served on numerous boards, from the United Way to the  American Heart Association and the Salvation Army.   Barbara and I extend our condolences to Donna's family and friends,  particularly to her beloved husband Vern. We were blessed by her  friendship and thank the Nelson family for their support over many  years.                            ____________________
