 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Democrats' power has literally gone to their heads. They aren't  satisfied enough to have the majority and the speakership, so now they  want to silence opposing viewpoints altogether.   They are undoing minority rights that have been a part of Congress  for over 100 years by taking away debate on the motion to recommit,  something that, while in the minority, now-Speaker Pelosi actually  equated to free speech. Obviously, now that she is in power, she wants  to take away that freedom of speech from us.   And when you think things can't get more radical around here, they  do. Now the Democrats' rules package takes out words like ``mother''  and ``father'' and ``brother'' and ``sister.'' In their quest to not  offend anyone, they are offending almost all of America.   If we are going to go down this path, I have some suggestions to be  added to this rules package. How about we add: Members who have a  relationship with a Chinese spy should be removed from the Intelligence  Committee. How about: Members should be punished if they leak  classified information and private information after they leave the  SCIF. How about: Members should be disciplined if they spread around  false Russian collusion information.   Of course, my Democrat colleagues would never dream of adding that.   Madam Speaker, I adamantly oppose this rules package.                                time  1300
