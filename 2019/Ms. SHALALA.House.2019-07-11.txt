 Mr. Chair, I rise in strong support of the Torres  amendment, No. 658, which recognizes the lifesaving work performed by  our Nation's 911 call takers and dispatchers.   Mr. Chairman, all of the emergency activities in my own district--the  police, the fire, the emergency responders--strongly support this  amendment, and so I want to stand with my colleagues on both sides of  the aisle simply stating these professionals save lives. And more than  giving 911 call takers and dispatchers the recognition they deserve, it  would make the standard occupational classification system more  accurate and, therefore, more useful as a statistical resource.   I urge a ``yes'' vote, and I thank the gentleman for yielding me the  time.
