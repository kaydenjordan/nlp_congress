 Mr. President, today I wish to recognize and pay  tribute to United States Army 1LT Kate M. Kientz, a proud Oklahoman who  is currently serving her country in Kosovo. I had the pleasure of  meeting and speaking with Lieutenant Kientz back in February during a  congressional delegation trip to the region, and I was proud to see a  strong Oklahoman such as herself representing our State and our country  so well. I would like to express my sincere thanks for the excellent  work of Lieutenant Kientz in advancing the mission in Europe. Her  dedication to duty is instrumental to prepare ready forces, ensure  strategic access, deter conflict, enable the NATO alliance, strengthen  partnerships, and counter transnational threats in order to protect and  defend the United States.   Lieutenant Kientz was raised in my home city of Tulsa, OK, and  attended Bishop Kelley High School. She continued her education at the  University of Oklahoma and graduated in 2017 with a degree in political  science and letters. Following graduation, she interned at the Oklahoma  House of Representatives and participated in Reserve Officers' Training  Corps exchanges in Beijing and Slovakia. These experiences were the  foundation of a strong background that prepared her for a successful  career in military intelligence.   As of January 2018, Lieutenant Kientz has been the chemical officer  and S4 in charge of logistics in the 1st Squadron, 89th Cavalry  Regiment. She arrived in Kosovo in October of 2018 and plans to then  finish her time as a lieutenant at Fort Drum before transitioning into  military intelligence.   Meeting Lieutenant Kientz in Kosovo had an impact on me and reassured  me that the next generation is in great hands with leaders such as  herself. On behalf of Congress and the United States of America, I  thank 1LT Kate M. Kientz and her family for their commitment,  sacrifice, and contribution to our great Nation. I join my colleagues  in wishing her future success in all aspects of life as she continues  to serve as a role model for service, sacrifice, and  leadership.                            ____________________
