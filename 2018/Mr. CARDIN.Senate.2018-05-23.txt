 Mr. President, I rise today to mourn the loss of Amy S.  Caprio of the Baltimore County Police Department, who was 29 years old.  Sadly, Ms. Caprio is the first female police officer to be killed in  the line of duty in the history of the Baltimore County Police  Department and the 10th officer killed in the history of the  department.   As a longtime resident of Baltimore County and as the Senator from  Maryland, I want to express my profound sadness and condolences to the  family and friends of Ms. Caprio, especially her husband Tim.   Officer Caprio was killed on Monday after responding to a call about  a suspicious vehicle and potentially a burglary in progress in the  Perry Hall region. According to police reports, Officer Caprio had  ordered suspects to leave the car when she was deliberately run over by  a suspect. It is unclear whether a firearm was discharged, and police  are reviewing the footage from her body camera before she was killed.   The Baltimore County police now report that they have several  suspects in custody, including juveniles who have been arrested and  charged as adults with first-degree murder.   A resident of the neighborhood told the Baltimore Sun that his son  saw the officer struck by a vehicle. Tony Kurek, 54, had just walked  into the door of his home when his son, Dakota, shouted to him: ``Dad,  Dad, a cop just got run over out front,'' the father recalled his son  saying. The officer was lying in front of his house, he said. Dakota  told his father he had seen the officer draw her gun on a black Jeep  Wrangler and order the people inside to get out. Instead, the driver  sped forward, ramming the officer with the vehicle. She landed about 20  feet away. ``She basically landed almost in front of my mailbox,''  Kurek said.   Let me thank the Kurek family, as well as the EMS and MedStar  Franklin Square Medical Center staff, who rushed to try to save Officer  Caprio's life. I know this event has shaken the Perry Hall community,  as well as residents who were asked to shelter in place, and several  local elementary schools were placed on lockdown during the police  search for the suspects. I am hopeful that the Blue Alert System in use  helped to quickly catch the suspects in this case.   As we learn more about Officer Caprio's life, we grieve for her loss.  According to a story in the Baltimore Sun, she served just shy of 4  years with the Baltimore County Police Department, but she had already  proven herself to be a dedicated officer. She was credited with  bringing down a pair of alleged package thiefs, closing dozens of cases  reported around the county at the end of last year. Because of her  efforts, the department was able to recover a cache of stolen property.   The department officials stated:         She didn't realize she was embarking on what would become a       considerable investigation into holiday package thefts around       the eastern portion of Baltimore County. This involved       numerous cases being independently investigated by       officers in multiple precincts, and would eventually       result in the identification and arrest of two suspects,       leading to the return of a very sentimental gift.    Officer Caprio had pieced together evidence from security cameras,  interviewed witnesses, tracked a vehicle, and compared notes with other  officers who were investigating package thefts in the area. She ended  up linking two suspects to dozens of stolen package cases in the  Parkville, White Marsh, Dundalk, Towson, Cockeysville, and Essex  precincts. When officers found the suspects' hotel room, it was filled  with stolen goods, including a brightly colored handmade quilt with a  heartfelt inscription that a woman had shipped to her granddaughter.  This quilt was eventually returned to the family.   Closing the case earned her praise across the nearly 2,000-member  department, and she was named the Parkville precinct's officer of the  month in March.   Police Chief Terrence Sheridan said:         Officer Caprio was the type of officer that you'd want to       hire. She was the kind of officer that was going to go up in       this organization.    Officer Caprio had graduated from Towson University in 2010 and was a  2006 graduate of Loch Raven High School. She joined the county police  department in July 2014. She graduated with the department's 140th  recruit class in December 2014 and was initially assigned to the Essex  precinct.   The men and women of law enforcement put their lives on the line  every day and run towards danger, not away from it. Family members  always worry about being reunited with their spouses, parents, and  family members at the end of the day.   Last week, I held a delegation meeting in the Capitol with our  Federal law enforcement officials from Maryland. I thanked them for  their service and told them I would fight for the resources they need  to combat crime and provide the best possible equipment and training  for their agents. This includes providing full funding for the COPS and  Byrne JAG Programs, which are absolutely critical to our Federal,  State, and local law enforcement partnerships. Teamwork is critical,  particularly when we are combating crime across jurisdictional  boundaries.   Last week was National Police Week. It is when we pause to recognize  and remember those law enforcement and emergency services officers in  Maryland who have paid the ultimate price and have made the ultimate  sacrifice. Each spring, law enforcement takes a rollcall to solemnly  mark the ``end of watch'' for the fallen law enforcement officers.  Their names are then added to the National Law Enforcement Officers  Memorial in Judiciary Square, close to  [[Page S2887]]  Capitol Hill. Carved on the memorial's walls are the names of more than  21,000 officers who have been killed in the line of duty throughout  U.S. history.   Let me share with my colleagues the other law enforcement officers  who were killed this past year in Maryland in addition to Officer  Caprio.   Sean Matthew Suiter, a detective in the Baltimore City Police  Department, was shot on November 15, 2017, while attempting to  interview a suspect during a homicide investigation.   Sander Benjamin Cohen, a deputy chief in the Maryland Office of the  State Fire Marshal, was killed in a traffic accident on December 8,  2017, as he attempted to assist a law enforcement officer whose car was  disabled on I-270. FBI Supervisory Special Agent Carlos Wolff was also  killed.   This year, on February 21, 2018, Corporal Mujahid Ramzziddin, a  corporal in the Prince George's County Police Department, in Maryland,  was killed while he was off duty and assisting a woman who was involved  in a domestic dispute.   Once again, I ask my colleagues in the Senate to keep Officer  Caprio's family and colleagues in their thoughts and prayers today. We  thank our law enforcement officers and all first responders who run  towards danger instead of away from it. Congress should make sure that  our officers have all of the tools and resources they need to  effectively carry out their mission to protect and serve their  communities and bring offenders to justice.   I thank my colleagues.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
