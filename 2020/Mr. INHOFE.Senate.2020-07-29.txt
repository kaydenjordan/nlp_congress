 Mr. President, today I honor a superb leader, liaison,  and warrior. After 3 years of service as director of the Navy Senate  Liaison Office, RDML Scott Sciretta recently promoted from captain to  rear admiral, lower half. On this occasion, I believe it is fitting to  recognize Rear Admiral Sciretta's distinguished service and dedication  to fostering the relationship between the U.S. Navy and this Chamber.   Rear Admiral Sciretta is a 1992 graduate of the Pennsylvania State  University. A surface warfare officer by designation, Rear Admiral  Sciretta has led our Nation's young men and women on shore and at sea,  most prominently in command of USS Jason Dunham, USS Cowpens, and USS  Lake Erie. The Navy has consistently relied upon Rear Admiral Sciretta  for his exceptional leadership and unparalleled work ethic.   Rear Admiral Sciretta has excelled in numerous other leadership  positions in the Navy, most recently as the director, Navy Senate  Liaison. In the Russell Senate Office Building and around the globe,  Rear Admiral Sciretta filled the role that was initially created and  held by Senator John McCain after his return from Vietnam as a Navy  captain. Decades later, Rear Admiral Sciretta had the job of  coordinating a weeklong series of logistical movements around the  country that enabled present and former Members of both Chambers to  honor a late colleague and dear friend.   Over the course of the last few years, Rear Admiral Sciretta led 45  congressional delegations to 35 different countries. He escorted over  half of the Members of this Chamber on travel and became a trusted  adviser and friend to many of us. I have had the pleasure of traveling  with Rear Admiral Sciretta on a number of trips. He distinguished  himself by going above and beyond the call pf duty to facilitate and  successfully execute each and every trip, despite any number of  weather, aircraft, and diplomatic complications.   Recently, Rear Admiral Sciretta departed Washington for Key West, FL,  to serve as the deputy director of Joint Interagency Task Force South  and lead operations to combat illicit trafficking. This Chamber will  feel Rear Admiral Sciretta's absence. I join many past and present  Members of Congress in my gratitude and appreciation to Rear Admiral  Sciretta for his outstanding leadership and unwavering support of the  missions of the U.S. Navy. I especially recognize his patient and  supportive family, Mrs. Sharon Diane Sciretta, Navy Lieutenant James  Francis Sciretta and his wife, Ms. Delma Eylin Sciretta, and Navy  Midshipman Adam Joseph Sciretta. I wish this Navy family ``fair winds  and following seas.''                            ____________________
