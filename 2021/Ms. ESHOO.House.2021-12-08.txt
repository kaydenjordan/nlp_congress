 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in the strongest support of this  legislation, Accelerating Access to Critical Therapies for ALS. It is  called the ACT for ALS.   As chairwoman of the Health Subcommittee, I am so proud to have  advanced this legislation which enjoys 331 bipartisan cosponsors, more  than any other bill pending in the House. This legislation establishes  grant programs to advance treatments for neurodegenerative diseases  like ALS, allowing more patients to receive critical medicines through  compassionate care programs.   Jamie Berry, one of my constituents, wrote a poignant letter to me,  and said the following: ``With ALS, a piece of you dies every day. We  are simply asking for a fighting chance to live the lives we were meant  to live.'' As we gather here to pass this bill, Jamie is a patient in  the neuro ICU unit at Stanford University Hospital.   Jamie, if you are listening, stay tuned, because your wish is going  to come true today. To you, Jamie, and all your fellow ALS patients, I  am proud that the United States House of Representatives will vote for  this legislation to support your fighting chance against this deadly  disease.   This is a transformational bill to make sure that people with ALS are  given treatment options, and something they all deserve--it is spelled  H-O-P-E, hope.   I salute Representatives Quigley and Fortenberry, for the phenomenal  job they have done on this legislation, both in introducing it and  building it up to be the most cosponsored legislation in the House.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support the bill, ACT for  ALS.
