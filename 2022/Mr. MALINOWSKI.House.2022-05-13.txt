 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Cantor Martha  Novick, who for the last 36 years has filled Temple Emanu-El, in  Westfield, New Jersey, with her warmth and her voice.   Over the years, she has brought hundreds of students to Washington,  D.C., to introduce them to social justice, advocacy, and action.   She has performed leading roles for the Metropolitan Opera  Association and the National Shakespeare Theatre and has appeared as a  soloist with the Jerusalem Symphony, the Brooklyn Philharmonic, and the  Westfield Symphony.   Cantor Novick is a performer and an innovator, creating the Shabbat  Hallelu worship service, which has become a national model, and working  tirelessly to find a balance between traditional and modern musical  styles of worship.   We are grateful to Cantor Novick for all she has done and for her  commitment to Temple Emanu-El and its greater community in her new role  as Cantor Emeritus.                            ____________________
