 Madam Speaker, I rise today to say thank you. Thank you  to a chief of staff, a colleague, a confidante, and a special friend.   Jon DeWitte has been my chief of staff for 11\1/2\ years. In fact,  when I was elected in 2010, Jon was the first call that I made. He was  my first hire, and we have been on this journey together the entire  time.   Now, Jon has had a great track record here in Washington, D.C., as  well. He worked for the Education and Workforce Committee. He then went  on to work with former Congressman Dave Camp. Then when I left the  position of district director from my predecessor, Peter Hoekstra, Jon  came and filled that role and filled that position for 8 years until I  got elected, when I asked him to come back to Washington and act as my  chief of staff.   Well, Jon--two redistrictings, majority, minority, government  shutdown, impeachments, war, peace--we have seen just about all of it  and have lived that textbook of political science. I couldn't have done  it without him, and I know he could not have done this without his  family.   I want to say a special thank you, as well, to Jodi, Nathan, Katie,  and Josh for the sacrifices that they made--the sacrifices that they  have made--for late nights and early mornings, for travel, for all the  different things that go into being an excellent chief of staff. He has  been one.   Now, I know that there are great paths ahead for Jon, and great paths  ahead for all of you, but I do know that our friendship will not end.  Team Huizenga is always Team Huizenga, and Jon is a vital part of that.   So once again, I thank Jon for his service, not only to me, but more  importantly, to the constituents of the Second Congressional District  back in Michigan and service to his country.   A job well done and I thank him.                            ____________________
