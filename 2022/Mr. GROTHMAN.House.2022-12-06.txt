 Mr. Speaker, I would like to address the problems in  China, the protests in China, and the degree to which perhaps the  largest American corporation, Apple corporation, out of sheer greed, is  weighing in and preventing protesters from communicating with each  other.   Their CEO, Tim Cook, who is making over $90 million a year, is right  now preventing AirDrops from being made between different protesters.  Without communicating with each other, those protests will not succeed.   China right now has one of the most repressive regimes in the world,  atheistic totalitarianism. It has been the greatest threat to freedom  in this country for the last 100 years.   It is disappointing, though perhaps not surprising, that American  corporations, the wealthiest country in the world, cannot resist  shutting down free speech in China to make a few more dollars.   Mr. Speaker, I urge Congress to act and do something with these large  corporations that, in America as well, have a monopoly on free speech,  a monopoly on communication, and are using it to support atheistic  totalitarianism.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Lamborn for organizing this  little group of speeches.   As has been mentioned, the first National Bible Week was less than 2  weeks before Pearl Harbor in 1941. Why do we have a National Bible  Week? Because the Bible was the preeminent text of our forefathers when  they wrote our Constitution.   To leave you with a couple quotes, George Washington said: ``It is  impossible to govern the world without God and the Bible. Of all the  dispositions and habits which lead to political prosperity, our  religion and morality are indispensable supporters.''   John Jay, the first Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court: ``The  Bible is best of all books, for it is the word of God and teaches us  the way to be happy in this world and in the next. Continue therefore  to read it and regulate your life by its precepts.''   Clearly, if you want to understand the Constitution, you have to  understand the Bible. That is why John Adams said that the Constitution  is made only for a moral and religious people and totally unfit for any  other kind.   The most read book or most cited book, by our forefathers, in the Old  Testament was Deuteronomy. I have always felt the reason they quoted  Deuteronomy so much is they wanted America to be the type of country  that God had wanted Israel to be.   Deuteronomy ends with the death of Moses. As has been mentioned, in  the relief up here, the wisest man, or the man with the most important  position in this room, is Moses, which shows that Congress, even at the  time we built this Capitol, talked about the importance of the Bible in  understanding what behavior should be and in understanding what our  Constitution has made a reference to.   In any event, I thank Congressman Lamborn one more time for putting  together this ceremony and encourage, particularly all of the young  people out there, to read the Bible so you understand the basis of our  country.
