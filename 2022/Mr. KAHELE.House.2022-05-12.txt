 Mr. Speaker, today, just like I did 1 year ago to this  day, I rise with extraordinary pride to congratulate the 2022 NCAA  Men's Volleyball National Champions, the University of Hawaii Rainbow  Warriors.   This past Saturday our Hawaii Rainbows defended their title on the  legendary court of Pauley Pavilion against Long Beach State University.   Emulating their victory in 2021, they proved that lightning can  strike twice by sweeping their opponent in a decisive three-set match.  Our Warriors displayed acute focus, tenacity, and bold dominance,  boasting a 27-5 season record while remaining undefeated at home.   As a proud alumnus and former Rainbow Warrior volleyball player, I,  along with the rest of Hawaii, congratulate our back-to-back national  champions.   ``Thanks very much.'' ``Mahalo nui loa'' to head coach Charlie Wade,  the coaching staff, the UH athletics program, the Manoa Aunties, our  loyal boosters, and dedicated fans who support our players on and off  the court.   To our 2022 NCAA Men's Volleyball Championship Team, ``all the  best,'' ``no ka`oi,'' and Go `Bows!                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, mahalo, Congressman Palazzo for organizing  this Special Order to celebrate the achievements of the National Guard  across the Nation. I am proud to be co-leading the bipartisan National  Guard and Reserve Caucus with you this year.   I am here to recognize the Hawaii National Guard and highlight its  growing role in our Nation's competitiveness and strategic level of  defense priorities.   In my 21-year career of service to my State and Nation, I have seen  the Hawaii Air National Guard transform from a quiet, off-the-radar, C- 130, F-15, and KC-135 squadrons out in the Pacific to lethal and almost  full-time composite associate squadrons.  [[Page H4908]]    The Hawaii Air National Guard's 154th Wing and their flying squadrons  serve alongside Active Duty counterparts flying C-17s and F-22s, as  well as the KC-135, each and every day. There are Active Duty pilots  flying with Guard pilots, side-by-side, deploying overseas.   An important aspect of my job is to listen and hear from our men and  women in the National Guard. Many of my policy proposals are the result  of hearing directly from our guardsmen.   For example, members of the Guard contacted my office last year to  raise their concerns about the number of days a reservist can serve on  Active Duty.                                time  1730    As a result, my colleagues and I authored the ``1095 Rule'' Amendment  Act, legislation that increases the maximum number of days that  reservists can serve on Active Duty to maintain mission readiness. We  are pleased that this legislation was signed into law and took effect  last month. This is a huge victory for National Guardsmen across the  Nation and ensures the full capability of our most talented Reserve  component members without affecting end-strength limitations.   Now, I believe we can all agree that our success, the success of our  National Guard, is directly linked to the strength of our leadership.  The Hawaii National Guard is positioned as a key strategic defense  priority for our military in the Pacific, and for that I personally  thank the adjutant general of the Hawaii National Guard, Kenneth Hara,  for his direction in leading the Guard in Hawaii. General Hara has been  central to our State's early success with the COVID-19 pandemic. He and  his team have been pivotal to the coordinated effort between our  States, counties, and community organizations.   Finally, mahalo nui loa. I am grateful for the airmen and soldiers  for being the best and most diverse National Guard organization in the  Nation. The important work that each and every one of them does makes  our country strong. I also thank their families for their sacrifice and  enduring support of their important work. Their commitment and  participation to the Hawaii National Guard Association and National  Guard associations throughout the Nation is vital to its success and  advocacy in Washington. Mahalo nui loa. Onipaa mau loa.
