 Mr. Speaker, I rise this morning to recognize three  of my constituents who are all celebrating birthday 100 very, very  soon. Mrs. Cora Jones ``Boot'' McLeod, Mrs. Christine Johnson Umstead,  and Mrs. Annie Belle Gilmore Rogers are all members of historic Mount  Vernon Baptist Church located in Durham, North Carolina, pastored by my  friend Dr. Jerome J. Washington.   These centenarians, Mr. Speaker, will soon celebrate their birthdays,  surrounded by family and friends. These women have committed much of  their lives to the development of their family and community. They are  devout Christians of the missionary baptist faith who love their  church.   Mrs. Cora Jones Boot McLeod was born on August 8, 1918, in Raleigh,  North Carolina, and attended Rosenwald Schools. She started her own  business in Durham as a professional beautician. Mrs. McLeod has spent  all of her life encouraging her family and community to be independent  and faithful in their pursuits. Her leadership is reflected in the  business community and at her beloved Mount Vernon Baptist Church,  where she served as church usher.    Mrs. Christine Johnson Umstead was born on August 16, 1918, in  Roxboro, North Carolina, located in Person County, just north of  Durham. She came to Durham as a food service professional. In  retirement, she has encouraged others to become active senior citizens  by setting an example and providing motivation to all. Mrs. Umstead  joined Mount Vernon in 1948 and has remained an active church member.   Over the years, she has provided faithful leadership and fellowship  as a Christian missionary, a member of the senior citizens  organization, and the J.E. Best Bible Class.   Finally, yet importantly, is Mrs. Annie Belle Gilmore Rogers. Mrs.  Rogers was born on October 20, 1918, in Durham, and her ancestors were  founding members of Mount Vernon Baptist Church. Over the past 100  years, she has exemplified the value of faith, education, and  resourcefulness.   She attended what was then Hillside Park School, which we now know as  Hillside High School, in Durham. She went on to become a teacher's  assistant at C.C. Spaulding Elementary School, where she helped educate  young minds who would go on to become future leaders.   Mrs. Rogers recognized the value of managing her resources and  teaching her family to do the same. She was among the first members and  leaders of the Mount Vernon Baptist Church Credit Union, at a time when  African Americans had few opportunities for investing their limited  resources or borrowing money to develop individual wealth. The credit  union stands today as the last functioning church credit union in the  State, with members of Mrs. Rogers' family serving on its board.                                time  1015    Mr. Speaker, it is with great pride this morning that I speak these  words today from the floor of the House of Representatives. These three  strong and powerful African American women  [[Page H7161]]  have worked and labored to empower their families and Mount Vernon  Baptist Church into a spiritual force serving the Durham community.   I am grateful to these remarkable women for their love of humanity  and contributions to their community. I ask my colleagues to join me in  wishing these three great Americans our very best wishes as they each  celebrate 100 years of life.                            ____________________
