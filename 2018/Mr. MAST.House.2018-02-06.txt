 Mr. Speaker, I dedicate my time today to a man whom I am  honored to represent in Congress. His name is Mr. Thomas Corey, a  decorated Vietnam hero who proudly served our country as a combat  infantryman.   During the 1968 Tet Offensive, he received an enemy round in the neck  that struck his spinal cord, leaving him paralyzed, a quadriplegic for  life. But with true American grit, that did not stop him from  dedicating his life and his work to our veterans and to our country. He  was a tireless patient advocate, working on medical research and family  support for disabled veterans.   Mr. Corey returned to Vietnam 16 times, promoting reconciliation for  individual veterans, accounting for those missing in action, and to  study the health effects of Agent Orange. For these extraordinary  efforts, he was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. He was also the  first recipient of the Vietnam Veterans of America Commendation Medal,  their highest award for service.   Mr. Corey, your Nation is grateful to you. I am grateful for you.  America is proud and blessed to have men like you who never stop  fighting for this country on and off the battlefield. And, Mr. Corey, I  salute you.                            ____________________
