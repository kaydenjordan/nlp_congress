 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to celebrate a U.S. Army  veteran, a great Tennessean, teacher, and mentor to many.   Hugh Hix Stubblefield, also called Hix or Stub, passed away late last  year after a long life of inspiring others.   Professor Stubblefield discovered his passion for the classroom in  1951 as a student at Texas Tech University. From there, he became an  educator himself, teaching high school in Atlanta and Cincinnati.   He went on to earn a master's degree from George Peabody College and  the University of Missouri. And then in 1962, while reporting for the  local newspaper, he returned to Tennessee Tech to teach journalism  until he retired in 1999. I had the pleasure of being one of his many  students.   Another former student of his, Lindsay Pride, now the editor of the  Herald-Citizen in the local paper in Cookeville, wrote, ``Hugh didn't  lecture students, he shared stories.'' I agree.   His experiences gave students real-world examples of the do's and  don'ts of journalism, and those nuggets of wisdom could apply to any  field. His advice was just flat-out helpful for an undergraduate  student getting their start in life or a journalism student.   Perhaps one of the most important lessons he taught us was patience.  He emphasized that it is better to be accurate than first. He stressed  the importance of having multiple genuine sources. He spoke about the  consequences of lacking accuracy and objectivity.   We are living through many of those consequences right now as a  country. Now more than ever, we could all benefit from Professor  Stubblefield's Introduction to Journalism class.   He fostered discipline in his students, discipline that came in handy  in many professions and even everyday life, including independent  thought, double-checking facts, and fairness.   He showed a genuine interest in the long-term success of his students  and kept in touch with many of them as they maneuvered the professional  world. That kind of attentiveness had an impact on countless alumni,  including a writer for the Los Angeles Times, an editor for The New  York Times, a novelist, and, yes, at least one United States  Congressman.   Professor Stubblefield did more than teach. He served as adviser for  the university yearbook and student newspaper for decades. In fact, he  received several honors from the National Council on College  Publication Advisors over his career.   For years, Professor Stubblefield was an active member of the  community, serving on the Upper Cumberland chapter of the Tennessee  Trails Association. He was also very involved with Park View Friendship  United Methodist Church in Cookeville.   He leaves behind his wife of 63 years, Ann Elizabeth Blair  Stubblefield--also a teacher of mine--two children, Katie Elizabeth and  Jon David; a granddaughter, and several great-grandchildren.   I know his kindness will continue to live on in them and his many  former students.                         Tennessee Pilots Remembered     Mr. Speaker, for 136 years, the Tennessee National Guard  has stood ready to respond to any State or Federal mission. That takes  more than manpower or equipment. It takes training to ensure our  soldiers and airmen are truly prepared for any emergency scenario or  conflict. But even training comes with its share of hazards and  sacrifice.   Our hearts are still broken after two Tennessee Army National Guard  pilots lost their lives during some of that training in a helicopter  crash in Huntsville, Alabama, 12 days ago.   Chief Warrant Officers Daniel Wadham and Danny Randolph had nearly 30  years of combined public service. They left behind a grateful State and  Nation.   Mr. Speaker, I invite my House colleagues to join me in praying for  their families. Let us all do what we can to make sure their commitment  to freedom is never forgotten.
