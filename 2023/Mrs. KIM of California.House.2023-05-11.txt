 Mr. Speaker, as we celebrate Teacher  Appreciation Week, I rise to celebrate Michael Short on his retirement  after 44 years of inspiring students in music in Orange Unified School  District.   A Chapman University and Cal State Fullerton graduate, Mr. Short has  been involved in Orange Unified School District music since the mid- 1970s, from elementary and middle schools to Orange High School, to  Santiago Canyon College, and much more.   He has directed several musicals, led choirs, and received several  awards for his work as an outstanding music educator.   Mr. Short has inspired generations of students in California's 40th  District across Orange County and beyond.   I thank Mr. Short for his dedication and his outstanding career to  the community, teaching and inspiring students through music.   I wish him the best in his retirement, and much enjoyment spending  time with his family; his wife, Vicki, his kids, and his grandkids.                            ____________________
