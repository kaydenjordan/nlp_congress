 Mr. President, many of our veterans carry both  visible and invisible scars from their time in the military. This is  true for U.S. Army SPC Matt Brannon of Boaz. Matt vividly remembers, as  a young man, watching the events of 9/11 unfold. This inspired him to  join the military in 2007 after graduating from Boaz High School. Matt  was wounded in action by an RPG explosion, receiving wounds to his  face, arms, and hands. He continued to fight even after sustaining  injuries, saving the lives of many of his fellow soldiers. Matt was  awarded a Purple Heart for his heroic actions.   In 2012, he returned home to Boaz, where he began working with the  local police department. As Matt adjusted to living with his battle  scars, he found healing through the outdoors. He decided to use his  experience to help veterans like him who were struggling with the  after-effects of war. This led him to bring Wounded Warriors in Action  to the region. Each year, he helps veterans from Alabama--and across  the Nation--who served in combat, find healing through hunting and  fishing.   Matt also serves as a narcotics agent with the Bureau of Special  Investigations arm of the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency. He is on the  frontlines keeping our communities safe from deadly drugs like  fentanyl.   Alabama is grateful for Matt's service. It is my honor to recognize  Matt Brannon as the December Veteran of the Month.                            ____________________
