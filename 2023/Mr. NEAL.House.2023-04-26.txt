 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the default on America  act. The chairman just mentioned something that is noteworthy. He said,  We are seeing a Republican plan, and for the next hour, we intend to  make sure America gets a chance to see the Republican plan.   A reminder for those who might be paying attention to this debate  today as to how we traveled on this road which, by the way, is  eminently manageable through negotiation after a clean debt ceiling  vote might take place.   So our Republican colleagues, I think--and I might be mistaken. You  know what? I am sure. They voted for more defense spending. $800  billion we are now at with defense spending. They voted for pandemic  relief. They voted for aid to Ukraine. How about the million and a half  new veterans that we have in America in the aftermath of the war in  Iraq and Afghanistan? They deserve our care, and our Republican  colleagues voted for that aid.   Republican Members, some of whom voted for the infrastructure bill,  some of them who voted for the legislation on the Inflation Reduction  Act, and some of them who voted for the CHIPS Act--that is what is in  front of us at this moment.   Here is the real ringer, Mr. Speaker. In December of 2017--and I hope  everybody pays attention to this argument--they voted to borrow $2.3  trillion over 10 years for the purpose of giving a tax cut to the  wealthiest among us with, by the way, modest to limited economic  growth.   Why is that important?   Because there has been $10 trillion worth of tax cuts over the last  25 years. Do you want me to recite it?    President Bush's tax cut in 2001, $1.3 trillion. They came back in  2003, another trillion, and subsequently presided over the invasion of  Iraq and Afghanistan, which we should note the cost of which are in the  trillions of dollars today.   They want us to believe that this problem that we have in front of  us--which I mentioned is manageable--they want us to believe that this  is the Democratic position on spending after they embraced the tax cuts  that I have just described.   This is about America's credit. What ever happened to the Republican  Party that talked about probity as it related to financial stability?   Whatever happened to the Republican Party that talked about the  importance of investment?  [[Page H2024]]    These arguments that they make now are largely vacuous because it is  inconsistent with the Republican Party I knew when I came to Congress.  They could borrow money for the Iraq war month after month to keep it  off budget so nobody would see what it was really about. They could  borrow money repeatedly, and the moment a Democrat gets to the White  House they are blamed for inflation.   I don't think Joe Biden should be blamed for inflation in the United  Kingdom. How about Germany? That is how empty these arguments are that  they are making.   There is a chance for us to do what we used to do here--and by the  way, Democrats responsibly voted for raising the debt ceiling three  times under the former President because we thought it was the  responsible thing to do. Speaker McCarthy got himself into this by the  promises that he made along the way.   The suggestion here is very simple, Mr. Speaker. Pass a clean debt  ceiling and then let's get on with negotiating.   Bill Clinton, on January 19, 2001, had balanced the budget four  times, projected surpluses in the trillions of dollars and 22 million  new jobs. The Republican Party gave it away through tax cuts to wealthy  people.   They are asking us today the following--they get to set the fire and  then call the fire department because that is what this argument is  about.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, my point was and is Republicans voted for the  PATH Act, as we did, and the bill is due.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentleman from New  York (Mr. Jeffries), the minority leader in the House of  Representatives, a champion of long-term worthwhile investments.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Virginia for  calling attention to these tax credits.   Talk about fortuitous timing, Mr. Speaker, here is the author of  these tax credits, all $370 billion, along with Earl Blumenauer. We  intend to lay out where these tax credits are going to in Republican  districts and see if those Members wish to take advantage of those tax  credits or not.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Thompson), who is a veteran.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Massachusetts (Ms. Clark), the minority whip and a great talent in the  Democratic Party.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Doggett), a longtime observer and critic of Republican spending  plans in the House.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Oregon  (Mr. Blumenauer) who had a profound impact on writing the tax credits  that the gentlewoman from Virginia acknowledged a moment ago.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Pascrell), a champion of Medicare, Social Security, and  renewable energy.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Davis), who has been a leader in terms of adoption  opportunities for those outside the mainstream.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Washington (Ms. DelBene), one of the most talented Members of this  institution.    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from Mr.  Pascrell.   [[Page H2032]]                                       Congress of the United States,                                        House of Representatives,                                      Washington, DC, March 8, 2023.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy.      Speaker of the House,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker McCarthy: Our most basic duty as Members of       Congress is to protect the well-being and security of our       constituents. If Republicans block America from paying our       bills, it would be a gross betrayal of our governing       responsibility and invite cataclysmic damage to our economy.       Therefore, I call on the House to advance legislation to       raise our debt limit and prevent a second Great Depression.        It has been 48 days since the United States reached its       current statutory limit and the Treasury Department began       taking extraordinary measures to prevent a default. On       February 15, the Congressional Budget Office raised the       specter of a default as soon as July without urgent       congressional action. Congress has acted to raise or suspend       the debt ceiling 49 times under Republican presidents and 29       times under Democratic presidents. This is a bipartisan       responsibility.        According to the Council of Economic Advisors (CEA), if the       debt ceiling is not raised, Social Security checks will come       to a halt and seniors will be without means to eat or turn on       the heat. Medicare reimbursements will freeze, leaving tens       of millions of Americans unable to pay for essential medical       care. Our veterans will see their health care cut off.        It gets worse. The collapse of available credit would send       shockwaves through the economy, leading to a bank run and a       decimation of small businesses. The cost of borrowing would       soar, leaving new homebuyers locked out of the housing market       and causing regular people to lose everything. The jobless       rate would skyrocket, with millions of Americans losing their       jobs and elevated unemployment lingering indefinitely.       Markets would be thrown into a postulated that the impact of       default would be ten times worse than the 2008 recession.        Republican-precipitated default would be just as       devastating for the global economy. America's treasury debt       is considered the world's safest asset and the dollar acts as       the globe's reserve currency. World confidence in our entire       economy would be irreparably wounded by default.        When Republicans put our Nation's credit on the line, the       result has been widespread turmoil and suffering. After       Republicans threatened to breach the debt ceiling in 2011,       Standard and Poor's downgraded the U.S. long-term credit       rating for the first time in history. Private sector hiring       froze, job growth withered, and consumer sentiment dropped to       its lowest level in 30 years. The Government Accountability       Office (GAO) estimated that federal borrowing costs increased       by about $1.3 billion, while the Bipartisan Policy Center       estimated that the 10-year cost to taxpayers was a staggering       $18.9 billion.        In 2013, when Republicans tried this play again, our Nation       experienced an annualized 0.25 percentage point reduction in       annualized fourth quarter's gross domestic product growth,       resulting in an estimated 120,000 lost jobs. Investors       stopped accepting Treasury bonds as collateral for short-term       transactions, and the government was forced to pay higher       interest rates at auction. Treasury's borrowing costs on       securities increased by an estimated $38-to-$70 million, and       rates for commercial paper also rose, disrupting private       markets. After Republicans yet again menaced our Nation's       credit in 2015, the Treasury Department postponed the release       of a new 2-year bond due to lack of demand, and was forced to       reduce bill issuance, leading to a drop of $210 billion in       bill supply.        The full faith and credit of America is not a bargaining       chip to be gambled whenever Republicans want to reverse       policy they don't like. Refusal to let our Nation pay its       bills would lead to a domino effect of catastrophic       proportion. The effects of failing to raise the debt ceiling       are real, tangible, and would be felt by every American       family and business.        Given these risks, I ask: where is the Republican plan to       raise the debt ceiling and when can we expect its       consideration before Congress?            Sincerely,                                                 Bill Pascrell, Jr.                                                Member of Congress.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Beyer), whose knowledge of economics is second to none in  this institution.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Evans), whose city is home to some of the most  important retirement plan management opportunities in all of America.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Schneider), an individual who is well known for his  proficiency in accounting procedures.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Nevada  (Mr. Horsford), a very capable gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), one of the most capable people that I have had a  chance to serve with in Congress.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Maryland.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Pallone), who comes from the same class as the last two  Members, the class of 1988, a very talented lot.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time is  remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Georgia  (Mr.   David Scott), a very distinguished and capable gentleman.                                time  1645     Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for acknowledging the  role that the child tax credit played in that statistical analysis.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Goldman), a new and very capable Member of this House.    Mr. Speaker, I remind everyone that, in Georgia-3, there  was $2.6 billion worth of tax credits; Ohio-15, $4.5 billion of tax  credits; West Virginia-1, $22 million worth of tax credits. Those tax  credits did not go to the  [[Page H2036]]  Chinese. They went to American families.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms.  Lois Frankel).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Chu), a member of the Ways and Means Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Ryan).    Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I thank you for your impeccable fairness once again as  you have presided over this Chamber as usual. I call attention to the  argument I made at the outset as to how we got to where we are today.  This is a manageable issue that men and women of good sense and good  instincts could come together on to find a solution.   The debt-to-GDP ratio, I understand the argument, but does that take  into consideration a pandemic and aid to Ukraine, stopping the  hostility of Putin's aggression?   Does it take into account our obligations--and for those who voted  for the PACT Act here--to come to the aid of our veterans?   Does it take into account the infrastructure bill that some  Republicans voted for?   Does it take into account the CHIPS and Science Act that some  Republicans voted for?   Does it take into account the extraordinary increases in defense  spending as China threatens America in the Straits of Taiwan and the  South China Sea?   These are all parts of votes that both parties have cast. These are  parts of the obligations that we have to members of the American  family.   Republicans suggest, well, if we just chop Medicaid--and earlier  today, Mr. Speaker, it should be noted this exclamation point that they  have added to the argument that we have no intention of cutting Social  Security or Medicare. Great. That is nice to hear. There are members of  the Republican leadership in the Senate who have said precisely the  opposite. They would put Medicaid and Social Security on the chopping  block, and our side should not be restrained in calling attention to  that, despite the debate that takes place in this Chamber.   The spending challenges that we have as they relate to defense, where  every Republican voted, I believe, for that defense budget and the  substantial increases that have taken place, that has been an act of  responsibility based upon what happens with Putin and President Xi and  others who would threaten freedom across the globe.                                time  1700    When we look at this argument that has been presented to the American  people today, I want to ask you about their 401(k) plans. As they allow  this argument to be pursued, the markets are going to begin to reflect  this in coming days.   People are going to pull back from investment. People are going to  pull back from what ordinarily would be an act of good fiscal prudence.  People are going to begin to pay a great deal of attention to this.   The argument that Democrats have offered today is really simple: You  and us, we were responsible for those increases in spending. Let us  have a vote on a clean debt resolution here and then proceed to  negotiation and discussion.   I have heard this argument when former President Bush never vetoed  one spending bill during 8 years as President. I have seen this  argument when we cut taxes, without the help of us, by $1.3 trillion in  2001 and, by the way, another trillion in 2003.   With the subsequent invasion of Iraq and Afghanistan and a million  and a half new veterans, these are our obligations.   Even though we disagreed, by and large, with those positions that  were adopted by the then-majority, you recognize the reality, that the  tally of the credit card is in front of us.   When you get the credit card, you don't get to say, ``Well, I don't  like the part of the bill that I have run up here, so I am not going to  pay it,'' or you don't say, ``I will only pay this.''   The bill is in front of us. The full faith and credit of the United  States is in front of us.   I made reference earlier today to the fiscal probity of the  Republican Party when I first came here. Whatever happened to the  Republican Party when it relates to fiscal prudence and probity?   We pay our bills, and we don't threaten the currency of the United  States where that dollar is recognized everywhere across the globe.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   This will be a 5-minute vote.   The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--yeas 217,  nays 215, not voting 3, as follows:                               [Roll No. 199]                                 YEAS--217       Aderholt      Alford      Allen      Amodei      Armstrong      Arrington      Babin      Bacon      Baird      Balderson      Banks      Barr      Bean (FL)      Bentz      Bergman      Bice      Bilirakis      Bishop (NC)      Boebert      Bost      Brecheen      Buchanan      Bucshon      Burgess      Burlison      Calvert      Cammack      Carey      Carl      Carter (GA)      Carter (TX)      Chavez-DeRemer      Ciscomani      Cline      Cloud      Clyde      Cole      Collins      Comer      Crane      Crawford      Crenshaw      Curtis      D'Esposito      Davidson      De La Cruz      DesJarlais      Diaz-Balart      Donalds      Duarte      Duncan      Dunn (FL)      Edwards      Ellzey      Emmer      Estes      Ezell      Fallon      Feenstra      Ferguson      Finstad      Fischbach      Fitzgerald      Fitzpatrick      Fleischmann      Flood      Foxx      Franklin, C.
