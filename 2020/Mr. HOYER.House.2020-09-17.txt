 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Before we begin the colloquy, let me make some remarks about someone  who has made a real difference in this House.   Madam Speaker, every society that wants to be a successful society  has to have rules. Thomas Jefferson, one of the great political  thinkers of the centuries, observed that there had to be both comity  and fairness if we were going to come together and have a democracy  that was operational.   Dick Gephardt used to say that the legislative process was a  substitute for armed confrontation, that the resolution of differences  in a democracy needed to be done in a civil way, pursuant to rules.   Madam Speaker, we are losing, in a short period of time, a gentleman  who has made a difference for this House, this Congress--House and  Senate--has made a difference to the civility of this House, a  gentleman who, by the way, is not responsible in any way for the lack  of civility that, from time to time, breaks out in this House.                                time  1430    I refer, Madam Speaker, to our Parliamentarian, Tom Wickham. I have  had the privilege of knowing him all of his days in the House of  Representatives. He has been here for a significant period of time and  has served as our Parliamentarian for essentially four Congresses, 8  years.   He stands--or sits, at this point in time--a short, at least 6 feet,  distance, with his mask on, which is a unique experience for him, from  the Speaker's rostrum. He is there to ensure that we play by the rules.  He is there to ensure us that we do not take advantage of one another,  but that we resolve, in pursuit of the rules, the differences that we  may have and do so in a way that, for centuries, essentially, have  governed how we process in the legislative arena.   It is a nonpartisan role. Obviously, he served when there were  Republican Speakers, and obviously, he is serving now with a Democratic  Speaker. It is nonpartisan, but it is sometimes thankless, particularly  when you have to make a ruling, particularly that the majority party  does not like.   I must say that there is probably not a Member among us who hasn't at  some point in time said either, ``Gee, I am sorry Wickham made that  ruling,'' or, ``I don't agree with Wickham.'' Therefore, it is a tough  job because we are all pretty powerful people. We all think we are  pretty smart people, and we know this, that, and the other. So, you  have to have the courage of your convictions as well as the  intellectual reasoning to go behind your decision. Tom Wickham has had  that every day he has served in this House.   It is hard to be a referee because the calls don't always go the way  people want. One of the hallmarks of the Parliamentarian's Office, and  Tom Wickham in particular, is they call them as they see them. No  matter the effect of those rulings, they make the ruling that they  believe is correct. You can disagree, but what you cannot disagree with  is that the Parliamentarian's Office prides itself on calling them as  they see them.   Now, it was difficult, I am sure, for every Parliamentarian, and the  Parliamentarian's Office, to conduct this role. But they have done so  in a manner, all the time I have been here, which I am in my 40th year,  that has been a credit to the House of Representatives, a credit to our  democracy, a credit to Thomas Jefferson's perception of trying to  create rules and ways of doing things that credited democracy, that did  not undermine it.   Tom was also the Deputy Parliamentarian and the Assistant  Parliamentarian, so he has had a lot of experience. He has spent a  quarter of a century working for this House.   I will miss him. We will miss him. This Congress will miss him.   He will be succeeded by somebody who has experience and depth and  will, I know, in the tradition of all the Parliamentarians with whom I  have worked over those 40 years, be fair and unflinching in calling it  as he sees it.   We will miss Tom's good humor and kind nature. I know my staff will  miss working closely with him every day to ensure the smooth and proper  running of the floor.   On behalf of Democrats, and I know Mr. Scalise will speak on behalf  of his party as well, I want to thank you, Tom, for your service, for  your dedication to this institution, for the temperate way in which you  dealt with all of us, even when we were not temperate. You were steady,  thoughtful, fair.   Also, as I said, I want to congratulate Deputy Parliamentarian Jason  Smith, who will succeed Tom as Parliamentarian of the House. He will,  as every Parliamentarian with whom I have served, be fair, be honest,  and call them as he sees them. My staff and I look forward to working  with him in his new role.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   If I might wryly observe, Madam Speaker, that I have not seen the  Parliamentarian pass you a note to instruct the gentleman to address  the Chair.   Tom, I am going to address you.    Tom Wickham, for those who are watching, is a wonderful  example of the extraordinary patriotism, loyalty, and talent that has  contributed to this House's operation by all of our staff. He is one of  the best, but we have the best.   Tom, I know you treated all the staff, certainly on my staff--and I  know all the staff--with great respect because you knew how important  they were. We all know how important you have been to the operations of  this House.   I don't know what you will be doing. But assuming that you, at this  young age of yours--I told you that you were way too young for us to  let you go, but you are going--you will be doing other things, and you  will bring great value to whatever enterprise you pursue.   We have been blessed for a quarter of a century with your service,  and we thank you for that service. Godspeed.    Madam Speaker, on Monday, the House will meet at 12 p.m.  for legislative business. No votes are expected in the House on Monday.   On Tuesday, the House will meet at 9 a.m. for morning-hour debate and  11 a.m. for legislative business.   I would remind Members that Monday is expected to be a travel day  following the holiday. So, Monday we will have business on the floor,  but we will have no votes on the floor.   On Wednesday and Thursday, the House will meet at 9 a.m. for morning- hour debate and 11 a.m. for legislative business.   On Friday, the House will meet at 9 a.m. for legislative business.   We will consider several bills, Madam Speaker, under suspension of  the rules, a large number of suspension bills, in fact. The complete  list of suspension bills will be announced by the close of business  tomorrow.   The House will consider, as well, next week a continuing resolution  for fiscal year 2021.   Madam Speaker, the House has passed 10 of its appropriations bills of  the 12 appropriations bills we have.   Sadly, the Senate has not passed a single bill out of committee, has  not voted on a single appropriations bill in its committee. As a  result, clearly, we will not be able to conclude the appropriations  process, and we will have to have a CR to make sure that government  stays serving the American people.   Hopefully, we can reach a bipartisan agreement, and there will not be  a controversial continuing resolution. I know Democrats and Republicans  and the administration are working toward that end.   I expect and hope a bill to be filed tomorrow. That is our hope. But  we do expect to consider that bill next week.   The CR, as I said, is necessary to avert a shutdown that would only  further damage our economy and undermine our efforts on COVID-19.   In addition, the House will consider H.R. 4447, the Clean Economy  Jobs and Innovation Act. This bill, Madam Speaker, is a package of  legislation reported out of the Energy and Commerce Committee and the  Science, Space, and Technology Committee to invest in energy innovation  and clean energy development.   In addition, the House may consider H.R. 6270, the Uyghur Forced  Labor Disclosure Act, and H.R. 6210, the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention  Act.   Members are advised that additional legislative items are possible.   I yield back to my friend, the Republican whip.                                time  1445     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments.   Of course, the Paycheck Protection Program was a very, very important  program. I was pleased that the committees came up with that program  and we had bipartisan support for that program.   I will tell the gentleman that that is an important effort for us to  take, but I would also say it is very important for us to act on behalf  of millions of people who still do not have a job or are on  unemployment and need the supplemental unemployment that they were  receiving to survive and keep their families going.   We have millions of people who are suffering from food shortages, the  inability to keep their family fed. We need to pass, we believe, the  supplemental nutrition program.   We need to make sure that States, in my view, have the ability to  function. They are hemorrhaging revenues because of COVID-19, because  of the decrease in the economy. States, cities, municipalities,  counties are suffering, and many other aspects, including testing,  which is one of the critical components of us confronting COVID-19.   So while I agree with the gentleman that the program that he talks  about--of course, we created that program and we passed it in a  bipartisan fashion, and it was very bipartisan in the Senate. I know  Mr. Cardin and Mr. Rubio were both involved in that. It was very  important to pass that.   But I will tell the gentleman that I was pleased that the President  indicated that we need to invest very significant sums, which he then  said would come back to the U.S. or help the U.S. economy. I think that  was a positive step forward.   I would also observe, as the gentleman observed, that Speaker Pelosi  and Secretary Mnuchin reached four major deals, compromises--four. One  was, we thought, very big at the time, $8.3 billion, which now looks  somewhat small. But we reached four of those. We brought them to the  House floor, the Senate floor, and they passed overwhelmingly in  bipartisan votes.   Secretary Mnuchin and the Speaker have been discussing trying to get  to, for 4 months now--now, Mr. Meadows is also in the room. Mr. Meadows  and I have a very positive relationship, but my observation has been,  through the years, Mr. Meadows is more about stopping deals than making  deals.   But I agree with the gentleman, we need to act. I am hopeful that the  administration and the Senate and the House will reach agreement ASAP,  not only on the PPP, which I agree with the gentleman on, not only on  the PPP, but all the other programs that I mentioned and many more that  are in the HEROES bill.   The Speaker has indicated we are certainly prepared to negotiate what  the expenditure is, and she has indicated a willingness to come down  very, very substantially to try to reach an agreement, which is what  compromise is all about. That hasn't happened yet, but I am hopeful  that it will happen in the near term, because I agree with the  gentleman, we need to act. I am urging the administration and all of us  to come to an agreement.   Unfortunately, in the Senate, their efforts have not been successful  in passing a bill. So we have no alternative bill beyond the HEROES  bill that passed, as I said, 4 months ago, so we have nothing to  conference because there is no Senate bill.   In fact, Mr. McConnell went from a trillion down to a half a  trillion, which almost every economist, either at a trillion or half a  trillion, says is not sufficient for health reasons and economic  reasons and family reasons to confront the enormity of the challenge  that still confronts us as a result of COVID-19.   So I thank the gentleman for mentioning Mr. Chabot's legislation. He  is right, of course, there is $130 billion in the pot. I think we ought  to purpose that to either a continuation of PPP or a continuation of  PPP and other things. But I think we ought to do it, and what we are  trying to do is a comprehensive package that deals with all the  challenges confronting American families, particularly the unemployment  insurance.   As of July 31, as the gentleman knows, the supplemental payment  lapsed. To some degree, the President has tried to put additional sums  in there. Some States are pursuing it and some States have effected it.   But I hope that the bottom line is, in the next week, in the near  term, and I think the President's statement was helpful, and I hope,  frankly, the Senators take that to heart, that we need to invest much  more than they suggested if we are going to meet the scope of the  problem that exists.   I thank the gentleman bringing to the House's attention that  particular bill, and certainly it will be under consideration as well,  I think, by those who are negotiating, mainly Secretary Mnuchin and  Speaker Pelosi. Mr. McConnell has chosen not to participate in those  discussions, as you know. Mr. Schumer does, and I think Mr. McCarthy  does--I am not sure all the time, but I am sure he does as well.   We want to get an agreement. We want to do what we have done four  times: reached an agreement, passed it overwhelmingly in both Houses  for the people, because the people are hurting and we need to act and  meet that challenge of their hurt and their need to support themselves,  their families, and, as you point out, their businesses.    Madam Speaker, the whip mentioned undermining confidence.  I will tell the whip with all due respect; nobody has undermined  confidence in the healthcare system more than the President of the  United States. No one has diverted more attention from the experts; no  one has denigrated the experts, which undermines confidence in their  advice and counsel, than the President of the United States. And no one  in the health community said that the coronavirus was a hoax.   We have just seen that Mr. Woodward heard in late January that the  President thought this was a very serious matter. And then, frankly, he  conveyed to the American people, don't worry about it, it is going to  go away. In a few days, a few weeks, it is going to go away.   No one has undermined the confidence of the American people in the  CDC or the FDA or the NIH more than the President of the United States.  He said they are wrong.   And I say that because confidence needs to be built by leadership.  And if the vaccine can come out next month, hooray, if it can be done  consistent with what the medical experts and the pharmaceutical experts  tell us can give the American people confidence.   But I will tell my friend Mr. Caputo substantially undermined  confidence because he wanted to tell the experts what to say apparently  consistent with what the administration's policy was as opposed to what  the scientific evidence was.  [[Page H4534]]    And so when you mention confidence, some people were trying to  undermine confidence; we have had six, seven, eight months of  undermining confidence.   And it is a shame. Because the gentleman is absolutely right. People  are going to need confidence. And they are going to have to take the  vaccine because that is the only way this economy is going to get back  to where it needs to be. People having confidence in the safety for  themselves, their husband, their wife, their children to be about the  business of America and their own personal business.   So I would hope that the President would leave it to the experts, not  to his judgment, to the experts as to when a vaccine is ready to  deliver to the public. And then I think all of us ought to have that  confidence to--I certainly am going to get the vaccine when the medical  experts tell me this is safe to take, and I am going to urge my family  to do the same. And I am sure you have just indicated you would do the  same. I think we will, hopefully, do that.    But the instilling of confidence, I would tell my friend, starts at  the top and with all of us, as well, because people respect us in some  respects sometimes, and they think we have knowledge that they may not  have, and therefore, they want to have confidence that, yes, this is  good; no, it is not, don't do it.   So I would simply say to my friend, I hope that we get a vaccine. I  hope we get it as soon as possible. And I hope that the election has  nothing to do with the vaccine. I hope the decision has everything to  do with science and medicine. And I think all Americans hope that, as  well.    How about Dr. Redfield?    Did you see what happened in the last 48 hours?    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   This President doesn't take responsibility for anything other than  good things. If anything bad happens, this President does not take  responsibility. He points to somebody else.   What I interrupted the gentleman on was he says, ``the scientists.''  Redfield is a scientist. He is a medical doctor. He is the head of the  CDC. He made a comment, his best judgment as to when vaccines were  going to be available, widely available.   The President contradicted him on both points he made just a few days  ago, as he has done with Fauci, as he has done with Hahn, as he has  done with others.   My confidence in those three companies is that they will come to the  referee and will say: ``Is this ready to go?'' The referee, in this  case the FDA, that the gentleman says is so respected has that  responsibility.   What I don't have confidence in, what I think so many of the American  people don't have confidence in, is they will get a call from the White  House that says: ``This is the judgment you are going to make.''   We have seen, over and over and over again, decisions modified  because of White House direction. In fact, Caputo was there for exactly  that reason at HHS, not CDC, but overseeing CDC.   I tell my friend, Madam Speaker, yes, we need to have confidence, but  we need to be truthful with them. We need to tell them the truth. We  need to take direction from the experts, not substitute our judgment.   The gentleman talks about hydroxychloroquine. Obviously, Fauci didn't  think that was a great recommendation to make. That was for doctors to  make, but the President made it. In fact, most of the doctors thought  that was not a good recommendation.   Certainly, Clorox was even less than that, I say as an aside. Maybe  it was tongue in cheek, but unfortunately, when the President speaks,  people don't necessarily think it is tongue in cheek, and it becomes  dangerous.   I will say to my friend, hopefully, that this vaccine issue will be  resolved by the experts and give confidence to the American people that  they can, in fact, rely on the experts and their doctor to take the  vaccine because, hopefully, it will be in a position where, in fact, it  will give the confidence and the result that is promised.    Madam Speaker, I am not going to prolong this. The only  thing I would say is, under the gentleman's theory, Madam Speaker, we  wouldn't need the FDA because, clearly, these companies would not do  anything just because of profit. And I don't allege that they would do  that.   But we have an FDA because we need a referee to look at it without  thinking of the consequences of a yes or no answer but a scientific  answer. That is the only observation I would make.   I get it. I get that the companies are reputable companies.   I support them. They do great work. But we have an FDA because we  need somebody who is an independent arbiter, not just because no  company would do this. Because if no company would do it, we wouldn't  need the FDA.    Madam Speaker, I have nothing left to say.
