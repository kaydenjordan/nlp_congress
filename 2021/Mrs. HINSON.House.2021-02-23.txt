 Madam Speaker, tonight, we are here to honor the life of  Luke Letlow, who was taken from us far too soon.   Luke led a life of public service, and he was dedicated to bettering  the lives in Louisiana. I know he was so looking forward to serving the  great people of the State of Louisiana here in Congress.   Most importantly, though, he was a dedicated husband to his wife,  Julia, and a loving father to their two young children. We are all  grieving with them during this time, their entire family. I hope the  Letlow family can seek some comfort in knowing that so many people here  in D.C., back in Iowa, Georgia, and around the country are lifting up  prayers for them every single day.   Although Luke is no longer with us, he does leaves behind, and he  reminds us about, a remarkable legacy that we and, most importantly,  his two children will always be able to remember him by long after we  are all gone from this place, too.   Thank you, Madam Speaker, for letting me speak tonight on behalf of  our classmate, Luke Letlow, and his entire family.
