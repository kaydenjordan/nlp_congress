 Madam Speaker, today, the Census begins to reach out  to households across America.   All communities across the country must be counted, particularly  those that are hard-to-count communities.   The Census is for everybody. However, due to the coronavirus  pandemic, we now face difficult challenges for the Census.   The Census must be extended an additional 3 months so we can get an  accurate count.   (English translation of the statement made in Spanish is as follows:)   Today we begin the census for families across the country. But due to  the coronavirus pandemic we are going to face grand obstacles. The  Census should be extended for 3 months to ensure a precise count.   Hoy comenzamos el conteo del censo para familias a traves del pais  pero por la creciente epidemia del coronavirus vamos a tener grandes  obstaculos. El censo debe de ser extendido por tres meses para tener un  conteo preciso.
