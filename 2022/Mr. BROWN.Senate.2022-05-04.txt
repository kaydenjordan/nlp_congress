 Mr. President, I rise in opposition to Senator Sanders'  motion to instruct.   When America invented the semiconductor 40 years ago, we produced  nearly half of the world's semiconductors. Today, we produce less than  10 percent.   Look what happened: Plants shut down across Ohio. Whirlpool, Ford,  GM--forced to idle plants because of the ``spread out all over the  world'' supply chain.   We passed the CHIPS Act 2 years ago. I thank Senator Cantwell who-- what she has done to stop this, encourage more production of these  chips at home.   This bill will fund--this legislation will fund the bill Congress  already passed. It is not a bailout. It is critical to my State--10,000  good jobs, 5,000 building trades--union building trades jobs paying  prevailing wage for the next 10 years. It is an incentive program.   The EU, China, Taiwan, South Korea all provide incentives to make  these chips domestically. None of them require stock warrants.   Everybody in this body knows my position in opposition to the  financial services industry to stock buybacks. You can count on that.   I yield my final 30 seconds to Senator Wicker.    Madam President, I rise to oppose Senator Toomey's motion  to instruct against motions that undermine investments in American  manufacturing and production.   I urge my colleagues to oppose this motion to instruct. It supports a  broad exclusion process for 301 tariffs for goods from China. These  tariffs are in place because of Chinese unfair trade practices that  target our industrial base and jobs in Pennsylvania and Ohio and New  Jersey.   The AFL-CIO opposes this motion. The USTR opposes it. The bipartisan,  pro-industry Alliance for American Manufacturing opposes it. They know  any exclusions need to be part of a broader strategic approach that we  all support to trade policy with China. Creating an overly broad  exclusion process that ties our hands would take away leverage we need  to pressure China to change its behavior--behavior the steel industry  in my State and other industries all over the country know too well.   China cheats. We know this. It subsidizes its steel industry. It  props up state-owned enterprises. It steals intellectual property. It  pollutes the Earth and exploits our workers. It is costing my State and  all over the country jobs year after year. We can't let China's  cheating undermine the investments we are making in this bill.   I ask for opposition to the Toomey motion.                                Vote on Motion
