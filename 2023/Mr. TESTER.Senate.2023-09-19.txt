 Mr. President, today I would like to honor the life and  service of a distinguished Montanan and one of Montana's five World War  II Medal of Honor recipients: Technician Fourth Grade Laverne Parrish.   Laverne and his family moved to the Mission Valley of Montana in  1934, and he graduated from Ronan High School in 1937. Never one to shy  away from service or sacrifice, Laverne joined the Washington Army  National Guard in the March of 1941, just months before the attack on  Pearl Harbor. He served as a medical aidman in Company C of the 161st  Infantry Regiment where he achieved the rank of technician fourth  grade, the noncommissioned officer equivalent of sergeant.   In August of 1942, his Army National Guard unit was activated and  deployed to Hawaii for training. Soon after, his unit was mobilized and  deployed to the Pacific Theater with the 25th Infantry Division. Known  as ``Tropic Lightning'' for specializing in jungle warfare, his  division saw combat in five different military campaigns, moving from  Guadalcanal, to the Northern Solomon Islands, and eventually joining  General MacArthur's campaign to recapture the Philippines.   In January of 1945, his division landed on the island of Luzon in the  Philippines. During heavy fighting in Binalonan, Laverne risked his  life rushing onto the battlefield to bring in his wounded brother in  arms to safety. While treating casualties, he noticed two wounded  soldiers from his company still in the field. Without hesitation, he  crawled back onto the battlefield amidst intense enemy fire to  successfully rescue both men.   Six days later, under withering enemy fire, Laverne's unit was  ordered to withdraw to the cover of a ditch. Seeing two wounded  soldiers unable to move, Laverne quickly left his position and pulled  them to safety. In that same field, he also delivered aid to 12  casualties, crossing and recrossing an open area raked by enemy fire in  the process and finally bringing an additional three men who were  critically wounded back to the unit.   Shortly after treating nearly all 37 of the casualties suffered by  his company, Laverne was mortally wounded by mortar fire and died on  the battlefield, just 6 months before the war ended. He was 26 years  old, and his body was returned to Montana, where he was laid to eternal  rest at the Mountain View Cemetery in Ronan. While Laverne passed, the  story of the heroic ``Montana Medic'' quickly spread through the 25th  Infantry Division as they bravely carried on facing more continuous  combat than any other Infantry Division in the 6th Army.   Laverne pitted heroism and bravery against great odds, saving the  lives of many of his fellow soldiers at the cost of his own. In honor  of his incredible bravery and sacrifice, Laverne was awarded the Medal  of Honor by President Harry S. Truman, our Nation's highest military  awarded to the men and women in uniform who have gone above and beyond  protecting our freedoms. He was one of just six medical corpsman to  receive this honor in World War II, and the six were credited with  saving the lives of more than 150 military personnel.   In the fall of 1948, the town of Ronan came together to honor Laverne  by naming the athletic field the Sergeant Laverne Parrish Memorial  Field. Naming this field in Laverne's honor was a small token of our  appreciation for his heroic service and sacrifice, but it ensured he  will be remembered generation after generation in Ronan--and all across  the Treasure State.   Seventy-five years later, Laverne's memory lives on in each of us--in  the freedoms of our children, our children's children, and right here  with us on this football field.   On behalf of myself and a grateful nation, I commend Mr. Laverne  Parrish and extend our deepest appreciation to him. He is a true  patriot who made Montana proud, and we will never forget him.   Today and every day, let us remember that we are standing here today,  in a free country, because of Laverne, the sacrifices he made, and the  sacrifices of our military men and women have made every generation  since.                            ____________________
