 Madam Speaker, today, I rise to acknowledge June 6,  1944, D-Day, the day the largest land, sea, and air attack came to  Normandy to fight Hitler. It was an unbelievable surge of power for  freedom.   Just a few years ago, I had the privilege of commemorating D-Day at  Normandy and being able to see the rows and rows of those who died in  the name of freedom. Nine thousand of the Allies died, men and women,  men in particular, from the United States of America.   I honor them today and recognize that as we stand in this place, as  we debate on this floor, we have the responsibility to pay tribute to  why they fought for freedom and their love of America. We have the  responsibility to do the right thing for the American people.   That is why I stand today to raise an issue that has plagued us over  and over again, and that is the enormity of gun violence, the  proliferation of guns, and the loss of life of our children. Violence  is impacting our children every single day.   Yesterday, we held a powerful hearing to talk about how we can stop  this gun violence. We heard from people who were victims, like Lloyd  Gock, a victim of the Monterey Park shooting. His words rang so  powerfully. He heard 42 gunshots, and he heard the bodies dropping, 11  dead and 9 wounded. He understands that a weapon of war should not be  on the streets and that we should ban assault weapons.   We also heard medical testimony, or professional health testimony,  that indicated that storage, as indicated in the Kimberly Vaughan  Firearm Safe Storage Act, would be most helpful in saving the lives of  children. Some 4 million children live in homes where guns are laid  around and not stored. They lose their lives there. Every single day,  eight children lose their lives by way of gun violence.   What about Mr. Kling from the Giffords organization that says 6,500  veterans die every year due to gun violence, to suicide? It is  imperative that we understand that their weapon of choice is a gun.  Some would say that they are suicidal, that they have mental issues.   It is the proliferation of guns--red flag laws, banning assault  weapons, raising the age.   We all still feel the pain of many shootings, but we feel the pain of  Uvalde. I have come to know those families and the elected officials  there who have been in pain, the city that has been in pain. The  families and children remain in pain.   You see how many of these small caskets they had to watch being  buried in that community when a child, yes, under the age of 21 got a  gun online. How outrageous is that?   I stand here today saying: Are we going to keep the promise of those  who laid their lives on the line for a free nation, or are we going to  continually be against what is right?   Let me quickly indicate that we must do something about the massive  evictions across America. People are unhoused and need more housing. I  am going to fight against the high numbers of evictions in all of our  communities and will introduce legislation dealing with eviction. I  want to bring it down in Houston and cities around the Nation.   As well, I want to make sure that whatever rights we have, all people  deserve the same rights, and that is access to freedom, justice, and  equality and to recognize their diversity and access to healthcare.   It was the Democrats who saved Medicaid when a million people were  going to lose their Medicaid. Had we followed the leadership of our  friends on the other side of the aisle, with their early bill H.R. 1, 1  million people--but we stopped it. We are stopping the default and  negotiating away the idea of taking a million people off of Medicaid,  their lifeline for healthcare.   It is extremely important that we recognize that men and women laid  down their lives or put on the uniform unselfishly. They do so so that  freedom can be for every American.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from  Pennsylvania and my good friend from Kentucky for their leadership.   Mr. Speaker, I think it is extremely important to assure the American  people--and particularly my husband, Dr. Lee--and to proclaim, which we  have the ability to do as Members of Congress, that no one's gas stove  will be lost or taken.   In fact, I even heard Members say that they are buying a gas stove or  getting a gas stove. Let me proclaim again: No gas stove will be taken  from any American ever--ever.   It is interesting to be on the floor fighting about freedom and  protection of a gas stove. Needless to say, today is June 6. I stood  earlier today to honor D-day. I know what those men died for. It is  important to be able to protect consumers from dangerous explosions of  any kind, and that is all that our agencies are doing.   Again, I proclaim that no one's gas stove is being taken away.   We will be debating freedom of a gas stove, protection of a gas  stove, when eight children per day are dying because of gun violence.   I only want my constituents in Houston to know, my constituents in  Texas to know, my constituents in the Nation to know, as we represent  the entire Nation: No one's gas stove needs protection or freedom  because there is an agency that, prospectively, in 3 years, is looking  to ensure that all gas stoves are safe. We owe that to the American  people.   I have now for the third time been engaged with the REINS Act. Please  let me explain to you what that is. It is literally a stop sign of the  executive functioning. If a regulation is abusive to the American  people, we can file lawsuits, as often happens, to challenge that, and  that would be individual consumers or companies. When you have a  regulation, it takes at least almost a year for the input of the  American people to be able to say this is a regulation that works or  not, except the REIN Act will require the Congress to intercede every  moment.   Accordingly, if it is about asthma, if it is about heart disease, if  it is about good medication, and a regulation comes out, you won't get  it because the Congress will have a rein around it. It will be a  stranglehold, and we will get nothing done.   The separation of powers, I have done that before, as well, out of  Judiciary Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from  Pennsylvania for her kindness.   All that will do is end separation of powers and basically say that  the courts--not because a petitioner or plaintiff has gone in but  because the Congress intercedes and wants the court to stop lifesaving  regulations that can be helpful to the American people.   Therefore, I know that we have to do our duty and be here today. I  honor, again, the men and women who serve in the United States military  and particularly those at Normandy on this day, of which I had the  privilege of being there some years ago.   Mr. Speaker, I end my remarks by saying that the American people need  us to be serious. Houstonians need us to be serious. Texans need us to  be serious. I am saying that no one's gas stove will be removed from  their house or their apartment, but we will offer you the ability and  the instruction to make sure that everything you have in your home is  safe for you and your family.
