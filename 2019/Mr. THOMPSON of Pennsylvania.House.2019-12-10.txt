 Mr. Speaker, yesterday I was pleased to  join 158 of my colleagues in sending a letter to Speaker Pelosi  highlighting the critical importance of the USMCA trade agreement.   It has been nearly 400 days since President Trump signed the  agreement with our two closest trading partners, and at long last, it  seems a vote may finally be in our near future. With less than 2 weeks  left in the legislative calendar, a vote is long overdue.   Farmers, ranchers, manufacturers, and everyone in between will  benefit from the passing of USMCA. USMCA will help increase market  opportunities, keeping trade free and fair, and the projected impact on  our Nation's agricultural industry is staggering.   Under this new, revamped agreement, U.S. agriculture exports are  expected to increase by more than $2 billion, annually, leading to an  estimated 325,000 additional jobs here at home. That is good news, not  just for our local rural communities, but for each and every American.   USMCA will help bring U.S. trade policy into the 21st century. Each  day that passes without a vote is leaving money and opportunity on the  table.                            ____________________
