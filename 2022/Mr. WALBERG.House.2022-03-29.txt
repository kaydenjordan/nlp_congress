 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the Securing a  Strong Retirement Act.   As an entire generation moves closer to retirement, we must ensure  our laws are up to date to help Americans achieve their retirement  goals.   Last Congress, we passed the SECURE Act, which made significant  improvements to our Nation's retirement policies. Today, we are  building upon that success to ensure Americans can live their golden  years with dignity.   I would like to highlight one provision of this bill, which  incorporates a bipartisan policy I have long championed with my  colleague, Representative Sablan. Our provision will reduce the  administrative costs for employers sponsoring retirement plans for  their employees.   Businesses often cite limited financial resources as a key reason for  not offering retirement benefits. The Retirement Plan Modernization Act  would ease the administrative burdens on employers, especially small  businesses, enabling more small businesses to offer retirement benefits  and ensure employees are not needlessly paying higher fees.   I thank both the Committee on Education and Labor and the Committee  on Ways and Means for including text from our bill in H.R. 2954.   Madam Speaker, the Securing a Strong Retirement Act will enhance  opportunities for Americans to save for retirement. I urge all Members  to support it.                                time  1700
