 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, on November 18 of last year, I came  here to speak about the Office of Net Assessment. That is an office  within the Pentagon. That office's purpose, under law, is to produce an  annual net assessment, which is supposed to be a long-term look at our  military's capability and those of our greatest adversaries. I don't  think it lives up to its mission.   In 2018, according to the Director of the Office of Net Assessment,  that office had not produced a net assessment since 2007. Not doing its  job for those 11 years and--who knows--possibly longer calls into  question whether this office should even exist. Yet a recent inspector  general report states that the office ``produces . . . highly  classified net assessments.'' I question the IG's conclusion based upon  available evidence that I know about, and I will give some of that  evidence.   In last year's speech here in the Senate and others that I have given  over the years on this subject, I discussed my oversight of this office  dating back to 2019. I also discussed my amendment to the national  defense bill. That amendment would have done one very simple thing:  required the Government Accountability Office to determine how much  taxpayer money the Office of Net Assessment actually uses for net  assessment--its purpose for existing. I want to know how much we can  cut from their budget to save the taxpayers money.   Apparently, this type of pro-taxpayer legislation was too much to ask  for. Accordingly, it appears that the Office of Net Assessment in the  Department of Defense gets to keep operating like a Pentagon slush fund  for irrelevant and political research projects.   On February 5, 2020, the Director of the Office of Net Assessment  told me:         We review all deliverables to ensure they're consistent       with the statement of work. We evaluate each deliverable to       assess whether we should seek additional information or       require a resubmission of commissioned work.    Now, I am going to return to that statement in a little bit, but I  want to give you some evidence of why what he said doesn't work out in  reality.   In December 2020, I asked the inspector general to take a deeper dive  into the Office of Net Assessment's contracting practices. That means  connecting all the dots in the contract transactions to ensure that  everything matches up. The inspector general reviewed 20 contracts. On  January 25 of this year, the inspector general issued its results and  found these three or four points:   Office of Net Assessment acquisition personnel inappropriately  performed contracting officer representative duties for 20 contracts.   Next point. Office of Net Assessment acquisition personnel and an  office providing contract support did not maintain complete contract  files, including preawards and contract administration documentation.  That also included the failure to maintain signed contracts and  modifications. Since 2019, I have repeatedly asked for a full  accounting of Stefan Halper's contracts. Either they never had one or  they have decided to obstruct Congress.   Next point. Office of Net Assessment acquisition personnel and an  office providing contract support inappropriately approved invoices for  payments totaling $9.8 million dollars due to the lack of oversight.  And that is just for the 20 contracts the inspector general sampled. So  without required supporting documentation for payment, the door is,  obviously, wide open to fraud, theft, and improper payments.   Next point. Without established and documented surveillance measures  for Office of Net Assessment service contracts, the Office of Net  Assessment may not have received all services outlined in a  contractor's statement of work.  [[Page S534]]    Next point--and last point. At this point, the next finding ought to  be no surprise from the inspector general. The Office of Net Assessment  did not administer contracts in accordance with the Federal Defense  Department and Washington Headquarters Services internal regulations  and policies.   Further, the audit states the ``[Office of Net Assessment]  acquisition personnel cannot verify whether they received services,  valued at $4.1 million, in accordance with the statement of work.''   Now, let's return back to that first quote I gave you from the  Director of Net Assessment.         We review all deliverables to ensure [that] they're       consistent with the statement of work. We evaluate each       deliverable to assess whether we should seek additional       information or require a resubmission of commissioned work.    Based upon all of the available evidence from these 20 contracts that  were inspected by the inspector general--and that is not all the  contracts that the office negotiated--this Director's statement is  absolutely false.   So here is the bottom line: The Office of Net Assessment has no clue  what they are paying for and whether they even received a complete work  product. And whatever they are actually doing, it is not in compliance  with Federal regulations, policy, and law.   This is a complete embarrassment and a slap in the face of American  taxpayers. While the Office of Net Assessment wasted millions of  dollars in taxpayer money every year, the communist Chinese Government  developed hypersonic missiles that can travel the globe.   If this unit isn't doing the job that they are supposed to, to assess  our national security capabilities and the capabilities of our enemies,  why are we still funding it? It would be better to take the $20 million  budget and give it to our servicemembers. At least we know that those  servicemembers have earned it.   A government slush fund will always be a government slush fund unless  Congress, with our power of oversight and appropriations, steps up and  fixes the problem. So I encourage my colleagues, especially those on  the Senate Armed Services Committee, to take a stand against this  blatant waste, fraud, abuse, and gross mismanagement.                            ____________________     Madam President, on another subject, I have come to  this floor several times in recent months--maybe over the course of a  couple of years--on my concerns about free speech on campus. There has  been a lot said in opposition to reports of crackdown on speech on  campuses, but today I come to the floor to give one shining example of  a university upholding expressions of free speech and making it still  happen.   This all started with former University of Chicago President Robert  Zimmer. The institution, starting with him and continuing, has  consistently pushed back on the trends of safe spaces, trigger  warnings, and the cancellation of invited speakers.   Instead, in a letter to all incoming freshmen, the University of  Chicago lays out its philosophy in plain English. In the letter to the  2020 freshman class, it said that one of the university's ``defining  characteristics is our commitment to freedom of inquiry and  expression.''   Now, this is more than just words; the university has consistently  followed through on this policy. Even today, the university is still  open to dissenting points of view. It even goes so far as to tell  freshmen ``at times this may challenge you and even cause discomfort.''   They are absolutely right. The point of college is not to be coddled.  The point of college or university is to learn. How can students do  that if they don't step out of their comfort zone?   I often say that my definition of a university is a place where  controversy should run rampant. At the University of Chicago, that  means noting that ``diversity of opinion and background is a  fundamental strength of our community.''   Both opinion and background are very important, and it defeats the  point to just have the one. Our universities cannot just have just a  veneer of diversity; the whole point of bringing in students of  different backgrounds is to get different points of view. That aim is  meaningless if all students who go to the college believe the same  things.   I have introduced several bills to provide transparency for  prospective students. My bills focus on transparency of cost, but in  many ways openness about a university's values are just as important.   So I congratulate former President Zimmer, who is doing just that and  putting his university's values on his sleeve. If some schools keep  cracking down on free speech and invited speakers, then the free market  will send their students elsewhere. That is because I don't think all  kids want to go to a school where they will never be challenged and  where their ideals will always be reaffirmed.   I am happy to see projects like the University of Austin, a newly  founded college dedicated to free speech principles.   So, in conclusion, it takes time to start new institutions. Instead,  we need people to stand up in the colleges that we already have. And I  hope others will join me in doing just that.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, today I pay tribute to a very dear  friend who was welcomed home to the Lord last month in Davenport, IA,  surrounded by his loving family.   Mike Duffy was a pillar in his community, church, and profession. A  born leader, Mike never met a stranger. He leaves the world a better  place, and he will be greatly missed by his family and friends,  including this U.S. Senator. He graced his community and congregation  with a larger than life presence. Mike wasn't born with a silver spoon  in his mouth; he was born with a heart of gold.   Mike grew up across the street from Sacred Heart Cathedral in  Davenport. A soldier of Christ, he lived the sacraments and his  Catholic faith in word and deed, practicing the Corporal Works of Mercy  with humility and purpose. He was steeped in Catholic education,  graduating from Sacred Heart Grade School, Assumption High School, and  St. Ambrose University.   When Mike was around age 11, I am guessing he went to confession to  ask forgiveness for a little white lie. That is around the time Mike  fibbed about his age to land a job as a paperboy for the Quad-City  Times. From there, Mike's tireless work ethic grew from one year to the  next. He soon joined the family business and never looked back.   His parents, John and Eleanor, moved to the Quad Cities to pursue the  American Dream. Here, they started a security business from scratch.  These risk-taking entrepreneurs were among my earliest supporters in  Scott County. Thanks to their support, they helped me gain a foothold  among local Republicans. Ever since, I have worked hard to earn and  grow grassroots support for my Senate campaigns in Scott County. I am  grateful that support continued through the branches of the family tree  with their son Mike.   As I mentioned, Mike was a go-getter from the get-go. He worked his  way up the ladder from the bottom rung, cleaning dog kennels. In high  school and through college, he continued climbing the work ladder at  the family business. He studied hard in school and learned as much from  the School of Hard Knocks. He enjoyed people from all walks of life and  treated everyone he encountered with respect and dignity.   Mike was frugal with his hard-earned money and generous with those  who needed it most. He was devout in his Catholic faith and devoted to  his bride Linda, with whom he enjoyed 48-\1/2\ years of marital bliss.  Their marriage was blessed with seven children: Brendon, Bridget,  Brianna, Bradley, Brian, Bethany, and son Ben, who passed away a year  to the day prior to his father's death.   Through the decades, Mike and Linda grew the family business  together. Mike wore many hats at the business, from dispatch  supervisor, to alarm manager, vice president of operations, executive  vice president, chief operating officer, president, and CEO. They grew  the business into the largest family-owned, full-service security  provider in the Midwest.   His professional life also included work as a licensed private  detective, holding U.S. Government Secret clearance. And still, Mike  had more to give beyond the workplace. An indefatigable civic leader,  Mike served on a slew of boards and committees, including alumni  president of St. Ambrose University, the Davenport Chamber of Commerce,  the Handicapped Development Center, and more.   His civic engagement made room for politics, as well. Throughout his  life, he supported conservative causes, championing pro-life and  Catholic education.   Our paths crossed countless times through the years. Barbara and I  very much enjoyed our decades-long friendship. Mike and Linda's  hospitality was second to none. Some years ago, the Duffys opened up  their home to me for an overnight visit. As it happens, I spend a lot  of nights on the road over the years for my 99 county meetings. It is a  treat to skip the hotel and be invited to stay in someone's home. It  was an even bigger treat to spend time discussing current events and  politics with Mike Duffy. On this particular visit, there was a bit of  excitement underfoot at the bustling Duffy household. The family was  making room for another addition, a duckling hatched the night of my  sleepover. So, naturally, Mike and the kids named the duck ``Chuck.''   Suffice it to say, I am going to miss his sense of humor.   Barbara and I send our heartfelt condolences to the entire Duffy  family, including 31 grandchildren. May his legacy of service and  citizenship continue to live on his community and through the growing  branches of the Duffy family tree. And may my brother in Christ rest in  eternal Happiness, joyfully in the arms of our Lord in everlasting  life.                            ____________________
