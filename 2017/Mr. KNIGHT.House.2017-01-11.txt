 Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 5, the  Regulatory Accountability Act of 2017.   Over the last 8 years, we have seen the administration authorize  hundreds of executive orders directing Federal agencies to issue,  finalize, and implement an unprecedented number of regulations. Most of  these impose one-size-fits-all standards on small businesses with  little to no consideration for their impact on small businesses.   As a member of the Small Business Committee, it is kind of my job to  go out and find out what small businesses have to offer, what is  impeding their ability to create and make more jobs for our industry  and for our economy. What we have found is that overregulation is  stifling them. This is the problem.   This is not something that we have made up. That is the problem in  this economy. That is why I am proud to support H.R. 5, and  particularly title III, which addresses one vital area that protects  small businesses--the Regulatory Flexibility Act, or RFA.   The RFA requires agencies to assess the economic impacts of new  regulations on small businesses. However, Federal agencies regularly  exploit loopholes in the RFA requirements that allow them to produce  inadequate or inaccurate analysis of impact.   We know this can have devastating outcomes, as witnessed in the  Department of Labor's overtime rule issued  [[Page H334]]  last year, which was one of the top concerns for many of the small  businesses and nonprofits that operate in my district and across this  country.   Title III of H.R. 5 would eliminate loopholes to ensure compliance  and would also require agencies to provide more detailed information in  each analysis.   I encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this  legislation.
