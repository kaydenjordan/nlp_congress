 Mr. Speaker, just over 1 year ago, we  entered a COVID crackdown. Businesses and schools shut their doors-- some of them, sadly, for good. Communities across the Nation continue  to feel this pain.   For more than 365 days, far too many of our Nation's school children  have been confined to virtual learning--forced to sit at home behind a  computer instead of a classroom.   The implications of students being left out of the classroom are much  bigger than parents being inconvenienced or students missing their  friends. Every day that we wait to reopen our schools is another day we  look the other way as youth mental health continues to plummet.   Every day we wait to reopen our schools is another day our students  fall behind.   Mr. Speaker, allowing American school children to return to the  classroom is long overdue.   It is time to listen to the science. It is time to put the students  first. And it is time to reopen our schools.                            ____________________
