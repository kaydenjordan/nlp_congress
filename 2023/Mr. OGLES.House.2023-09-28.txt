 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, when we fund specific programs, we should ask  ourselves one question: What is the real return on investment?   In the case of the Peace Corps, we are spending a little over $410  million. Is the investment worth it, given the rising costs of food and  gas? Is it appropriate for Congress to prioritize the Peace Corps over  our veterans, prioritize the Peace Corps over securing our border?   Keep in mind, my proposed cut is a modest cut. How is the Peace Corps  justifying its budget in light of financial hardships borne by millions  of Americans today?   In separate testimonies before the House Committee on Foreign  Affairs, Carol Spahn, the Peace Corps Director, pointed out the  agency's work on the following: helping illegals at the southern  border, promoting DEI amongst its volunteers, promoting COVID-19  vaccinations in low-income areas, and climate change adaptation, just  to name a few.   In the latter case, the Peace Corps is working to promote climate- smart approaches in agriculture and to focus on gender equity issues.  It is clear the Peace Corps has become more of an activist organization  than an organization determined to help people.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, best investments? This is the best we can do?  How about we invest in our veterans? How about we invest in our border?  How about we take care of America? I want to help those around the  world, but not at the expense of Americans.   It should be noted that the Peace Corps has a long and sordid history  of covering up sexual abuse of its participants. Think about that. Are  we going to aid and abet an agency, an organization, that has this  sordid past while our veterans suffer, while our border is open, while  we have migrants being abused on the border? I should think not.   This is a modest cut. It simply returns the funding back to pre-COVID  levels, merely a $14 million cut. We can do this.   At a time when Americans are suffering, at a time when interest rates  are high, gas has gone up, food is more expensive, surely we put  hardworking Americans first.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I would argue that the Gold Star families would  like us to invest in our veterans. I would argue the veterans who are  homeless would like for us to invest in our veterans.   When we look at the suicide rates among our servicemen and -women, we  should be investing in our veterans. To say that putting our veterans  first and using them as a pawn is offensive.   Mr. Chair, I ask my colleagues to support this. I ask that we put our  veterans and Americans first, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, if you want to come up with the right policy  position on an issue related to foreign affairs, talk to Antony Blinken  first, and then do the opposite.   We have all seen the Secretary's inability to be correct about any  major foreign policy concern for the last 20 years, whether that be  Iraq, Libya, Yemen, giving the Iranians $6 billion to deploy--as their  president says, ``wherever they need it''--or in Afghanistan.   He is undoubtedly one of the most professionally ineffective and  incompetent individuals to hold the title of Secretary of State. But if  incompetence by itself were sufficient grounds to a Senate-confirmed  Cabinet official, the President would have very few advisers left.   In the case of Secretary Blinken, it is about incompetence and  perhaps outright corruption. For instance, Secretary Blinken received  more than $5,000 in payment from the former Prime Minister of Pakistan,  who notably praised the Taliban.   He received more than $5,000 for speaking at a bank opening in China.   He offered advisory services to a Japanese company who invested  heavily in a CCP company that was blacklisted by Trump.   Let's take one more. Mr. Blinken's consulting firm, WestExec  Advisors, it advertised its ability to help American colleges secure  CCP donations without compromising their Pentagon research grants.  Think about that. Usurping America's rules for engagement with the CCP.   That advertisement, by the way, was removed just 2 weeks prior to Joe  Biden's acceptance of the Democratic Party's Presidential nomination.   We have since learned from the former acting CIA Director Mike  Morrell that the infamous spies who lie letter--a letter that impacted  our Presidential race--was led by no one other than Antony Blinken. The  letter was signed by 51 intelligence experts, and was intended,  according to Morrell, to give Joe Biden a way to refute the Hunter  Biden laptop story ahead of a Presidential debate.   You would think this would be worthy of investigation, if not  outright impeachment, but certainly defunding.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, serving the country or serving Hunter Biden?   Because we know through the work of Senators Johnson and Grassley,  that Hunter Biden kept his Burisma colleagues apprised of meetings and  emails he held with Mr. Blinken.   Mr. Blinken had previously said to Senate staffers that he wasn't  aware of any communications with Hunter Biden, aside from one in-person  meeting, which is a materially false statement and should subject him  to criminal penalties under 18 U.S.C. 1001.   Of course, the U.S. Congress never holds anyone accountable for  misleading Congress. Why tell the truth?   Mr. Chairman, Blinken has lied to Congress. He worked to prevent  critical information, including the July 2021 dissent cable from being  reviewed by this Chamber until confronted by the gentleman from Texas.   He clearly has a closer relationship with Hunter Biden than he led  on, and, further, engaged in questionable activities prior to serving  as Secretary of State, very little of which has been investigated or  vetted.   These questions deserve to be asked.   Mr. Chair, I urge adoption of this amendment and defunding of Mr.  Blinken. I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, William Holman, with the Holman rule, did  come up with a way to defund someone like the Secretary.   Back to the Secretary, there should be accountability for our botched  Afghanistan withdrawal and for helping establish the Islamist theocracy  that is in power there today. It is an insult to the memory of those  who lost their lives at Abbey Gate. This man is responsible, and he is  complicit.   Mr. Chair, I urge adoption of this amendment. He should be defunded.  Quite frankly, I would say he should be impeached.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I am a big proponent of Israel, our closest  ally in that region. Yet, this administration has stopped at nothing to  marginalize that relationship with the State of Israel.   When President Trump shuttered the U.S. consulate in Jerusalem, it  was a shot heard around the world. President Trump's action clarified  our diplomatic mission to Israel--the U.S. consulate was  inappropriately treated as something close to a de facto embassy to a  nonexistent Palestinian State.   By getting rid of the consulate, President Trump made it clear that  our only diplomatic outreach to that area is and should be the State of  Israel. In place of that consulate, the Trump administration  established the PAU, and housed its operations within the U.S. Embassy.  The PAU reported directly to the U.S. Ambassador to Israel and cannot  act independently of that Ambassador.   These actions created transparency in our foreign policy where there  was previously confusion. You would think that that would be  appreciated by both sides here. Unfortunately, you would be wrong.   Since taking office, the Biden administration has worked to roll back  progress initiated under President Trump by announcing the  administration's intent to reopen the consulate general.   Joe Biden has since closed the PAU in favor of the so-called Office  of Palestinian Affairs, an intended halfway step toward reestablishing  their consulate.   If you need further proof of the administration's intent, take note  that the Office of Palestinian Affairs, the OPA, doesn't report to our  ambassador in Jerusalem, it receives its instruction from the Bureau of  Near Eastern Affairs at the Department of State here in Washington.   Our commitment should be to Israel and Israel alone, not to the PLO.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, to my colleague, I thank her for the idea of  communication.   Mr. Chairman, we need communication with folks from around the world.  But as far as diplomatic missions, Mr. Chairman, we should be focused  on Israel.   The creation of the Office of Palestinian Affairs is an affront to  both our most important ally in the world and to U.S. law, which  clearly states that Jerusalem should be the undivided capital of  Israel, the Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995.   The OPA is, unfortunately, just the latest in a legacy of foreign  policy driven by an animus toward the State of Israel. This should be a  bipartisan bill. Israel is our greatest ally in that region, arguably,  one of our greatest allies in the world, and to diminish that is really  unjust.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, it is often the case in foreign relations  that symbolism is policy. What the Office of Palestinian Affairs  symbolizes is a destructive policy that will only serve to embolden the  enemies of Washington and Jerusalem.   Our friends in Israel are under attack daily from bombs lofted in the  air to attacks on the streets. To do anything but to have unwavering  diplomatic support really jeopardizes lives. It threatens their  sovereignty, and we must stand with our important ally, the State of  Israel.   Mr. Chairman, I urge the adoption of this bill. I urge my colleagues  for this to be unanimous, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I would just make a point of personal  privilege. My colleagues and I, across the aisle and here with me in  the Chamber, thank our staff for being here during these long days and  long nights. We thank them.   Mr. Chair, in August 2021, as America looked in horror at the  beginning of what would soon become the greatest foreign policy  disaster of the 21st century, then-Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan  praised the takeover of Kabul, joyfully proclaiming that the Taliban  had thrown off the shackles of slavery.   Some Americans may have been puzzled that Pakistan, designated major  non-NATO ally of the United States, would have been so bold as to  support America's enemies back in 2021.   However, a cursory look at Pakistan's history would clarify that this  country, a country whose many Islamist groups support attacks against  innocent civilians, has always supported terrorism and terrorist  groups.   The Haqqani Network, a designated foreign terrorist organization  whose members now play a role of kingmaker in Afghanistan, is a proxy  of Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence, or ISI, and has been for  decades.   Along with many elements of the Taliban, the network was regularly  given safe haven in Pakistan to operate and evade apprehension. The  coordination between the Haqqani Network and Pakistan was so strong  that in 2011, then-chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral  Mullen, described the network as a veritable arm of the Pakistani  intelligence.   The Haqqani Network is guilty of horrific terrorist attacks against  U.S. servicemembers. Perhaps not coincidentally, it was the Haqqani  Network who was put in charge by the Taliban of security of Kabul 1  week before the tragedy at Abbey Gate that claimed the lives of 13 U.S.  servicemembers and wounded many more.   Mr. Chair, I urge adoption, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, like my colleague, I too believe in great  relationships and dialogues, but when you are in a relationship with a  country that consistently undermines and attacks you, then maybe that  is not a relationship that is worth being in. Because of billions upon  billions of assistance to Pakistan, we learned a few things. First,  insofar as Pakistan goes after terrorists, it does so selectively. It  often targets those who are allied with our friends in India.   Second, despite the enormous financial leverage we have historically  had with Islamabad, we cannot obtain several key concessions, including  the release of Dr. Shakil Afridi, a man who assisted in the capture of  Osama bin Laden.   Instead, Pakistan has conditioned the release of Afridi on us  releasing a known terrorist. Little wonder that President Trump  canceled $300 million in security aid to Pakistan back in 2018 due to  its horrific record of going after militants in the border region  between Pakistan and Afghanistan.                                time  1330    They are an adversary in the region, and I am not talking about the  people, but the government in control undermines the United States, our  interests, and even our partner India.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, all this amendment aims to do is continue  mainstream U.S. policy in this Department of State and Foreign  Operations bill.   The 2021 Country Report on Terrorism regarding Pakistan highlighted,  once again, Pakistan's continued listing as a jurisdiction with  strategic deficits in its AML/CFT system.   Pakistan does not sufficiently support anti-money laundering efforts  and it does not support laying waste to terrorists in the border  region. In a Gallup poll of Pakistanis it reflected that 72 percent of  Pakistanis see us as an enemy. We spend billions and billions of  dollars, they attack us, and they see us as an enemy.   There are many needs that this country has, that our veterans have,  that our borders have, and it is money that could be spent better  elsewhere.   There is no reason for us to continue to subsidize Pakistan or any  function of its government until it changes its posture.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, may I inquire how much time I have.    Mr. Chairman, bleeding hearts can argue all they want  about wanting to support Pakistan despite their overwhelming support  for terrorism within and outside its borders. I would say our money is  better spent elsewhere.   For what it is worth, according to a classified Pakistani Government  document publicly released last month, the Biden administration  apparently encouraged the overthrow of the former Prime Minister of  Pakistan because he didn't want that country to abandon its neutrality  stance on Ukraine.   Ladies and gentlemen, it is important that we take a stand against  terrorists and terrorist states. If they are going to be our ally, if  they are going to receive hard-earned American dollars, then they  should act like our ally. That is all I am requesting here.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, April 15, 2019, under the leadership of  President Trump, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps was designated a  foreign terrorist organization.   That is important because the IRGC is guilty of killing and injuring  thousands of Americans. They maintain the largest inventory of  ballistic missiles in the region. They have developed a range of  unmanned aerial vehicles, UAVs. They support terrorists in Yemen like  Hezbollah and Hamas, oftentimes in violation of international  sanctions.   They wield considerable influence on the government of Iraq and  frequently threaten the very existence of our ally and our partner, the  State of Israel, like they did earlier this month.   The President of Iran just used the U.N. General Assembly as a  backdrop for calling for the assassination of an American citizen or  American citizens and cited the elimination of Soleimani, the former  head of the IRGC, as justification.   Iran will employ all tools and capacities in order to bring justice,  they said, to the perpetrator and all those who had a hand in  Soleimani's killing.   These are the words of an enemy, and we should spend no funds in  overturning that designation. This should be a bipartisan bill. It  should have a vote.   Mr. Chair, I urge adoption of this amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I support the chairman, and I want to put a  finer point on it.   In front of the U.N. General Assembly, and I continue, they will  ``not rest until that is done,'' that being death to Americans. ``The  blood of the oppressed will not be forgotten, and the ropes of the  guilty will bring them to justice.''   These folks intend to kill Americans. These folks intend to topple  and attack our ally, which is Israel, and I will not stand for it.   I stand before you, Mr. Chair, and ask adoption of this amendment. I  urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle--this should not be a  partisan issue. We are talking about the lives of Americans.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
