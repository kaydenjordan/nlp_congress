 Madam Speaker, I speak tonight about the advocacy and  the positives we have of hydroelectric dams in my home State and in our  country. They provide hydroelectric power, which is green power, which  is renewable power. Yet, that seems to be forgotten these days when  they are more and more trying to remove hydroelectric dams from our  grid.   It is clean power; it is available 24 hours a day. You don't have to  wait for the sun to come up or wind to blow.   Hydroelectric dams have several multiple use purposes, such as  storing water for people or for agriculture. That water is available  for dipping out of when you have aircraft that need to get water supply  for fighting forest fires like we have over a million acres of in my  home State, in Northern California.   Water transfers can help with the wildlife; with helping to have  switches so that they can have water for aquatic species, for swapping  during the year.   So why are we wanting to remove hydroelectric dams?   In California, we even have issues with having to shut off power  usage, what is called flex alerts. What is even funnier is that you  have shut them off from 3 to 9 p.m. on charging your electric car.   So we should utilize our hydroelectric dams and all the multiple  positive uses they have, and not tear them out, like on the Klamath  Basin.                            ____________________
