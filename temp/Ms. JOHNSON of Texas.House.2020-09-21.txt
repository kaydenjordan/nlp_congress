 Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of the  National Suicide Hotline Designation Act, which I have led in the House  with my colleagues Congressmen Chris Stewart, Seth Moulton, and Greg  Gianforte. I am so pleased that we are considering this critical  legislation on the floor today, in honor of September as Suicide  Prevention Month.   As a former chief psychiatric nurse, I have spent my legislative  career advocating for more accessible mental health resources in our  communities, especially considering the significant needs in these  difficult times. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  reported that in late June, 40 percent of American adults struggled  with mental health or substance abuse during the COVID-19 pandemic.  Specifically, it reported that communities of color, essential workers,  younger adults, and unpaid caregivers had disproportionately worse  mental health outcomes and elevated suicidal ideation.   This is exactly why I am determined to pass this bill, as it directs  the Federal Communications Commission to designate 9-8-8 for the  national suicide prevention and mental health crisis hotline system. It  also provides the necessary state funding guidance, federal reporting,  and specialized service training to effectively implement the new  dialing code. This three-digit phone number--instead of a full ten- digit number--is much easier to remember, especially when you or a  loved one are in a crisis and in need of help. As such, this redesigned  and upgraded suicide prevention lifeline will save lives.   As the country's mental health and suicide crises have worsen during  the COVID-19 pandemic, Congress has an urgent responsibility to fulfill  the promise of 9-8-8 and develop a modern mental health and suicide  prevention crisis hotline system. I am especially proud of the efforts  in this legislation to support communities at higher risk of suicide,  including veterans and LGBTQ youth. This new system will include the  Veterans Crisis Line to specifically support veterans seeking mental  health support. The bill also authorizes states to collect a fee  designated solely to supporting local crisis call centers affiliated  within the national network, which includes the Suicide and Crisis  Center of North Texas in my district. This provision will ensure that  the local call centers experiencing increased call volume due to the  more accessible dialing code will have the financial resources needed  to expand their operations and serve all who are seeking help.   We must not allow the tragedies of this coronavirus to be compounded  by preventable losses of life due to mental health distress. As a  former mental health professional, I am proud to support the passage of  the National Suicide Hotline Designation Act, and I thank my colleagues  for their collaboration on such a critical and timely effort. I urge my  colleagues to vote in favor of this bill.                                time  1715
