 Mr. Speaker, it is often said that there are  inefficiencies and waste in the Federal Government. Well, I am here to  recognize the most efficient grant writing program in the Federal  Government: The Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program, marking its  20th anniversary.   The AFG program, along with its sister programs SAFER and Fire  Prevention Grants, help deliver training, manpower, and desperately  needed equipment straight to where they are most needed. Communities  across America have benefited from these programs over the past 20  years; all of this with hardly any overhead costs.   It is a well-run program. Why? Well, because it is largely run by the  fire service.   Throughout my time in Congress, it has been a true honor to have  visited well over 100 fire departments in my district. These are some  of my favorite visits. And you see the best of America in these  everyday heroes.   On a final note, I thank Chief Jeff Cash, Jason Wofford, and Ryan  Cole for teaching my AFG grant classes throughout the years.   I would encourage my colleagues to do likewise to ensure their fire  services are well taken care of with the best training and equipment  they deserve.   Thank you to the AFG program and to the fire service.                            ____________________
