 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Dr. Ngozi Ezike,  a dedicated public servant whose last day as director of the Illinois  Department of Public Health was yesterday.   For the past 3 years, Dr. Ezike worked tirelessly to protect the  health and well-being of the people of Illinois, including leading our  State's public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In spite of  historic challenges, she remained dedicated to her job and making sure  that the people of Illinois always had the most accurate information  about how to best protect themselves and their families.   Amid an onslaught of social media misinformation and conspiracy  theories, Dr. Ezike helped make sure that Illinois' COVID response  operated in reality and was grounded in science. She always made sure  that the scientists and public health experts were heard by our elected  officials.   Dr. Ezike is a trailblazer--not only because she was Illinois' first  Black woman to serve as the director of the department of public health  but because she was called to lead a Statewide public health response  to an unprecedented pandemic, and she did not blink.   There is no doubt that her work helped save lives in Illinois. So on  behalf of the people of our State, I thank Dr. Ezike for her service,  and I wish her nothing but the best in whatever she decides to do next.                   Community Projects: Clean Drinking Water     Madam Speaker, for decades the city of Joliet has lived  under the threat of unsafe drinking water from lead pipes used in  service lines to individual homes. In recent years, the lowering of the  water tables has threatened even the long-term availability of drinking  water to Joliet, and that is why I am so proud that the Federal omnibus  recently passed by Congress included $3.5 million for the city of  Joliet to help tap into Lake Michigan as the primary source of drinking  water and to accelerate the replacement of lead service lines, thereby  helping to secure clean and safe drinking water for the entire Joliet  community for decades to come.   Altogether, our office secured nearly $19 million for very worthwhile  projects in Illinois' 11th District that will benefit our entire  community, and this will be taxpayer money well spent.                     Community Projects: Stepping Stones     Madam Speaker, for decades substance abuse disorder has  torn apart families in Will County and around the country. Often  families with young children had nowhere to turn to. That is why I am  so proud that the Federal omnibus recently passed by Congress included  $2 million for Stepping Stones--a nonprofit that provides clinical  services and recovery support for those seeking treatment for substance  use disorders so that they can build new housing units for women  seeking treatment.   Altogether, our office secured nearly $19 million for very worthwhile  projects in Illinois' 11th District that will benefit our entire  community, and this will be taxpayer money well spent.                    Community Projects: Affordable Housing     Madam Speaker, for decades, Will County has grappled with  issues of affordable housing, an issue that has become more and more  important in communities large and small across our country.   That is why I am so proud that the Federal omnibus recently passed by  Congress included $3 million for the Housing Authority of Joliet to  help turn a shuttered golf course into quality, affordable housing for  hardworking families who deserve access to the dream of homeownership.   Altogether, our office secured nearly $19 million for very worthwhile  projects in Illinois' 11th District that will benefit our entire  community, and this will be taxpayer money well spent.                  Community Projects: The Old Joliet Prison     Madam Speaker, for decades the Old Joliet Prison has  served as the backdrop of Hollywood movies like ``The Blues Brothers''  and hit TV shows like ``Prison Break.'' But years of neglect have left  the site unsafe and closed to visitors.  [[Page H3716]]    That is why I am so proud that the Federal omnibus recently passed by  Congress included $3 million for the Joliet Area Historical Museum so  that they can rehabilitate the site of the Old Joliet Prison and make  it safe for visitors once again and enhance its potential as a tourist  attraction. This project is shovel-ready and will help create and  sustain much-needed construction jobs while restoring a historically  and culturally significant site in an economically challenged part  of the city.    Altogether, our office secured nearly $19 million for very worthwhile  projects in Illinois' 11th District that will benefit our entire  community, and this will be taxpayer money well spent.             Community Projects: Aurora Quad County Urban League     Madam Speaker, for decades, America has faced a deficit  of job training opportunities from underserved and underrepresented  communities, and that is why I am so proud that the Federal omnibus  recently passed by Congress included $425,000 for the Aurora Quad  County Urban League so that they can launch a youth careers program in  Aurora to connect young people with jobs and apprenticeship  opportunities in construction, transportation, distribution of  logistics, and all fields facing an increase in and need for Federally  trained workers.                            ____________________
