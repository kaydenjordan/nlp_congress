 Mr. Speaker, this week, while gas prices  remain near record levels across the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,  President Biden has chosen to spend his time meeting with Saudi Arabia  instead of American energy producers.   By canceling the Keystone XL pipeline, and by refusing to allow new  drilling leases here in the U.S., the current administration has  declared a war on American energy. Instead of using cleaner and less  expensive American energy, President Biden is now turning to OPEC to  drill the oil that we so desperately need.   Because of skyrocketing inflation, American families are spending an  extra $5,000 a year on everyday items. Right now, Americans are pulling  up to the gas pump, and after filling their tank, they don't have money  to buy their kids lunch.   To get our Nation back on track, we need to rely on American energy,  not Saudi Arabia. We need to unleash American energy, and we need to  return to American energy dominance.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, first of all, I thank  Representative   Mike Kelly for holding this Special Order.   What a pivotal summer we have seen as the United States Supreme  Court, after almost five decades, has overruled the terror of Roe v.  Wade.   We all know that all life is sacred. As a doctor, I swore an oath  first to do no harm, and for me as a doctor, that meant refusing to  ever be involved in performing abortions or any abortion procedures.  Now, as a legislator, it means working each and every day to protect  and stand for human life.   Even after this historic Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe v.  Wade, there is still work to be done to protect human life here in the  United States. Our Declaration of Independence states that life,  liberty, and the pursuit of happiness are unalienable rights given to  all of us by our creator, and government is created to protect these  rights. Government is created to protect life, liberty, and the pursuit  of happiness.   We must all, as legislators, stand for life, and we must continue to  fight for the unborn.    The sanctity of human life is an inherent part of America from our  founding days, and it must be protected today and into the future.   Again, I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania, my colleague and my  friend, for doing this Special Order this evening and allowing all of  America to hear how we stand behind the sanctity of human life.
