 Mr. Speaker, I think I would like to raise the  question, what would Abraham Lincoln do, a man who faced the turmoil of  a divided Nation. I think he would look for an individual like General  Mr. Lloyd Austin, someone who had had the balance of seeing life as a  civilian but being an impeccable leader of the United States military.   Mr. Speaker, before I came to this floor, I walked down Independence  Avenue to greet the young men and women in the National Guard who had  come here from Texas. I wanted to let them know how important it was  for them to be here to defend the citadel of democracy and how grateful  we were that we had a peaceful transition of power yesterday.   What I see in Mr. Austin is a recognition that civilian control of  the military has been a bedrock principle of our democracy since the  founding of our Republic. Yet, at the same time, in the backdrop of the  last 4 years, I think he is needed for two reasons.   One, the military has faced an enormous amount of instability. They  were called ``suckers'' and ``losers.'' Generals were criticized. So  you need someone who is a military person's military person, someone  they know is part of the team.   Then you need someone who can build that morale. Yes, we had morale  in the previous administration of President Barack Obama, having  respected them. Now, I believe we must give President Joe Biden the  opportunity for his Secretary of Defense.   Mr. Speaker, I am grateful for my colleagues on the other side of the  aisle who will support this concept, knowing that we believe that  civilian control of the military is a bedrock.   I do think that we cannot call this a precedent. One and two is not a  precedent. I do think we can look at maybe some other definitions of  what it means.   But a man who is able to end a war of 150,000 soldiers coming home is  a man who can lead the United States military in a spirit of lifting  the morale, providing stability, and calling them the brave men and  women that they are.   Let's support the waiver. Vote ``yes'' on this resolution.   Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Committees on the Judiciary  and on Homeland Security, I rise in support of H.R. 335, which provides  an exception to a limitation against appointment of persons as  Secretary of Defense within seven years of relief from active duty as a  regular commissioned officer of the Armed Forces so that President  Biden can nominate retired four-star Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III to serve  as the next Secretary of Defense.   Gen. Austin retired from active duty in 2016, which under current law  (10 U.S.C. Sec. 113(a)), makes him ineligible for appointment as  Secretary of Defense.   Civilian control of the military has been a bedrock principle of our  democracy since the founding of the Republic.   That principle has served the nation well and we should depart from  it only where there is compelling reason to do so.   Indeed, in the history of the Department of Defense, the only Defense  Secretary ever given a waiver was then-Secretary of State, General  George Marshall--who was provided an individual waiver in 1950 at the  height of the Korean War in a stand-alone bill approved by the  Congress.   That is why I did not support granting waiver for General Mattis to  be nominated as Secretary of Defense in the last administration. Even  General Mattis is a great general and a great American and served well  as Secretary of Defense.   But the experience of the last four years leads me to a different  result today.   For four years, the Department of Defense has had to deal with  attempts by the last President and his staff to undermine the  independence and capability of the Department of Defense, going so far  as to refer to the men and women who risk their lives to keep us free  as ``suckers'' and ``losers'' and appointing unqualified persons as  Acting Secretary of Defense and to other senior positions.   The Pentagon needs--the United States needs--an experienced, Senate- confirmed Secretary of Defense to restore morale and regularity as soon  as possible.   I agree with President Biden that Gen. Austin's many strengths and  intimate knowledge of the Department of Defense and our government are  uniquely matched to the challenges and crises we face.   The next Secretary of Defense will need to immediately quarterback an  enormous logistics operation to help distribute COVID-19 vaccines  widely and equitably.   General Austin oversaw the largest logistical operation undertaken by  the Army in six decades--the Iraq drawdown of 150,000 service  personnel.  [[Page H216]]    The next Secretary of Defense will need to ensure the well-being and  resilience of our servicemembers and their families, strained by almost  two decades of war.   General Austin knows the incredible cost of war and the hardships  experienced by the families that pay it.   The next Secretary of Defense will have to make sure that our armed  forces reflect and promote the full diversity of our nation.   General Austin is uniquely qualified to lead and oversee this effort  to ensure that every member of the armed forces is treated with dignity  and respect, including Black, Latino, Asian American, Native American,  women, and LGBTQ+ service members.   General Austin, who was born in Mobile, Alabama and raised in  Thomasville, Georgia, graduated from the United States Military Academy  with a Bachelor of Science degree in 1975 and rose through the Army's  ranks during his distinguished and trailblazing career, becoming only  the sixth African American to attain the rank of an Army four-star  general, and over his nearly four-decade military career, challenged  his beloved institution to grow more inclusive and more diverse at  every step.   General Austin was the first African American general officer to lead  an Army corps in combat and the first African American to command an  entire theater of war, and if confirmed, will be the first African  American to helm the Defense Department, which will signal to every  American and every member of the Armed Forces that the country they  pledge the last full measure of devotion is one of endless  possibilities.   Any lingering concerns I may have about injuring the sacred principle  of civilian control over the military have been laid to rest by the  Armed Services Committee Chairman Smith's representations that General  Austin has assured him that he understands this crucial principle and  that he is completely committed to upholding it.   In addition, Chairman Smith represents that General Austin has agreed  to appear before the members of the House Armed Services Committee to  address the issue, and he has already spoken to numerous House members  and made it clear that he will ensure that civilian control of the  military is maintained.   Finally, President Biden has also already expressed his intent to  nominate civilians with strong backgrounds and expertise to fill the  roles of Deputy Secretary of Defense, Under Secretary of Defense for  Policy, and Chief of Staff to the Secretary of Defense.   Mr. Speaker, we also cannot overlook the impact of January 6, 2021 on  the decision we are called upon to make.   On that day, the U.S. Capitol, was attacked and breached by angry mob  of insurrectionists, comprised of an inordinate number of white  supremacists and white nationalists, intent on preventing the Congress  from carrying out its constitutionally imposed responsibility of  counting electoral votes and announcing the election of the President  and Vice-President.   This represent a dangerous escalation in the activities of what FBI  Director Wray testified to Congress is the greatest domestic terror  threat facing the nation.   Equally disturbing is that troubling evidence continues to emerge  that the military itself has servicemembers sympathetic to extreme  views and white supremacist causes.   The appointment of the first African American to lead the Department  of Defense in the nation's history will send a powerful signal that  racism, anti-Semitism, misogyny, homophobia, and other divisive, anti- social, and anti-American attitudes and actions have no place in the  Armed Forces and will not be tolerated.   For all of these reasons, I urge all Members to join me in voting for  H.R. 335, granting the waiver needed to pave the way for Secretary- designate Lloyd J. Austin III to serve as Secretary of Defense.                       [From the Hill, Jan. 19, 2021]   Lloyd Austin is the Right Nominee for Defense Secretary and the Right                           Leader for This Moment          (By Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D-TX), Opinion Contributor)         As a senior member of Congress and a senior member of the       House Homeland Security Committee, I know the importance of       domestic security and the defense of our nation. Retired       General Austin, I believe, can bring that balance and that is       why he deserves a congressional waiver to become President-      elect Biden's secretary of Defense. I am going to support       President-elect Joe Biden's nomination of retired General       Lloyd Austin as the 28th U.S. secretary of Defense.        First, let me acknowledge that I did not support giving a       waiver to General James Mattis to become the secretary of       Defense nominated by President Donald J. Trump in 2017. My       opposition was not because I did not have respect for General       Mattis who might have warranted such a waiver, but it was       rather because of the view that I had of the United States       military at that time. President Barack Obama handed off to       the Trump administration a military that was strong in morale       and a stable organization. After all, the military under his       command was able to capture our greatest enemy--Osama bin       Laden. His capture was an enormous boost to the Pentagon and       to the overall military rank and file. Military personnel and       families were treated with dignity and their needs were       responded to expeditiously. Certainly, improvement could have       been made, but generally the United States military was in       very good shape. On the other hand, in 2020, my concern is       that throughout the last four years the military has been       under attack by negative comments on generals and by a       succession of secretaries of Defense. There is a great need       to bring in a person who can first of all boost the morale of       our men and women in uniform who sacrifice their lives on       behalf of the people of this nation, and their families every       day. Secondarily, now we need stability and a firm hand that       shows the balance between the needs of the military and       guidance as a civilian leader. I believe after listening to       Mr. Austin in our conversation, it is clear that his view of       the role of the secretary of Defense is solidly based on the       fact that the Commander in Chief is his boss and will be the       guiding force on the policies and on the vision for action.       This is a time for impeccable leadership to bring about a       morality boost and stability to our men and women in uniform.       And for that reason, I truly believe this is a distinct and       different time, and that General Austin who has been a       civilian for a good period of time knows the role of a       civilian leader and will act accordingly. I believe more that       this is the right decision at the right time.        Lloyd Austin, a retired General, is an accomplished and       respected trailblazer in the United States Army. He is a       trusted and crisis-tested leader who has broken barriers in       his historic ascent to the highest ranks of the military.       With more than 40 years of service, Retired General Lloyd       Austin is a deeply experienced and highly decorated commander       who has served with distinction in several of the Pentagon's       most crucial roles. He is a son of the South born in Mobile,       Ala., and grew up in Thomasville, Ga. He graduated from West       Point United States Military Academy and later earned degrees       from Auburn University, Webster University, the Army Command       and General Staff College and the Army War College.        Mr. Lloyd Austin was promoted to Lieutenant General in 2006       and assumed command of the XVIII Airborne Corps at Fort       Bragg. And in 2009 he handed over his command to become the       Director of the Joint Staff. He retired from the U.S. Army in       2016 as the first African American to serve as Commander of       CENTCOM, the U.S. Central Command, where he oversaw America's       military strategy and joint operations throughout the Middle       East and in Afghanistan.        He was the chief architect of the military campaign to       defeat the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria and became the       second highest ranking commander in Iraq, taking command of       the Multi-National Corps--Iraq.        Mr. Lloyd Austin is highly decorated with many awards and       decorations including medals for Defense Distinguished       Service Medals, Army Distinguished Service Medals, a Silver       Star, Defense Superior Service Medals, and a Legion of Merit       medal.        If confirmed, Lloyd Austin will become the first African       American secretary of Defense which culminates a barrier-      breaking career as the first African American general officer       to command an Army Division in combat, to lead a Corps in       combat, to command an entire theater of war, and to serve as       Commander of U.S. Central Command.        Secretary-designate Austin has proven and demonstrated       extraordinary leadership across a lifetime of distinguished       service and is well prepared to lead our nation's military as       a strong and dedicated civilian leader.        The nation needs a leader over the Pentagon that respects       civilian control, to build up morale of our armed forces, and       bring consistency, stability, and leadership at the highest       level to the Department of Defense. That is Lloyd Austin,       retired General. Further, as an African American woman, I       believe this historic moment will further heal and unify the       nation.        Secretary-designate Lloyd Austin has previously been       confirmed by the Senate because of his impeccable commitment       to duty and his reputation. As a proud American who loves his       country just as much out of uniform as in uniform, he       deserves a waiver by the Congress and deserves to be       confirmed for this critical role of overseeing our military       forces and protecting our great nation. Retired General Lloyd       Austin is an example of why America is still that ``shining       city on the hill'' and why he should be confirmed by the       United States Senate for secretary of Defense. Retired       General Lloyd Austin is the right person for this right and       momentous time in our nation's history.
