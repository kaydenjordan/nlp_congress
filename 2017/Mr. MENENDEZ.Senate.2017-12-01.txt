 Mr. President, I am here to support the motion offered  by Senator Cantwell, to speak out against a tax bill that is nothing  short of highway robbery on New Jerseyans.   This tax plan is about one thing. It is about cutting taxes for  wealthy corporations and asking working families to pay for it. It is  especially bad for middle-class families in New Jersey, New York,  Washington, Maryland, and other high-earning States that make bold  investments in education, that drive the most innovation, that generate  the most Federal revenue.   Don't let the Republicans fool you if they airdrop an amendment at  the last minute that throws a few crumbs at New Jersey families and  call it a victory. Carve-outs, caps, and exceptions are nothing but  gimmicks meant to distract the public from what is really going on. No  matter how you slice it, gutting or even limiting the State and local  tax deduction is a direct assault on middle-class families in America's  highest earning, most economically productive States. By gutting the  SALT deduction, Republicans will literally force millions of middle- class families across America to pay taxes on their taxes.   In 2015 alone, nearly 1.8 million New Jersey households deducted a  combined $32 billion in State, local, and property taxes from their  Federal tax bill. These families aren't living large. They are middle- class folks who had to work hard for every dollar they have. In fact,  IRS data shows that more than 85 percent of taxpayers who claim the  SALT deduction make under $200,000 a year and over half make under  $100,000 a year. So it is wrong to ask millions of Americans who had to  fight their way into the middle class to pay more just  [[Page S7663]]  so big corporations can pay less, and rubbing salt in their wounds is  the fact that Republicans let corporations keep on deducting their  State and local taxes on top of the huge tax cuts lavished on them by  this tax plan.   If deducting State and local taxes is so important for big  corporations that make billions of dollars each year, Republicans  should understand why it is so important for middle-class families in  cities and suburbs across America. That is why I am offering this  motion with Senator Cantwell to send the bill back to committee to fix  this fatal flaw and restore the SALT deduction. If it is good enough  for huge corporations, it should be good enough for middle-class  families.   I have heard many of my Republican colleagues complain about the SALT  deduction as if it is some subsidy for States like New Jersey, and that  hypocrisy is just amazing to me. Far from subsidizing successful States  like New Jersey or New York, the SALT deduction actually benefits the  entire Nation, which is able to share in the economic rewards created  by the high-powered economies of States like New Jersey, and now  Republicans want to take even more. Well, we are sick and tired of it,  and we want our money back.   I will make a deal with any Republican from a taker State. Since you  are so opposed to subsiding other States, how about you take all of the  extra Federal dollars you receive beyond what you pay and transfer it  back to donor States like New Jersey? Sound like a deal? I don't think  so.   Each and every year, States like New Jersey, New York, and Virginia  generate billions of dollars in Federal revenue that go to Americans in  less productive, lower income States that are more reliant, more  dependent on Federal spending. They are America's economic powerhouses,  America's donor States, precisely because they invest in public  education, law enforcement, mass transit, infrastructure, and economic  opportunity for all.   It is no surprise that everyone from the Fraternal Order of Police to  the American Hospital Association, to AARP support keeping the State  and local tax deduction. Taking it away is a direct threat to the  funding States need to educate our kids, keep cops on the beat, equip  first responders and firefighters, and provide healthcare to the most  vulnerable--all this just to give big corporations big tax cuts.   If multinational corporations get to keep deducting their State and  local taxes, there is no reason to stop millions of middle-class  Americans from doing the same. Make no mistake, any reduction in the  State and local tax deduction is a direct assault on America's highest  earning, most innovative, most economically productive States. Guess  what. All Americans will lose out when America's economic powerhouse  States aren't so powerful anymore.   I urge my colleagues to stop punishing success, stop interfering in  State government decisions, and join me in protecting the SALT  deduction. Vote for the motion to recommit.   I yield the floor    Mr. President, I intend to offer the following motion  to H.R. 1, and I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the  Record. The motion is supported by Senators Cantwell, Van Hollen,  Cardin, and Booker.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                     Motion to Commit With Instructions         Mr. Menendez moves to commit the bill H.R. 1 to the       Committee on Finance with instructions to report the same       back to the Senate in 3 days, not counting any day on which       the Senate is not in session, with changes that--        (1) are within the jurisdiction of such committee; and        (2) would eliminate the repeal of the State and local tax       deduction if State and local spending on investments in       Medicaid and other health care, infrastructure, or services       for children or seniors, education, or law enforcement is       reduced or taxes on the middle class are increased.     Mr. President, I have a motion to commit at the desk.    Mr. President, I rise once again to stand up for the  good people of New Jersey and other States to offer a motion to restore  the State and local tax, or SALT, deduction.   Ending the SALT deduction will subject millions of middle-class  families to double taxation, but that is not all. It will also set the  stage for huge cuts to education, law enforcement, infrastructure,  public health, and other critical services. But don't take my word for  it. Listen to the teachers and police officers, the doctors and nurses  and firefighters.   The National Education Association opposes it because it will hurt  our public schools. The Fraternal Order of Police and the National  Sheriffs' Association oppose it because it will make our streets less  safe. The American Medical Association and the American Hospital  Association oppose it because people will lose access to healthcare.  The AARP opposes it because it will lead to cuts in Medicare and  Medicaid and hurt our seniors. Even the New Jersey Chamber of Commerce  opposes it because it will hinder investments in the infrastructure  that businesses need in order to compete.   My motion to commit would restore the SALT deduction if these all too  predictable consequences happen. A corporate tax cut cannot build a  road, care for a senior, teach a child, or help keep our streets safe.  If corporations can keep the State and local tax deduction, so should  middle-class families. We cannot afford to roll the dice and risk these  investments in the middle class.   I urge the adoption of the motion to commit, and I ask for the yeas  and nays.
