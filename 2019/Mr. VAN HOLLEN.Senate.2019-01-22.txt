 Mr. President, on December 11 of last year, at a  meeting at the White House, President Trump said he would be  ``proud''--``proud''--to shut down the government of the United States  if he didn't get things 100 percent his way. Then, 11 days later, on  December 22, President Trump shut down the government.   We are now 32 days into the longest government shutdown in the  history of the United States, and I say to President Trump: That is  nothing to be proud of.   The damage is growing by the day in every part of our country and  across different sectors of our economy. It is estimated that the  partial government shutdown is now costing the economy $6 billion every  week. Eight hundred thousand Federal employees are going without pay,  and this coming Friday will mark the second full pay period in which  they get pay stubs with a big fat goose egg on them.   Hundreds of thousands of those Federal employees are working every  day without pay, and hundreds of thousands of them have been locked out  of work and want to get back to doing the business of the American  people but are prohibited from doing so because of the government  shutdown. So as a result of their inability to go to work, there are  tens of millions of our fellow Americans who are losing access to vital  government services.   There is nothing to be proud of in shutting out a whole sector of  service contract employees and small businesses that provide support  services to the Federal Government.   I am going to go into a little more detail in a moment, but small  businesses around this country that depend on the Small Business  Administration for loans or because they do business with the Federal  Government are getting absolutely clobbered. That is nothing to be  proud of.   It is not anything to be proud of that so many Federal employees are  not able to make their rent or mortgage payments or the monthly tuition  installment payments for their children's college education or for  other provisions they want to provide for their family.   Now, sadly, this Senate is complicit in the shutdown. Let me actually  rephrase that. The majority in the Senate is complicit in the shutdown  because we have not been allowed a vote on two bills that are on the  Senate calendar that we could vote on today and would reopen the  government.   I have one of those bills right here. I have brought it to the floor  in the past. It is a bill that would open eight of the nine Federal  Departments that have nothing to do with the Homeland Security  Department or border security or a wall--eight of the nine of them.  This bill is sitting on the Senate calendar. We could vote on it today,  and yet the majority leader refuses to bring it up for a vote.   The great irony is that this bill that is on the Senate calendar  contains provisions that have already been supported in the Senate by  overwhelming bipartisan majorities. A big part of this bill includes  about four Federal Departments where we voted by 92 to 6 on the funding  levels for the whole fiscal year until the end of September. In other  cases, what is in this bill passed the Senate Appropriations Committee  on a vote of 31 to 0 and another on a vote of 30 to 1. So why aren't we  bringing up these bills?   Now, the majority leader had said previously he wasn't going to bring  up any bills in the Senate unless they were supported by President  Trump and by the Democrats. Do you know what? That is an abdication of  the responsibility of this Senate as a separate and coequal branch of  government. Since when do we say to this President or any President: We  are not going to consider a piece of legislation on the floor of the  Senate unless you tell us ahead of time that you are good with it?   That is not doing our job. That is not fulfilling our constitutional  responsibility. We have an obligation to do our duty as a separate  branch of government and vote, especially when it is on a piece of  legislation the Senate has already voted on and already supported  overwhelmingly on a bipartisan basis and that would reopen the  government.   So instead of doing our job, we are going to contract out our  responsibilities to the President of the United States, but apparently  it is going to get worse because now, as I understand it, the majority  leader has changed his position and now he will allow a vote on  something in the Senate Chamber. But guess what it is. It is on the  President's proposal.   So now not only are we going to essentially say that we will not vote  on something the President doesn't like, but now the one thing the  majority leader says we will vote on is what the President wants--what  the President wants.   Well, do you know what? I am OK having to vote on the President's  proposal, but if we are going to vote on that, my goodness, we should  also vote on the bill that is already on the Senate calendar and that  has already received strong bipartisan support in the U.S. Senate.   So I do have a question for the majority leader. If we are going to  be voting on President Trump's most recent proposal, are we also going  to be able to have a vote on the bill that was already on the Senate  calendar, that has already been supported by a bipartisan majority, and  that would reopen the government right away? That is my question.   Let's vote, and let's just see what happens, but let's vote on not  just what the President of the United States wants. Since when does the  President dictate what we do here in the Senate? That is a question for  every Member.   So I am for voting, but I am not for doing what appears to be about  to happen, which is just to say that we are going to vote on what the  President wants and, again, contracting out our responsibilities to the  White House.   What we are seeing every day, as I said, is the growing damage from  this shutdown. I mentioned that small businesses are really feeling the  pain. There is a story in the Wall Street Journal, headline: ``Small  Businesses' $2 Billion Problem: Government Shutdown Leaves Loans in  Limbo.''   This is happening all over the country. What you are seeing is that  businesses and startups and the engines of  [[Page S324]]  our economy are not able to access loans through the Small Business  Administration. In fact, Mark Zandi of Moody's Analytics estimates the  shutdown has delayed the $2 billion in SBA lending. Jill Emerson, the  CEO of an electrical components company in Tennessee, just heard that  her lender shut down their $3 million line of credit. ``Our frustration  is unbelievable,'' she said. This is the CEO of an electrical  components company in Tennessee. ``To keep us alive, I am borrowing  from business associates who have worked with us for years.''   We are hearing other small businesses that are just starved for lack  of capital, others where the small business owners are personally  guaranteeing loans. For the most part, there are many who are just not  getting the capital they need to open up their businesses, to sustain  their businesses, and as a result, they are laying off workers. That is  a growing consequence of this shutdown.   Many times, I have shared on this floor some of the stories of  Federal employees who work in Maryland and the fact that they want,  first and foremost, to get back to work. Everywhere I go, even before  people mention the fact that they are missing their paychecks, they  tell me they want to get back to do the work for the American people.  Then they do share terrible stories about how the lack of pay is  impacting them more and more, day by day.   Beyond the stories you will hear from Federal employees who work in  my State of Maryland or Senator Kaine's State of Virginia--and I want  to thank Senator Kaine for all of his efforts to reopen the government  and, of course, Federal employees in the District of Columbia--the  reality is, 80 percent of Federal employees live outside of this  region. They live all over the country. We are talking about the Coast  Guard, Coast Guard officials. We are talking being TSA officials. We  are talking about Homeland Security officials. We are talking about  people in Federal Agencies who are scattered across this country.   A former marine who is now an EPA employee in Kansas is the primary  breadwinner for her family and two children. Here is what she had to  say the other day: ``To have to go to your landlord and say, `I don't  know how I'm going to pay you,' I have never had to do that.''   The President said people would ``make adjustments.'' The President  said he could ``relate.'' It is easy for the President to say. He is  sort of jetting from the White House to Mar-a-Lago, to Trump Tower.  Those words are hollow to the millions of Americans who are actually  really hurting.   Here is what this Federal worker in Kansas said:         We're trying to cut the grocery bill just down to the       necessities, I mean we don't live extravagantly so it's hard       to cut out any bills.    Her children notice, she said. She said:         My son wants to sell art to pay our bills.    Right now, we have Federal employees all over the country who are  trying to take on odd jobs to make ends meet. Sometimes that takes  startup costs, which, of course, they don't have because they don't  have any income coming in the door.   One story from Cadillac, MI, goes as follows: Debra-Ann Brabazon, a  furloughed Forest Service worker, said she is paying $100 to get  fingerprinted and get background-checked so she could get certified as  a substitute teacher. She was down to eating one meal a day. She didn't  have the $100 to pay to get the fingerprinting and background check to  get an odd job in order to bring in some income while she wasn't  getting her Federal paycheck. She said she leapt to volunteer in  exchange for grocery money and that ``I was a nanny in college. I am  falling back on everything I learned about how to survive.''   As we can see, as each day goes by, the pain grows--the pain grows on  small businesses, the pain grows on families. The Trump shutdown is  also hurting our national security and creating growing harm to our  national security by the day.   The FBI Agents Association put out a report today on the impacts they  are seeing. One agent said:         I have been working on a long term MS-13 investigation for       over three years. We have indicted 23 MS-13 gang members. . .       . Since the shutdown, I have not had a Spanish speaker in the       Division. We have several Spanish speaking informants. We are       only able to communicate using a three way call with a       linguist in another division.    The government shutdown is hurting the FBI's efforts to go after MS- 13 gangs.   I often hear President Trump talking about the need to crack down on  MS-13, and when it comes to MS-13, he is absolutely right. Long before  the President even started talking about MS-13, many of us in this body  and in the House of Representatives have been working to crack down on  MS-13 gang violence. The President just discovered MS-13 when he  decided to run for President, but many of us had been working on that  issue for a long time. Yet now the government shutdown is undermining  that effort.   Here is what another national security official says:         Not being able to pay Confidential Human Sources risks       losing them and the information they provide FOREVER. It is       not a switch that we can turn on or off.    Here is another FBI official indicating that the shutdown has shut  off funds they used for critical informants to track down criminals,  but apparently that doesn't matter to President Trump. That effort is  just another casualty of the shutdown he brought about.   We are also seeing impacts on cyber security. WIRED magazine reported  last week: ``As the Government Shutdown Drags On, Security Risks  Intensify.'' The article notes that the new Cybersecurity and  Infrastructure Security Agency at the Department of Homeland Security  is operating with a skeleton crew, risking government websites and  systems.         Many government websites have had their HTTPS encryption       certificates expire during the shutdown, exposing them to       potential snooping or even impersonator sites. And with most       IT staff staying home, it seems unlikely that software       patches and upgrades are being installed at their regular       clip, potentially leaving them exposed to malware they'd       otherwise be protected against.    In other words, since President Trump has sent all these employees  home without pay, they are not able to ensure that government computers  are not kept up to date with the software they need to protect them  against cyber attacks. The shutdown is leaving a lot of the U.S.  Government's computer systems more vulnerable. When that happens, it  makes all of us more vulnerable.   In addition, the private sector that relies, in many ways, on a  public-private partnership with cyber security resources from the  National Institutes of Standards and Technology, NIST, says they are  not able to access that information at this point in time.   Those are just some of the more recent impacts that harm our national  security. Interestingly, what we are seeing is that not everyone is  hurting. It turns out, if you have friends in the Trump administration,  you may able to get some relief.   I think many of us were interested last week when the mortgage  industry was able to persuade the administration to bring back some  employees from the IRS back to work. Here is what the mortgage industry  said: Could you make these guys essential, meaning some of the folks  then wanted to bring back at the IRS.   Do you know what? In response to the mortgage industry, the White  House brought more people back. According to the report, the shutdown  was stalling an IRS process to confirm borrowers' incomes before they  could grant home loans, and that of course is a problem for the  mortgage industry in making those loans. So the Mortgage Bankers  Association reached out to the Department of the Treasury, and suddenly  the Department of the Treasury said: Oh, that is an essential function.  The mortgage industry wants it. We are going to bring back folks to  process that information.   The story quotes the chief executive of the Bankers Association,  saying: I would like to take some credit. Our direct request got quite  rapid results.   I am glad people are getting their income checked through IRS  validations so they can get their mortgages. The way to do this isn't  to respond piecemeal to some powerful special interests. We shouldn't  be playing favorites in this shutdown, and that is what we are seeing  from this administration.  [[Page S325]]    The way to deal with it is obvious: open up the government so we can  resume these functions. In the U.S. Senate, the fastest and best way to  open up the government is to have a vote--to have a vote on the bill  that is on the Senate calendar that has already received broad  bipartisan support in the U.S. Senate.   I want to talk a minute about Homeland Security. The Trump  administration's request for this portion of border security funding  was $1.6 billion. That is what is in their budget. You can look at  their budget online. They requested $1.6 billion. I serve on the Senate  Appropriations Committee, and the Senate Appropriations Committee  provided that request--provided that request for strengthening  barriers. We did say you can't use that money to build that sort of  new, huge wall the President used to talk about, but we provided $1.6  billion. That was going to work out fine in the long run.   Then, of course, in December, the President said: Oh, I need this  $5.7 billion for a big wall.   I think all of us who follow these issues closely know that even  before President Trump was elected, we had 700 miles of barriers and  fencing along certain strategic parts of the border, and we have  provided funds to reenforce and strengthen some of those barriers. So  this is a totally manufactured issue by the President of the United  States in terms of all of a sudden demanding more funds than the  President himself in his budget requested.    So we should have a serious conversation on border security and  immigration issues, and we can have it now, but what we cannot do is  continue to allow the country to be held hostage through this  government shutdown. As I said at the beginning of my remarks, it was  the President of the United States who said on December 11 of last  year, he would be ``proud'' to shut down the government if he didn't  get things his way. Well, that is just not how things work, especially  not how things work in an era of divided government. So I appeal to my  colleagues, my Senate Republican colleagues to work with us to find a  way out. Obviously, the fastest way out is to vote on the bills that  already have bipartisan support. We should have the conversation, but  what I do find to be a very sad reflection on this body, is if we move  forward and have a vote only on the proposal the President of the  United States wants and not also a vote on the bill that previously had  bipartisan support in the U.S. Senate because that would send an awful  message. It would send the message that the majority party has allowed  an independent and coequal branch of government to be totally hijacked  by the President of the United States, as opposed to doing our job as a  separate branch of government under article I.   If we are going to take the position that this Senate, with 53  Republicans and 47 Democrats, is only going to vote on a proposal from  the President of the United States, then we simply have become a  vehicle--an agent for the President. That would be a great shame on  this body.   If we are going to have a vote on that bill--and I am fine to have a  vote on that bill. We should have votes. In the light of day, we should  have transparency and accountability, but what would be outrageous is  to say: OK. We are only going to vote on the bill the President of the  United States wants and not on another measure that has already  received broad bipartisan support. That would be a dereliction of duty  in the U.S. Senate as a separate and coequal branch of government.   Let's end this shutdown. We have it in our power to vote now. Let's  do our job. The President can do what he wants, but let's do our job  under the Constitution and let's do it and be held accountable by the  American public. Let's not use procedural devices to only allow votes  on what the President wants and not votes on bills we voted on before.   I am hoping this Senate will do its job and do its duty and hold that  vote to reopen government and not just on the President's proposal but  on the other proposals as well. In the meantime, we should continue to  have serious conversations about the most effective and cost-effective  way to provide border security and how we can deal with other  immigration issues, but nobody should send the signal that shutting  down the government is a good way to do business. I would hope that  neither Republican nor Democratic Senators would want to send a signal  to the Executive that they are going to be rewarded for shutting down  the government--now 32 days long, a real shame for the country, and  something nobody should be proud of. No matter what the President of  the United States says, this is nothing for anybody to be proud of.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
