 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize an outstanding  member of my staff who is moving on to a career in the defense sector,  Danielle Houser.   Danielle graduated from UF in 2015 with a degree in international and  global studies. She then moved to D.C. to begin her career on Capitol  Hill. In January of 2017 she helped open our D.C. office as my  executive assistant, later moving into a legislative role and becoming  my legislative aide for military and defense affairs.   After Hurricane Michael devastated the panhandle, DJ played a key  role in ensuring Tyndall Air Force Base and all of our bases had the  resources they needed to begin recovery. DJ is a force of nature. She  is ambitious, disciplined, hardworking, cheerful, and a joy to work  with. She has been an integral part of my office since its inception,  and we will miss her greatly.   Madam Speaker, please join me in recognizing Danielle Houser for all  that she has done for north Florida and our Nation and wish her luck in  all her future endeavors.                            ____________________
