 Mr. President, I reserve the right to object. I certainly  welcome the Senator from Utah's interest in oversight of coronavirus  emergency relief funds. There is no question Americans deserve to know  where their hard-earned tax dollars are going and how these critical  relief funds are being used to help communities all across our country  in the wake of this public health crisis, especially for those who need  it the most.   I am also thankful that my colleague agreed with the importance of  conducting thorough oversight of these programs and supported the  creation of the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee when we  passed the CARES Act. These oversight requirements, based on the  successful oversight model of the American Recovery and Reinvestment  Act, ensure that we have strong oversight of all coronavirus relief  dollars through regular, detailed reports and recommendations from the  PRAC, the GAO, and the inspector general.   Following guidance from the Office of Management and Budget, all  COVID-19 relief funding from the legislation that the Senator has  identified is already being tracked on USASpending.gov. Anyone-- anyone--can go to the website right now and see the figures.   As of August 31, Congress has provided $4.7 trillion in relief  spending. The administration has committed $3.9 trillion of those funds  to helping communities, and $3.4 trillion in assistance has already  reached those who need help through this crisis.   I would also urge the Senator to consult the more than 1,300  oversight reports that the PRAC has already completed related to the  pandemic response, in addition to the more than 100 reports that the  GAO has also issued on this topic, rather than creating additional and  redundant work for the GAO at taxpayer expense.   The Senator's proposal is duplicative and unnecessary, and for that  reason I object.
