 Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   (Mr. VISCLOSKY asked and was given permission to revise and extend  his remarks.)    Mr. Chairman, I would like to start by expressing my  appreciation for how Chairwoman Granger has conducted the business of  this subcommittee. Her abiding priority has remained the safety,  effectiveness, and efficiency of every man and woman in uniform.  Additionally, she has taken a thoughtful and bipartisan approach to our  work. She has been transparent, considerate of every Member's request  in this body, and is a fierce defender of the oversight  responsibilities and constitutional prerogatives of the Congress.   I would also like to express my gratitude to Chairman Frelinghuysen,  Ranking Member Lowey, and the other members of the subcommittee for  their efforts. This legislation would not have happened without the  incredibly skilled staff that the chairwoman has just enumerated, and I  will join her in thanking them for their outstanding work.   I would also be remiss if I did not also use a portion of my time to  recognize that this will be the last time I will manage time on a  Defense appropriations bill with my very good friend, Chairman Rodney  Frelinghuysen, on the floor with us. He is a consummate gentleman,  decent to his core, a tireless advocate for the people he represents,  and always working for the best interest of our Nation and those  wearing its uniform. He will be sorely missed, and this body will be  lesser without him. I thank him for his service, and I thank him deeply  for his friendship.   With regards to the matters before us, I would like to begin by  calling attention to an issue of great importance to me: the full  integration of women in the military. Female servicemembers are  invaluable to the defense of our Nation. For the majority of the time  that they have been allowed in the military, women have had to  assimilate into a culture established by men for men. This is not the  best way to maximize the effectiveness of our armed services.   While I appreciate the opening of combat career fields to women and  the Department's emerging effort to ensure that combat equipment is  designed and fitted for female servicemembers, I would submit that  these are immediate-term solutions.   Bluntly, the rate at which women leave the service is detrimental to  its readiness. Some of the reasons for their departures are glaringly  obvious and will be difficult to overcome because they will require  cultural and significant policy changes. But I am pleased that the  House Armed Services Committee in their fiscal year 2019 authorization  bill has taken a step to establish a female retention baseline and  developed ways to improve female retention. Initiatives like these will  help the Appropriations Committee to better focus funding where it can  be most effective.   Specific to the bill, the chairwoman has provided an accurate  summary, but there are a few areas I would like to highlight. This bill  increases funding by almost $200 million above the budget request for  several important environmental cleanup accounts. The subcommittee  under Chairwoman Granger and previously under Chairman Frelinghuysen  has been very proactive on emergency environmental issues, including  those caused by firefighting chemicals. Those living on or near  military facilities and everyone throughout our country should not have  to worry about access to clean drinking water.   Oversight of the management and expenditure of $674 billion is a core  function of this subcommittee. As such, this bill contains several cuts  to accounts that have large, unobligated balances or have under  executed. The funds generated by those cuts have been invested in  programs and initiatives that provide more benefit to our country and  the warfighter. Unlike the recently debated and much-ballyhooed  rescission bill, these are actions of real substance that will benefit  the taxpayer.   I believe good oversight is fostered by constructive and informed  dialogue between the committee and the agencies. Oversight cannot be  effective when proposals are presented at the last minute with the  intention of forcing a decision. Oversight cannot be effective when  complex changes to a program are first communicated to the legislative  branch through the media. I have great respect for the service  secretaries and chiefs, but there needs to be an improvement in the  timeliness and quality of communication. The committee report to  accompany this bill contains several sections encouraging the  department as a whole and with a special focus on the Army to adhere to  congressional direction, increased transparency for budget exhibits,  and improve the quality and timeliness of communication.   I am cautiously optimistic that the bipartisan budget agreement,  which provided relief from the Budget Control Act, will provide a  pathway for completing the fiscal year 2019 bills in a somewhat timely  manner. However, the next two fiscal years present daunting obstacles  to make it even more important to complete our work as soon as  possible.   Most obvious is the return of the BCA caps for fiscal year 2020,  which if left unchanged will require the department's base funding to  be reduced by $71 billion from the level provided in this bill. A  reduction of that magnitude would cause great disruption. Inexplicably,  multiple Congresses have managed to alleviate the budget caps for 7 of  8 years, but only after significant and protracted political theater. I  know the senior leaders in the Pentagon are not taking chances and have  begun to identify programs to cut in 2020 that will carry the least  associated risk for the warfighter if these caps are not adjusted.   Additionally, senior military leaders have testified that arresting  the erosion of our military's competitive advantage requires real  budget growth of at least 3 percent above inflation through 2023, and  that increasing that competitive advantage would require even higher  growth. I agree with the assessment that we need to make smart  investments, but I do not believe a growth rate of that magnitude is  sustainable. Unless we act responsibly on the revenue side of the  budget and address entitlements in a meaningful fashion, the money will  not be there.    While we are on the floor today debating the funding for the DOD  bill, we must consider that maintaining our competitive advantage in  defense also requires other investments that we do not immediately  equate with military matters. As only 29 percent of Americans aged 17  to 24 qualify for military service, investments in our youth,  difficult-to-retain populations, education, and public health are  equally important.   Since fiscal year 2016, the annual funding level for the Department  of Defense has increased by $100 billion. To put this into context, a  $100 billion increase is larger than the annual budget for the  Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Education,  and the Department of Transportation. It is greater than the combined  annual budgets of the Department of Homeland Security and the  Department of the Interior.   Finally, I remain concerned that while we have seen plenty of long- awaited, long-term planning and strategy documents generated by the  Pentagon and the White House over the last 500 days, the bulk of our  ongoing military operations continue to be authorized by legislation  from 17 years ago. There have been four Presidential elections and  eight congressional elections since 2001 and its Authorization for Use  of Military Force. I am disappointed that the Rules Committee did not  make in order any amendments on this matter. It is a shame that this  Congress cannot muster the will to even talk about this important  issue.   Mr. Chairman, in closing, I, again, thank the chairwoman for her  great effort and her true partnership, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman  from New York (Mrs. Lowey), the ranking member of the committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman  from Minnesota (Ms. McCollum), the ranking member of the Interior,  Environment, and Related Agencies Subcommittee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman  from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur), ranking member of the Energy and Water  Development, and Related Agencies Subcommittee.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Cuellar), a member of the Committee on Appropriations as  well as the Subcommittee on Defense Appropriations.                                time  1645     Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman  from Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz), the ranking member of the  Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies  Subcommittee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Sherman).    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Connolly).  [[Page H5720]]         Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Will the gentlewoman yield?  [[Page H5741]]         Mr. Chair, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   Mr. Chair, I rise in support of the gentleman's amendment and thank  him very much for offering it.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman's amendment.  I agree with everything he has said relative to the value of the  program.   But I would point out to my colleagues that, in our bill, we include  $145 million for directed energy and railgun weapon efforts; and this  is an increase of $25 million over last year's level, 2018, of $120  million.   I would congratulate the gentleman that this time last year he had an  amendment on the floor that was successful in adding $24 million to  that program, bringing it up to $120 million. However, we are 8 months  into the fiscal year and, to date, the Department has only spent about  20 percent of that money, that is, $24 million.   I would also, again, point out, in the underlying bill, we have  increased that $120 million to $145 million, so we do, as a committee,  understand the potential of the program.   However, I think it is not good policy to continue to increase  funding for the program without allowing the services time to  adequately research and learn from their past investments. Why should  we continue to add more funding before the prior year's funding can  even be spent or reasonably assessed as far as progress being made?   Therefore, with all due respect to the gentleman, I must oppose his  amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I understand I have the right to close.  [[Page H5744]]     Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, again, I would agree with the gentleman as  far as the progress our adversaries are making, our shared concern  about making sure we make progress. But, again, I would point out there  remains, in fiscal year 2018, $96 million of unobligated moneys.   There is a recognition by the committee of the value of proceeding  with this in a deliberate fashion, which is why we added another $25  million over the existing level, for a balance of 145 million  additional dollars. We believe, at this point, that is enough, which is  why I do respectfully object and oppose the gentleman's amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise as the designee of the gentleman  from Florida and have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, the amendment before the House increases  funding for the Peer Reviewed Breast Cancer Research Program by $5  million.   Our colleague Mr. Hastings has worked closely with Mr. McGovern of  Massachusetts, Mr. Costello of Pennsylvania, as well as Mr. King of New  York, each of whom have cosponsored this bipartisan amendment.   The need to fund research in order to prevent, treat, and cure breast  cancer is vital to both save American lives and also to address  important economic and healthcare costs, and I would ask my colleagues  to adopt the amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  gentleman's amendment.    Mr. Chair, I would certainly agree with the assertion  of the gentleman who offered the amendment that the relationship our  country has with Pakistan has been difficult, but I am opposed to the  amendment because maintaining a relationship, no matter how difficult,  is essential. The relationship has helped the U.S. make progress  against terrorism, as difficult as that road has been, and the  Pakistanis have allocated part of their forces within their own borders  to this mission.   Very importantly for our colleagues, I would point out that our bill  recognizes the difficulties we face with Pakistan.   Section 9016 prohibits the funds to Pakistan if our government  believes the government is engaged in unfair activities.   Section 9016 requires that the Secretary of Defense, prior to  obligating any funds, certify that the Government of Pakistan is:   Cooperating on counterterrorism efforts;   Not supporting terrorist activities against the U.S. or coalition  forces in Afghanistan;   Not intervening extrajudicially into political and judicial processes  in Pakistan;   Dismantling IED networks;   Preventing the proliferation of nuclear-related materials and  expertise;   Implementing policies to protect judicial independence and due  process of law;   Issuing visas in a timely manner for U.S. visitors engaged in  counterterrorism efforts and assistance programs in Pakistan; and   Providing humanitarian organizations access to detainees, internally  displaced persons, and other Pakistani civilians affected by the  conflict.   A complete withdrawal of U.S. assistance would likely polarize  Pakistan and exacerbate significant pro-and anti-American rifts within  the military and their government generally.   Aggravating this divide would be counterproductive, I believe, to the  objectives of our Nation in that region of the world. In addition to  counterterrorism activities, the fact of Pakistan's nuclear weapons  capability provides ample reason for our country to continue a positive  engagement.   Again, as difficult as it has been, this amendment is an overly broad  reaction to what is a legitimate concern. The bill addresses the issue  in a thoughtful and deliberate way.   We should not be taking any strident approach, and I would ask my  colleagues to reject this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    I understand that I have the right to close.    How much time is remaining?    Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms.  Granger), chairwoman of the committee.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Chairman, I would simply acknowledge the  seriousness in which the gentleman from Texas has offered his  amendment, the concern we share, which, again, I believe is recognized  in section 9016 of the bill.   Mr. Chair, I ask our colleagues to oppose the amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise as the designee of the  gentlewoman from Wisconsin, and I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, the amendment before the House would bar  the use of funds in contravention of existing Federal requirements for  meaningful consultation and coordination with Tribal communities  related to the activities that would impact them.   I do believe this is a good amendment and ask my colleagues to accept  it.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
