 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize a  good friend of mine, Mr. Danny Powers, on his selection to serve as the  Grand Marshal of Savannah, Georgia's, 198th St. Patrick's Day parade.   The St. Patrick's Day parade in Savannah is the third-largest St.  Patrick's Day celebration in the entire country. We will be expecting  around 400,000 spectators to attend Savannah's signature event.   Since 1824, Savannah has been the home of this fabulous celebration  of the rich Irish heritage of our city.   The grand marshal is an honor that recognizes members of our  community for their great service, and Danny is well-deserving of that.   Danny has been the Chatham County tax commissioner for 27 years,  since 1995. During his tenure, Danny has boosted property tax  collection rates; integrated online technology to improve  accessibility; and has added satellite offices for vehicle tag  renewals.   Danny has been an integral and influential member of the Savannah  community for many years, and we are so grateful to have him.   Madam Speaker, I congratulate Danny on this tremendous honor; he has  earned it.                            ____________________
