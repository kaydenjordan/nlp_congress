 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  Eastwood Academy and Lyons Elementary School in Houston, Texas, as  National Blue Ribbon Schools for 2017.   The U.S. Department of Education selects blue ribbon schools each  year from across the country based on their overall academic excellence  and progress in closing the achievement gap. Lyons Elementary and  Eastwood Academy are 2 of just 342 schools selected nationwide this  year.   Lyons Elementary and Eastwood Academy were selected as exemplary  high-performing schools based on State and national assessments while  serving the historically disadvantaged communities of Northline and  Eastwood.   I thank the parents, teachers, and administrators of Eastwood Academy  and Lyons Elementary for their hard work and commitment to building a  brighter future for our children and our community.   Finally, I wish to recognize the students at Lyons Elementary and  Eastwood Academy for their diligence and academic excellence and wish  them best in their future endeavors.                            ____________________
