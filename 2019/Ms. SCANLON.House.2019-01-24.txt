 Madam Speaker, I rise today to commend the good people  of the Fifth District of Pennsylvania, who are helping their neighbors,  the Federal workers, contractors, and families who have been so  grievously impacted by the government shutdown.   As the human and financial toll of this senseless shutdown has  spread, we have seen locals step up and help those who are struggling  without pay. What a contrast with this administration where Cabinet  members said today that they didn't understand why an unpaid worker  might have to resort to a food bank to feed his family.   Unlike this administration and the Senate majority leader, our  neighbors have recognized the true impact of the shutdown and are doing  something about it. We have seen youth groups, and fire departments,  and local organizations organize food drives. Nonprofits are collecting  donations and organizing food pantries so Federal workers can feed  their families.   I urge the President and the Senate majority leader to put people  before politics. People are not bargaining chips. The shutdown needs to  end now.  [[Page H1193]]                                ____________________
