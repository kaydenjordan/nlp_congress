 Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the  ``Comprehensive Mental Health in Schools Pilot Program Act of 2021,''  which I introduced today.   Millions of children and adolescents across the Nation struggle every  day with mental health concerns that threaten their emotional well- being and academic achievement.   The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the need for comprehensive  school mental health systems that can provide the support and services  that students desperately need.   This bill is a targeted effort to address the worsening mental health  crisis in this country. If enacted, this legislation would help schools  as they work to promote positive school climates, improve social and  emotional learning, and reduce the prevalence and severity of mental  illness.   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that between  March and October of 2020, the proportion of children between the ages  of 5 and 11 who visited an emergency department because of a mental  health crisis climbed 24 percent compared to the same time period in  2019, and climbed 31 percent for children between the ages of 12 and  17. More people are reporting frequent thoughts of suicide and self- harm than have ever been recorded. The full effects of increased  learning loss, social isolation, uncertainty, and trauma may not  manifest for years, and schools must be prepared to deal with this  preventatively.   That is why I am proud to introduce this bill, which would direct the  Secretary of Education to establish a $20 million 4-year pilot grant  program to help schools serving low-income students address mental and  behavioral wellbeing, as well as academic, cognitive, and social and  emotional development, through multi-tier, evidence-based interventions  that foster positive learning environments. More specifically, this  funding may be used for providing professional development  opportunities, encouraging restorative policies, establishing racially,  culturally, and linguistically appropriate trauma-informed practices,  and hiring more school-based mental and behavioral health  professionals.   I want to thank Representative David Trone for introducing this bill  with me, and I hope our colleagues will join us in support of this  solution to our youth mental health crisis.
