 Mr. Chair, I thank Ranking Member Smith for yielding.   Earlier this month, the Armed Services Committee advanced the fiscal  year 2019 National Defense Authorization Act to the House floor with  broad, bipartisan support.   I thank Chairman Thornberry and Ranking Member Smith for their work  in developing this year's bill. I have greatly appreciated the  bipartisan tradition that annually allows us to come together to best  protect our country and those who serve on our behalf.   The Tactical Air and Land Forces Subcommittee has embodied that  spirit of bipartisanship, and I would like to thank my friend and  colleague Congressman Mike Turner for all the work we have done  together over the past several years.    I am especially pleased that the bill under consideration today  includes proposals related to better understanding and reducing  physiological episodes in Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force aircraft. I  believe it is important to keep calling on DOD to solve this problem  across multiple aircraft, wherever it occurs.   The bill also appropriately directs the Air Force to continue the  JSTARS recap program while the service works to develop a next- generation JSTARS in order to ensure this critical capability remains  available to maximum effect to our servicemembers.   The proposal makes important investments in research and development  aimed at using advanced materials to increase ballistic protection and  reduce the weight of the personal protective equipment we issue to  those we send into harm's way.   With these provisions in mind, I look forward to continuing to work  with my colleagues to see that we provide our men and women in uniform  with the resources they need to carry out their mission.   Finally, I would like to thank all the members of the subcommittee  and the professional staff members for all of their dedicated work to  help produce this mark.   Mr. Chair, I urge passage of this bill.
