 Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman  from Oregon yielding me the time.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 302, a bill to make the  Nation's transportation system more secure. Not only does H.R. 302 give  needed attention to the security of air cargo, airport perimeters, and  public areas of airports, as well as mass transit facilities, but for  the first time since the 9/11 Act, it directs TSA to put significant  focus on bolstering surface transportation security.   H.R. 302 also does two important things for TSA frontline workers. It  directs TSA to sit down with labor representatives to collaborate on  long-overdue personnel reforms and authorize the TSA training academy.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to say that H.R. 302 includes every House- passed Democratic TSA bill, as well as language to right a wrong that  has resulted in billions of dollars collected from the flying public  for security being diverted from TSA security operations.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues for their collaboration and  support.
