 Mr. Speaker, Americans miss President Donald  Trump.   Under the Biden administration, we have a supply chain crisis, an  energy crisis, a border crisis, an Afghanistan crisis, and an economic  crisis that threatens every bank account and paycheck that we earn.   Americans are scared and losing hope after 9 months of the Biden- Harris administration.   Under President Trump, we had a roaring economy; we had energy  independence; our border was secure; and our enemies feared our  resolve.  [[Page H5689]]    The radical left is attempting to destroy our economy and the  American way of life, but every crisis created by the Biden  administration is only a reminder of how great it was to have an  American President who put America first.   Today marks 9 months of the Biden administration, and my constituents  miss President Trump now more than ever.                            ____________________
