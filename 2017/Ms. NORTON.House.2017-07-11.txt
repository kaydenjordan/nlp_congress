 Mr. Speaker, despite attempts at resuscitation, TrumpCare  is close to impasse, charitably speaking. The Senate bill does so much  harm to all concerned--to Americans who depend on Medicaid or Medicare  or have a preexisting condition, and actually raises costs out of  pocket with less coverage while kicking 22 million people, including  61,000 D.C. residents, off their healthcare plans altogether--that some  may be tempted to cheer the coming demise of TrumpCare.   Defeat of TrumpCare may be better than repeal of the Affordable Care  Act, but to leave it there is to show contempt for the American people.   Republicans argue that ObamaCare was flawed because it was the  product of only one party. If so, Republicans should avoid the same  mistake. The best way for Congress to spend the remaining weeks before  recess is with Democrats and Republicans at the same table.                            ____________________
