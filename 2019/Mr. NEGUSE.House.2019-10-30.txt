 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the House  adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 9 a.m. tomorrow.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous material on H.R. 823.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Chair, I would first like to thank Chairman Grijalva and  Chairwoman Haaland for their support and advocacy of this bill.   I stand today in support of my bill, H.R. 823, the Colorado Outdoor  Recreation and Economy Act, or the CORE Act.   As Representatives for the people, as legislators here in the Halls  of Congress, our job is to fight for commonsense solutions that come  directly from our communities.   When our constituents raise their voices on issues that impact them,  and when we are able to respond with legislation that benefits our  districts and our State, that is when our work is most effective.   I am proud that the CORE Act was crafted by Coloradans over the last  decade. It is a product of collaboration, careful consultation, and  negotiation.   Local elected officials, community members, businesses, outdoor  recreation and conservation groups, ranchers, sportsmen, they have all  contributed their input and their passion for the outdoor areas that  they love.   Each title in this bill has been carefully vetted by a thoughtful  group of local elected leaders and community members, and each title is  well deserving of consideration on the House floor today.   I will just give a brief overview of the bill.   The CORE Act would conserve over 400,000 acres of public land, and it  consists of four titles that Coloradans have been asking Congress to  pass, as I said, for well over a decade.   Title 1 is the Continental Divide Recreation, Wilderness and Camp  Hale Legacy Act. It establishes permanent protections for nearly  100,000 acres of wilderness, recreation, and conservation areas in the  White River National Forest along Colorado's Continental Divide.    The title creates two new wildlife conservation areas, totaling  approximately 12,000 acres. The Porcupine Gulch Wildlife Conservation  Area would protect Colorado's only migration corridor over Interstate  70 for elk, bear, mule, deer, and other wildlife. The Williams Fork  Wildlife Conservation Area would also enhance wildlife habitat for the  greater sage grouse and other species.   Title 1 also designates the first-ever national historic landscape at  Camp Hale. This unprecedented designation speaks to the storied legacy  of the Army's 10th Mountain Division in Colorado and around the world.  As my colleagues may know, the soldiers that trained at Camp Hale led  our Nation to victory in World War II and then went on to create the  outdoor recreation industry as we know it today.   The second title is the San Juan Mountains Wilderness Act. This  title, which has previously received bipartisan support in both the  House and the Senate, provides permanent protections for nearly 61,000  acres of land located in the heart of the San Juan Mountains in  southwest Colorado. It designates some of the State's most iconic peaks  as wilderness, including  [[Page H8646]]  two fourteeners, Mount Sneffels and Wilson Peak.   The third title is the Thompson Divide Withdrawal and Protection Act,  which prevents new oil and gas development in one of Colorado's most  treasured landscapes while also protecting private property rights. The  Thompson Divide, through ranching and outdoor recreation, contributes  $30 million a year to the statewide economy. It is an area that is  simply too valuable to drill for oil and gas.   This title also includes a pilot program to allow the capture of  fugitive methane from both active and inactive coal mines in portions  of Pitkin, Delta, Gunnison, and Garfield Counties.   Madam Chair, this is a point that is worth underscoring. This  provision that I mentioned was developed at the request of local  elected leaders. Ultimately, I am thankful for their thoughtful input  to improve the bill.   The fourth and final title formally establishes the boundary for the  Curecanti National Recreation Area, currently one of only a handful of  National Park Service units without a formal designation by an act of  Congress. This special place consists of three reservoirs that are a  designation for boating, fishing, hiking, and camping. It is a long- overdue formal designation that will allow the National Park Service to  more effectively manage the area, and it also will help ensure that the  Federal Government lives up to a longstanding commitment it made to the  State of Colorado to provide new fishing access for sportsmen in the  Gunnison River basin.   Finally, I would like to call out an important addition to this bill  that was included in the manager's amendment to honor the life of an  outstanding individual who was truly loved by his family and friends,  and he served as a pillar of his community. Sanford Morris Treat, Jr.,  who went by the name ``Sandy,'' was a World War II veteran who served  in the 10th Mountain Division and trained at Camp Hale.   I had the honor of meeting Sandy before his passing earlier this  year, and it is due to his and his fellow veterans' unwavering advocacy  that Camp Hale would be forever maintained as a National Historic  Landscape under the CORE Act. Therefore, the manager's amendment  includes language to designate the Sandy Treat Overlook as an  interpretive site overlooking Camp Hale.   It is my hope that those who visit it will be reminded of his service  to our country, his zest for life, and his passion for protecting the  legacy of Camp Hale.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues, respectfully, to support the CORE  Act, not only to honor those who came before us, but also to protect  our treasured places for generations to come.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Chair, with great respect for my colleague from Colorado  Springs, whom I certainly enjoy serving with, I would just say that  local community support is so critical on public lands bills of this  nature. That is why I am so proud that this bill has overwhelming  support from the local communities that are impacted by it.   One thing, I suspect, that you will not hear from my distinguished  colleagues on this side of the aisle is a reference to any counties,  cities, or towns directly impacted by this bill that ultimately don't  support it.  [[Page H8647]]    Just to give you a sense of some of those communities, the town of  Crested Butte, the town of Carbondale, the city of Glenwood Springs,  the town of Telluride, the town of Basalt, the town of Breckenridge,  the town of Ophir, the town of Ridgway, the town of Mountain Village,  the town of Snowmass Village, the town of Frisco, and the town of  Dillon, they have all supported this bill.   Garfield County supports a provision of the bill which impacts its  county. San Miguel County does the same. Gunnison County, Eagle County,  San Juan County, Summit County, Ouray County, and Pitkin County--I am,  in some respects, left at a loss of words in terms of trying to  understand what local community support my distinguished colleague is  referencing in terms of it being lacking.   And, of course, it makes perfect sense that these communities would  so overwhelmingly support this bill because they have been engaged in  important stakeholder input on this bill for 10 years, long before I  came to Congress.   This bill has been the product of a very robust community-driven  stakeholder process, which is why it has overwhelming support of not  just the local communities that are impacted by it, but, ultimately, by  the people shown by just a recent empirical study that over 70 percent  of the people on the western side of Colorado and writ at large in the  State support the provisions of the CORE Act. That is why it has also  earned the support of my distinguished colleague from Colorado, the  dean of our delegation.   Madam Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Colorado (Ms.  DeGette).    Madam Chairwoman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Just a few points before I yield some time to my distinguished  colleague from the Sixth Congressional District.   I would first say, this reference to wilderness study areas and the  notion that because, as my distinguished colleague from Colorado  Springs mentioned, there are some wilderness study areas in certain  areas, that, therefore, no further protections are needed, of course,  as the gentleman from the  [[Page H8649]]  Third Congressional District just mentioned, in his effort to eliminate  some of those wilderness study areas, the case in point that permanent  protections are, in fact, needed. There is a reason why we pursue these  permanent protections, and that is, ultimately, to ensure that the  lands are protected for future generations, like my daughter, so that  she can enjoy the same treasured public lands that I have had access  to.   I would also say, with respect to my colleague from the Third  Congressional District, what I failed to hear during his remarks or,  for that matter, the gentleman from Colorado Springs' remarks is,  again, any reference to a single county that is directly impacted by  this bill that opposes this bill.   I understand the gentleman referenced Montezuma County, and I found  the letter from Montezuma County a bit perplexing given that none of  the CORE Act designations are in their county or even bordering their  county.   As I mentioned earlier, the San Miguel Board of County Commissioners,  which is in the Third Congressional District, supports this bill. The  Gunnison Board of County Commissioners, the Eagle Board of County  Commissioners, the San Juan Board of County Commissioners, the Ouray  Board of County Commissioners, the Pitkin Board of County  Commissioners, and a variety of other counties have expressed support  for the provisions of the bill that impact their particular county,  including the Garfield Board of County Commissioners, which is in the  Third Congressional District.   So, make no mistake, I respect philosophical disagreements that may  exist about the need to protect public lands, and there may be--in  fact, there clearly is a disagreement there, and we are going to land  on different sides of that debate.   But facts matter. And, ultimately, the local communities across the  State that are impacted by this bill directly have made clear that they  support the CORE Act. As I said, it is no surprise that they do because  they have been engaged in the debate around the CORE Act for a decade.   I have each title of the CORE Act that has been introduced since 2011  by Mr. Udall when he served in this Chamber, by Mr. Salazar, and, of  course, by Senator Bennet in the upper Chamber. This bill is the  product of a decade of collaboration.   Ultimately, what I have heard from these county commissioners and so  many others is that they are tired of waiting, Madam Chair.   I recognize that I am new to Washington, but ultimately, I think our  job here is to deliver results for the people who elect us to serve.   I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Crow), who has  served in our armed services so bravely, to discuss the HAATS issue, in  particular. Then, I am happy to yield to Mr. Tipton so that we can  engage in a colloquy.    Madam Chairwoman, I am happy to yield to the gentleman  from Colorado (Mr. Tipton) to give him a moment to respond. It seemed  like he had something to say.    Madam Chair, I appreciate Representative Tipton, my  distinguished colleague, for mentioning that. I would say a few things.   First, of the nine counties that are impacted, as I mentioned, eight  of them have expressed support for the provisions of the bill that  impact them.   While I don't have the letter from Montrose County that apparently  came in today--and I am happy to visit with the gentleman further about  that letter--my understanding is that they expressed support still for  the Curecanti title of the bill in their district.   I also would just say this: If the gentleman is willing to make a  commitment that he will vote for this bill if the Montrose Board of  County Commissioners supports the bill--is that the gentleman's intent?    Madam Chair, reclaiming my time, the gentleman will have  an opportunity to talk. I would just say this: We had this similar  debate in the Rules Committee on Monday. Again, I am new to Washington,  so perhaps this is just the way the process works, but this notion that  amendments are offered and then a representation is made by the  gentleman that even if every amendment passed, they would not support  the bill, fundamentally, for me, this process is about good faith,  negotiation, and discussion to get to a consensus.   I believe there are a number of amendments that the Representative,  along with several others that have been proposed, that we are going to  debate tonight. Some of those may, in fact, be amendments that we can  agree to. But I would hope that my colleagues on the other side of the  aisle would approach the discussion on those amendments with that same  good faith, with understanding that they would hope to get to yes,  because a similar discussion happened earlier this year with respect to  the Garfield Board of County Commissioners.   Their nonsupport of the bill was justified and rationalized as a  reason to oppose it. Of course, eventually, by working with those  county commissioners, Senator Bennet's office and myself were able to  negotiate a compromise so that they could be in a position to support  the title of the bill that impacts that county, so that we could  protect the treasured public lands in the Thompson Divide.   Again, I believe it is important to underscore that point, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, again, I think it is important to underscore  the facts. While I appreciate the gentleman from California making his  case, his characterization of local support or lack thereof on this  bill is simply not consistent with the facts, because, again, I have  yet to hear of a single community that is directly impacted by the CORE  Act that opposes the title of the CORE Act that impacts that  community--not one, Madam Chair. I have been waiting. Coloradans are  waiting.   Again, it is completely permissible to have a philosophical debate  about whether or not to protect public lands. I happen to believe that  these incredibly iconic places across our State ought to be protected.  They ought to be preserved. My colleagues may disagree. That is their  right. But it is important to stress the facts.   To that point, the last point I will make, and just yet another area  that apparently needs to be clarified, is around motorized recreation.  Any characterization that the CORE Act mandates widespread closures of  trails or roads is false. This bill does not close any existing roads,  jeep trails, off-highway vehicle trails, motorcycle trails, or groomed  snowmobile trails, not one.   Facts matter, Madam Chair.   I would ask the Chair how much time do I have remaining.    Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chairman, I have great respect for my colleague  from Arkansas. I know he has a deep experience in his field, I  appreciate him on the Natural Resources Committee, and I enjoy serving  with him on that committee.   I would ask my distinguished colleague whether he would support the  bill if we were to, say, amend the bill to give the Secretary  unilateral power to do what the Secretary determines to be necessary  for the control of fire and insects.   Would the gentleman be amenable to that?    I yield to the gentleman from Arkansas.    Madam Chair, I thank my distinguished colleague from  Arkansas; and I will tell the gentleman that we don't need to amend the  bill because that language is in the bill, repeatedly in the bill  because I share your concerns regarding wildfire, as do my  distinguished colleagues from Colorado.   So we put great care to put into the bill language that reiterates  ``the Secretary may carry out any activity that the Secretary  determines to be necessary for the control of fire, insects, and  diseases.''   So since we have that provision in the bill, I am hoping that the  gentleman will join the bill, and I certainly hope that my colleagues  on the other side of the aisle will do the same, because I think this  bill strikes the right balance in terms of protecting these incredible  public lands and doing so in a way that ensures that we are not at risk  of a wildfire and mitigating as best as we can.    I would also tell the gentleman, of the 400,000 acres in the bill-- and I look forward to bringing my colleague from Arkansas to Colorado  to see these public lands--only 73,000 of them would be designated as  wilderness in this bill, and many of those acres are actually above the  tree line or otherwise unforested.   So, I think the language of the bill addresses the gentleman's  concerns, and I appreciate his raising them. I also very much  appreciate his quoting a personal hero of mine, and I suspect a hero of  many of the Members in this Chamber, and that is Teddy Roosevelt, who,  of course, was an esteemed conservationist in his time.   I will share a quote that I have found to be very compelling: ``Here  is your country. Cherish these natural wonders, cherish the natural  resources, cherish the history and romance as a sacred heritage, for  your children and your children's children.   ``Do not let selfish men or greedy interests skin your country of its  beauty, its riches or its romance.   Madam Chair, it is important that we not lose sight of the bigger  picture, which is that this bill is protecting iconic places like the  Thompson Divide in Colorado from oil and gas development.   The ranchers, the citizens of that community, they have been waiting  an awfully long time for the protections in this bill, which is why I  am so proud to be able to carry the baton for them in the CORE Act.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1900     Madam Chair, I am ready to close as well.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Chair, it is important that we not divorce ourselves from the  fate of this legislation. Whether it will become law or not is  dependent on each and every one of us and where we stand on the bill.   While I have great respect for my colleague from Colorado Springs, I  think it is fitting that the closing that he offered cited President  Trump and his threatened veto letter.   For me, and for the people I represent, for the citizens of my State,  this bill is not about the President. It is not about any of us in this  Chamber. It is about them and the public lands that they are so blessed  to have in their respective communities.   I said this earlier--I will say it again--as a freshman lawmaker, I  understand that I have not been in Congress long, but these pieces of  legislation have been.   Public lands are at the heart of who we are as Coloradans. You heard  the dean of our delegation talk about our recent poll where 73 percent  of Coloradans consider themselves outdoor recreation enthusiasts.  Whether they live in Gunnison, Glenwood Springs, Boulder, Fort Collins,  Eagle County, Summit County, and everywhere in between, 73 percent say  the ability to live near, recreate on, and enjoy public lands, like  national forests, parks, and trails, is a significant reason why they  live in the West.   Ninety percent believe that the outdoor recreation economy is  important to the future of Colorado. It is why so many have labored on  various components of this bill for so long--my predecessor, then- Congressman, now-Governor Jared Polis; former Senator Mark Udall;  former Congressman John Salazar; and, of course, Senator Bennet today  leading this companion legislation in the Senate; and the countless  county commissioners, mayors, city councilors, town trustees,  conservationists, and ranchers who have worked to build consensus on  this bill, literally for a decade.   Many of them traveled here just a few months ago when we had a robust  debate in the Committee on Natural Resources, and we were able to mark  up this bill and send it here to the floor. They deserve to have their  voices heard.   My colleagues can say as often as they would like that there are  local voices missing or ignored, but that does not make it true. We  know that the communities impacted by this bill support it. That is a  fact. There can be no dispute about that.   We know that strong policy requires compromise, years of input, and,  yes, vigorous debate. I am happy to participate in that debate, but the  people of Colorado have made their voices clear on protecting these  public lands.   I mentioned the stakeholder process that we have been engaged in,  that the communities have been engaged in, that this State has been  engaged in for a decade, regardless of what party was in power or what  election year. It was local communities and stakeholders coming to the  table to craft the designations that you see on the map to protect  these wonderful iconic places that you see to my right. They have been  advocating for far too long not to see action from their elected  officials.   Madam Chair, it is time that Congress listen to the people of  Colorado and vote to protect the places that my home State hold so  dear. It is time to hold ourselves accountable. It is time we pass the  CORE Act.   Madam Chair, I urge swift adoption of H.R. 823, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Madam Chair, I have great respect for my colleague from  the State of Utah. I enjoy working with him on the Committee on Natural  Resources and have enjoyed being able to partner with him on a number  of efforts surrounding regenerative agriculture and many other  subjects.   I would say that I oppose this amendment. The distinguished  gentleman, I believe, mentioned--I hope I am quoting him right--that  when his bill passed the Chamber, and I believe the bill earlier this  year that passed our committee, that I was proud to vote for, he had  the support of conservationists in his State, county commissioners,  local elected officials, the Governor, and his congressional  delegation.   I would tell the distinguished gentleman that he may not be aware  that, in our case, we have the support of conservationists, county  commissioners, local elected officials, and our Governor.   The gentleman is correct that the only support that seems to be  missing is from Republican colleagues in the State's delegation, and  that is a shame. I would hope that a bill that has this volume of  support from local communities, as has been well established during the  course of this very vigorous and robust debate, would earn the support  of my friends on the other side of the aisle who also have the great  privilege of representing the State that we love so much.   With respect to the more esoteric point on legislating in areas that  an individual may not specifically represent, my understanding--again,  I have been in Congress here for only 10 months. But my sense of it  thus far is that we take votes literally every day on bills that impact  our respective districts and, of course, areas far outside of our  districts.   During the 114th Congress, just by way of example--I was not here. I  believe my friends on the other side of the aisle who are gathered here  today were. They voted to pass H.R. 8, which was the North American  Energy Security Infrastructure Act of 2015, out of the House.   This was a bill widely opposed by many Democrats who were concerned  that the bill would lead to increased opportunities for constructing  natural gas pipelines across Federal lands in their home districts.  That, of course, did not stop my colleagues from voting for that bill.  They searched their conscience. They made the conclusion that they  reached. And that is their right.   I would only say that it is the right of every Member on this  particular bill to, again, search their conscience as to whether or not  they believe areas like the Thompson Divide ought to be protected. If  they believe that those areas should be protected, then they ought to  vote ``yes.''   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1915     Mr. Chair, we will continue to do that important work,  and I appreciate the gentleman's statement in that regard. And I concur  with it.   It is worth mentioning--I don't know that it has been mentioned yet  during this debate: We have worked very hard. I have a stack of emails.  This is literally 35, 40 pages of emails, exchanges between my staff  who work on public lands with the Representative from the Third  Congressional District over the last 8 months, working, trying to get  that consensus.   I will certainly pledge to the gentleman that we are going to keep  doing it.   Mr. Chair, with that, I am ready to close as well, but I will reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous consent to claim the time in  opposition, though I am not opposed.    Mr. Chair, the section of the bill that the  Representative referenced, in my reading of the bill and in my  understanding of the bill, already includes some language that is  nearly identical regarding Federal water rights.   But, that being said, I made a pledge to the distinguished gentleman  from Utah just a few moments ago in the debate that we would continue  working to try to get to consensus. So I will support this amendment,  and I will encourage my colleagues on this side of the aisle in good  faith to support this amendment as well, and I hope the sponsor of this  amendment would take that good faith and recognize the same.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I would like to claim time in opposition.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, this amendment would add language regarding existing  grazing to a public land withdrawal that protects a sensitive landscape  and its ranchers from mining.   As a reminder, the CORE Act is supported by many ranchers who have  been involved with the Thompson Divide Coalition over the years and by  the North Thompson and Coal Basin Cattlemen's Association because the  bill would protect their ranching heritage on these lands for future  generations.   So, ultimately, I don't think that this amendment is necessary, and I  do worry about the potential for unintended consequences. For example,  I hope that adding it does not somehow imply that the many withdrawals  that Congress routinely enacts without such language would somehow  restrict grazing; although, I know that that is not my colleague's  intent.   Mr. Chair, I would ask the gentleman--I mean, if the gentleman is  [[Page H8663]]  willing to support the underlying bill if his amendment is adopted,  then I would be happy to support it.   Mr. Chair, with that, I will reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, while I appreciate my colleague's statement-- and I don't know that I heard a particular answer to the fundamental  question as to whether or not he would be supportive of this bill were  his amendment to pass--again, I think we are trying to approach this in  a good faith way. We want to find consensus.   So, if the Representative from the Third Congressional District  believes that this amendment is necessary to protect the ranching  heritage on these lands for future generations, which is obviously a  goal that he and I both share, I will support the amendment.   Mr. Chair, I am no longer in opposition and will encourage my  colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chairman, I oppose this amendment. It does not  reflect agency recommendations or on-the-ground support of title IV of  this bill. Veiled behind the claim of compliance with existing  management, this amendment is contrary to a longstanding agreement to  transfer 2,560 acres of Forest Service land to the National Park  Service, which is reflected in the CORE Act as written.   Both agencies have agreed that the transfer would benefit both the  national recreation area and the national forest, and the proposal has  long enjoyed broad public support. This amendment is an attempt to both  reduce the acreage included in the national recreation area and to  prevent the most effective management of these lands.   And I think it is important, Mr. Chair, because we have talked a lot  about stakeholder involvement, community-driven processes, and we have  yet to receive any letter opposing a provision of the bill impacting a  county in which that county ultimately has acreage involved; any letter  of opposition. The only letter, in fact, that we have received of  communication is from Gunnison County. Gunnison County strongly opposes  this amendment. They were never consulted by the sponsor on this  amendment, despite the area in question being in their county.   So ultimately, I would oppose this amendment, and I would encourage  all members, respectfully, to vote against it.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, with much respect to my colleague from the  Third Congressional District, I have been to Montrose many times. It is  a beautiful part of our State and there are wonderful people who call  that community home. What I would say, again, I find it a bit ironic,  with all of  [[Page H8664]]  the discussion around local support and whether or not local  communities support provisions of the bill or do not, on the one hand,  we don't have a single communication that I am aware of from a county  that is impacted by a provision of this bill opposing the title that  impacts that county. We do not have one.   The only letter of opposition, or the only communication that we have  from a county opposing any of the matters that we are discussing today  happens to be a communication from a county that opposes the amendment  offered by the gentleman. And so, again, I struggle to understand the  consistency there, but nonetheless, contextually I just want to make  sure we fully explain the rationale behind the 2017 interagency  agreement that my distinguished friend mentioned, because ironically  enough, the agreement that the sponsor mentioned that ultimately the  amendment is grounded in for the purposes of, ``managing recreational  facilities while congressional action is expected to legislatively  establish the Curecanti National Recreation Area.''   So in 2008 and 2009 these agencies all agreed that the transfer of  the full acreage, 2,560 acres, that that was something they supported,  and they were hoping that Congress would do something about it. Ten  years later, it is 2019, and we have done nothing. Ultimately, the  agencies came together on an interagency agreement in 2017 to at least  do something in the interim with the hopes that Congress would step up  and fill the void and codify those protections, which is precisely the  opportunity that we have now before us. That is why I oppose this  amendment and would encourage others to do the same.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time    Mr. Chair, how much time do I have remaining?    Mr. Chairman, I would say, with respect to the  technicalities in terms of active forest management and the interagency  agreement, I suppose we will have to agree to disagree. And I  appreciate the gentleman's point and, ultimately, we have clearly  landed on different sides of that issue.   But, again, and I hate to belabor the point, it is important for  those, you know, who may be watching these proceedings thousands of  miles away back home in our home State for them to just appreciate the  facts.   So we are clear, there are nine counties directly impacted by this  legislation. There is one county, in my understanding, that my friend  from the Third Congressional District is citing when he mentions  potential opposition to the bill. But what he is not clarifying, or  rather what has not been clarified, is there is no county of those nine  that oppose the provision of the bill that impacts their community; not  one. We have been here for an hour, and I have yet to hear of a single  county, or a town, or a city council for that matter.   Facts matter. This bill has local support, and that local support  extends to this title of the bill. The Gunnison County commissioners  and the community in Gunnison have made that clear, which is why I  would urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I want to say a deep note of gratitude to my  distinguished colleague and my good friend from Colorado (Mr. Crow),  who served our country so bravely and so honorably. We are all deeply  grateful for his service in the Armed Forces and, of course, his  service today in this Chamber.   I don't know that I could say it any better than he did. I believe  that this amendment reaffirms the support that we have for HAATS across  our Colorado delegation and for the reasons he already so eloquently  stated.   I think, ultimately, any further codification, as my colleague from  the Third Congressional District had referenced, would be a solution in  search of a problem.   Mr. Chair, I encourage every Member of this Chamber to support Mr.  Crow's important amendment.    Mr. Chair, I move that the Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Crow) having assumed the chair, Mr. Pappas, Acting Chair of the  Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that  that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 823) to  provide for the designation of certain wilderness areas, recreation  management areas, and conservation areas in the State of Colorado, and  for other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon.                            ____________________
