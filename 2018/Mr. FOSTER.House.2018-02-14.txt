 Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, my amendment clarifies that this bill is  only intended to apply to the source code underpinning algorithmic  trading rather than any computer code that exists anywhere in the  enterprise.   The algorithmic source code at a trading firm are its crown jewels.  It is basically the core of its existence in its intellectual property.   It is not merely historical or descriptive like books or records that  regulators routinely have access to. Likewise, it is not a broad  expression of strategies that a firm might use some time in the future.  Rather, it is a specific and prescriptive algorithm that generates a  specific outcome based on a specific set of inputs.   The firms that rely on algorithmic trading have Ph.D. scientists,  mathematicians, and economists researching correlations that lead to  these relationships between the inputs and outputs. These may be simple  but may also be incredibly complex, involving multiple inputs that do  not appear related at first glance.   This complexity, coupled with the fact that they are written largely  in computer code, limits the usefulness of  [[Page H1166]]  inspecting source code as an examination tool. It is, rather, the  behavior of the firm in the market that represents potential violations  of security laws. Manipulative behavior, like frequently displaying or  canceling orders, should get the regulators' attention and prompt them  to ask the firm to explain it.   Source code would be and will be a valuable part of any investigation  or enforcement action into observed manipulation of the market, but  this is not the basis and should not be the basis for casual  inspection. It would probably be central to proving the element of  intent in an enforcement action because it demonstrates that the  algorithm was designed to engage in, for example, manipulative or  abusive behavior.   To this end, it is imperative that the firms achieve archived  versions in effect at any given time and log modifications to those  algorithms, including who made them, at any time that the code is  altered. These should always be available by subpoena.   Additionally, I believe that most firms would allow the regulator on  site to examine the source code on an air gap computer. To treat the  source code as ordinary books and records would not limit the regulator  to onsite examination, but would allow for staff to request it and that  it be made available offsite, which has real dangers.   Because of the value the firm carries with its proprietary  algorithms, it makes sense that the firm would be reluctant to allow  any undue access to its crown jewels. It is really, I believe and I  think the majority of my colleagues believe, something that should be  accessible only by a subpoena.   My amendment simply clarifies that it is only the algorithmic trading  code and related information that should be covered. I urge my  colleagues to support my amendment and, upon its adoption, to support  the bill on final passage.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1615     Mr. Speaker, I would just like to simply reiterate that  it should be the actions in the market that are the first indications  that the regulators should have a look at, and when they see suspicious  activity in the market, that is the time to get the subpoena and go  after the source code.   With that, I just urge the adoption of the amendment and the passage  of the underlying bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
