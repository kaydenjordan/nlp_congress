 Mr. President, I was necessarily absent for rollcall vote  No. 17, the motion to invoke cloture on the Gardner amendment in the  nature of a substitute, No. 1617, to H.R. 1957. Had I been present for  the vote, I would have voted yea.                            ____________________     Mr. President, even during this pandemic, people have  been forming lines--6 feet apart and masked--at the corner of Emerson  and Green Bay Road in Evanston, IL, to pick up Hecky's Barbeque. They  come for the pulled pork, chicken wings, and especially the sauce. And  for years, Hecky Powell was there with his family's recipes, his hard  work, his smile, and his wisdom. Sadly, on May 22, Hecky passed away  from pneumonia after a diagnosis of COVID-19. He used to say that  people kept coming in for the sauce--that is what made the food great.  Well, part of what made Evanston great was Hecky. For 37 years, he  brought good barbeque, leadership, and kindness to Evanston, and today  we pay tribute to him.   Harry William ``Hecky'' Powell was born in 1948 at Cook County  Hospital.  [[Page S2929]]  Verna, his mom, had to give birth there because there was no room at  the Community Hospital of Evanston, the only hospital in town that  accepted Black patients. Hecky was one of nine siblings. He had a  successful career in public service, serving as the director of several  nonprofit agencies.   One day, Hecky got an idea for a restaurant. He was dating Cheryl  Judice, a sociologist who would later become his wife. They didn't know  much about food, but Hecky's mom did. Verna had lost her job at a  restaurant, and his dad was unemployed at the time. So when the  restaurant next to Hecky's office went on the market, he figured he  would buy it, and his parents could actually run the restaurant. On  October 13, 1983, Hecky's Barbeque opened up with only $100 in the  register. Many of the first recipes came from Verna and his Creole  grandmother's native New Orleans.   Everyone enjoyed Hecky's. Chicago Bears legend William ``The  Refrigerator'' Perry was an early customer, drawn to the sauce-drenched  ribs, fries, and two slices of Wonder Bread. Chicago Bulls great  Scottie Pippen had Hecky's cater the team's private plane on occasion.  When the Northwestern Wildcats faced off with the University of  Southern California Trojans in the Rose Bowl in 1996, then-mayor  Lorraine Morton and Hecky bet the mayor of Pasadena that the Wildcats  would win. The Trojans won 41 to 32, and Hecky made ribs and chicken  for the entire Pasadena City Council.   But it was more than a restaurant. Hecky used his place to help high  school kids learn responsibility and social skills, giving many of them  their first jobs. He worked long hours, starting early in the morning,  but he always had fun. No task was too small. He was cook, cleaner, and  manager alongside his mother and the kids he was mentoring.   Hecky was a champion for local youth. In 1994, he founded the Forrest  E. Powell Foundation. Named after his father, the foundation offers  grant and scholarship opportunities. In 2016, he started the Evanston  Work Ethic Program, which helps young people prepare for vocational or  trade school.   In 2011, Hecky left work early, thinking he had the flu. He made  light of it, but his wife knew better. He later was diagnosed with  liver failure and told he had 6 to 7 months to live.   Hecky resolved that he was going to be fine and against tough odds,  he lived to receive a liver transplant in 2015 and was able to get his  life back. Hecky then joined the Northwestern Medicine Transplant  Advisory Council Board to help people get their own lives back too.   For all this work, Hecky received the key to the city of Evanston in  2014, Abner Mikva Lifetime Achievement Award in 2015, and the street in  front of the restaurant was officially renamed ``Hecky Powell Way.'' A  person did not know Evanston until they experienced it with Hecky.   When the COVID-19 pandemic reached Evanston, Hecky stepped up.  Hecky's kept the whole staff on payroll and donated meals to hospital  workers, shelters, and the Evanston Fire Departm. Hecky, as the  unofficial mayor of Evanston, was the face of the community poster that  read ``No Mask, No Sauce.''   Evanston has lost a true leader of the community. He was kind and  generous without ever asking anything in return. I was honored to count  Hecky as a friend and enjoyed many great times together with him.  Squeezing in a stop at Hecky's was part of every Evanston visit.   This June 19, people will celebrate with Hecky's Juneteenth  Strawberry pop. For years, Hecky was part of the Jubilee, celebrating  the arrival of news in Galveston, TX, that the Civil War was over and  President Lincoln had issued his Emancipation Proclamation. He was  Evanston's biggest supporter of making Juneteenth a holiday. This year,  Evanston has its first Juneteenth Parade, and Hecky was going to be a  big part of it, so it is fitting that the community will be dedicating  part of the celebration to him.   Hecky is survived by his wife Cheryl, seven children, Sharmin, Terry,  Dawn, Joy, Hecky Junior, Jason, and Gigi, as well as his mother and  seven siblings.                            ____________________
