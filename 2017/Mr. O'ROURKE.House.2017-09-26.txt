 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Congressman Weber for  bringing us today. I also want to extend my condolences for the loss of  life and the devastation that was visited on the communities that he  represents. I know that he is doing his best to unite those communities  in every way possible to ensure that they get back on their feet, they  rebuild, and are bigger and better than ever. Party difference doesn't  mean anything at this moment. It is all of us as Texans. I join  Chairman McCaul in agreeing that we cannot have a better moment as a  State. I am grateful to him for bringing us all together today.   As he said, I have really had an opportunity to spend some time  traveling Texas, and especially southeast Texas, starting around the  time that Harvey hit. I will tell you, Mr. Speaker, that in Austin,  Texas, on the 25th of August, I was there as the first evacuees were  leaving southeast Texas, coming from Victoria and Corpus Christi and  other places that were under mandatory evacuation orders. They were  arriving at Red Cross shelters that were staffed both by the  professionals and the volunteers.   I was told by the head of Red Cross in Austin that they had never  seen a greater turnout of volunteers on the first day of a disaster. In  fact, I met a young man named Luis Zamora, who at the time was a rising  junior at Tarleton State University and a member of the National Guard,  and who was so disappointed that his colleagues in the Guard were  called up, but he was not. He drove himself down to the Red Cross  headquarters so that he could sign up, volunteer, and help staff one of  these shelters, welcome those who were fleeing this storm, and help try  to make their lives a little bit better.   It reminded me of visiting some of the shelters in San Antonio, where  I had a chance to see their great Mayor Ron Nirenberg in action  personally welcoming people coming from other parts of the State. To  every one of them, his message was: We are so glad you are here. Stay  as long as you need to. We are going to make things better for you. You  focus on you. We will do our best to take care of you.   That really was the message we heard everywhere that we went.   When we found ourselves in Victoria helping to transport some medical  supplies for two of those hospitals, we met an extraordinary young  woman named Lisa Price, who had been up for the last 72 hours, as many  of the people working in those hospitals were, trying to coordinate  care for those in need, coordinate the evacuation of those who were no  longer able to be cared for in hospitals that only had backup generator  power and did not have reliable water and could not keep those  medicines and vaccines chilled.   There were volunteer ambulance corps from all over the State of Texas  who had driven down to Victoria to help transport these patients out.  Lisa and others were helping to coordinate that. Her husband, Jason, a  Department of Public Safety Trooper was out on those roads that had no  streetlights, that had no working traffic signals, trying to ensure the  safety of his fellow Texans. Two extraordinary heroes who exemplify the  way that Texas met this challenge.   I certainly spent some time in Houston, where we heard tale of all of  the first responders, certainly folks who were working under the great  fire chief there, Chief Pena. But also first responders who came from  across the State. El Paso sent folks from the El Paso Police Department  and the El Paso Fire Department. They made over 100 rescues not just in  the Houston area, but also in the greater Beaumont area, including  rescuing a 1-month-old child from chest-high waters. Again, we saw that  both from first responders and everyday citizens who risked their own  lives to save the lives of fellow Texans.    We were in a parking lot in Victoria, where we were picking up  supplies to take to Rockport. We knew, however, that Rockport was under  a mandatory curfew, enforced by DPS. So I approached two DPS cruisers  that were in the parking lot at Walmart, where we were going in to buy  ice and water and diapers and other supplies that they might need in  Rockport. I wanted to ask these two DPS officers if they could help us  to get into Rockport under the curfew. As they were rolling down their  window and I began to introduce myself, they said: I know exactly who  you are. You are Beto O'Rourke. We are from El Paso. We were one of the  first volunteers from the Department of Public Safety in El Paso to  come out to Victoria, and we have been working this community,  communities like Cuero, Port Lavaca, Rockport, and other places.                                time  1715    They wanted to be where the action was. They wanted to be out there  saving lives. And it made me so extraordinarily proud of El Paso and  Texas once again. It is like the 90 soldiers from Fort Bliss from one  of the aviation brigades who were in southeast Texas as well trying to  facilitate the rescue of their fellow Texans, being where the need was  at its moment of greatest importance, again, making us so proud.   Congressman Weber, I will conclude by telling you that, as we came in  to Rockport and were able to successfully get in under curfew to make  our delivery, we were blown away and inspired by the volunteer fire  department, 20 people strong, 8 of whom had lost their homes and  literally everything in their homes but had not lost a minute's service  to their fellow community out of that Rockport fire station.   They were living in the fire station because they had nowhere else to  live. They were responding to triple or quadruple the service calls.  The rains had now ended. The fires had begun. There was some question  about the viability  [[Page H7526]]  of those structures, and they wanted to be there to save lives.   That fire chief, Steve Sims, and the men and women who serve under  him are the absolute best of us as Texans. I am so glad that you and  every one of our colleagues from Texas, Republican or Democrat, House  Member or Senator, are focused on making Chief Sims, the members of  that fire department, and every Texan affected by Harvey whole again.  We have got to use their inspiration and their example to do the  important work that is here before us.   So I thank you once again for bringing us together, allowing me to  join you and work with you and our colleagues to make sure that Texans  fully recover from Hurricane Harvey bigger and better than ever. Thank  you.    Thank you. I cannot think of a better way to spend it  than to be here with you.
