 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 348 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 348         Resolved, That at any time after adoption of this       resolution the Speaker may, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule       XVIII, declare the House resolved into the Committee of the       Whole House on the state of the Union for consideration of       the bill (H.R. 953) to amend the Federal Insecticide,       Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act and the Federal Water       Pollution Control Act to clarify Congressional intent       regarding the regulation of the use of pesticides in or near       navigable waters, and for other purposes. The first reading       of the bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order       against consideration of the bill are waived. General debate       shall be confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour       equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking       minority member of the Committee on Transportation and       Infrastructure. After general debate the bill shall be       considered for amendment under the five-minute rule. It shall       be in order to consider as an original bill for the purpose       of amendment under the five-minute rule an amendment in the       nature of a substitute consisting of the text of Rules       Committee Print 115-21. That amendment in the nature of a       substitute shall be considered as read. All points of order       against that amendment in the nature of a substitute are       waived. No amendment to that amendment in the nature of a       substitute shall be in order except those printed in the       report of the Committee on Rules accompanying this       resolution. Each such amendment may be offered only in the       order printed in the report, may be offered only by a Member       designated in the report, shall be considered as read, shall       be debatable for the time specified in the report equally       divided and controlled by the proponent and an opponent,       shall not be subject to amendment, and shall not be subject       to a demand for division of the question in the House or in       the Committee of the Whole. All points of order against such       amendments are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of       the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report       the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been       adopted. Any Member may demand a separate vote in the House       on any amendment adopted in the Committee of the Whole to the       bill or to the amendment in the nature of a substitute made       in order as original text. The previous question shall be       considered as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to       final passage without intervening motion except one motion to       recommit with or without instructions.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr.  McGovern), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.  During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, I found myself listening to the Reading  Clerk as he read through the rule. It is a fairly straightforward rule,  but it sounded pretty complicated as he was going through it. And I am  reminded that  [[Page H4434]]  standing to your left is one of the gentlemen that helps us sort  through those issues.   As every Member of this institution knows, who was listening to the  colloquy last week, Brian Cooper is leaving this House after 35 years  of public service, honorable service, showing up day in and day out. My  friend, Mr. McGovern, and I, working on the Rules Committee, sometimes  go until 2, 3, or 4 in the morning. Well, folks like Mr. Cooper can't  go home until the Rules Committee goes home.   So day in and day out, with absolutely no pomp or circumstance, just  dedicated public service, Brian Cooper served this institution. I fear  this will be the last time he and I are on the floor together while I  have control of the microphone. And I did not want to yield control of  that microphone without telling how much his assistance has meant to  me.   You know, Mr. Speaker, standing in that chair is a powerful  responsibility. The burden sometimes is a lot to bear. When you are  surrounded by a team of excellence, as you are today, with Ethan to  your right and Brian to your left, I know you do that with great  confidence. I am grateful to folks who help us to succeed.   Thank you, Mr. Cooper, for all of that service.   Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 348 is a structured rule. It provides  for consideration of H.R. 953, the Reducing Regulatory Burdens Act of  2017. It makes in order two amendments from my Democratic colleagues-- one from Ms. Esty and one from Mr. Huffman.   As you might remember, the House passed a nearly identical version of  this bill last year, Mr. Speaker, but, unfortunately, it did not get  across the finish line in the Senate, so it did not make it to the  President's desk. We are trying again this year. My sincere hope is  that we will succeed.   Mr. Speaker, I know that you hear from constituents, as I do, talking  about regulatory burdens, and why can't we bring commonsense rules and  regulations to Washington. H.R. 953, the bill that this rule would make  in order, is an attempt to do that.   This bill prohibits the EPA from requiring unnecessary and  duplicative pollution permits for certain pesticides. Now, so often  when we start a sentence with ``this prevents the EPA,'' folks think:  Oh, there go those Republicans again going after the environment,  waiving those regulations that protect friends and family.   Well, as you know, Mr. Speaker, that accusation is never accurate.  But, in particular, it fails to address this situation.   For decade upon decade, the EPA has regulated pesticides in this  country. If we pass H.R. 953 today, for decades and decades to come,  the EPA will continue to regulate pesticides in this country.   As a result of litigation, Mr. Speaker, the courts are forcing the  EPA not to regulate pesticides as pesticides, but to regulate  pesticides as pollutant discharges, as if there is something else to do  with pesticides other than to spray it.   They are saying that you can't just get a permit to use your  pesticide, Mr. Speaker. You can't just read the label and the proper  application and get a permit to apply, as indicated on the label. You  must also get a permit to discharge a pollutant as if the pesticide is  not already regulated as a pesticide itself.   Mr. Speaker, it makes no sense. The good news is I am surround by a  team of excellence here in the United States House of Representatives  and, in a bipartisan way, we have already agreed that it makes no  sense.   You will recall, Mr. Speaker, we brought a substantially similar  measure to the floor, and we passed it under a process called  suspension of the rules. It is a process we save for those bills that  are relatively noncontroversial. It passed in a bipartisan way, but  didn't make it across the Senate floor.   We brought it back again, Mr. Speaker, to this floor. We brought it  under a rule, as we are doing today. It passed again in a bipartisan  way. We sent it to the Senate, but couldn't make it across the Senate  floor.   Mr. Speaker, we added it to the farm bill that we passed here in the  House, which, again, passed in a bipartisan way. We sent it over to the  Senate and it was stripped out on the Senate side.   Mr. Speaker, we have come together time and time again as a body to  move this commonsense regulatory reform forward. It is my great hope  that I will get support from both sides of the aisle again today not  just on this rule, but on the underlying legislation, and that we will  move forward in a bipartisan way again.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I would advise my friend from Massachusetts  I do not have any speakers remaining, and I reserve the balance of my  time to close.    Will the gentleman yield?    I appreciate that. I would like to inquire of the  Speaker: Is my friend from Massachusetts working on my yielded time or  is he working on his time?    I thank my friend.    If my friend would yield, I was advised that I had  yielded an abundance of time. I just wanted to make sure that I was not  being more generous than you and I would have intended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I want to recognize that, if you locked my friend from Massachusetts  and me in a room together, it would be over both of our objections, but  we would be able to solve about 50 percent of the challenges that face  this country.   There is something different that happens in conversation and  dialogue when the cameras are turned off than happens when the cameras  are on, and of course we are going to keep these cameras here on the  floor of the House for as long as you and I are here because the  American people have a right to see and a right to know.   But just like Mom and Dad don't want to have all their conversations  in front of the kids, and the kids certainly don't want to have all of  their conversations in front of Mom and Dad, there is a role to be  played for folks to be able to close the door and sit down and visit  with each other and try to make things better.   My friend from Massachusetts is absolutely right. The only job that  we have is to make a difference for our constituency back home.  Sometimes we legitimately disagree on how to do that. The budget is a  good example.   You will remember, Mr. Speaker, President Obama, in his 8 years as  President of the United States, never once introduced a budget that  balanced. He borrowed from our children and our grandchildren in every  single budget.   And when I say he didn't introduce a budget that balanced, I don't  mean that he didn't balance in year 1, I don't mean he didn't balance  in year 10. I mean never, ever, ever looking forward in his budgets did  he ever stop borrowing.   Mr. Speaker, there is not a man or woman in this institution who  believes that you can run a country that way. There is not one. There  is not a man or woman in this institution who doesn't understand that  balancing budgets is going to mean hard decisions, and so it is  absolutely the right place for the dialog about what those hard  decisions should be.   But let us not be confused for one moment. There is no pathway to  balance that isn't hard. Borrowing from your children and your  grandchildren to pay for what you want today is always going to be  easier, Mr. Speaker, than paying for it yourself. We are going to have  to have that conversation.   I agree with my friend from Massachusetts. We do not work for the  President of the United States in this institution. If anything, he  works for us.   I sit on the House Budget Committee, Mr. Speaker, and I promise you,  we are promulgating our own House budget, a work product that is going  to make this institution proud. I am particularly pleased to be working  with Budget Committee Chairwoman Diane Black on that budget, even as we  speak.                                time  1300    Mr. Speaker, it will balance by making commonsense changes to Federal  programs, one of which is included in this bill here today.   Take the EPA, for example. Mr. Speaker, I encourage you, if you have  not read the comments of our new EPA Administrator, to get into those  because what he would tell you, which is absolutely true, is that we  have Superfund sites in this country that are so polluted they cannot  be utilized for other purposes.   They have been on the Superfund list for decades through Republican  Presidents and through Democratic Presidents. They have been sitting on  that list. There is no plan to clean them up, no plan to make a  difference in those communities, and no plan to serve those  constituencies. That is wrong.   Instead of spending its time and resources making a difference for  families, making a difference for the environment, what is the EPA  having to do?   Respond to court cases that tell it to treat the reasonable and  labeled application of pesticides; not as spraying pesticides in your  field, but as if you were operating a factory and just having as an  effluent, pesticide flowing out of your factory. That is just nonsense.   The reason we produced pesticides is to spray it in fields. We do not  need an effluent discharge permit as if we are running a factory,  pumping it into our streams. We are not. We are spraying it on our  plants to do what?   Address the food needs of this Nation.   My friend from Massachusetts is absolutely right when he talks about  hunger in this Nation, Mr. Speaker. He is absolutely right. I dare say  that there is not a community in this country that is not affected by  hunger. But the biggest advocate we have in the fight against hunger is  the American farmer, Mr. Speaker.   There is nobody in the world who does it better; there is nobody in  the world who produces it cheaper; there is nobody in the world that  has the capability of producing the food to go on the grocery store  shelves in America except the American farmer. And these pesticides and  herbicides make a difference in getting that food out of the field and  onto those store shelves.   We want to do it with strict EPA regulation. That is what is lost in  this debate. There is not one Member of this body that wants to repeal  EPA regulation. We want to keep that EPA regulation. It is called  FIFRA, that regulation that pesticides are regulated under. No one  wants to change that at all.   All folks want to do is say: Wait a minute, this is not a factory  discharge issue. This is a pesticide issue.   My friend from Massachusetts is absolutely right. I sit on the  Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, Mr. Speaker. We did not  have a hearing or a markup on this bill, and it was absolutely referred  to our committee.   Why, Mr. Speaker?   It was referred to our committee because we have jurisdiction over  the Clean Water Act, but this has never been a Clean Water Act issue,  except the courts tried to make it one. This has never been a Clean  Water Act issue, except the litigants tried to make it one. So when we  tried to fix the problem, we didn't waste a moment in the  Transportation and Infrastructure Committee dealing with the Clean  Water Act because this has never been a Clean Water Act issue. It is an  ag issue, which is why it went through my friend of Massachusetts'  Agriculture Committee.   Mr. Speaker, I don't begrudge anyone the job that they have to do in  this institution. We have different constituencies. They ask different  things of us.  [[Page H4438]]  We all have to come and do our work. But I will tell you what, Mr.  Speaker, everything doesn't have to be an us-against-them battle.  Sometimes it is just about us. Sometimes there is more that unites this  country than divides this country, and that is okay. Sometimes we are  able to work together on commonsense solutions, and that is okay.   Mr. Speaker, when this bill came to the House under suspension of the  rules, again, that process that we use for things that are  noncontroversial, my friend from Massachusetts supported it at that  time. He supported it because it is good legislation that is going to  make a difference for folks back home. It is going to make a difference  in combating hunger in every jurisdiction across this Nation.   When this bill went through the Agriculture Committee, Mr. Speaker,  there were no amendments offered. The Agriculture Committee is composed  of Republicans and Democrats. It is a place where discussion takes  place. It was the markup of this bill, which is when you go and try to  amend it and make it better. Not one amendment was offered from either  side.   Why?   Because we have discussed this issue, we have litigated this issue,  and we have worked together on this issue, and it is a collaborative  work product.    I yield to the gentleman from Massachusetts.    I thank my friend. He is absolutely right. When the  experts on the Agriculture Committee considered this, when the folks  who spend their entire careers on Capitol Hill working on pesticide and  pesticide safety considered this, they had absolutely no amendments to  offer whatsoever.   When it came to the Rules Committee and the entire House could offer  amendments, folks absolutely offered amendments. The Rules Committee,  on which the gentleman from Massachusetts and I serve, made two of  those amendments in order. We rejected others. You heard my friend's  opening statement, Mr. Speaker, that one of the amendments we rejected  was to protect pregnant women.   Well, Mr. Speaker, for Pete's sake, I have served with these men and  women in here. I have been in this body for 6 years. There is not one  Member of this institution who doesn't care about pregnant women. There  is not one Member of this institution who doesn't care about children.  There is not one Member of this institution who doesn't care. What we  do in this institution is care. And when my friend from Massachusetts  supported this bill, when he supported this bill, there were no  amendments along those lines.   When the gentleman supported this bill without the amendment dealing  particularly with pregnant women and children, I don't believe for a  moment the gentleman forgot about those pregnant women and children. I  don't believe for a moment he decided he was going to punish pregnant  women and children. I believe that he thought those protections were  inherent in the base text, and he was right when he thought it, and he  was right when he supported it.    I yield to the gentleman from Massachusetts.    Reclaiming my time, I will tell my friend two things  that he already knows. Number one is we do accept amendments from the  entire Congress. That is the purpose of the Rules Committee being in  existence, and we have added two amendments to this bill for  consideration.   When the gentleman supported it in the 112th Congress, we considered  no other amendments. That is a change this time. We are going to do  that. When it passed the last time we did a rule, no one offered any  amendments. This is a change from that time. When we passed it in the  Agriculture bill, no one offered any amendments. So it is a change this  time. We absolutely are opening up the process more and more with every  time the House considers this bill.   But I would also tell my friend something that we are going to have  to grapple with as an institution, and that is that I don't need a  Rules Committee if what we are going to do is make every amendment that  comes to this institution in order.   The only reason we have a Rules Committee is to pick and choose. The  only reason we have a Rules Committee is to set up a timetable on which  we can debate and consider things in a reasonable manner. The only  reason we have a Rules Committee is because we are not operating under  unanimous consent as our friends in the Senate do, though we absolutely  could. And I would refer him to my friend, Daniel Webster, who has some  marvelous ideas about how we might do that.   But, Mr. Speaker, I think it is legitimate for folks back home to  wonder what is going on in that United States House. They passed it in  a bipartisan way once. They passed it in a bipartisan way twice. They  passed it in a bipartisan way three times, and here it is on the floor  today, and it is as if the sky is falling and going to open up and  swallow everything that is good and decent about this land.   Why is that, Mr. Speaker? Why is that the conversation we are having  today instead of the one we had not once, not twice, but three times  about how we could use this legislation to improve the lives of  citizens across this country?   Perhaps that is just the environment we are in. Perhaps that is just  the cards we have been dealt in politics across America today, Mr.  Speaker, but we have a chance together as an institution to stand up  and say it does not have to be that way. We have a chance together to  stand up and say that we can do better than those partisan shenanigans.  We can get together on things that are going to make a difference, and  the first opportunity you are going to have after this speech, Mr.  Speaker, to do that, is in supporting the rule for this bill. The first  opportunity we are going to have to do that is in supporting this rule,  and then supporting the underlying legislation and sending it back to  the Senate one more time. It is the right thing to do, Mr. Speaker, and  we have the opportunity to do that together.   Mr. Speaker, I urge strong support for the rule and the underlying  bill.   The material previously referred to by Mr. McGovern is as follows:         An Amendment To Be Offered to H. Res. 348 by Mr. McGovern         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       section:        Sec. 2. Rule XXI of the Rules of the House of       Representatives is amended by adding at the end the following       new clause:    RESTRICTIONS ON CONSIDERATION OF LEGISLATION THAT WOULD BREAK DONALD     TRUMP'S PROMISE NOT TO CUT SOCIAL SECURITY, MEDICARE, OR MEDICAID         13. (a) It shall not be in order to consider a bill, joint       resolution, motion, amendment, amendment between the Houses,       or conference report which includes any provision described       in paragraph (b).''        (b) A provision referred to in paragraph (a) is a provision       which, if enacted into law, would result in any of the       following:        (1) a reduction of guaranteed benefits scheduled under       title II of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 401 et seq.);        (2) an increase in either the early or full retirement age       for the benefits described in paragraph (1);  [[Page H4439]]         (3) a privatization of Social Security;        (4) a reduction of guaranteed benefits for individuals       entitled to, or enrolled for, benefits under the Medicare       program under title XVIII of 18 such Act (42 U.S.C. 1395 et       seq.); or        (5) a reduction of benefits or eligibility for individuals       enrolled in, or eligible to receive medical assistance       through, a State Medicaid plan or waiver under title XIX of       such Act (42 U.S.C. 1396 5 et seq.).        (c) It shall not be in order to consider a rule or order       that waives the application of paragraph (a). As disposition       of any point of order under paragraph (a) or this paragraph       (except a point of order against an amendment pursuant to       paragraph (a)), the Chair shall put the question of       consideration with respect to the measure, order, conference       report, or rule as applicable. The question of consideration       shall be debatable for 10 minutes by the Member initiating       the point of order and for 10 minutes by an opponent, but       shall otherwise be decided without intervening motion except       one that the House adjourn.                                   ____           The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.                            Parliamentary Inquiry
