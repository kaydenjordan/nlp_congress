 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman  from Hawaii for yielding time.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this bill. I am proud to  join the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Hill) in sponsoring this  legislation to update the Little Rock Central High School National  Historic Site.   In 1954, the Supreme Court issued a historic decision in the Brown v.  Board of Education case, which desegregated our Nation's public  schools. Unfortunately, the law of the land did not become the practice  of its people overnight. It took the will of brave men and women and  some very brave children, like the Little Rock Nine.   Parents swallowed the fear for their children. Strong, innocent  little children put their bodies on the line to force the change that  justice demands. The actions changed the heart and the soul of our  Nation, and we must admit today that our country is a better country  and we are a better people because of these children, the mothers and  fathers, the teachers, and many of our citizens.   When Little Rock, Arkansas, leaders attempted to desegregate Central  High School, the Governor fought back. He choose to stand on the side  of hate and bigotry. It took a determined mayor, a strong President,  the U.S. Army, and the Arkansas National Guard to protect these nine  teenagers as they entered the school.   In 1957, Mr. Speaker, I was 17 years old, and I vividly remember  those days. These young people inspired all of us to stand up, to speak  up, and to speak out. And many of us started saying: If the children in  Little Rock can do what they are doing, we, too, can do it.   For those of us watching on television, listening to the radio, and  reading the newspapers, we were deeply inspired. We were moved to do  something, to say something. I said to myself: We need to stand up the  same way the people and students in Little Rock are standing up. I  remember thinking that I could--that I must--find a way to get in the  way.   Mr. Speaker, Central High is part of our history that must be  preserved for a generation yet unborn.   I remember very well, a few years ago, I visited that school and  walked through the halls with a young African-American student who was  president of the student body, who the principal asked to escort me  through the school. I felt like I was walking in a special place,  almost a holy place. It brought tears to my eyes.   During those dark and difficult times, the national historic site  became a beacon of hope, an inspiration that we can never give up, that  we can never give in as we strive towards equal rights and justice for  all.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Arkansas for introducing this  bill, and I urge all of my colleagues to stand with the gentleman from  Arkansas and the gentlewoman from Hawaii and support this piece of  legislation.                                time  1400
