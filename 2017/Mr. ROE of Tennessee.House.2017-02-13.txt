 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 609) to designate the Department of Veterans  Affairs health care center in Center Township, Butler County,  Pennsylvania, as the ``Abie Abraham VA Clinic''.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 609         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) Abie Abraham of Lyndora, Pennsylvania, was stationed       during World War II with the 18th Infantry in New York; 3       years with the 14th Infantry in Panama; 15th Infantry,       unassigned in China, while the U.S.S. Panay was sunk; 30th       Infantry, Presidio, San Francisco; and the 31st Infantry,       Manila, Philippines, for 9 years.        (2) During World War II, Abraham fought, was captured,       endured the Bataan Death March and as a prisoner of war for       3\1/2\ years, was beaten, stabbed, shot, survived malaria and       starvation to be rescued by the 6th Rangers.        (3) Abraham stayed behind at the request of General Douglas       MacArthur for 2\1/2\ more years disinterring the bodies of       his fallen comrades from the Bataan Death March and the       prison camps, helping to identify their bodies and see that       they were properly laid to rest.        (4) After his promotion in 1945, Abraham came back to the       United States where he served as a recruiter and then also       served 2 years in Germany until his retirement with 30 years       of service as a Master Sergeant.        (5) Abraham received numerous medals for his service,       including the Purple Heart, and had several documentaries on       the Discovery Channel and History Channel.        (6) Abraham wrote the books ``Ghost of Bataan Speaks'' in       1971 and ``Oh, God, Where Are You'' in 1977 to help the       public better understand what our brave men endured at the       hands of the Imperial Japanese Army as prisoners of war.        (7) Abraham was a life member of the Veterans of Foreign       Wars, the American Legion, the Purple Heart Combat/Infantry       Organization, the American Ex-POWs, the Disabled American       Veterans, and the American Defenders of Bataan.        (8) Abraham was a volunteer at Veterans Affairs Butler       Healthcare for 23 years from  [[Page H1105]]       1988 to 2011 and had 36,851 service hours caring for our       veterans.       SEC. 2. ABIE ABRAHAM VA CLINIC.         (a) Designation.--The Department of Veterans Affairs health       care center in Center Township, Butler County, Pennsylvania,       shall after the date of the enactment of this Act be known       and designated as the ``Abie Abraham VA Clinic''.        (b) References.--Any reference in any law, regulation, map,       document, paper, or other record of the United States to the       health care center referred to in subsection (a) shall be       deemed to be a reference to the ``Abie Abraham VA Clinic''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and add extraneous material.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of H.R. 609, a bill to name the  Department of Veterans Affairs health care center in Center Township,  Butler County, Pennsylvania, the Abie Abraham VA Clinic.   This bill is sponsored by the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.  Kelly), my good friend. I am grateful to him for introducing this  legislation in honor of an American hero.   Master Sergeant Abraham lived a truly remarkable life. As a teenager,  he set a world record for tree sitting--a popular pastime in those  days--after sitting in a tree for 3\1/2\ months, according to his  obituary in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.   In 1932, at the age of just 19, he enlisted in the United States Navy  and, 2 years later, the United States Army. Over the course of a 30- year military career, he served in the Philippines, China, Germany, and  Panama. He earned a number of accolades, including the Purple Heart. He  survived, Mr. Speaker, the Bataan Death March and 3\1/2\ years in  captivity, being beaten, shot, and starved.   Following his rescue, instead of returning immediately to the United  States, Master Sergeant Abraham agreed to stay behind to recover the  remains of his fallen comrades and to ensure they received the  recognition they were certainly due.   Following his service, Master Sergeant Abraham devoted his time to  caring for his fellow brothers and sisters in arms as a lifelong member  of several veterans service organizations and as a volunteer at the VA  Butler Healthcare Center, where he spent a total of almost 40,000 hours  over the course of 23 years tending to the veteran patients there.   In his spare time, he authored two books, made public appearances at  schools and community centers, and participated in documentary films  that have aired on the Discovery and History Channels. In addition to  all of that, he was also a lightweight boxing champion and trainer.   Master Sergeant Abraham most certainly lived a full and interesting  life characterized by both service in and out of uniform. Given that,  it is only fitting and appropriate that we honor him by naming the VA  healthcare center in Butler County, Pennsylvania, after him. This  legislation satisfies all the committee's naming criteria and is  supported by the Pennsylvania congressional delegation as well as many  VSOs.   Once again, I thank my colleague, Congressman Mike Kelly, for  introducing this bill. I urge all of my colleagues to join me in  supporting it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman  from Pennsylvania (Mr. Kelly), my friend and colleague.    Mr. Speaker, I think this is an amazing story  that Mr. Kelly shared before us. I had a history professor in college  who survived the Bataan Death March. He spent 3\1/2\ years in the  same--I wonder if these two men knew each other. He, indeed, too, was a  remarkable man. I can think of no better honor in Butler, Pennsylvania,  than to honor his memory by naming this medical center. Once again, I  encourage all Members to support this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 512) to title 38, United States Code, to permit  veterans to grant access to their records in the databases of the  Veterans Benefits Administration to certain designated congressional  employees, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 512         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Working to Integrate       Networks Guaranteeing Member Access Now Act'' or the       ``WINGMAN Act''.       SEC. 2. PROVISION OF ACCESS TO CASE-TRACKING INFORMATION.         (a) In General.--Chapter 59 of title 38, United States       Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:       ``Sec. 5906. Access of certain congressional employees to         veteran records         ``(a) In General.--(1) The Secretary shall provide to each       veteran who submits a claim for benefits under the laws       administered by the Secretary an opportunity to permit a       covered congressional employee employed in the office of the       Member of Congress representing the district where the       veteran resides to have access to all of the records of the       veteran in the databases of the Veterans Benefits       Administration.        ``(2) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, upon       receipt of the permission from the veteran under paragraph       (1), the Secretary shall provide read-only access to such       records to such a covered congressional employee in a manner       that does not allow such employee to modify the data       contained in such records or in any part of a database of the       Veterans Benefits Administration.        ``(3) A Member of Congress may designate not more than two       employees of the Member as covered congressional employees.        ``(b) Requirements.--The Secretary may not impose any       requirement other than the requirements specified under       subsection (e)(1) before treating an employee as a covered       congressional employee for purposes of this section.        ``(c) Nonrecognition.--A covered congressional employee may       not be recognized as an agent or attorney under this chapter.        ``(d) Limitation on Use of Funds.--None of the amounts made       available to carry out this section may be used to design,       develop, or administer any training for purposes of providing       training to covered congressional employees.        ``(e) Definitions.--In this section:        ``(1) The term `covered congressional employee' means a       permanent, full-time employee of a Member of Congress--        ``(A) whose responsibilities include assisting the       constituents of the Member with issues regarding departments       or agencies of the Federal Government;        ``(B) who satisfies the criteria required by the Secretary       for recognition as an agent or attorney under this chapter;       and        ``(C) who is designated by the Member of Congress as a       covered congressional employee for purposes of this section.        ``(2) The term `database of the Veterans Benefits       Administration' means any database of the Veterans Benefits       Administration in which the records of veterans relating to       claims for benefits under the laws administered by the       Secretary are retained, including information regarding       medical records, compensation and pension exams records,       rating decisions, statements of the case, supplementary       statements of the case, notices of disagreement, Form-9, and       any successor form.        ``(3) The term `Member of Congress' means a Representative,       a Senator, a Delegate to Congress, or the Resident       Commissioner of Puerto Rico.''.        (b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of sections at the       beginning of such chapter is amended by adding at the end the       following new item:  ``5906. Access of certain congressional employees to veteran                records.''.         (c) No Authorization of Appropriations.--No additional       funds are authorized to be appropriated to carry out this       section or the amendments made by this section. This section       and such amendments may only be carried out using amounts       otherwise authorized to be appropriated, of which, during the       period of fiscal years 2018 through 2021, not more than       $10,000,000 may be obligated or expended for such purpose.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and add extraneous material.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today and urge all Members to support H.R. 512,  as amended, the WINGMAN Act.   First, I want to say a special thanks to the gentleman from Florida  (Mr. Yoho) and the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Rodney Davis), our  colleagues, for introducing the WINGMAN Act. This bill will help  Members cut through the red tape and help constituents who have applied  for benefits from VA.   Isn't that why we are here, to help our constituents?   The problem is that when a constituent calls one of our offices to  ask about the status of a claim for benefits, the only thing we can do  is write VA and wait for the VA to respond. I know I get very  frustrated, and I am sure my colleagues do as well, with how long it  takes for the VA to get back to us. The WINGMAN Act provides a simple  solution. The bill allows designated, permanent, full-time  congressional staffers to look up the status of a claim on VA's  database, but only if the veteran has given the staffer permission.  Staffers would have read-only access to VA databases, meaning they  wouldn't be able to add or remove any information.   Passing H.R. 512, as amended, would allow Members to help  constituents who simply want to understand the status of their claim  for benefits. I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R.  512, as amended.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1645     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Bilirakis) control the balance of my time.
