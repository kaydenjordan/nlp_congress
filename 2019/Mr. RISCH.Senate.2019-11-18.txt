 Mr. President, as a member and former chairman of  the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each month  I recognize and celebrate the American entrepreneurial spirit by  highlighting the success of a small business in my home State of Idaho.  However, in honor of Veterans Day on November 11, this month I will  honor a veteran-owned small business for each of the 10 days the Senate  is in legislative session. The personal sacrifices made by America's  veterans have protected the very freedoms and values that give each of  us and our children the ability to achieve the American dream. The  skills veterans learn as members of the military are invaluable and  undoubtedly contribute to Idaho's flourishing veteran business  community. I am proud of the sacrifices veterans have made to protect  our country and that they are choosing Idaho to call home when they  complete their service in the military.   As your U.S. Senator from the great State of Idaho, it is my pleasure  to recognize Mountain View Dental Clinic in Soda Springs as the  veteran-owned Idaho Small Business of the Day for November 18, 2019.   Mountain View Dental Clinic is owned by U.S. Air Force veteran Dr.  Jerry Walker, DMD. Walker was born and raised in Rexburg before moving  to Pennsylvania to attend dental school. Luckily for Idaho, Walker  returned home to the Gem State to open his practice and serve the Soda  Springs community. With more than 18 years of clinical experience,  Walker and his employees pride themselves on building trust with their  clients.   Walker and his staff provide routine dental care services such as  cleanings and oral cancer screenings, in addition to cosmetic services  tailored to fit the needs of each patient. The team at Mountain View  Dental Clinic works hard to remain at the forefront of dental research  and technology, ensuring that patients enjoy a comfortable experience  at the dentist.   Congratulations to Dr. Jerry Walker and all of the employees at  Mountain View Dental Clinic for being selected as the Veteran-owned  Idaho Small Business of the Day for November 18, 2019. You make our  great State proud, and I look forward to your continued growth and  success.                            ____________________
