 Mr. President, I rise to reintroduce legislation to  establish the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta National Heritage Area,  California's first National Heritage Area.   I am very pleased to work with Senator Harris, Congressman John  Garamendi, and local stakeholders in California on this important  legislation.   This legislation will establish California's first National Heritage  Area in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta to promote environmental  stewardship, heritage conservation, and economic development in  communities across five Delta-area counties.   The Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta is the largest estuary in the  western United States and one of the most productive and ecologically  important watersheds in North America. This extensive inland delta is a  national treasure that must be protected.   The Delta offers recreational opportunities enjoyed by millions of  Californians and out-of-state visitors alike, who come each year for  boating, fishing, hunting, and sightseeing.   It also provides critical habitat for more than 750 wildlife species,  including Sandhill cranes and other migratory birds along the Pacific  Flyway as well as iconic native fish like the Chinook salmon, some as  large as 60 pounds, which return each year to travel through the Delta  to spawn in tributaries upstream.   These same waterways also provide freshwater to millions of  California households and irrigated farmland south of the Delta and  elsewhere in the state.   Before being converted for farmland starting in the 19th century, the  Delta flooded regularly following the springtime snowmelt and once  supported the continent's largest Native Americans communities.   Later, the Delta served as the gateway for the California Gold Rush,  after which Chinese immigrant workers built hundreds of miles of levees  to make the Delta's rich peat soils available for farming and to  control flooding.   Japanese, Chinese, Italian, German, Portuguese, Dutch, Greek, South  Asian, and other immigrants began the area's farming legacy and  established proud communities that continue today.   Over the years, the vibrant ``river culture'' unique to Delta  communities has attracted the attention of celebrated authors from Mark  Twain and Jack London to Joan Didion.   A National Heritage Area designation would help to preserve this  uniquely American story by providing the opportunity for modest federal  funding to help local entities, principally the Delta Protection  Commission, manage the Heritage Area in accordance with California law  and in partnership with Delta communities.   The management planning process required by this legislation will be  collaborative and open to the public. Federal, State, tribal, and local  governments, private property owners, and all stakeholders will have a  voice in the management planning for the Heritage Area.   I'd like to emphasize that this legislation does not affect water  rights or water contracts, nor does it impose any additional  responsibilities on local governments or private landowners.   Instead, this legislation authorizes Federal assistance to support  local projects as part of an inclusive process required by State law.   Today, the Delta faces a crisis due to invasive species, urban and  agricultural run-off, wastewater overloads, channelization, dredging,  water exports, and other stressors.   Many Delta islands are now 10 to 20 feet below sea level due to  subsidence, and the present levee system is inadequate for providing  reliable flood protection for historic communities, agricultural  enterprises, and infrastructure.   Alarmingly, many existing levees were simply not engineered to  withstand earthquakes. Should levees fail, a rush of saltwater into the  interior Delta would damage this already fragile ecosystem, disrupt  drinking water supplies, flood agricultural land, inundate towns, and  damage roads, powerlines, and water infrastructure.   Our legislation recognizes the Delta as a working landscape central  to California life and seeks to further local projects already underway  that promote environmental stewardship, heritage conservation,  community revitalization, and economic development throughout the  Delta.   This legislation also seeks to fulfill the broadly supported 2009  California state law that called for a Heritage Area designation for  the Delta.   Our legislation is a small part of the commitment the Federal  government must make to the California Delta.   I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues at every  level of government to restore the Delta and its native species,  upgrade California's water supply, safeguard against flood risk,  improve water quality, and preserve Delta communities' rich heritage  and continued vibrancy.   Thank you, Mr. President, I yield the floor.                                  ______                                         By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Blumenthal, Mr. Markey, Ms.          Warren, Mr. Casey, Ms. Duckworth, and Mrs. Gillibrand):   S. 320. A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, to require  federally licensed firearms importers, manufacturers, and dealers to  meet certain requirements with respect to securing their firearms  inventory, business records, and business premises; to the Committee on  the Judiciary.
