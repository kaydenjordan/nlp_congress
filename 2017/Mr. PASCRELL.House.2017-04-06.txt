 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Rhode Island.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my strong support for the  National Endowments for the Arts and the Humanities. I want to  associate myself with the comments of the gentleman from Rhode Island  and the gentleman from North Carolina.   As a former teacher, I have seen firsthand how important the arts and  humanities are in educating our kids and bettering society as a whole.   It has been shown that exposure to the arts stimulates students'  learning, their motivation, and their creativity.   Those students involved in the arts score significantly higher in the  SATs than other students. Now, more than ever, the arts often seem to  be one of the first programs cut from a school or a government budget.   In fact, this President has proposed eliminating both the Endowments  entirely--the first time any President has proposed such a measure.  This has been supported by Democrats and Republicans because it is  meaningful to the entire Republic.   The NEA, the National Endowment for the Arts, has already sustained  significant budget reductions. The NEA appropriation is 12 percent  lower than it was in 2010. It declined to $19.5 million.   And while I understand, when everything is a priority, nothing is a  priority, I understand that this priority affects the spirit of the  greatest Nation in the world.                                time  1130    The importance of arts and humanities is not something we should even  forget, even in the face of tough economic times. The arts support 4.7  million full-time United States jobs and, as you have heard, creates  billions in economic activity each year.   In New Jersey, the National Endowment for the Arts last year provided  over $1 million in direct grant funding to 13 arts organizations,  community groups, schools, and artists, as well as enabled the New  Jersey State Council on the Arts to award 171 grant and nongrant  services totalling over $13 million. So there are consequences and a  ripple effect to the few Federal dollars that are provided and  targeted.   In my hometown of Paterson, New Jersey, the Council for the  Humanities has awarded grant funding to the Hamilton Partnership for  Paterson in support of their work for the Great Falls National  Historical Park.   Humanities organizations like these enrich the cultural and  historical benefits of the Great Falls through programming and  community involvement initiatives. That is why it is crucial that we  ensure that they receive the funding and the recognition they deserve.   The budget proposal does damage to Americans across the board. One  area taking a massive hit, if I may use a parallel, is health care.  This budget would cripple the NIH, the National Institutes of Health,  slashing funding by $5.8 billion, equal to 19 percent of the current  $30.8 billion discretionary budget. The budget takes aim at vital  antipoverty programs that directly impact health care because poverty  causes poor health. So our physical health is going to take a toll.   But it is our mental health that could be improved through a strong  arts foundation, helping to relieve stresses and lift American spirits.  Spiritual health of Americans, supported by the NEA and the NEH, is a  key piece of our overall well-being.   As an active member of the Congressional Arts Caucus, I have spent  years opposing those who wanted to slash funding for the National  Endowment for the Arts and Humanities.   I will continue to work with my colleagues--and I pledge to you today  that I will--on these Federal initiatives that possess widespread and  bipartisan support.   Democrats and Republicans have always come together on this issue. It  lifts our spirit as a culture and a nation. You mentioned Yevtushenko  before, a Russian poet who came to New York City in the fifties. I only  know a few words in Russian, but I went anyway because he was going to  read his poetry in Russian. There was no interpreter there.   Yevtushenko had been in the midst of the Russian Revolution. He had  been in the midst of people trying to gain a voice. I just know a few  words; nonetheless, I was moved by his spirit, like watching a painting  or looking at a photograph or going to a movie. I understand without  knowing the words. That is what a poem should be. It should be,  regardless of meaning, in any language. Whether it is music, art,  poetry, sculpture, cinema, photography, dance, it doesn't matter.   This is the heart of America. Our children are drawn to it. And we  even use art and the humanities now to help those people through very  distressing times, which is very interesting and fascinating.   So I thank the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Langevin) for  yielding. I want him to know he has a partner. Once I partner, you know  I am not going to go away.   I also thank those who did stay to speak about this very critical  issue.
