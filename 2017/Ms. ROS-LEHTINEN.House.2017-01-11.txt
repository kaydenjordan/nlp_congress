 Mr. Speaker, I would like to congratulate Meg Daly,  the board of directors, the founders and partners who have rallied  behind the great vision of creating The Underline.   Located in my congressional district, The Underline is a 10-mile  linear park, an urban trail that extends from the Dadeland South  station to the Miami River and that will connect millions of Americans  across Miami-Dade County through safe, alternative methods of  transportation.   Mr. Speaker, this is underutilized land below Miami's Metrorail that  has transformative potential for community mobility, positive economic  impact, and enhanced quality of life.   Thanks to the overwhelming collaboration of our south Florida  community, there are also many new ideas that will be incorporated in  creating this vision, such as dog parks, yoga programs, street art, and  pop-up stores. This Saturday, January 14, this recreational space will  feature local artists, and the public will be able to experience art  that inspires and challenges us to be healthy, mobile, and connected.   Congratulations to Meg and to all involved in The Underline.                            ____________________
