 Madam President, reserving the right to object.    Madam President, I think the record really needs to be set  straight. The picture that is being painted here is that the  Republicans or President Trump or both don't care about the fact that  Russia is and has been trying to interfere in our elections and that,  for some reason, our refusal to allow this specific act to move forward  until it is fixed is evidence of that.   In support of that, he said that there is no penalty on the Russians  because of their actions. I will remind my colleagues that I am the  chairman of the committee that has jurisdiction over economic  sanctions. On this floor, last Congress, we had this very debate. I was  making the case then that we needed a broad, strong sanctions law  against Russia for its election interference and not only for its  election interference but also for its invasion of Crimea and for its  cyber security attacks on the United States.   What happened then? We passed what I believe is probably the  strongest, most extensive legislation putting into effect sanctions on  Russia for election interference, for cyber security violations, for  invasion of Crimea, and other malign conduct. Under that legislation,  the administration has been active.   I want to read you just a little--I think that President Trump has  probably put more sanctions on the Russians than any other President in  our history. The Treasury's Russia sanctions program is among the most  active of the sanctions programs that the United States has. This  administration has sanctioned 335 Russian-related individuals and  entities, 317 of which were sanctioned under Treasury authority.   By the way, the bill I referred to has an acronym. It is the  Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, or CAATSA. That  is the legislation that the administration is using to deter Russian  election interference and other activities in addition to other malign  conduct.   Now, I want to state again, as my colleague knows, I agree and have  agreed that we can work on further legislation, but we need to get it  right because economic sanctions legislation is a two-edged sword. It  hurts the United States and our allies often as much as it hurts the  entities sanctioned, and because of that, we have to have the ability  to be flexible in when to apply, how to apply, and how to adjust the  impact of our sanctions; otherwise, we will see that we will do more  damage to ourselves and our allies than to Russia.   By the way, we don't just need legislation dealing with Russia. We  need legislation dealing with the same types of activities from Iran  and China and North Korea, to name just a few of the others. We need to  do it with the appropriate mechanisms.   The mechanisms in this bill have been designed more to attack the  Trump administration and Republicans than to attack the Russians and  those who would attack our country and our elections. I have said again  and again and again that if we can fix the mechanisms so that they will  work effectively to work against our enemies and protect America and  our allies, as our current sanctions regimes do, then we can move  forward with legislation that will even enhance what we did in CAATSA.   I will also remind my colleague that in addition to CAATSA, one of  the reasons we have been so active in the United States is that we have  passed significant additional legislation. I remind my colleagues and  everyone that in addition to CAATSA and the already existing IEEPA  legislation, which are very broad and powerful international emergency  economic authorities that have previously existed in the United States  to help our administrations push back against malign conduct from our  enemies, we have also passed the Ukraine Freedom Support Act. I  referenced Crimea earlier. We have passed the Magnitsky Act. President  Obama, President Trump, and I believe President Bush, before them, have  issued significant Executive orders on their own with their Executive  order authority to expand sanctioning authority.   To create the picture that there is no deterrent is false. To create  the picture that the Trump administration is trying to turn a blind eye  to Russia's malign conduct is false. To create the picture that the  Republicans, because they want to get a mechanism that works properly,  are therefore willing to turn a blind eye to Russia is false.   When we can finally stop trying to play politics with this issue,  when we can stop trying to make it anti-Trump or anti-Republican or  make politics out of the problems that Russia truly is creating for us,  maybe we can come together and pass yet another strong piece of  legislation to move forward--but not as long as it is done with  mechanisms and with lack of flexibility that actually undermine our own  economic security and our system in applying the sanctions. Because of  that, I object.    Madam President, not to belabor the point, but I just want  to respond briefly. Yes, there are Republicans and Democrats on this  bill, but many of the Members who are on this bill have told me they  are ready and willing to amend and make it work.   I have offered and have tried now for months to get that done. I am  willing to continue trying to improve and strengthen this bill, but the  notion that this is just somehow trying to protect the President from  having to make tough choices is simply false.   I will read today--as has been indicated, we have leaders from Russia  in America today, and in response to that, our Secretary of State  Pompeo said:         The Trump administration will always work to protect the       integrity of our elections, period. . . . Should Russia or       any foreign actor take steps to undermine our Democratic       processes, we will take action in response.    All of the authorities in this legislation we are debating right now  exists already under CAATSA. I guess the argument is that President  Trump will not use them. Well, the reality is he will. Secondly, I have  indicated my willingness to work on this legislation.   Rather than continuing to stand on the floor and debate why we like  or don't like what President Trump is doing, I think we ought to get  down to the serious business of legislating.   I yield the floor.
