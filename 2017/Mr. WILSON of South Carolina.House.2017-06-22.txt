 Mr. Speaker, Otto Warmbier was a  shining example of what American families hope for sons and daughters:  intellectually curious, interested in the world, and bright. Sadly,  Otto was murdered by the North Korean dictatorship. By imprisoning him  under sham charges, the Communist totalitarian North Korean regime is  clearly responsible for his death.   Otto's story highlights the brutality of the North Korean murderers,  one that wrongfully imprisons American citizens and uses them as  bargaining chips in an effort to gain attention on the world stage. It  is past time we strongly restrict tourist travel to this Potemkin  atrocity.   I am grateful to have introduced bipartisan legislation, with  Congressman Adam Schiff, that would enable the Treasury Department to  regulate travel to North Korea through licenses, and no licenses would  be able to be granted for tourist travel. Foreign Affairs Committee  Chairman Ed Royce has been instrumental for legislative success.   We will be most successful defeating brutality by denying the  dictatorship any source of income and depriving it of the opportunity  to use innocent Americans like UVA student Otto Warmbier as hostages.  [[Page H5057]]    In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Glenn  Thompson for yielding. I appreciate his effective leadership on  strengthening America's workforce to create jobs.   I am grateful to speak today on the importance of career and  technical education, a critical tool in closing the skills gap and  creating jobs.   South Carolina has been successful in promoting career and technical  education programs, recruiting Michelin, BMW, Boeing, Bridgestone, MTU,  and now Volvo. I hope all communities across America can experience the  success we have achieved creating jobs, leading to the lowest  unemployment rate in 16 years.   The Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century  Act will reduce regulations and allow State and local leaders to create  CTE programs that are best for their communities by providing greater  flexibility of Federal resources, allowing States to respond to their  unique educational and economic needs to create jobs for fulfilling  lives.   I appreciate the opportunity to encourage my colleagues to pass this  bipartisan legislation. These efforts, amplified by President Donald  Trump's executive order last week expanding apprenticeship programs,  will be an important step forward in our educational system--closing  the skills gap and training Americans for meaningful, skilled jobs.
