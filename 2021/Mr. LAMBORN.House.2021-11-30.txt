 Madam Speaker, in 1941, President Franklin Delano  Roosevelt declared the week of Thanksgiving to be National Bible Week.  While facing a world entering a great war and a nation exiting a Great  Depression, FDR led us to recognize that the Bible is a foundational  building block of Western Civilization--the Judeo-Christian heritage.   The ideas and principles that shaped the thinking of America's  foundation and Founding Fathers were found in the Bible. Today, 80  years later, we celebrate a book that is no less relevant and  foundational than it was in 1941, or 1776, or 2,000 years ago.   Amidst worldwide pandemics that have shaken the foundations of  education, economy, healthcare, and every other source of personal and  national security instability, we find that the Bible stands as the  only foundation that can never be shaken.   At the end of the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus said:         Therefore whoever hears these sayings of mine and does       them, I will liken him to a wise man who built his house on       the rock: and the rain descended, the floods came, and the       winds came and beat on that house and it did not fall for it       was founded on the rock.    It is a great honor for me to come to the House floor tonight to  commemorate National Bible Week. I am so thankful and blessed to live  in a country where we have the freedom to worship and read the holy  Scriptures without fear. Many people across the globe live in countries  where such freedoms do not exist. Our very Declaration of Independence  confesses God's truth that is self-evident:   [[Page H6701]]              We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are       created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with       certain unalienable rights, that among these are life,       liberty and the pursuit of happiness.    As a personal testimony for myself, the Bible has had a profound  impact on my life and my family as it has on millions of Americans and  people all over the world.                                time  1945    God's Word is so valuable to me because it has shaped my thinking and  deeply influenced my relationship with God. The Bible has, indeed, been  a source of guidance, wisdom, joy, and light in every area of my life.  I agree with what King David said: ``O, how I love Your law. It is my  meditation all the day.''   In this hour, we will hear Members of Congress from various faith  traditions and denominations and from all over the United States speak  about what the Bible means to them and their constituents. We are here,  in keeping with tradition, to recognize National Bible Week.   I would first like to yield to the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs.  Hartzler), my good friend and inspiration to so many of us.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Missouri for  her comments.   I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Babin), my friend and  colleague.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments.   Here we are in the Halls of Congress, and many things have happened  here over the years. When you look back on what our country was like at  the founding of our country, some things have changed. Many of the  early American settlers came to the New World with the expressed  purpose of living out their life with faith in God and His Word,  according to their own consciences. One of Congress' first acts in the  infancy of our Nation was the authorization of an American-published  Bible.   The Revolutionary War with the British had cut off a lot of shipments  of Bibles from England, and there was a shortage. So in 1782, Congress  passed this resolution: ``Resolved, that the United States in Congress  assembled highly approve the pious and laudable undertaking of Mr.  Aitken, as subservient to the interest of religion, as well as an  instance of the progress of arts in this country, and being satisfied  from the above report of his care and accuracy in the execution of the  work, they recommend this edition of the Bible to the inhabitants of  the United States, and hereby authorize him to publish this  recommendation in the manner he shall think proper.''  [[Page H6702]]    Boy, can you imagine doing that today, the House of Representatives  approving the printing of the Bible? Our country has changed over the  years and not always necessarily for the better.   Madam Speaker, I now yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  Carter).    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments.   I now yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Johnson).    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman, and I yield to the  gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Good).    Madam Speaker, if you go to the discoveries that  archeology has made over the years, they have always validated Biblical  accounts.   Time and time again, Biblical personalities, locations, and events  actually existed in time and space as proven by archeology.   Claims by some critics that a Biblical statement was simply made up  have always been debunked by later discoveries, many more times than we  could cite here tonight.   For instance, the Dead Sea Scrolls proved the credibility and  authority of Scriptures. Jewish archeologist Nelson Glueck has said:  ``It may be stated categorically that no archaeological discovery has  ever controverted,'' or contradicted, ``a Biblical reference.''   Madam Speaker, I now yield to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr.  Grothman).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Illinois  (Mrs. Miller), my friend and colleague.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Tennessee  (Mrs. Harshbarger), another one of our great freshmen Members.    Madam Speaker, I would like to tell you my story real  briefly.   When I was a freshman in college years ago, I was asked if I knew  what the Bible was about. I said, yeah, I know what it is about. But I  had never read it for myself, which was actually pretty presumptuous.   Madam Speaker, I wonder if this might be true for anyone else who is  listening here today?   The only honest thing I could do when I was confronted with that  question was to actually read the Bible for myself. I started with the  Gospel of John.   When I read it, I discovered that I didn't know what was in it at  all. I had all of these preconceived ideas, but yet I discovered things  like Jesus said: ``I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes  to the Father except through Me.'' So I ended up discovering a personal  relationship with Jesus Christ who became my Lord and Savior.   Madam Speaker, I speak from personal experience when I say that it is  better to read the Bible for one's self and not just take someone  else's word for what it says. My life has been transformed by the truth  that it contains. The message of the good news of Jesus is still  transforming many lives today.   ``For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that  whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life,''  John 3:16.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr.  Norman).  [[Page H6704]]         Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from the great  State of Georgia (Mr. Hice).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from the great  State of Georgia (Mr. Allen).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from the great  State of Mississippi (Mr. Guest).    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for those words.   I yield to the gentleman from the great State of Pennsylvania (Mr.  Kelly), my friend and colleague.    Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Kelly for his heartfelt  words.   I now yield to the gentleman from the great State of Tennessee (Mr.  Rose).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from the great  State of North Carolina (Mr. Budd), my good friend and colleague.                                time  2030     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his kind words  and for his heartfelt remarks.   I yield to the gentleman from the great State of Georgia (Mr. Clyde).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Cloud), my friend and colleague.    Madam Speaker, I remember the time Mr. Gohmert and I  went to Israel together. That was a very special and, you can say,  life-changing experience.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from the great State of Texas  (Mr. Gohmert).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Joyce).    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
