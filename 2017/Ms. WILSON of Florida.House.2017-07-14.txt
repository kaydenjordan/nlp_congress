 Mr. Chairman, today, I join with my colleague  and friend, Representative Duncan Hunter, in offering an amendment to  the maritime administration title in the NDAA.   The cruise industry, which is a vital source of economic opportunity  for my constituents, has come to me with concerns about lawsuits it  says are clogging U.S. courts and making it more difficult to conduct  business and create opportunities in my district and elsewhere.   I take these concerns seriously and want to help address them, but I  also want to make sure that they are protecting workers and that we  don't shut off opportunities for them to be fairly compensated if they  become ill or injured in the course of their employment.   The Hunter-Wilson amendment is intended to do just that. It  safeguards U.S. courts against further crowding of court dockets, while  not denying foreign crewmembers remedies.   This provision has been passed in the House five times in the past 3  years, and most recently, the Senate Commerce Committee included it in  the maritime administration title of the Defense Authorization bill for  FY 2017.   I want to thank Chairman Hunter and Chairman Shuster for their work  on this amendment.   I urge my colleagues to support the Hunter-Wilson amendment.
