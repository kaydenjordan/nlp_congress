 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in objection to the Pregnant  Workers Fairness Act.   This bill was so close to being a bipartisan bill. In fact, I was  ready to vote ``yes'' on it because, as the majority of people, I do  not believe in discrimination. But at the very last minute, the  majority had to throw in a provision to actually allow discrimination  in a bill that is supposed to be about nondiscrimination--the very last  minute.   Ranking Member Foxx offered an amendment to protect and not to  discriminate against religious organizations.   Guess what the majority did?   They voted it down.   Remember, this is supposed to be a bill about not discriminating, yet  we vote this down.   Although the bill sounds good, and as a woman--and I will say I am a  woman--as a mother--and I am proud to be a mother--I was also pregnant  and a worker. So I believe in fairness. I believe in nondiscrimination.  I believe in protecting the rights of those individuals.   But let's stop playing games in Congress. Let's actually start  protecting the people who need protection, and let's get to work.
