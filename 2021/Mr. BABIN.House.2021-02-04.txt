 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the services of Ms.  Deborah ``Debbie'' Moseley, the executive director of The Bridge Over  Troubled Waters in Pasadena, Texas. Commonly referred to as ``The  Bridge,'' this organization has assisted men, women, and children  affected by domestic and sexual violence or homelessness in  southeastern Harris County, Texas.   For 34 years, Debbie has served the organization as an advocate in  the field of domestic and sexual violence. Debbie began working as a  volunteer at The Bridge in 1986, alongside her mother and grandmother.  A year later, she started working with The Bridge's children's programs  on Tuesday and Thursday evenings. In 1988, Debbie began to work full  time at The Bridge as a resident advocate.   Over the years, she has held many leadership positions in each of the  different programs that The Bridge offers, including shelter  coordinator, resale shop coordinator, nonresident director, and  advocacy director. In 2003, Debbie was named the executive director and  has served in that role ever since.   Under Debbie's leadership, The Bridge connected with community  leaders and the community at large; built a new location; and started  Destiny Village, a long-term housing program for survivors of violence  with disabilities and children. In addition, she has significantly  increased The Bridge's share of funding granted by the Victims of Crime  Act to provide critical support services to victims of domestic  violence.   Debbie is a licensed social worker and has dedicated her life to  community and volunteer service. She serves on the boards of numerous  community organizations, such as the Harris County Coordinating  Council, the Texas Council on Family Violence, the Harris County Adult  Fatality Review Team, the Pasadena Chamber of Commerce, the Pasadena  Police Academy, and the Bridges to Life prison ministry. She is also  active in the New Hope Church of Pearland, the Pasadena Kiwanis, the  Bay Area Kiwanis, the Pasadena Rotary, the Salvation Army, and the  Texas Invitational.   For her community and civic involvement, Debbie has received numerous  recognitions, including the Governor's Victim Services Division  Pathfinder Award in 2007; Debbie Moseley Day in Pasadena, Texas; the  Rotary Club's Paul Harris Fellow Award in 2010; Rotary Director of the  Year in 2016; and the Stella Trimble Community Service Award in 2017.   In 1985, Debbie married the love of her life, Tom Moseley. Debbie is  the mother of four children: John Miles of Burleson, Texas; Aaron  Miles, also of Burleson; Derek Miles of League City; and Staff Sergeant  Josh Moseley, who is stationed as a United States Marine Corps  recruiter in Arlington, Texas. Debbie and Tom are the proud  grandparents of eight grandchildren.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Debbie Moseley for her lifetime of  dedicated service to the survivors of domestic and sexual violence, and  I wish her the very absolute best during her well-deserved retirement.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, at the direction of the narrow Democrat  majority, we are here today standing in judgment over a newly elected  colleague of ours for things said as a private citizen that have since  been retracted.   Meanwhile, some colleagues have engaged in anti-American, anti- Semitic tropes and commentary before and after their elections to  Congress. Other colleagues have incited and called for violence across  the country the day Donald Trump became President, and still encourage  violence against him and those who support the Republican Party, not to  mention other dangerous words that have been harmful to the security of  our Nation.   But, Mr. Speaker, none of those are in question. Those Members never  saw any condemnation and, in this Democrat majority, they never will.   I went to the Rules Committee yesterday, strongly opposing to this  course of action, with a suggestion to correct this blatant double  standard, should it move forward. I was told by the chairman that, ``We  don't share the same values,'' because I was demanding that we  prioritize accountability for members of his party and their comments  and dangerous rhetoric carried out while in office before we address  Representative Greene's commentary made before she was elected.   Perhaps the chairman is right. My values are that anyone who  blatantly calls for violence against Conservatives; praises deadly  antifa riots; endangers Americans; encourages the destruction of our  ally Israel; and, perhaps worst of all, dismisses the significance of  9/11 has no business serving in the House of Representatives.   In closing, Mr. Speaker, no one in Congress should be more grateful  than the Democrat majority that eliminated our motion to recommit last  month and the Democrat members who have made these inflammatory remarks  over the years, because I have no doubt that a motion by Republicans to  oust those Representatives would have succeeded with very strong  bipartisan support. By shattering this precedent today, perhaps this  majority has set in motion a future majority's obligation to do so.   If my Democrat colleagues are attempting to take the speck out of our  eye, I encourage them to also take the log out of their own eyes.    Madam Speaker, I thank my good friend from Washington  State--and a classmate--for having this. It is good to be here.   Madam Speaker, I stand here today as a proud representative of  Houston, Texas, the epicenter of American energy and the catalyst for  this country's pursuit of energy independence. But, unfortunately, our  economic bedrock of oil and gas is under attack, severe attack, by an  administration that is eliminating millions of jobs and leaving our  national security wide open to threats from adversaries.   An oil and gas moratorium on Federal lands is projected to cost  America 1 million jobs. Revoking the Keystone XL pipeline permit will  cost us 11,000 jobs in 2021 alone and account for the loss of $1.6  billion in gross wages.   Rejoining the Paris climate accord, which was originally poorly  negotiated by President Obama, is projected to cost us 400,000 jobs and  is simply a bad deal for the American people and very good deal for the  world's biggest polluter, Communist China. What happened to this new  administration's promise to stand up for all Americans?   From gas and electric bills, to new highways and bridges, to taxes,  to putting food on the table, what happens to the oil and gas industry  affects all Americans, and killing these jobs will have a ripple effect  that will be felt in every home in the Nation.   Additionally, if we destroy oil and natural gas production here by  canceling these pipelines and forcing adherence to widely burdensome  red tape, we will then have to import oil and natural gas from overseas  and burn  [[Page H367]]  much fuel to get it here. And that means that we will be paying more  for energy that was processed not using the same, stringent clean  environmental regulations that we have here in America.   No, if we want to stand here and talk about cleaner energy solutions,  we have to acknowledge the fact that pipelines are by far the safest  and most environmentally friendly way to transport energy. In fact,  pipelines have a 99.9 percent safety record. When we kill energy jobs  here in the United States, we are in turn killing clean energy jobs  globally.
