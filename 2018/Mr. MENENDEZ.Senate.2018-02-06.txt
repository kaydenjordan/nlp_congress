 Mr. President, first of all, let me congratulate my  colleague from Florida on the most recent historic launch. There is no  one who has been a greater advocate for America's space program than  Senator Nelson. I appreciate his leadership as well on this issue,  which goes all the way from Florida, across the entire Atlantic and, of  course, the Pacific as well.   I rise in strong opposition to the Trump administration's offshore  drilling plan. I am here to speak on behalf of New Jersey's shore  businesses--the restaurants, the bait-and-tackle shops, and the bed- and-breakfasts that depend on clean beaches to succeed. Their  businesses are the lifeblood of the Jersey Shore. Their voices deserve  to be heard. Their livelihoods are on the line. Yet this administration  remains solely focused on what is good for Big Oil's bottom line, never  mind the consequences for our economy, the health of the planet, or our  vibrant coastal communities.   The Interior Department's offshore drilling plan reads like a wish  list for oil industry executives. Clearly, the Trump administration  didn't consult my constituents when drafting this plan. By the way, we  had already gone through a 5-year plan, so there were supposed to be 5  years before we revisited this, and now we are back at it again. They  didn't consult the shop owners in Asbury Park or the fishermen in  Belford or the innkeepers in Cape May, because if they had, they would  have learned that our shoreline is an economic powerhouse for our  State.   Each year, New Jersey's tourism industry generates $44 billion in  economic activity, directly and indirectly supporting nearly 10 percent  of the State's workforce. Likewise, our seafood industry supports over  31,000 jobs, and we are home to one of America's largest saltwater  recreational fisheries, supporting over 16,000 jobs. Together, the  homes and businesses along the Jersey Shore encompass almost $800  billion in property values.   All of this adds up to a simple reality: Clean coasts are vital to  the economic security of millions of New Jerseyans. The same holds true  for towns up and down the Atlantic shoreline. Yet the Trump  administration plans to ignore the concern of the communities that have  the most to lose. They ignore the more than 120 municipalities, the  1,200 elected officials, the 41,000 businesses, and the 500,000 fishing  families from up and down the east  [[Page S635]]  coast who voiced their opposition the last time oil and gas drilling  was being considered. They ignore concerns from the Pentagon and NASA  about disruptions to their operations from drilling in the Atlantic.  They ignore the opposition of my west coast colleagues to drilling in  the Pacific. They ignore the Department of the Interior's own finding  that the Arctic drilling comes with a 75-percent chance of an oilspill  in a treacherous and challenging environment. Simply put, the Trump  drilling plan ignores everyone except Big Oil.   What is happening here is a dream scenario for the oil industry, but  it is a nightmare for our shore communities. It is a gift to corporate  polluters at the expense of our coastal economies.   By the way, I love these commercials that I see that talk about  American energy independence. As you have heard my colleague Senator  Wyden say before, we are now an exporter of oil. Well, how is it that  you are exporting oil? You are drilling it here in the continental  waters of the United States, but you are exporting it abroad for others  to use. It seems to me that if you are drilling on Federal lands and  waters, you should keep it here for domestic energy consumption to keep  the price down and to keep energy security. That is real energy  security, not having Big Oil drill here and then export it all over the  world so that they can make a profit. I don't know how that makes us  more energy secure here at home.   Make no mistake--this administration's massive expansion of offshore  drilling is just the beginning. They are also working to dismantle  minimal safety standards for offshore drilling. That is right. The  Trump administration not only wants more offshore drilling, it also  wants to permit more dangerous offshore drilling.   The Interior Department reportedly seeks to weaken the well control  rule--the critical safety standards put in place after the Deepwater  Horizon tragedy, which taught us something: If you drill, you will  spill. If you drill, you will spill. At some point, that will happen.  During Superstorm Sandy, which took place along the east coast of the  Atlantic, imagine if we had oil rigs off the shore of New Jersey. We  would have had spills. We would have had spills. So instead of saving  lives and saving our environment and the economic consequences that  flow from that, the Trump administration's actions aim to save the  industry $90 million.   During his Senate confirmation, Secretary Zinke promised to ``work  with rather than against local communities in the states.'' Well, it  sure feels as though he is working against New Jersey. The Secretary  has shown no concern for the Jersey Shore communities that would be  devastated by an oilspill--the shuttered businesses, the destroyed  industries, the massive job losses, and the birthright of every New  Jerseyan to go to the Jersey Shore and enjoy its pristine beaches. That  is why it is all the more baffling that Secretary Zinke recently said  that after hearing from concerned Florida businesses and public  officials, he would consider exempting the State from the disastrous  Trump drilling plan. When asked about the decision, the Secretary said  that ``local voices count.''   Well, I am happy if that is what is going to happen for Florida, but  guess what--if it is good enough for Mar-a-Lago, it certainly should be  good enough for the Jersey Shore. That is why every Member of the New  Jersey congressional delegation, Republicans and Democrats alike,  recently joined me on a letter inviting Secretary Zinke to visit the  Jersey Shore. We would be happy to have him meet with community  leaders, business owners, and families who depend on clean coasts. If  he wants to focus on the economics of oil drilling, I suggest he start  with the thousands of people who would be out of a job if oil starts  washing up on our beaches.   The Secretary needs to hear from constituents of mine like Charles  from Tom's River, who recently wrote to say:         We already have some shoreline concerns, thanks to Super       Storm Sandy. We definitely don't need another threat to our       economy.    Jeanne from New Brunswick wrote:         Tourism is a major New Jersey business. Our beaches are       pristine and must be protected.    He needs to hear from any of the thousands of New Jerseyans who have  signed my COAST Anti-Drilling Act citizen petition to permanently ban  drilling in the whole Atlantic Ocean.   The Jersey Shore is a national treasure, home to generations of  family vacations, successful small businesses, and vibrant coastal  communities that are visited by people from across the Atlantic coast,  Canadians who come down and spend their money at our shore, and so many  others. That may not mean anything to ExxonMobil or BP. It may not mean  anything to President Trump or Secretary Zinke. But it means something  to me. That is why we are here today to give voice to New Jerseyans who  have gone unheard. We will not stand silent while this administration  tries to auction the Jersey Shore off to the highest bidder--not  without a fight.   I yield the floor.
