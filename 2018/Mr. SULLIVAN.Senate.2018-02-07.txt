 Mr. President, I join my colleague from Alaska today in  honoring Bill Van Ness. Chairman Murkowski has identified some of the  significant contributions that Bill made to Alaska and Alaskans. I  would like to focus specifically on one of those contributions, the  Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act or ANCSA, and the role that law has  played in improving the lives of Alaska's Native people. Through ANCSA,  the State of Alaska, the Federal Government, and the Alaska Native  community reached a settlement regarding aboriginal claims to lands and  resources throughout the State. Alaska Natives set aside those claims  in exchange for nearly $1 billion and the right to select approximately  45 million acres of land.   Bill's creativity is evident in the manner in which ANCSA addressed  the fundamental question of how to ensure that the thousands of  individual Alaska Natives received their fair share of the settlement  funds and lands. To answer that question, ANCSA authorized the creation  of corporations, in which Alaska Natives are the sole shareholders, to  receive the funds and hold title to the selected lands. For the most  part, this corporate structure has proved to be very beneficial to the  Alaska Native shareholders and to the State of Alaska.   In this regard, I point to the Arctic Slope Regional Corporation,  ASRC, which is owned by Alaska Native people who have inhabited the  North Slope of Alaska for thousands of years. With strong leadership  from its shareholders, officers, and board members, ASRC has grown into  a multibillion dollar enterprise that is Alaska's largest domestic  company and that provides dividends to its nearly 13,000 Alaska Native  shareholder, as well as many jobs to shareholders and other Alaskans.  Bill Van Ness's contributions as an author of ANCSA and later as a  private attorney representing ASRC were keys to ASRC's success story.                            ____________________
