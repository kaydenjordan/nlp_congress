 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, our friends in the House, led by Speaker  Pelosi, have adopted a new strategy for handling allegations of  wrongdoing. It is a dangerous approach, one in which opinions count for  more than the facts and politics trumps everything else, including the  law.   Yesterday evening, Speaker Pelosi announced that the House is now  moving full steam toward impeaching President Trump. When the  announcement was made, the only information they had in their hands was  press reports--no report of the transcript, no facts, no evidence, no  nothing--and that is really all they needed. Any hook, any angle, any  straw they might be able to grasp in order to justify this  unjustifiable action was good enough for them--hearsay and press  reports.   House Democrats began this process of impeaching the President based  on a so-called whistleblower complaint they hadn't even read, which  detailed a call they hadn't seen a transcript of. Meanwhile, we know  the media eagerly reported that the ``whistleblower'' didn't even have  firsthand knowledge of the situation--something we now know to be true.  In other words, the alleged whistleblower doesn't legally qualify as a  whistleblower because he or she wasn't there when the conversation took  place but, rather, reported something that somebody told somebody  else--otherwise known as hearsay. Forget obtaining the evidence, giving  people an opportunity to be heard, and the facts considered. Rather  than looking into that, they decided on a result they wanted to achieve  and were looking at trying to backfill a justification or something  that is unjustified based on the facts we know now.   Of course, we know what this is. This is a continuation of the  election in 2016 where our Democratic friends can't believe that  Hillary Clinton lost the election to Donald Trump. We know that after  that, they claimed: Well, Hillary Clinton actually won the popular  vote.   Forget the Constitution and the role of the electoral college.  Because of the constitutional requirement that the electoral college  vote and whoever wins the majority becomes President--they said: Forget  the Constitution.   Then there was the former FBI Director, Comey, who leaked memos to a  buddy of his and then asked him to leak them to the press because he  wanted to make sure that a special counsel was appointed to investigate  and potentially prosecute President Trump. We know this investigation  went on for years and cost millions of dollars and ended up with the  conclusion of no obstruction and no collusion. You can imagine the  disappointment of our friends in the media who had written about this  assuming that President Trump would be indicted, maybe convicted of  some offense, only to find out there was no collusion, no obstruction,  and no charges.   So now we know that the Speaker and her colleagues in the House have  grabbed hold of this straw without knowing the facts and without even  waiting for the evidence to be revealed. The Speaker's decision to  impeach the President says everything you need to know about their  intentions. It doesn't matter what was said or what was not said; it is  about relitigating the 2016 election--something our Democratic  colleagues have never ever been able to accept. They are trying to defy  the voters who voted for President Trump in 2016.   Does a whistleblower complaint deserve to be examined and taken  seriously? Absolutely. In fact, the Senate Intelligence Committee, on  which I and the Presiding Officer sit, will do just that. We are in the  process of doing that. Before the Speaker's announcement yesterday, the  President had agreed to release the full, unredacted transcript of the  call, and this morning, he did. Tomorrow, the Senate Intelligence  Committee will hear from Acting Director of National Intelligence  Joseph Maguire, as well as the Inspector General for the Intelligence  Community, Michael Atkinson, to learn more about their role in this  process. That is exactly how this matter should be handled--with care,  by the rules, I would say by the book, and make sure that everybody's  rights are protected before people begin to cast unjustified and  slanderous allegations.    Our friends in the House, the House Democrats, aren't just fanning  flames here; they have been pouring gasoline out for months through  their baseless oversight hearings and all-out obsession with the  Mueller investigation, which ended up with a big belly flop.   Yesterday, Speaker Pelosi lit the match, and there is no turning back  now. The American people have made abundantly clear that this sort of  partisan exercise is not what they want, especially when it comes at  the expense of other important work that we are not going to be able to  accomplish because of this obsession with eliminating President Trump.  In a poll this summer, only 34 percent of Texans supported impeachment.   While so much remains in the air, this move has made one thing clear:  Our House colleagues have zero interest in doing the jobs they were  elected to do in 2018, and given the fact that the voters gave them the  majority, they show zero interest in governing and in passing  legislation. Instead of working with both sides of the aisle to pass  bipartisan legislation to lower drug costs, to try to address the  concern about mass shootings, to ratify the trade agreement known as  the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, and otherwise try to make life better  for the American people--that is not the route they have chosen. They  have chosen a partisan, political path, which will absolutely suck all  the oxygen out of Washington. It will be an obsession of the media and  the American people until it is concluded, crowding out anything and  everything else that we might do that might improve the lives of  regular Americans.   The Democrats' decision to move forward with impeachment and toward  removing the President from office will make solving these big  challenges facing our country nearly impossible. House Democrats aren't  doing what is right and what is best for our country; they are driving  an even bigger wedge between the American people to serve their  partisan political interests and using the Constitution to hedge a  political fight.   Now, make no mistake about it--when Special Counsel Mueller was doing  his investigation, it was an investigation to see whether crimes had  been committed and if they had been, to present that evidence to a  grand jury and indict those who were more likely than not to have  committed those offenses and then to try the case to a conclusion in a  court. That is not what impeachment is. Impeachment is solely a  political exercise, and it is a political exercise to defeat President  Trump even though the American people voted for him as the President of  the United States.   Notwithstanding the gasoline that House Democrats have been pouring  on this issue and the fact that Speaker Pelosi decided to light the  match and to ignite it yesterday, one thing is sure, and that is that  cooler heads will prevail here in the Senate. We know bipartisan  oversight is already under way. House Democrats' obsession with the  2016 election has gone too far, and in fact, they should be embarrassed  by what they have done. Meanwhile, we will carefully examine the  record, root out the evidence, and follow that evidence wherever it may  lead. It is important to have a fair trial before you decide to hand  out punishment, not hand out the punishment and then somehow look for  justification for an already reached conclusion.                           Debbie Smith Act of 2019    Mr. President, on another matter, it has been 4 months since we  passed the Debbie Smith Act of 2019. This legislation sailed through  the Senate without any Senator voting against it. And why would they?  It is as bipartisan--you might even say nonpartisan--as they come.   The Debbie Smith Act, as Members know, sends vital funding to State  and local crime labs to test DNA evidence. It authorizes training for  law enforcement and forensic nurses and enables law enforcement to  identify violent criminals and get them off the streets.   The benefit of the Debbie Smith Act is wide-ranging, but it continues  to deliver on the initial goal of reducing the national rape kit  backlog. That is right--at one point, there were as many as 400,000  untested rape kits sitting in labs or on evidence shelves in police  lockers, and each one of those forensic rape kits held the keys to  identifying a person who had committed a sexual assault or some other  crime.  [[Page S5679]]    In Texas alone, the Debbie Smith Act has helped us reduce the backlog  of untested rape kits by approximately 90 percent. Since 2001, we have  gone from roughly around 20,000 untested rape kits to 2,000. That is  still too many; we need to test all of them. We have made serious  progress, and I won't be satisfied until that untested rape kit number  gets to zero, but to do that, Congress needs to reauthorize the Debbie  Smith Act.   It should be obvious, but I will say it anyway. This program  transcends politics or party. Allowing it to expire is a disservice to  the victims and the advocates who have championed this legislation  since it was first enacted 15 years ago.   I introduced the Debbie Smith Act of 2019 in the Senate with my  friend and colleague from California, a Democrat, Senator Dianne  Feinstein, which just demonstrates bipartisan support from Republicans,  Democrats, victims' rights groups, law enforcement, you name it. But  despite all that, Speaker Pelosi has refused to bring this legislation  to the House floor for a vote, and unless they pass it soon, this  critical program will expire for the first time in a week.   There was absolutely no problem reauthorizing this critical program  in 2008 or 2014, but clearly times have changed. Our House Democratic  colleagues aren't above politicizing something as noncontroversial as  reducing the rape kit backlog.   If House Democrats allow this to expire, funds could soon be taken  away from crucial activities like prosecuting cold cases, reducing the  backlog, or capacity enhancing efforts. It is simply inexcusable and  shameful that Speaker Pelosi and the House would allow the Debbie Smith  Act to expire when they have had a bipartisan bill in their hands for 4  months.   Well, just when you think you have seen it all around here--we have  seen a lot of partisan antics in the House this year, but this one  really takes the cake.   I urge our colleagues in the House to quit the games and pass this  critical legislation to support victims of sexual assault without  further delay.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
