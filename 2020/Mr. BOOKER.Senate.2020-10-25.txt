 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Thank you, Madam President, my colleague from Iowa. I am  grateful.   Madam President, I rise today to speak on the nomination of Amy Coney  Barrett. I rise in the midst of a pandemic, in the midst of an election  process in which over 50 million Americans  [[Page S6575]]  have already voted, to speak with a simple call that we should wait. We  should not be doing this as a body.   Now, that is not a radical statement. It is a statement that has been  said by pretty much every Member of the Democratic side, but it is also  a statement that was made by many people in the Republican Party before  we got to this juncture.   It was said around the time that Merrick Garland was up for  nomination by President Barack Obama 269 days before an election, and  people said that we were in an election season; that we should wait.   But this is not a typical election season. This is an election that  is going on where the people are coming out to speak on an array of  issues. There is a profound urgency in the air--not a partisan urgency.  America has seen record turnout because they know what is at stake in  this election.   There are issues that are driving people to the polls, and in this  context, our President is doing what has never been done before. The  only time this had a chance to be done before was when Abraham Lincoln  had a vacancy on the Supreme Court in the midst of an election--this  close to an election. Abraham Lincoln--one of our greatest Presidents  of all time--made a powerful choice. He had the power to move, and he  had the power to nominate, but he showed a restraint on power. He  showed, in a sense, what we would call an act of grace. He knew that in  the midst of an election, when people were coming out to speak, that it  was better to wait.   This grace is also what was called for by Ruth Bader Ginsburg on her  deathbed. She didn't know who would win this election, but she thought  it was best to call to the better angels of our nature; that sometimes  the greatest demonstration of power is when we do not use it; that this  precious democracy, this great experiment that has endured for this  period of time, has sustained itself on acts of decency and grace and  most importantly on trust--trusting people, trusting Americans, and  trusting voters.   We haven't always gotten it right, but this fundamental ideal that  when people are exercising their voice, the people in this body should  listen. Over 50 million Americans. We are days--in fact, hours--away  from the actual election day, but the process has started already.  People are speaking, but we are refusing to listen.   I fear that what is driving many people to the polls are some of the  very issues that this Supreme Court Justice will be in a position to  hear. We know that Donald Trump spent the last 4 years trying to  overturn the Affordable Care Act. He made a promise to only appoint  Justices who would overturn it. He promised that he would nominate a  judge who would ``do the right thing unlike Bush's appointee John  Roberts on ObamaCare.'' This is clear.   We know that the majority leader, Mitch McConnell, controlling this  floor, has spent years trying to overturn the Affordable Care Act. In  fact, between the House and the Senate, there have been over 70 votes  to overturn the Affordable Care Act.   We know there is a case that will come before the Supreme Court on  November 10 that could very well determine whether over 600,000 people  in my State and 20 million people across the country can keep their  health coverage.   So this is not a secret. The American people know what is going on.  They see what is happening here. Many of them, I believe, are going to  the polls to speak about the issue of healthcare, and instead of  waiting and trusting to hear and listen to the will of the people, we  are here right now.   Folk are scared. We are, in a sense, walking through the valley of  the shadow of death--the fourth largest mass casualty event in the  history of our country, and the death rate is rising every single day.  That is why so many Americans have been speaking out and calling out,  because they know what this nomination could very well mean for their  lives and for the lives of their family members. They know what a world  without the ACA would be like.   For a President to nominate someone--a President hostile to the ACA-- a Supreme Court Justice who has spoken to this, they know what this  might mean. We know that for 3.8 million New Jerseyans and 130 million  Americans who have preexisting conditions--people with diabetes; cancer  survivors; people with diseases like my dad had, Parkinson's--it could  mean being charged more or being denied coverage completely. This is a  terrifying reality.   Folk who are going to the polls, waiting hours in a line, know what  it could mean--that once again more people are going to be bankrupted  by outrageous medical bills.   They know what it could mean for lifetime caps on care for children  with complex medical conditions.   They know what it could mean for a family with a child who survived a  medical procedure and another medical procedure and another medical  procedure, surgery after surgery, being told: If you want your child to  live, pay for it yourself.   So many Americans know what it would mean for seniors not being able  to afford lifesaving prescriptions, making the dangerous decision to  cut pills in half or ration their insulin.   So many Americans know that losing the ACA could mean real tragedy.   In New Jersey, over 600,000 people are losing their healthcare in the  middle of a pandemic that in my State has already killed 16,000 of our  first responders, our neighbors, and in many cases our friends and our  family members. These are numbers, these are data, and these are  statistics, but each one is a human life. Each one has dignity, and  each one has family.   I know, for example, Michelle Lewris from Palisades Park, NJ. When  Michelle lost her husband John suddenly last year, she also lost the  health coverage she had through his job. But she was able to get  coverage through the Affordable Care Act's marketplace and qualify for  a subsidy that made it more affordable for her. Today, she is insured,  and she can manage her diabetes and her heart disease and her  autoimmune disease because of her coverage. She said that if she lost  her affordable healthcare, she would have to sell her home and would be  in financial crisis.   Losing the ACA for Merritt Bowman, who is a 49-year-old dad with twin  boys and a football coach from New Jersey--he said that before the ACA  was passed, he didn't even go to the doctor because he was afraid he  couldn't afford it, putting his own health in danger. After the ACA, he  was able to get affordable coverage. When he felt sick a few years  back, he made a doctor's appointment and was diagnosed with diabetes.  Today, thank God, his condition has improved, but, he said: Now I have  a preexisting condition. My insurance covers my medication and my  equipment to monitor my diabetes. If that is taken away from me, what  is going to happen? I can't afford those things on my own   I know this reality. We must know this reality. We must listen to  Americans right now who are saying openly: I am going to the polls  because of my fears on healthcare.   Yet we are going through--instead of waiting to listen to our fellow  Americans, showing that grace that they should decide, we are rushing  forward.   What about protections that are granted people like those under Roe  v. Wade? What about that? Those are decisions that we should let voters  decide. We should listen to the American people. What about protections  for workers? What about protections for organizers? What about voting  rights? All of these issues in the midst of an election deserve to be  decided by the people.   The American people know what is at stake right now because we know  that Donald Trump nominated Judge Barrett with a very specific agenda  in mind. He told us very clearly. We know that Donald Trump wants the  Affordable Care Act to be overturned, and he would appoint judges he  believes would do that. We know that Donald Trump wants Roe v. Wade  overturned. He has explicitly told us that. We know that Donald Trump  wants us to question the validity of an election because he has  questioned the validity of an election that is ongoing right now.   I never imagined I would have a day in my life as an American  citizen--I have watched other countries, but I never thought in my own  we would have a leader who would question the validity of an election,  going as far as to say: If I lose, this election was rigged, and it was  illegitimate.   That does real damage to not just this moment in time; it does damage  to  [[Page S6576]]  our very institutions and our processes that are essential for this  democracy. It is dangerous language.   The behavior of this President is so dangerous that his own Cabinet  members--former Cabinet members--have called it out.   I know the strength of our Nation, but our institutions must be  protected, and they must be preserved. The processes that ensure this  democracy continues to go on so that our truth goes marching on--all  have to be protected.   When you have a President who calls into question our very election  processes and literally says ``If I lose, it is illegitimate'' and then  says ``I won't even commit to a peaceful transfer of power,'' that  should raise alarms. That is why people within his own party, people  who served in his own Cabinet, people respected in this entire body,  like General Mattis, former Secretary of Defense, have said that Donald  Trump is a threat to our democracy.   It is in that context, in the middle of a national crisis, that we  are in the midst of an election, and we can't even get a Supreme Court  nominee to commit themselves to the idea of the peaceful transfer of  power, who the President himself has said he is rushing to the highest  Court in the land because he believes that this election may be decided  by that judge. That judge won't even commit to being recused under  these circumstances. Is that strengthening our democracy? Is that  girding trust in our country's processes, or is it weakening them?  Because it clearly is doing damage to what is necessary for the  endurance of our country and our ideas.   These aren't just my words; these are the words of people on both  sides of America's political divide. Yet we are not showing restraint  in this moment. We are not showing that grace. We are rushing for  short-term gain for one political party and long-term damage to our  Nation.   I don't understand why this is not something that raises worry and  concern--a President who so easily trashes some of our most valued and  sacrosanct ideas.   I remember the hurt I felt when peaceful protesters in Lafayette Park  were turned upon. I remember a note I was forwarded from a college  classmate--if I have it correct--about her son being hit with a rubber  bullet. I remember journalists whom I had gotten to know in these very  hallways telling me about the horror of seeing the panic and the  screams and the running as the gas and the rubber bullets hit. I saw  how a President seemed to utilize the military to menace what is one of  our most important constitutional protections--the right to protest  peacefully.   I have seen 4 years now of too many people who have remained silent  in the face of erosions to our constitutional norms as the President  has so willingly trashed that which people on both sides of our  political divide have worked so hard to build up. I stood right there  down near the Presiding Officer and raised my hand, like so many of us  have--like all of us have--to protect and defend the Constitution of  the United States.   To not see us right now, in the midst of a potential constitutional  convulsion; in the midst of a potential constitutional crisis where a  President himself is not committing to the peaceful transfer of power;  where there are people organizing to do harm to elected leaders, kidnap  them; when you could go online right now and look at groups calling out  to people with Special Forces training to go to polls and perhaps cause  mayhem--I don't understand why we don't share a bipartisan, deep  concern for what is happening right now in our country and how this  moment in American history fits into the concern that moving forward  right now causes danger and causes harm.   I would be remiss to not mention that in the midst of it all, we are  also in the midst of a racial awakening in our country. We saw what are  perhaps the largest demonstrations in our Nation around issues of  racial justice--all 50 States, towns and communities from all  backgrounds, people marching and protesting around race issues. It has  led millions of Americans to learn more about our own history,  discovering things like the Tulsa massacre, discovering things like the  Colfax massacre, going to the incredible museum in Alabama for  lynching, where thousands of Americans were lynched in our country,  discovering our history and how it ties directly to the President.    In the midst of all of this, we know that issues of race and the law  will continuously come up before the Court until we have justice  rolling down like water and righteousness like a mighty stream.   In the midst of all of this, even in my conversations with this  nominee, I was surprised that they could not speak to one article, one  Law Review article, one column, or one book they have read about issues  of race in the law, when we are still in a nation that has such bias in  its outcome, where just by the color of their skin they are directly  correlated with longer sentences, more likely to get the mandatory  minimum, more likely to get the death penalty, where we see no  difference between Blacks and Whites in America for using marijuana or  selling marijuana, but Blacks are almost four times more likely to be  arrested for possession of marijuana, getting criminal convictions for  doing things that two of the last three Presidents admitted to doing.   And in the midst of all of this that has activated so many Americans  and many even in the polls today, I couldn't get even a dialogue going  about issues of race.   When I specifically asked about a case, Judge Barrett's case in Smith  v. Illinois Department of Transportation--this case involved a Black  traffic patrol driver who had been fired by the Illinois Department of  Transportation. This employee claimed that he had been the subject of a  hostile work environment and that his supervisor had called him the N- word. Judge Barrett ruled against him saying that despite documenting  being called the N-word by his supervisor, the employee had failed to  make the case that he had been fired in retaliation for complaints  about race discrimination.   When I asked Judge Barrett why she ruled that a supervisor using a  vial and derogatory term, one that carries with it a history of racial  subjugation and violence like the ``N-word,'' did not constitute a  hostile work environment--I mentioned that Judge Kavanaugh, in a  similar case, ruled that it did--I was surprised after her answers to  go back and read the case. She had muddied the facts in the case. In  fact, she blatantly mischaracterized a key fact in the case.   Judge Barrett said: ``He didn't tie the use of the N-word into the  evidence that he introduced for his hostile work environment claim.''  When, in fact, the employee's reply brief states: ``Appellant's  position is that the combination of the N-word and the acts identified  immediately above did create a hostile work environment.''   She mischaracterized her own ruling claiming, ``So the panel very  carefully wrote the opinion to make clear that it was possible for one  use of the N-word to be enough to establish a hostile work environment  claim if overplayed that way,'' when, in fact, her opinion stated  something different:         The N-word is an egregious epitaph. That said, Smith can't       win simply by providing that the N-word was uttered.    Again, even Justice Kavanaugh stated that being called the N-word by  a supervisor suffices in itself to establish a racially hostile work  environment.   Again, in this context, at a moment that our country is moving in  numbers we have not seen before, we have a Justice that  mischaracterizes a case, doesn't speak directly to the facts, as plain  as they were, and can't engage in a substantive conversation about any  scholarship whatsoever around race in America.   I would like to read an excerpt of the letter from Derrick Johnson,  President and CEO of the NAACP. He writes: ``It is disturbing enough  that Judge Barrett declined to rule that use of this vial epitaph  constituted a racially hostile work environment, but her  misrepresentation to the Judiciary Committee about the basis for her  ruling raises serious questions about her truthfulness and candor under  oath that extended far beyond this particular case.''   I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the Black Lives Matter  Global Network Foundation signed by 18,000 Americans in opposition to  the nomination of Amy Coney Barrett to serve as Associate Justice on  the Supreme Court of the United States be printed in the Record  [[Page S6577]]    There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                             Black Lives Matter,                                                   October 21, 2020.      Hon. Lindsey Graham,      Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Dianne Feinstein,      Ranking Member, Senate Judiciary Committee,      Washington, DC.      Re Opposition to the Nomination of Amy Coney Barrett to the           Supreme Court of the United States.         Dear Chairman Graham and Ranking Member Feinstein: On       behalf of Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation, Inc.       the umbrella organization for our global movement, I strongly       urge you to oppose the nomination of Amy Coney Barrett to       serve as Associate Justice on the Supreme Court of the United       States.        The New York Times recently recognized Black Lives Matter       as the largest, most diverse civil and human rights movement       in the history of both our country and the world. We cannot       stand back nor stand by as partisan political games threaten       irreparable harm to the last branch of government where Black       Americans can turn for protection and justice.        As imperfect as our American judicial system has been, it       has traditionally had at least the veneer of an avenue for       recourse for marginalized groups. This political hijacking of       the nominating process to the highest court in the land goes       against the purpose and intent of the Constitution you are       sworn to uphold.        The U.S. Supreme Court has always been crucial to the       progress of African Americans. Our rights to fully       participate in democracy and in every facet of social and       economic life, on an equal basis, lie in the balance. From       Brown v. Board of Education to Shelby County v. Holder, we       have seen the power of the Supreme Court to both advance and       undermine civil rights and equal justice under law. Each       year, the Court decides critical cases involving voting       rights, equal educational opportunity, fair employment, fair       housing, women's rights, access to healthcare, immigration,       consumer rights, environmental justice, and criminal justice.       These decisions directly impact our lives, our families, and       our communities for generations.        Placing someone like Barrett who has a record of flagrant       disregard for established precedent, especially on issues       related to race, on the Court is dangerous for marginalized       people. Smith v. Illinois Department of Transportation, is       only one example of her dangerous jurisprudence. In the       aforementioned case, Barrett ruled that being called the n-      word by a supervisor does not constitute a hostile work       environment. So extreme is this ruling, that it places       Barrett to the right of Justice Kavanaugh, who in 2013 wrote       that a single use of this epithet ``suffices by itself to       establish a racially hostile work environment.'' The means by       which Judge Barrett reached this extraordinary conclusion, by       relying on grounds that neither the trial court nor either       party had raised, reveals the jurisprudential gymnastics to       which she was willing to undergo in order to reach this       disturbing conclusion.        The nomination of Amy Coney Barrett in the middle of a       presidential election poses a grave threat to the integrity       and legitimacy of the bastion of the Judicial Branch of       government. Justice Ginsburg passed away on September 17.       Thirteen days after, voting began. At least 31.4 million       people have already voted for President and for their       Senators in this election, both through early voting and       voting by mail. Their voices must be heard and honored.        Black Lives Matter wants a Supreme Court that works for all       of us. We will fight for that Court. Corporate interests like       insurance companies, drug companies, and the gun industry       have worked for years to pack the courts to ensure that they       work for them, not for the rest of us. To have courts that       protect equal justice for everyone, we need a nominee who       will fight against these corporations and protect the rights       of everyday working people. We need a Justice who won't pick       and choose whose rights to defend, but one who will work to       protect equal justice for all. Amy Coney Barrett is not that       nominee. She will not be that Justice.        Our rights and the future of our democracy is at stake.       Because Amy Coney Barrett puts the wealthy and powerful       first, the Court will continue making decisions that deny       Americans' voting rights, put corporations ahead of people,       refuse to recognize and remediate discrimination, and limit       access to health care.        Black Lives Matter must also note that Amy Coney Barrett       currently occupies a judicial seat meant for a Black woman.       She ascended over Black women with greater qualifications and       more professional experience. In 2017, Donald Trump appointed       Barrett to an Indiana seat in the U.S. Court of Appeals for       the Seventh Circuit, which covers Indiana, Illinois, and       Wisconsin. This is the same seat to which President Obama       nominated Myra Selby, a Black woman, in 2016. But Republican       Senators blocked Myra Selby's confirmation and saved the seat       for Donald Trump. After Trump was elected, the Seventh       Circuit lost its only judge of color to retirement. In total,       Trump had four vacancies to fill on this circuit. Instead of       nominating a person of color to restore diversity to the       court, Trump appointed four white judges, including Amy       Barrett, making the Seventh Circuit the only all white       federal appellate court in the country.        The judicial oath for the Supreme Court states ``I solemnly       swear (or affirm) that I will administer justice without       respect to persons, and do equal right to the poor and to the       rich, and that I will faithfully and impartially discharge       and perform all the duties incumbent upon me''. Judge Barrett       has failed to show she is capable of holding true to those       principles. We take her at her opined word and believe she is       who she has shown us to be.        For these reasons, Black Lives Matter strongly opposes the       nomination of Judge Barrett to the Supreme Court. Thank you       for your consideration of our position.            Respectfully,      Patrisse Cullers,        Co-Founder and Executive Director, Black Lives Matter       Global Network Foundation, Inc.     So I appeal, again, one last time to the conscience of  the Senate. This is not a time to proceed. This is a time for grace. It  is not a time to proceed. It is a time to firm up the foundations of  our Republic. It is not a time to proceed. It is a time to listen to  the American people. It is a time to listen to the voters lined up now.  It is a time to listen and wait.   I know there are a lot of Americans who are concerned right now, not  with the one nominee but with how this process has gone. It is a  process that is eroding people's trust and their faith in the  institution. They don't see fairness in this. They look at the own  words of Republican Senators and don't understand how hypocrisy like  that can stand--one standard for one President, another standard for  another.   But I want to tell everyone who is hurting right now, everyone who is  worried about our Republic, everyone who is concerned in this moment  about their healthcare and their voting rights and their Nation that  this is not a time to give up. There will be difficult days ahead, but  it is not a time to give up.   We know that healthcare is at risk, but it is not a time to give up.  We know that women controlling their own bodies, sacrosanct as that  idea is and as under threat as it now is--it is not a time to give up.  LGBTQ rights are under threat, but it is not a time to give up. We  cannot give up in the cause of our country. It is not a right cause or  a left cause. It is a right and wrong cause.   We can be a nation that builds for posterity a functioning republic  that can elevate the best of human ideals like grace. We cannot give up  in this moment. We cannot meet darkness with darkness. We cannot  surrender to cynicism about our systems. We have to keep pressing  forward.   I still believe that our Nation's history, as speckled as it is with  wretchedness and pain, is still a story that is a testimony to the  overcoming of injustice and the better securing of it. I still believe  that we do live in a nation where the truth does prevail in the end. I  still believe that even when wrongs are done, they can be righted. I  still believe that though this may become, today, a moment of shame, we  can reclaim in this Nation the ideals of our Founders--those  testimonies to grace, the commitment to each other of their sacred  honor--that we still can take a body politic, wounded and injured, and  in our country find healing, find redemption, and find grace.   I yield the floor.
