 Mr. Chairman, I am honored to be here today to  introduce my amendment to H.R. 9, the Climate Action Now Act. My  amendment takes into consideration the various populations, regions,  industries and communities affected by climate change, while reducing  any possible impacts on American jobs.   We all know that climate change has impacted countries and  communities throughout our country and the world. Over the past few  years, we have seen the devastating effects of it on the waters of the  Caribbean Sea, fueling powerful storms, like Hurricane Maria, which  devastated Puerto Rico and took the lives of close to 3,000 people and  displacing another 300,000 from their homes.   In my home State of California last year, it led to the deadliest  wildfire season in history. According to the National Climate  Assessment, rural communities, like the ones I serve, face challenging  obstacles in responding to climate change because they are so highly  dependent on natural resources.   My constituents, the people of California's Central Valley, live in  one of the most economically distressed parts of our country. We have  been forgotten and left behind. But it is my constituents who have seen  the direct impacts of climate change with our recent heat waves and  droughts. It is only going to get worse if we don't work together and  address this issue head-on.   H.R. 9 is the first step we must take in addressing this challenge.  This would prohibit Federal funds from being used to take any action in  advancing the withdrawal of the U.S. from the Paris Agreement.   The U.S. committed to joining the Paris Agreement because we are a  leading nation. It is unfortunate that this President is taking us  backward.                                time  1030    Instead of fighting climate change, the President and his  administration have proposed to slash funding from the Department of  Energy's Efficiency and Renewable Energy offices by over 85 percent,  and they even propose to cut energy funding from our States.   My amendment would help create a clean energy economy that would  provide good paying jobs to millions of Americans, cleaner air for  everyone, and a safe, sustainable future for our children and  grandchildren.   What we continue to hear from our Republican colleagues is that a  number of coal jobs will be taken away from Americans. And I can tell  you, as somebody who has worked in the mining industry, who has worked  underground, I know it is not the way to go.   While we know that mining jobs and underground jobs are honorable  jobs and provide for families, at one time so was whaling, but we need  to be innovative in looking towards the future. The more time we waste  on clinging to jobs of the past, the more time we waste on not making  progress.   Nationally, there are over 240,000 jobs in the solar industry alone,  and only about 53,000 coal mining jobs. Reports find that the Paris  Agreement would generate over 24 million jobs worldwide.   In the State of California, we have over 519,000 clean energy jobs,  and it is critical, more than ever, that we continue to connect workers  to these jobs that we are creating for the 21st century. My amendment  does just that by requiring any climate plan to consider the impact on  jobs, wages, and pay.   We have the opportunity to be global leaders in the clean energy  economy, ensure that so many of these jobs are created right here in  the United States--not in other countries, not in India, not in China.   We cannot afford to take steps back on the fight on climate change,  and we  [[Page H3420]]  must keep our word to the rest of the world. Mr. Chairman, I urge my  colleagues to support my amendment.
