 Mr. Speaker, on behalf of my family and staff, I want  to salute and commemorate the veterans of the U.S. Virgin Islands and  throughout the United States on this Veterans Day.   The Virgin Islands along with the other territories send more men and  women per capita to serve in the U.S. military than anywhere else in  this Nation.   I would like to personally recognize Task Force Alpha on St. Croix,  Task Force Bravo on St. Thomas, and St. John Responders.   On Veterans Day, we salute the men and women who have proudly worn  the uniform and the families who have served alongside them. We affirm  our sacred duty as citizens to express our enduring gratitude, both in  words and actions, for their service.   As part of Veterans Day this year in the Virgin Islands, we will be  honoring female veterans in the territory. Being honored as parade  marshal and guest speaker on the island of St. Croix is Major Kathleen  Parris; on St. Thomas, Sergeant First Class Laurel Maloon-Francis,  serving as parade marshal; and serving as guest speaker on the island  of St. Thomas will be former military spouse, Monique Y. Ferrell,  director of the Army Sexual Harassment/Assault Response and Prevention  Program.   Mr. Speaker, just as we vow to leave no soldier behind on the  battlefield, we vow not to forget any veteran when they return home.                            ____________________
