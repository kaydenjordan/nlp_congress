 Mr. President, I want to thank my colleague from  Delaware via Columbus, OH, for his comments, and I want to talk for a  moment about what we did today in the U.S. Senate. We passed  legislation very important to our veterans that has to do with  expanding VA veterans' healthcare coverage but specifically addresses  the problem of our veterans who have been exposed to burn pits--toxic  burn pits that have resulted in terrible illnesses, including cancer  and others.   The legislation we passed is named the Heath Robinson PACT Act. And  people may wonder: Well, who is Heath Robinson? Why is it named after  him?   Heath Robinson was from Pickerington, OH, which is a small community  outside of Columbus, OH. He enlisted in the Ohio National Guard. He  became a sergeant first class. He did tours of duty in Kosovo and also  in Iraq. He was with the 285th Area Support Medical Company and was a  two-time Ohio Army National Guard NCO of the Year in 2012 and 2013--so  a very distinguished career in the military.   In 2020, he died of cancer. And when you talk to the medical  professionals, they say that his exposure to burn pits  [[Page S3011]]  is what resulted in his cancer developing and in the end of his life  way too soon.   So his widow Danielle, who some people may remember was at the State  of the Union up in the Gallery, and his mom Kathi and his daughter  Brielle have been tireless advocates for addressing this burn pit  issue, trying to stop the burn pits from being used but, of course,  addressing the consequence of these burn pits. And they have channeled  their grief in a constructive way, which is to encourage Congress to  pass this legislation that we passed today. So many other veterans who  have been exposed to burn pits will now get their healthcare because of  their work and because of the tribute that is being paid to their  father and husband and son, Heath Robinson.   So that is who Heath Robinson is, and that is why it was important to  name that legislation today after him.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I am also rising today to ask unanimous  consent from my colleagues to pass other legislation, S. 2129, a  bipartisan bill that I have coauthored with my colleague from Ohio,  Senator Sherrod Brown. It honors a young man named Otto Warmbier, and  it counters North Korea's censorship and surveillance state.   Otto Warmbier was a native of my hometown in Cincinnati, OH, and his  wonderful family are dear friends. He was a young man of great spirit,  great intellect, and great promise. He was a student, a star at the  University of Virginia.   In 2015, he went to North Korea with a tour group. It was a cultural  visit with people from the United States, from Europe, looking to see  what North Korea was like. They were there for a very brief period of  time, but at the end of that brief visit, as he was waiting in line at  the airport to leave with fellow members of the tour, North Korean  security officials grabbed him and pulled him out of line.   He was detained, and then eventually he was sentenced for 15 years on  trumped-up charges relating to whether or not he tried to take down a  poster that was a political poster--15 years. Otto Warmbier, again, a  young man of great promise, was unjustly convicted and imprisoned. And  during a 17-month period of imprisonment, captivity, he was badly  mistreated by the North Koreans, to the point that when he was returned  to the United States in 2017, he came back in a comatose state from  which he never recovered.   Otto Warmbier died almost exactly 5 years ago today, June 19, 2017.  He was 22 years old, with his whole life ahead of him. So 5 years ago,  life changed forever for Otto's friends, for his parents, his  classmates. His service, his funeral was extraordinary, the outpouring  of love.   His parents, Fred and Cindy, have taken their grief and done  something very constructive with it. They have focused on exposing what  North Korea is really like and also ensuring that, to the extent  possible, North Korea is held accountable for this atrocity. No parent  should have to endure what they went through.   I have worked with Senators Brown, Coons, Tillis, Van Hollen, and  Hagerty, as well as the Warmbiers, as well as the Biden administration,  on this legislation. It is called the Otto Warmbier North Korea  Censorship and Surveillance Act. It would authorize sanctions against  any foreign individuals involved in censoring the North Korean people's  access to information on behalf of the Kim Jong Un regime.   Of course, the North Koreans aren't getting the truth because  information is censored. So it is very important to get whatever real  news you can into the country. When that happens, what you find out is  that people leave North Korea and then work against the regime. But so  many people don't have access to that information.   So this bill authorizes the U.S. Agency for Global Media to find new  and creative ways to circumvent North Korean censorship and provides  $10 million annually for the next 5 years to counter North Korea's  repressive censorship and surveillance state, including something very  practical and needed, which is repairing the antennas that have been  used for this purpose that were damaged in a typhoon years ago and have  never been fixed because we haven't had the funding.   This bill has adequate funding to put in place the infrastructure  that is now going to be necessary to effectively send true, accurate  information to North Korea to counter North Korean propaganda for the  sake of the people of North Korea.   Together, this Chamber can send a bipartisan message to the world  that we will not stand for the censorship and the repression of the  North Korean regime. So I urge my colleagues to support this  legislation. It is something we have worked on carefully. We have  gotten technical assistance from the administration. It is something  that I hope we can pass here this evening and then we can, in turn, get  it passed in the House of Representatives and get it to the President  for his signature.   So, Mr. President, I would now like to call up this legislation. I  ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate  consideration of Calendar No. 159, S. 2129.    I ask unanimous consent that the committee-reported  substitute amendment be agreed to and that the bill, as amended, be  considered read a third time.    I know of no further debate on the bill, as amended.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the motion  to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, this is an important day for Otto  Warmbier's family, for so many people who care about the repression and  the lack of information going into North Korea, and I thank my  colleagues for supporting this legislation.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
