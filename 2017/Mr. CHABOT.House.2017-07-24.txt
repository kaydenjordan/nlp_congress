 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2333) to amend the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 to  increase the amount of leverage made available to small business  investment companies, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2333         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Small Business Investment       Opportunity Act of 2017''.       SEC. 2. INDIVIDUAL SBIC LEVERAGE LIMIT INCREASE.         Section 303(b)(2)(A)(ii) of the Small Business Investment       Act of 1958 (15 U.S.C. 683(b)(2)(A)(ii)) is amended by       striking ``$150,000,000'' and inserting ``$175,000,000''.     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, as chairman of the House Small Business Committee, a day  does not go by without me hearing from our Nation's job creators. From  inspiring accounts that are driven by their work ethic to stories of  sacrifice all in the name of growing their company, the Nation's small  businesses are the true lifeblood of the American economy.                                time  1615    With over 29 million small businesses operating in the United States,  they are responsible for two out of every three new jobs created in  this country. However, their full potential is being held back by  heavy-handed regulations and uncertainty. Unfortunately, their  inability to access capital continues to prevent job creation and  expansion.   As a way to increase access to capital, the Small Business  Administration jump-starts and enhances the flow of venture and private  equity capital through the Small Business Investment Company program,  also known as the SBIC program.   Created in the 1958 Small Business Investment Act, the program  utilizes a privately owned and SBA licensed model to increase access to  capital. With over 300 SBICs operating in the country and more than $24  billion of capital under management, the program in fiscal year 2015  invested more than $5.4 billion in approximately 1,000 small  businesses.   In 2015, I introduced a SBIC bill that focused on increasing the  family of funds limit.   Similar to my 2015 legislation that was signed into law, the bill we  have before us today concentrates on the individual leverage limit.  Currently set at $150 million, the individual limit determines how much  capital can be deployed by a SBIC that has only one fund under  management. To better utilize this program and allow an increase in  capital to small businesses, H.R. 2333--the bill that we are  considering here this afternoon--increases the individual leverage  limit to $175 million.   I want to thank the gentleman from California (Mr. Knight), the  chairman of our Subcommittee on Contracting  [[Page H6179]]  and Workforce, for his leadership on this issue.   With access to capital being such a critical need for small business  expansion and job creation, an increase in the individual leverage  limit could deliver the needed capital that the next great American  company is searching for.   This bill has broad bipartisan support and was favorably passed out  of committee unanimously. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R.  2333.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Ms. Judy Chu, who is here this afternoon, I  believe, on behalf of Ms. Velazquez, who is the ranking member. We have  a very strong bipartisan working committee. It is one of those in  Congress that I think can be a model for other committees in how the  two parties can actually work together and push forward with policies  that are good for the country overall. We are not a very partisan  committee. We work together. And I want to thank both Ms. Velazquez and  Ms. Judy Chu for their participation in that bipartisanship.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Marshall).    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Norman), the newest member of the  Small Business Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I want to, again, commend the gentleman from  California (Mr. Knight) for his leadership on this particular  legislation. He is the subcommittee chairman of the Contracting and  Workforce Subcommittee.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, let me reiterate the importance of this  bill, which aims to increase access to capital for small businesses. It  simply increases the SBIC's individual leverage limit from $150 million  to $175 million.   This legislation really is common sense. And, as I mentioned before,  it is bipartisan. I, again, want to thank the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Judy Chu) for her bipartisan leadership on this as  well.   It will enhance the ability of small businesses to gain the needed  money to expand and create jobs in our communities.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 2333, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2056) to amend the Small Business Act to provide for  expanded participation in the microloan program, and for other  purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.  [[Page H6180]]    The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2056         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the microloan program at the Small Business  Administration is a program that acutely targets small dollar borrowers  by utilizing nonprofit intermediaries known as microlenders.   Beyond lending the needed capital that is critical to a small  business, microlenders are required to provide technical assistance and  training to borrowers and perspective borrowers.   The program is unique to the SBA's capital access programs because it  combines capital with counseling, two ingredients for growth. However,  like many Federal programs, it is in need of modernizing to fully meet  the demands of America's small businesses.   H.R. 2056, the Microloan Modernization Act of 2017, does just that.   To fully service small dollar borrowers, H.R. 2056 raises the lending  volume a microloan intermediary has at its disposal from $5 million to  $6 million.   Next, the legislation provides flexibility to the outdated and  antiquated 25/75 rule that limits the amount of preloan technical  assistance a microloan intermediary can offer to their small business  clients.   By updating the rule to a 50/50 split, more complete assistance can  be offered in the early stages of the process, oftentimes, when a small  business needs it the most.   To determine if the program is running at its full potential with  microlenders throughout the Nation, H.R. 2056 also directs the SBA to  study the utilization of the program.   Lastly, to make sure the SBA is providing the correct amount of  supervision, the Government Accountability Office, the GAO, is required  to study the SBA's oversight tools.   As we continue to see signs of economic improvement, we must  steadfastly defend the Nation's small businesses and startups. H.R.  2056 makes important changes to the program that will enhance a small  dollar borrower's ability to grow and create jobs.   I want to thank the gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. Murphy) and all  the members on this committee who have taken a leading role in this  legislation. It has broad bipartisan support--again, the Small Business  Committee working in a bipartisan fashion.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 2056, and I  reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1630     Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Bacon).    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, in closing, I would note again that we have  bipartisan work on this committee. I thank Mrs. Murphy and Mr. Bacon  for working together and pushing this bill, which I think will benefit  small businesses all across the country. I we appreciate that. Mrs.  Murphy, of course, is from Florida, and Mr. Bacon is from Nebraska.   I think the Microloan program really is an important tool in the  SBA's capital access toolbox, but it is in need of modernizing, and  H.R. 2056 does that. These are the reforms, I think, that the Nation's  job creators need.   Small businesses, startups, and entrepreneurs have the ideas to  create the next great American company. We just need to provide the  correct environment for that growth to take place, and I think this is  something that will contribute towards that possibility and, therefore,  be able to create more jobs for more Americans all across the country.   Mr. Speaker, I would urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2056, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2364) to amend the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 to  increase the amount that certain banks and savings associations may  invest in small business investment companies, subject to the approval  of the appropriate Federal banking agency, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2364         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Investing in Main Street Act       of 2017''.       SEC. 2. INVESTMENT IN SMALL BUSINESS INVESTMENT COMPANIES.         Section 302(b) of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958       (15 U.S.C. 682(b)) is amended--        (1) in paragraph (1), by inserting before the period the       following: ``or, subject to the approval of the appropriate       Federal banking agency, 15 percent of such capital and       surplus'';        (2) in paragraph (2), by inserting before the period the       following: ``or, subject to the approval of the appropriate       Federal banking agency, 15 percent of such capital and       surplus''; and  [[Page H6182]]         (3) by adding at the end the following:        ``(3) Appropriate federal banking agency defined.--For       purposes of this subsection, the term `appropriate Federal       banking agency' has the meaning given that term under section       3 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   As members of the Small Business Committee, we hear day in and day  out how access to capital continues to challenge job creation and job  growth. We must continue to work in a bipartisan fashion to create an  environment for small businesses to flourish and grow.   One resource available to small employers is the Small Business  Investment Company program, or the SBIC program, which currently runs  on a zero cost subsidy to the American taxpayer.   The program enhances access to capital for small business throughout  the Nation by utilizing a private sector-owned and SBA-licensed formula  to increase equity capital.   Within the SBIC program, banks and Federal savings associations are  limited to the amount of capital or surplus they can invest in an SBIC.  Under current statute, the limit prevents no more than a 5 percent  investment.   The legislation we have before us today, H.R. 2364, the Investing in  Main Street Act of 2017, increases this investment threshold to 15  percent and requires any investment above the 5 percent mark to be  subject to approval by the bank's regulator. This new 15 percent marker  brings parity to the program with rules by the Office of the  Comptroller of the Currency.   As the Nation's small businesses continue to experience difficulties  accessing capital, assistance like the SBIC program delivers, and has a  track record to prove it. Some of the Nation's most prominent companies  have received SBIC financing in the past. The update provided in H.R.  2364 will continue and build upon the success of the program.   This bill has broad bipartisan support and was favorably passed out  of committee unanimously. I would urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on  H.R. 2364.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   In closing, I would like to thank the gentlewoman from California  (Ms. Judy Chu) and the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Adams) for  their leadership in introducing this and pushing this important  legislation forward.   Once again, it is a bipartisan piece of legislation, and we have  worked together. Republicans and Democrats working together, isn't that  something? So we appreciate their hard work on this.   With small businesses being the cornerstones of nearly every  community in the Nation, we must continue to work together to create an  environment for growth and job creation. The 29 million small  businesses all across the Nation are depending on us actually working  together on things like this.   I know the ranking member of the committee likes to say, ``There  aren't Republican small businesses; there aren't Democratic small  businesses; they are just small businesses,'' and she is absolutely  right. So I really do appreciate their working on this legislation.   H.R. 2364 is commonsense legislation that enjoys bipartisan support.  I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this.   I yield back the balance of my time.
