 Mr. Speaker, 17 years ago, the United States began a 2- month-long crash course in voting machines and election infrastructure.  The 2000 Presidential election opened our eyes to the fact that voting  equipment in most places was out-of-date and unsafe.   We didn't learn the lessons of 2000, and in 2017, America's election  infrastructure remains in a bad state. We must act immediately.   First, we need to help all local and State governments replace their  outdated paperless machines with more secure systems.   Second, we need to require postelection audits of all paper records  to make sure that the results tabulated by voting machines have not  been hacked.   Third, we need to help election officials at the local level upgrade  their database and election infrastructure to protect against all cyber  attacks.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting all  efforts to modernize and protect our voting infrastructure and  legislation dealing with cyber attacks.                            ____________________
