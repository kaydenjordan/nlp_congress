 Mr. Speaker, it is important for my colleagues and  as well the American people to know that NATO is not just section 5,  when one is attacked all are attacked. NATO is thought. It is purpose.  It is a sense of collaborative viewpoints on the value of democracy.   It is important that any Commander in Chief, no matter what party  affiliation, passes the standard of decorum to recognize our allies and  to strengthen the relationships and to give criticism where necessary  and to seek improvement, but not to be an embarrassment.   I think it is important, as meetings are proceeding, that we  recognize that our allies are far more important than an individual who  continues to provide nerve gas to kill people on foreign soil, to be  behind attacks on airplanes taking over Crimea and other places. It is  important to recognize that, yes, you engage with your enemy, but you  recognize that they are your enemy.   I would also suggest that it is hardly the American way for the U.S.  delegation to oppose a breastfeeding resolution at the World Health  Organization and to punish a little country like Ecuador.   I want us to be better internationally, Mr. Speaker, and stand for  the values of America.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, Congressman Correa is a valued member  of this body and one of the outstanding members of the Homeland  Security Committee, where he is Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on  Oversight and Management Efficiency.   We are here today to call upon the President, the Department of  Health and Human Services, and the Congress of the United States to act  without delay to ensure separated immigrant children are reunited with  their parents in an expeditious manner.   On June 26, 2018, a federal judge ruled that unless reunification is  not in the best interest of the child, a child under 5 years old must  be reunited within 14 days of its order.   Yesterday was the deadline that this administration failed to meet.   To President Trump, I say ``Time's Up!''   This act committed was not only mortifying, but an illegal act.   This individual has proven he lacks depth and experience, has  violated the ethics that this country prides itself on, and he should  be ashamed.   This is a senseless act that must not go unnoticed.   We must hold him accountable for these not clearly formulated  decisions.   Yesterday, I met with faith and community leaders to bring attention  to yesterdays' deadline, imposed by a federal judge, to reunite the  youngest separated children with their parents due to the President's  egregious ``zero-tolerance'' policy.   In our country, the rule of law and its implementation is an  essential component of our democracy.   Twenty years ago, Flores v. Reno, also known as the Flores Agreement,  established that migrants or immigrants could not be separated from  their children for long periods of time.   Earlier this year, President Trump and his administration implemented  a ``zero-tolerance policy'' of separating immigrant children from their  parents upon arrival into the United States.   To be certain, the administration's plan was half-baked.   As the Founder and Chair of the Children's Caucus and as a parent and  grandparent, I am outraged that the administration represented what  they did not know and could not do.   They did not know the true number of the children separated, they  could not reunite these children, and there is no plan for their  reunification.   When Americans and the international community from all walks of life  began to challenge this cruel and inhumane policy, the courts got  involved.   It appears as if a fortnight was more than enough time for this  administration to make a complete mess of this process, and in the  process damage families--perhaps irreparably.   According to the American Civil Liberties Union, fewer than half of  the migrant children who are under five years-old will be reunited with  their parents.   Studies have documented that when young children are forcibly removed  from their parents, the traumatic experience engenders long-term  negative effects on their physical and mental health and well-being  suffers.   Stressful situations that would usually prompt physiological  responses in other people--increased heart rate, sweaty palms--would  provoke nothing in the children forcibly removed from their parents  because their fight-or-flight response system appeared permanently  broken.   This is outrageous and unacceptable in a nation which has a long and  noble tradition of providing sanctuary to the persecuted and oppressed.   Last Friday afternoon, July 6, 2018, the administration asked for  more time to reunite these young children with their parents, which  again was nothing more than a tacit admission that its plan for  separating children was implemented without a way to eventually reunite  them with their parents.   After it was ordered to reunite these children, and in asking for  more time to comply with the federal court, the President's lawyers  asked ``can I keep these children away from their parents for a longer  time?''   My response is ``these children have been away from their parents  long enough.''   When I visited the border and the federal detention facilities that  housed parents and children quarantined from one another, what I  witnessed was horrific and was echoed in heartbreaking audio recordings  released by the press revealing children crying, aching for their  parents, as all face a fate uncertain, and inconsistent with the  American ideal.   I will never forget the little children I met during my visit to the  border.   One baby, 9-month-old Roger, had been taken from his 19-year-old  sister after she was prosecuted for crossing the border illegally.   Their mother is dead, and they were coming here to find family.   Little Leah, was just one year-old and was taken from a grandmother  and a sister.   The pain was no less visceral when speaking with mothers wondering  where their children have gone.   In South Texas I met Gabby, from Honduras, who had a 45 day-old baby  taken from her, and while housed at the facility had not yet been  treated or given medical attention.   Yesterday, a federal judge ruled that the administration's argument  in favor of child separation was ``tortured.''   Put another way, the Administration has no leg to stand on.   Trump knows that he is advancing a cruel and inhumane policy, but he  refuses to accept responsibility for this matter blaming,  alternatively: Congress, the courts and prior presidents.   This is no surprise, of course: all who have watched this president  know his proclivity to shirk responsibility for any of his actions.   In a bizarre turn of events, the President actually tried to blame  the courts for his own cruel child separation policy.   A federal judge appropriately chastised the President and cast as  ``cynical'' any attempt to blame the courts for his mess, which is  entirely of this Administration's own doing.   Tellingly, the judge went one profound step further and indicated  that the President and his administration knew--at least for over a  year--that there was no facility which would house parents and children  together.   Thus, when it proceeded with this new immigration policy, the  President knew that the segregation of children from their parents was  inevitable and chose to implement this policy anyway.   The last time this nation had policies that promoted the forcible  separation of children from newly arrived persons was slavery: a dark  and shameful chapter in this nation's history that we cannot revisit.   Earlier this year, President, in proclaiming April as National Child  Abuse Prevention Month, stated, ``we must always remember that all  children are blessings from our Creator'' and endowed with value,  purpose and human dignity.''   It is time for this President and the administration he leads, to act  with reason, foresight and compassion and immediately and completely  rectify this crisis.
