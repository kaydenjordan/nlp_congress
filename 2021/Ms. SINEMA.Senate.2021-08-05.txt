 Mr. President, I rise in support of the majority leader's  comments, and I want to commend my colleagues for the work we have done  together in a bipartisan fashion over the last 4 days, considering and  clearing 22 amendments as a body together in the Senate.   And while we were unable to agree on additional amendments today, I  do also look forward to us reconvening together on Saturday and  proceeding under regular order to finish what will be a historic piece  of legislation both in its bipartisan nature and in the impact it will  have on our country.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
