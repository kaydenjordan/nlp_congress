 Mr. President, last week the dedicated journalists at the  Cincinnati Enquirer published the first in a series of reports on the  Ohioans left behind by the economic recovery. This is a big project  that seven reporters, three editors, photographers, and videographers  are all working on. They are doing what reporters do best--going behind  the headlines about stock market performance and actually talking to  people from all walks of life in southwest Ohio, in their circulation  area.   When you look beyond the numbers, you see a pretty different story  from what this President and his Wall Street Cabinet like to brag  about. These reporters traveled the 80-mile road that stretches from  Middletown to Cincinnati and beyond. They talked to teachers and  factory workers. They talked to pastors and truckdrivers, people of all  ages, and people of all races. Over and over they found the same  things. These Ohioans have simply not recovered from the Wall Street  recession of a decade ago. They haven't recovered from decades of trade  and tax policies that funneled wealth to the richest CEOs and the  biggest multinational corporations.   These reporters wrote:         [These workers] may find jobs, but they don't earn the       salaries and benefits they once did. They may pay their bills       on time, but they're one illness or broken-down car from       financial crisis.        Their savings accounts are stretched. Their health and       retirement benefits inadequate. They need more than they       have.    In other words, their hard work isn't paying off. Listen to some of  the stories these reporters tell. They talked to a subcontractor for AK  Steel. His employer is renegotiating its contract with the factory.   The authors wrote:         If the contract vanishes, someone will still do the work he       does, but that's about the only thing he knows for sure. A       new company might fire everyone and hire new drivers or       decide to cut his pay.    More and more companies use subcontractors and independent  contractors as a way to--as they always put it--``cut labor costs.''  What they really mean is to pay people less.   Listen to the story of a Mexican immigrant in West Chester Township  in Butler County. He is here legally. He has a work permit. He works 60  hours a week to support his family. Do you know what he told reporters?         It's real tight with four kids. . . . I'm not here to take       anybody else's jobs or money or benefits. . . . I'm here to       work.    Another woman, a cancer survivor, talked to reporters about her  crippling medical debt. She had to leave her job because of her  condition, and she owes thousands of dollars because of her cancer  treatment.   They wrote that ``the debt took her car first, then her home of 12  years.''   Think about that. The debt took her car first because she got sick  and because we don't protect people with preexisting conditions because  of the President's comments and antics and all. They took her car  first, and then they took her home of 12 years.   Listen to a story of a man in Middletown. He is trying to get a job,  but he can't yet afford a computer or a car. He is applying for a job  in an auto parts plant. He has to fill out forms online, and he has to  have a drug test. That means trying to figure out how to get to a job  counseling center to use a computer. It means trying to get a friend to  drive him another 7 miles to the drug testing center.   The competition for a decent-paying job like that is so stiff that he  is afraid  [[Page S2205]]  if he doesn't get the application in very soon, the job will be gone.   Think about the many layers of these stories. The reporting makes  clear, as they say, that these are not outliers. These are not unusual  cases. ``Household income is lower today than before the recession in  almost half the counties in Greater Cincinnati.''   Greater Cincinnati is partly in Kentucky, represented by Senator  McConnell and Senator Paul, partly in Indiana, represented by Senator  Young and our new colleague from Indiana, and much in Ohio, represented  by Senator Portman and me.         Poverty is worse in one-third of those counties.        Wages for the poorest workers have barely budged since the       recovery began.    And we know it isn't just southwest Ohio. It is the whole State. It  is the whole country. It is the same story we see repeated over and  over and over in this country. Wall Street recovers, corporations  recover, and the wealthiest CEOs recover and then some. They all do  better than ever.   Corporations spent more than $800 billion with a ``b''--800,000  million--in stock buybacks last year.   Remember the President's tax bill? I heard him say in his Cabinet  Room, every American would get at least a $4,000 raise. Some Americans  would get a $9,000 raise. He told a group of Senators face-to-face.  There would be many more good-paying jobs created. He went to  Youngstown, OH, only 1 year ago and said: Don't sell your homes. Stay  here. The jobs are going to come back. We are going to build new  factories. We are going to repopulate these factories.   Well, on his watch, three shifts of 1,500 people each at Lordstown--a  GM plant--and Youngstown have been laid off, it appears, permanently.   The President's tax bill? That money didn't end up in the pockets of  the company's workers. Stock buybacks go straight to the pockets of  CEOs and other corporate managers who make the decisions about what to  do with corporate stock buybacks.   So do you remember I said $800 billion in stock buybacks last year?  For the first time in a decade, corporations spent more on buying back  their own stock, meaning taking the money and putting it in their  pockets. They spent more money buying back their own stock then they  did in long-term capital expenditures and investing in their workers'  pay. They took more money for themselves--as if the President didn't  know that of his tax cut, between 70 percent and 80 percent went to the  richest 1-percent of the people in the country over time. He knew that.  I think he knew that.   He also knew that in this tax bill there was a 50-percent-off coupon.  If you produce in the United States, you pay a 21-percent corporate tax  rate. If you move to Mexico you pay a 10.5-percent corporate tax rate.  So what the President did and what the Senate did is to give a 50- percent-off coupon as a reward for shutting down your production in  Lordstown, OH, and moving to Mexico.   Corporations spent more on their stock than investing in long-term  capital expenditures and workers, but ordinary Americans--what happened  to the people in this story?   As for this story that the Cincinnati Enquirer wrote about and all of  the people they interviewed--White, Black, Latino, Asian American,  young and old, middle class and people falling out of the middle class,  and low-income people who work hard and aspire to the middle class-- what happened to them? They got left behind.    We need to change how we think about our economy. It is time for  people in this Congress and in the White House to stop measuring the  economy in quarterly earnings reports and stock prices.   Who thinks that way? People don't structure their lives thinking  about quarterly financial reports. They don't structure their lives  thinking of stock prices. People don't think in terms of 3-month  earnings quarters. They think in terms of school years. They think in  terms of 30-year mortgages. They think in terms of ``the number of  years left that I have to work before my retirement, and am I going to  have enough?'' That is the way that people think, but that is who we  are here to serve, in South Dakota, Ohio, or anywhere else. We are here  to serve workers and here to serve families. We are not here on the  Senate Banking Committee to serve Wall Street. We are not here on the  Senate Finance Committee or on the floor of the Senate to serve the  biggest companies in the country that typically reward us by moving  jobs overseas.   We need policies that restructure our economy to recognize that all  work has dignity. When work has dignity, everyone can afford healthcare  and everyone can afford housing. They have power over their schedules.  They have the economic security to start a family, to pay for daycare  or college or both, to take time off to care for themselves or their  families when they are sick, and they save for their retirement.   The dignity of work fundamentally is about wages. It is about  benefits. It is about having power over your own schedule. It is about  daycare. It is about saving for retirement. It is about being able to  take off to care for a loved one, whether you are raising children or  taking care of an aging parent.   When work has dignity, our country has a strong middle class and a  prosperous future.                            ____________________     Mr. President, last month, the courts once again stepped  in and allowed politicians to meddle in women's healthcare. Last month  the courts once again stepped in. Unelected judges--unelected,  conservative, mostly male judges--stepped in and allowed politicians to  meddle in women's healthcare. These unelected judges ruled that Ohio  can defund Planned Parenthood, limiting healthcare options for tens of  thousands of Ohioans.   Planned Parenthood centers just in my State alone provide 70,000 free  STD and HIV tests, cancer screenings, domestic violence education, and  prenatal care. These clinics--and I have been to a number of them--are  often the only places that many women and some men have to turn. Think  again about the services they provide. They provide STD and HIV tests.  They provide cancer screenings. They provide prenatal care. They  provide domestic violence education.   What happens if they can't go to Planned Parenthood because of a  political movement? Because of the politicizing of women's health, we  see elected officials in Ohio taking away that care. They can't afford  care somewhere else or they live too far away from other healthcare  providers to have any real options. They turned to Planned Parenthood.   This decision by these judges is devastating for Ohioans. I get  letters all the time from Ohioans who rely on Planned Parenthood.   One woman in Cincinnati wrote:         [Planned Parenthood] performed several of my yearly       screenings, one of which detected an abnormality that was       taken care of early and didn't develop into a major problem.       Also, I was able to buy highly effective birth control at a       reasonable price and avoid harder choices down the road.    Why would a legislature and a judge want to take that away?   A woman from West Liberty, a conservative community in our State,  wrote:         If Planned Parenthood was not available to me as a young       woman, I would've had nowhere to turn.        I was comfortable with seeking the help of the kind women       and staff at Planned Parenthood. I was young and naive, but       at least I knew there was somewhere safe to turn to.    A Columbus woman who wrote from the State's largest city:         At the age of 18, I became a young new mother. Throughout       my years as a new mom, struggling to manage financial       responsibilities on top of everything else, I used Planned       Parenthood for most of my OB needs.        Planned Parenthood not only provided a well-rounded       education in which I had received none previously--    That happens so often--       but they also provided services that I would not have had       access to otherwise.    Another woman from Cincinnati wrote:         I am 42 years old, but when I was a young woman in college       I went to a Planned Parenthood clinic to receive my yearly       check-ups. It was cheap, near my college, and easy to access.        During one of my appointments they shared with me that they       had found an irregular pap-smear and that I needed immediate       medical attention.        [The doctor] suggested a surgery for an issue she found       that may later cause issues  [[Page S2206]]       with having children. The doctor was amazing, supportive, and       provided me the guidance as a young woman of what to do to       ensure I was safe and getting the proper next steps.        Planned Parenthood saved my life.    The animosity coming out of the majority leader's office, the  animosity toward Planned Parenthood coming from so many of my  colleagues, and so much of the animosity coming out of the White House  toward Planned Parenthood just amazes me because this woman said:  ``Planned Parenthood saved my life.''   Think about that.   It is time for old White men in Washington and in courtrooms--and  that is usually who they are. They are very affluent, they are  generally older men judges, they are generally White, and they are  making decisions in courtrooms and dictating decisions that should be  made between a woman and her doctor.   That is what this is. This, along with heartbeat bills and all the  other bills making their way through the State legislature in my State  of Ohio and around the country--they spread lies. They spread  disinformation. They are all about the same thing--intimidating women,  intimidating doctors, and making it harder for women to get  comprehensive healthcare. It is immoral, and it is despicable. I join  so many of my colleagues in pledging never to stop fighting to protect  women's freedom to make their own healthcare decisions.   I yield the floor.
