 Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member for his  leadership, and I thank the chairman for his important work in this  Congress and in this committee.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1226, the Wounded Warrior  Access Act, for the same reasons my colleagues had mentioned.   When a veteran files their claim for benefits, they are given the C- file. For a veteran to view this C-file, they must either make an  appointment at their local VA office, travel there to view it in  person, submit a form through the mail or fax with no confirmation that  it was ever received, or submit a Freedom of Information Act request  for their file.   Throughout my time in Congress--I know I am not the only Member who  has heard from a number of veterans who have had trouble accessing  their C-files from the VA.   Just to put this in context, Mr. Speaker, our veterans need these  files to access the benefits that they have earned or appeal the VA's  decisions about their claim. That is why, Mr. Speaker, this is so  important.   Veterans in the Inland Empire and across this country need an easy  way to access this information without jumping through bureaucratic  hoops.   This bipartisan bill is a commonsense solution that cuts this red  tape and will help American veterans.   I again thank Chairman Bost, Ranking Member Takano, and members of  the House Veterans' Affairs Committee for their leadership in bringing  this bill to the floor.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 1226.
