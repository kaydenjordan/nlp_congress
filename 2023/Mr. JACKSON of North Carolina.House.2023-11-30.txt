 Mr. Speaker, I am proud to represent  Mecklenburg and Gaston Counties and just want to report back on some  bipartisan progress we have had lately.   We have a huge problem with fentanyl across the State, as we do  across the country, but we have new funding both to prevent overdoses  and to crack down on the organized crime that is trafficking fentanyl  into our communities.   We also got bipartisan support to close the weather radar gap which  exists in Charlotte. We have the largest weather radar gap in the  country. We are working on new technology to make sure we have more  accurate forecasts to keep people safe.   We are also working on the Junk Fee Prevention Act to save your  family money and prevent all of those fees that attach as we make  purchases online. It is a solid bipartisan start with more work to do.  I will keep you posted.                            ____________________
