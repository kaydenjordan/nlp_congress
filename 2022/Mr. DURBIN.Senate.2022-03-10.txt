 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, it is interesting to listen to the  reaction to the notion that we are going to stop our dependence on  Russian oil. I totally support that. The notion that I would buy  gasoline in my hometown and put it in my car or truck and somehow  subsidize what Vladimir Putin is doing in the rape of Ukraine is just  unacceptable. I believe there is not only a moral force but a political  force behind this. Morally, there is no way we are going to support  Putin. Politically, we have to come together with other nations and  make this as painful as possible on him, and stopping the import of  Russian oil is a move in that direction.  [[Page S1072]]    It is interesting that that was a bipartisan position which I joined  over the weekend--many of us did--Democrats and Republicans all saying:  Enough with the Russian oil. We will find other ways to keep America's  economy and cars and trucks moving without being dependent on Vladimir  Putin or subsidizing his war effort.   It was bipartisan--strong statements. In fact, there were as many  statements in support of this from the other side of the aisle as this  side of the aisle. Then what happened? Well, Dana Milbank, in this  morning's Washington Post, tells the story of what happened.   After President Biden made his announcement Tuesday, he said,  accurately:         ``Since Putin began his military buildup on Ukrainian       borders, just since then, [it is 2 weeks] the price of gas at       the pump in America went up 75 cents. And with this action       [the Americans will stop buying Russian oil] it's going to go       up further.'' [President Biden] dubbed it ``Putin's price       hike'' and said ``Russia is responsible.''    Since this was a bipartisan idea--stopping the flow of Russian oil  into the United States and subsidizing Putin's invasion of Ukraine--you  would think there would be bipartisan applause. The exact opposite  occurred.   In a Dana Milbank article, which I will ask to be part of the Record,  here is what was said by House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy:         ``These aren't Putin prices. They're President Biden's       prices''. . . . ``Gas prices started rising the day President       Biden took office--when he canceled the Keystone Pipeline and       halted new drilling on federal lands.''    It turns out that these assertions, by not just Kevin McCarthy but  other Republican leaders, are just not accurate. Nobody goes to the  task and assignment of actually backing up some of these facts like  real history and real numbers.   Here is what he says: Gas prices started rising on the day that Biden  took office.   Wrong.   They have been on an upward trend since bottoming out in April 2020,  at the start of the coronavirus pandemic. This is because of booming  demand during the recovery. So this notion that these are Biden gas  prices that just started going up magically after he was sworn--not  true.   Then I love this one on the Keystone XL Pipeline. How many times have  you heard on the floor of the Senate--maybe even this morning--that  canceling the Keystone Pipeline is the reason that gasoline prices have  gone up?   It turns out, according to Dana Milbank, that pipeline was only 10  percent completed when Biden canceled it. Its owners didn't even expect  to open it until next year, 2023, at the earliest.   Well, how about this one? You hear this over and over again from so  many Republicans: Biden halted new drilling on Federal lands, they say.  According to Milbank:         Wrong. After a temporary halt in new leases, Biden has       outpaced Trump in new drilling permits for public lands.    That has been reported by the Washington Post.   And as for Biden's shutdown of American energy, listen to this:         U.S. production has increased under Biden from 9.7 million       barrels a day to 11.6 million barrels. The number of oil rigs       operating was 172 in July of 2020. . . . Now, 519 are in       operation. U.S. production is forecast to set a record next       year.    Now, I don't doubt that stopping the Russian export of oil into the  United States is going to have a negative impact on gasoline prices. It  stands to reason. But there is an adjustment being made. The President  spoke to it last night, at a meeting we attended, where he is working  on other sources for America to make this hardship as little as  possible.   I ask unanimous consent that the Milbank article be printed in the  Record.    Mr. President, finally, an omnibus spending bill. For  months, there have been negotiations underway. The process has been  drawn out. As a member of the Appropriations Committee, there was a lot  of frustration. But soon we are going to vote on an omnibus spending  package, and we are going to do much more than keep the lights on in  our government.   In many ways, this spending package is a testament to the progress we  have  [[Page S1073]]  made during the past year of the Democratic majority. We have historic  funding to reduce the cost of living for working families. We get it;  American families are having a tough time making ends meet and are  living paycheck to paycheck. We take action in this omnibus spending  bill to start to address that challenge, and we create good jobs here  in America. Isn't it about time we focus on making things in America,  putting people to work with good jobs that supply them? And we need to  ensure families and children can access critical supplies, like  nutritious food and clean water that they need to survive.   This bill also provides more than $13 billion to the Ukrainians  fighting tooth and nail to defend their freedom. The Democratic Senate  caucus was fortunate last night to have over an hour and a half with  the President where he spoke candidly and informally about the  challenge we face in Ukraine. We have sent millions--maybe billions of  dollars--in assistance to those who are resisting Vladimir Putin's  barbaric attack on that nation, and we know that it is the right thing  to do. There are displays of courage by the Ukrainians the likes of  which we haven't seen in modern times. President Zelenskyy,  particularly, has impressed not only the United States but the world  with his singular courage.   The funds we are putting in this bill will help Ukrainians on the  frontline to continue to hold back Vladimir Putin, and on the ground,  in the air, through cyberspace, as well as helping our NATO allies in  the region. NATO has never been stronger--30 different countries  standing together, shoulder to shoulder, to stop Vladimir Putin's  invasion.   The omnibus spending package, also, makes crucial investments in  America at a time when we need it. It will fund research into the  technologies and innovations. Innovation is an American phenomenon.  Other countries do it, but I think we do it better. And whether we are  curing a disease, creating a new industry, or combating the climate  crisis, America needs to continue to lead the world in innovation. This  spending bill does that.   At a moment of great peril and uncertainty in the world, we are  coming together to defend our families, our security, our economy, and  our future. But we need to move fast. We need to send this package to  President Biden's desk quickly.   For the past 2 weeks, Russian mortars and missiles have been raining  down on innocent people and children throughout Ukraine. More than 400  individuals have been killed, with some estimates in the thousands of  deaths, believing that the current numbers are really an undercount.   Let me say one word while we are on the subject of Vladimir Putin and  war crimes. What more evidence do you need than the bombing of a  maternity hospital and the killing of mothers and infants? This man,  Putin, and his attack on the Ukrainian people, is not following any  standards or rules of decent conduct in any way whatsoever. I think it  is obvious.   Yesterday, the Russian airstrike that devastated the hospital complex  in Mariupol is an indication that we will never forget. A video  released shortly after the bombing showed a pregnant woman being  carried away on a stretcher, surrounded by pulverized cars in flames  and blackened trees covered in debris. It was a scene from a horror  movie--a horror created by Vladimir Putin.   Ukraine needs humanitarian, military, and economic aid today. That is  exactly what this omnibus bill will provide--billions of dollars in  military equipment and intelligence support and even more billions in  emergency supplies, food aid, healthcare, migration, and refugee  assistance.   This is how America stands by our fellow defenders of democracy at  their darkest hour, and Ukraine needs our help.   Here at home, the spending package includes a number of provisions  that will strengthen America and the 330 million Americans who live  here. We are bringing vital investments back to our home States. I  support the return of congressionally directed funding, because  Senators and Representatives know their States and know their districts  better than any Federal Agency personnel in Washington.   I am pleased to report that my colleague, Senator Tammy Duckworth,  and I worked to include $210 million in funding for Illinois projects  in this bill; and I will be ready to stand up and defend every single  one of them piece by piece, project by project, as a good investment in  the future of my State and our Nation.   This funding is going to help localities in Illinois launch important  infrastructure, access to healthcare, environmental conservation,  strengthening community violence prevention initiatives, supporting  nonprofits doing important work through our State, and much more.   We also do something that I have worked on personally for the last  several months and that I am particularly proud of; we are going to  reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act, known as VAWA. For months,  I have worked on this proposal with some amazing people in the U.S.  States Senate. On my side of the aisle, Senator Dianne Feinstein really  was one of the founders of this effort. On the Republican side of the  aisle, two women Senators have just been amazing--Lisa Murkowski of  Alaska and Joni Ernst of Iowa. We wouldn't have passed this bill and  included it in this appropriations measure were it not for their good  effort; and I thank them very much. They have helped to provide a  lifeline to survivors of sexual and domestic violence.    With this year's spending package, Congress will finally reauthorize  the Violence Against Women Act.   Additionally, the omnibus includes funding for a longstanding  priority of mine: research. These investments in research are going to  help keep America on the cutting edge of innovation when it comes to  lifesaving medical treatment, therapies, and so much more. For example,  this bill provides the National Institutes of Health with a significant  funding increase--this time, a $2.25 billion increase; that is more  than 5 percent. Five percent, I have kind of established--and, I hope,  with some of my colleagues--as the Holy Grail of increases each year in  research, particularly at the NIH. And with the good help of Republican  Senator--retiring Senator, unfortunately--Roy Blunt of Missouri, we  have managed to keep our promise. Lamar Alexander, now retired from the  Senate, was one of the leaders on this issue. And Patty Murray is  always there from the State of Washington. Well, we are going to keep  our word again this year.   Basic medical research, which the United States leads the world in,  is going to be enhanced with this improvement of more than 5 percent  increase in the budget of the National Institutes of Health.   I am particularly pleased that this omnibus bill includes a dedicated  $25 million for the implementation of the ACT for ALS bill, which  became law late last year. I want to thank Senator Coons for his  leadership on that issue. This funding will ensure that NIH can quickly  launch new initiatives to expand access to treatments for those  suffering from ALS.   Sadly, I am disappointed to say that the package does not include  COVID relief. We are at a turning point in this pandemic. New cases of  COVID are at their lowest rates in more than 7 months, praise the Lord;  and parents and families are just as anxious as can be to get their  kids back in school and life back to normal. These are promising  developments--from vaccines to better treatments--but we cannot pretend  that this pandemic is over for good, nor that it won't resurface in  terms of new variants. We need to prepare for whatever the coronavirus  might have in store for us. We need to make sure we have the  therapeutics and strengthen our capacity to detect new variants before  they become pandemic.   Given the dire urgency of the situation in Ukraine, I understand we  simply don't have time to go back to the bargaining table, but many of  us still believe that a toolkit to deal with future infections in COVID  or the next pandemic is absolutely essential. I can only hope the  Senate agrees with that on a bipartisan basis.   Two years into this pandemic, we know this virus is anything but  predictable. It operates like free-form jazz. Just when we think we  have found  [[Page S1074]]  our rhythm, the tempo gets turned upside down with a new variant. This  current lull in cases is the perfect moment to tune up our instruments,  keep our fingers sharp, and prepare for whatever is next.   Let me close by saying that, aside from the omission of additional  COVID relief, there is much to celebrate in this spending package. It  is an example of what Congress can achieve when it works together.   In the face of Russia's horrible invasion of Ukraine, an invasion  that has already created 2 million Ukrainian refugees, we are standing  together in defense of democracy. Russia's invasion is a tragic  illustration of one man's mania and of a conflict that will define the  21st century if we don't stop it in its tracks. Right now, Putin is  waging yesterday's war with yesterday's goal of reestablishing the  Soviet Union. He is sending ill-equipped teenagers in Russian Army  uniforms into Ukraine to terrorize innocent families and bomb children  in hospitals, all in some delusional effort that he is going to create  the new Russian Empire, with him being installed as the Czar of that  enterprise. He is not willing to face the challenges of the New World.  So he is trying to revive the Old World.   Autocrats like Putin live in fear of the future. Democracies like  America welcome it because we know that the future represents an  opportunity to build a better world for everyone. That is precisely why  President Zelenskyy and every Ukrainian is fighting to protect their  country. They are protecting, as well, the freedom to shape their own  future, not to have their future dictated by a man like Vladimir Putin.   With the spending package before the Senate, we can begin building  our own future as well--a future made in America.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I would like to call the attention of my  friend from Wyoming to a column today by Dana Milbank in The Washington  Post. I think it is really worth reading in light of some of the things  that have been said on the floor:         Canceling the Keystone XL pipeline caused gas prices to       rise?    That has been said. Well, it is wrong.         It was only 10 percent [finished] when Biden canceled it,       and its owners didn't expect to open it until 2023 at the       earliest.    It had no measurable impact--maybe no impact--on current oil prices.         [The assertion that] Biden halted new drilling on Federal       lands? Wrong. After a temporary halt in new leases, Biden has       outpaced Trump in new drilling permits for public lands.    The Post has reported that publicly.         As for Biden's ``shutdown of American energy,'' U.S.       production has increased under Biden from 9.7 million barrels       a day to 11.6 million barrels. The number of oil rigs       operating was at 172 in July 2020, E&E News reports. Now, 519       are in operation. U.S. production is forecast to set a record       next year.        What's holding back oil production--    according to Mr. Milbank--       isn't government policy. U.S. producers still have 4,400       wells already approved and drilled that are not yet       producing. They aren't drilling more because of a shortage of       workers and equipment and, particularly, investors' greed--    which, I think, the Senator from Maine was alluding to.   So some of the many things that have been said on the floor here as  gospel have turned out to be somewhat short of factual.   I would concede that I listened to the Senator's statement earlier  that this is a supply and demand issue at its heart. I do think there  is some gouging going on. Maybe I am wrong. The fact of the matter is  we are coming out of a recession--or at least out of a downturn in the  economy--from COVID-19, and there is an exceeding demand and not much  supply. The net result is inflationary, and prices have gone up at the  pump. In terms of this administration's being at war with the  production of oil in America, I don't think that case can be made.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to print the  following letter in the Congressional Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                        U.S. Senate,                                      Committee on the Judiciary,                                                     Washington, DC.      To the Secretary of the Senate:        PN1480, the nomination of Kenly Kiya Kato, of California,       to be United States District Judge for the Central District       of California, having been referred to the Committee on the       Judiciary, the Committee, with a quorum present, has voted on       the nomination as follows--        (1) on the question of reporting the nomination favorably       with the recommendation that the nomination be confirmed, 11       ayes to 11 noes; and        In accordance with section 3, paragraph (1)(A) of S. Res.       27 of the 117th Congress, I hereby give notice that the       Committee has not reported the nomination because of a tie       vote, and ask that this notice be printed in the Record       pursuant to the resolution.      Dick Durbin.                            ____________________     Madam President, on April 1, 2022, the Illinois State  Police--ISP--will mark 100 years since its founding. Its work and  dedication to making a safer Illinois is one of pride and integrity. I  want to take a moment to reflect on the ISP's century of service.   A little more than a century ago, Illinoisans no longer wanted to be  stuck in the mud. The year was 1921. The Department of Public Works and  Buildings reported nearly 1,100 miles of paved road in service, and  that number was growing. But the State was still filled with dirt  roads, and Illinois voters approved a new road system. The Age of the  Automobile led the State of Illinois to undertake one of the largest  building programs in the country. It also meant these roads and drivers  needed to be protected.   On April 1, 1922, the 52nd General Assembly approved the creation of  the Illinois Highway Maintenance Police to do just that. Today, they  are known as the Illinois State Police. The name has changed. The  mission has expanded. But the dedication of the ISP has not.   The ISP started out with just eight officers. Equipped with  mismatched and self-constructed World War I surplus uniforms and  motorcycles, they set out to enforce the weight laws of the State and  protect the growing highway system. The first headquarters was at the  residence of John J. Stack, the ISP's first director. The building also  was its first mechanic garage.   From these modest beginnings, the ISP would grow and evolve every  year. A year after its founding, the ISP increased to 100 officers. By  the end of the decade, it grew to 300. The ISP moved under different  departments and continued to take on new responsibilities and add to  its roster. And by the 1950s, more than 1,000 members were authorized  to conduct a variety of law enforcement activities, confronting a  rising tide of crime and controlled substance abuse. The ISP's duties  and size continued to advance through several reorganizations.   The ISP has become a nationally renowned law enforcement, public  safety, and criminal justice agency. Its responsibilities have only  grown with the challenges of times. Today, there are more than 1,800  sworn officers and more than 1,000 civilian employees. They protect  people on more than 2,100 interstate miles, nearly 16,000 miles of  State highways, and nearly 8,000 bridges.   These dedicated officers no longer focus on just the hard roads. From  aircraft support to helping with high-profile investigations, the ISP  is on the frontlines of law enforcement. In addition, it provides  oversight of the 9-1-1 systems and support for the statewide 9-1-1  advisory board. The ISP also is an important part of fighting the  opioid crisis.   Through all of this, the ISP has kept its focus on the mission of  promoting public safety and justice for every Illinois citizen. Its  officers and employees do this every day and with great sacrifice.  Dozens have given their lives for their fellow citizens. Thousands of  ISP recruits and cadets pursuing law enforcement careers throughout  Illinois have followed in their honorable footsteps at the Illinois  State Police Academy.   I want to congratulate the ISP on an incredible century of integrity,  service, and pride, and I thank the brave men and women of the ISP for  their unwavering service to Illinois. The second century of the ISP has  unlimited potential.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 3818         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Affordable College Textbook       Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) The high cost of college textbooks continues to be a       barrier for many students in achieving higher education.        (2) According to the College Board, during the 2021-2022       academic year, the average student budget for college books       and supplies at 4-year public institutions of higher       education was $1,240.        (3) The Government Accountability Office found that new       textbook prices increased 82 percent between 2002 and 2012       and that although Federal efforts to increase price       transparency have provided students and families with more       and better information, more must be done to address rising       costs.        (4) The growth of the internet has enabled the creation and       sharing of digital content, including open educational       resources that can be freely used by students, teachers, and       members of the public.        (5) According to the Student PIRGs, expanded use of open       educational resources has the potential to save students more       than a billion dollars annually.        (6) Federal investment in expanding the use of open       educational resources could significantly lower college       textbook costs and reduce financial barriers to higher       education, while making efficient use of taxpayer funds.        (7) Educational materials, including open educational       resources, must be accessible to the widest possible range of       individuals, including those with disabilities.       SEC. 3.

SEC. 6. GAO REPORT.         Not later than 3 years after the date of enactment of this       Act, the Comptroller General of the United States shall       prepare and submit a report to the Committee on Health,       Education, Labor, and Pensions of the Senate and the       Committee on Education and Labor of the House of       Representatives on the cost of textbooks to students at       institutions of higher education. The report shall       particularly examine--        (1) the implementation of section 133 of the Higher       Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1015b), as amended by       section 4, including--        (A) the availability of college textbook and open       educational resource information on course schedules;        (B) the compliance of publishers with applicable       requirements under such section; and        (C) the costs and benefits to institutions of higher       education and to students;        (2) the change in the cost of textbooks;        (3) the factors, including open textbooks, that have       contributed to the change of the cost of textbooks;        (4) the extent to which open textbooks are used at       institutions of higher education; and        (5) how institutions are tracking the impact of open       textbooks on instruction and student learning outcomes.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 3818         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Affordable College Textbook       Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) The high cost of college textbooks continues to be a       barrier for many students in achieving higher education.        (2) According to the College Board, during the 2021-2022       academic year, the average student budget for college books       and supplies at 4-year public institutions of higher       education was $1,240.        (3) The Government Accountability Office found that new       textbook prices increased 82 percent between 2002 and 2012       and that although Federal efforts to increase price       transparency have provided students and families with more       and better information, more must be done to address rising       costs.        (4) The growth of the internet has enabled the creation and       sharing of digital content, including open educational       resources that can be freely used by students, teachers, and       members of the public.        (5) According to the Student PIRGs, expanded use of open       educational resources has the potential to save students more       than a billion dollars annually.        (6) Federal investment in expanding the use of open       educational resources could significantly lower college       textbook costs and reduce financial barriers to higher       education, while making efficient use of taxpayer funds.        (7) Educational materials, including open educational       resources, must be accessible to the widest possible range of       individuals, including those with disabilities.       SEC. 3.
