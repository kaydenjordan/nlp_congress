 Madam Speaker, on November 2, 2019, the  communities of Olmsted Falls and Columbia Township of northeast Ohio  mourned the loss of firefighter Brett Wilson.   Brett was off duty the morning of October 27 when a car struck a  nearby utility pole, causing power lines to fall onto the roadway.  Brett and his girlfriend, without hesitation, ran to help the victims  of the accident.   Brett was electrocuted after coming into contact with the electrified  ground near the accident and passed away immediately. Both his  girlfriend and the driver were injured but, luckily, survived.   Our community honored Brett's heroism and life on Saturday, November  2, with a funeral procession held in his honor. Unsurprisingly, the  community lined the streets, waving American flags and holding their  hands over their hearts to honor the 2015 Olmsted Falls High School  graduate.   We are heartbroken by the loss of the Olmsted Falls resident and  Columbia Township firefighter, Brett Wilson. Brett, the son of an  Olmsted Township police officer, was a true hero and public safety  servant.   Brett will be deeply missed by his friends, family, and the  community. We thank him and his family for their service, and we keep  them in our prayers.                            ____________________
