 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman  from Ohio, our ranking member of the subcommittee, for all of his work  on this. I want to thank Congressman Sean Patrick Maloney from New  York, our chairman; Chairman DeFazio and the ranking member of the full  committee, Sam Graves, for all their work on this.   Mr. Speaker, this is a bill that is a bipartisan bill, and I do  appreciate everyone working together to make sure that we are doing the  right thing.   The Coast Guard, in many cases, is not held to the level of regard  and respect that they deserve.   Let's think about all of the things that the Coast Guard is  responsible for:   They are in charge of drug interdiction on our seas; they are in  charge of alien interdiction on our seas; they are in charge of  enforcing all U.S. laws on our waterways; securing our maritime  borders; defense readiness; port and coastal security issues; search  and rescue; marine safety; maintaining aids to navigation; icebreaking;  marine environmental protection; oil spill prevention and response; and  many other things.   Mr. Speaker, I often refer to them as the Swiss Army knife of the  Federal Government. They have an incredibly broad jurisdiction. These  are men and women who are serving their Nation on a daily basis.   I want to thank all of the leaders of this committee for the work in  the committee, where we took the Coast Guard Parity Act and added it to  this bill. The Coast Guard Parity Act recognized that the men and women  of the Coast Guard were treated differently from all of the other armed  services whenever the Federal Government goes into a shutdown.   Mr. Speaker, when the government shuts down, it is because Congress  failed to do its job together with an administration. The men and women  in the Coast Guard do not deserve to be punished.   There is something that is really important to point out: the men and  women of the Coast Guard can't just go say: Hey, I am going to go work  for another job. I am going to leave this one because I am not being  paid because the government is shut down. I am going to go work and do  this other job.   They are contractually obligated to continue doing their work and  their service for our Nation. So the Coast Guard Parity Act was added  to this bill in committee, and I am very disappointed that it was  pulled out. I know the chairman and the ranking member were both very  supportive of this.   We need to address this issue. Let me say it again: the men and women  of the Coast Guard are not responsible for when the government shuts  down, and they should not be penalized for it either. I hope that we  can continue to work together to solve this.   But going back, Mr. Speaker, the Coast Guard does an incredible job  in an incredibly broad mission. This bill helps to recapitalize an  antiquated network or system of equipment, antiquated vessels that have  lasted well beyond their intended service life. It helps to ensure that  we can authorize the appropriate vessels, whether it is the national  security cutter, the offshore patrol cutter, the fast response cutter,  and the helos and winged aircraft that the men and women of the Coast  Guard depend on on a daily basis.   We know that the other side--the drug traffickers and the alien  smugglers and others--are using new and updated technology. We need to  make sure that we continue to provide the men and women of the Coast  Guard with the upper hand with the best technology and with the best  equipment to deal with their daily mission of protecting our Nation and  enforcing all laws on the seas of the United States.  [[Page H7287]]    Mr. Speaker, again, I want to thank Mr. DeFazio, Mr. Graves, Mr.  Gibbs, and Mr. Maloney for all of the work that they have done to  ensure this bill moves forward. It is a bipartisan bill, and I urge  adoption.                                time  1345
