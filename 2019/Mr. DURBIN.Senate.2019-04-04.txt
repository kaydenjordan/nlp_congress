Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, yesterday in Warren, IL, a small town on  the Illinois-Wisconsin border, mourners from near and far lined the  streets and packed the town's high school to say good-bye to a local  hero. They came to honor and bid farewell to an Illinois State trooper,  Brooke Jones-Story, who was killed in the line of duty last Thursday.   Trooper Jones-Story had pulled over a truck a little after noon and  was inspecting it on the shoulder of U.S. Highway 20 in Freeport, just  west of Rockford, IL, when a semitrailer crashed into her squad car and  the truck she had stopped. The squad car and truck she had pulled over  burst into flames. Trooper Jones-Story, a devoted public servant, 11- year veteran of the Illinois State police, wife, stepmother, daughter,  sister, lifelong fan of the Chicago Cubs, fan of Disney movies, animal  rescuer, and a CrossFit workout enthusiast, died instantly. She was 34  years old. No one else was injured.   Sadly and unbelievably, Trooper Jones-Story was the second of three  Illinois State troopers who have died this year after being struck by  vehicles on the sides of roads and highways.   Three State troopers in Illinois were killed in less than 3 months.  All told, 16 Illinois State Troopers have been struck by vehicles so  far this year, several suffering serious injuries.   Let me tell you about the other two heroes we lost.   Just 2 days after Trooper Jones-Story died, Trooper Jerry Ellis was  killed by a wrong-way driver near Libertyville, IL.   It happened at 3:25 in the morning. The driver was headed in the  wrong direction on Interstate 94 in Green Oaks when he hit Trooper  Ellis's squad car head-on. The driver who caused the crash was also  killed.   Jerry Ellis was 36 years old. He had been an Illinois State Trooper  for 11 years. Before that he had served his country in the U.S. Army in  Iraq.   He and his wife Stacy are the parents of two little girls, Kaylee,  age 7, and Zoe, age 5.   Chris Lambert, in fact, was the first Illinois State trooper killed  this year. It was January 12. He had just finished his shift and was on  his way home when he stopped during a snowstorm to help at the scene of  a three-car accident on Interstate 294 in Northbrook.   Another driver, apparently trying to avoid the pileup, swerved onto  the left shoulder of the highway, where Trooper Lambert was standing,  and hit him and killed him.   Trooper Lambert was 34 years old. He, too, was an Army veteran. He  served in Iraq and Haiti. He had been with the Illinois State Police  since 2013.   He and his wife Halley were parents of a 14-month-old daughter,  Delaney. The driver who hit him has been charged with felony reckless  homicide.   What makes the deaths of these three public servants--these three  heroes--even harder to bear is that our State of Illinois passed a law  nearly 20 years ago that was supposed to make roads safer for police  and other emergency responders.   It is called the ``Move Over'' Law or Scott's Law. It was named after  the Chicago Fire Department lieutenant, Scott Gillen, who was killed in  2000 by a drunken driver while working on a crash scene on the Chicago  freeway.   Scott's Law requires motorists to slow down, and, if possible, move  over when they see a parked squad car, fire engine, or ambulance with  flashing lights. If you can't change lanes, slow down and proceed  cautiously. That is what Scott's Law says.   It was expanded in 2017 to include all vehicles stopped with hazard  lights on, including tow trucks. Violators can lose their license and  face stiff fines--up to $10,000.   Every State has some form of Scott's Law. Police and other first  responders in many States are working to draw attention to these laws  and to enforce them.   I believe the Federal Government needs to do more. In the upcoming  surface transportation reauthorization bill, I will be working not only  to increase funding for highway safety grants to provide States with  the resources they need to better enforce these laws but also to  encourage people all across America to be sensitive to the men and  women who are serving us in public capacities in law enforcement and  other responsibilities. They deserve our respect and our caution.   Despite these measures, Illinois State Police have seen a troubling  increase in incidents in which a squad car with its lights flashing has  been hit by a passing car. In 2016, there were 5 such incidents; in  2017, 12; and last year, 8. Just a little over 3 months into this year,  already there have been 16 such incidents, with 3 young troopers dead.   Two days ago, April 1, was Illinois State Trooper Day--a day set  aside each year to honor the dedicated men and women of the Illinois  State Police.   As Brendan Kelly, now the acting director of the Illinois State  Police said: ``In 97 years, 69 men and women of the Illinois State  Police bravely put on their uniforms to serve the citizens of this  State and never returned home.''   But this is the first time in 66 years that the Illinois State Police  have lost three state troopers in 1 year, and the year is only a few  months over.   State police are uncertain what is driving this deadly trend, but  Lucy Kuelper--and I would like to show you her photograph here.    Lucy Kuelper, a sixth grader from rural Rio, IL, hopes  that she may have a way to stop the terrible losses.   I thank the Senator from New York.   Lucy is just 12 years old, but she knows the fear of watching someone  you love go to work and the worry that you might never see them again.  Lucy's dad, her hero, John Kuelper, is also a State trooper.   When Lucy learned about the number of State troopers who had been hit  and killed recently, she asked her dad: What can I do?   Together, they came up with an idea. With help from her mom, Jessica,  Lucy created a Facebook page to raise awareness about Scott's Law. She  calls her page the Move Over Project.   She posted the photo, shown here, of herself standing next to her  dad, holding up a sign that says hashtag ``move over . . . for my  DAD.''   She asked other loved ones in the police force and other emergency  services to post similar photos with hashtag ``move over for . . .''  and fill in the blank.   In 5 days, Lucy's Facebook page received more than 14,000 ``likes.''  People have sent in photos from all over the country. They want people  to move over for their dads, moms, sisters, brothers, uncles, and  friends. There are photos of firefighters, police officers, EMTs, and  tow truck drivers standing next to spouses, children, infants, parents,  friends, and pets.   This week, the State of Illinois Commission on Volunteerism and  Community Service honored Lucy with its Volunteer of the Week Award.  She deserved it, but Lucy says the only reward she wants is for people  to follow the law and move over, so her dad and others like him who do  dangerous jobs will be able to come home to their families at the end  of the day.   I want to thank Lucy for her efforts in starting the Move Over  Project. Look at the faces and the families involved. Remember them the  next time you see an emergency vehicle on a highway with its lights  flashing parked along a roadway. Move over and save lives.   I yield the floor.    I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Booker),  the Senator from California (Ms. Harris), and the Senator from Vermont  (Mr. Sanders) are necessarily absent.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 1036         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Affordable College Textbook       Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) The high cost of college textbooks continues to be a       barrier for many students in achieving higher education.        (2) According to the College Board, during the 2017-2018       academic year, the average student budget for college books       and supplies at 4-year public institutions of higher       education was $1,240.        (3) The Government Accountability Office found that new       textbook prices increased 82 percent between 2002 and 2012       and that although Federal efforts to increase price       transparency have provided students and families with more       and better information, more must be done to address rising       costs.        (4) The growth of the internet has enabled the creation and       sharing of digital content, including open educational       resources that can be freely used by students, teachers, and       members of the public.        (5) According to the Student PIRGs, expanded use of open       educational resources has the potential to save students more       than a billion dollars annually.        (6) Federal investment in expanding the use of open       educational resources could significantly lower college       textbook costs and reduce financial barriers to higher       education, while making efficient use of taxpayer funds.        (7) Educational materials, including open educational       resources, must be accessible to the widest possible range of       individuals, including those with disabilities.       SEC. 3.
