 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Mr. Victor Garza and  to wish him a happy 100th birthday.   Victor Garza is a World War II veteran who is devoted to his family,  his faith, and service to this country. He joined the United States  Navy at the age of 22 and served in the Pacific theater during World  War II.   During his service, he worked as a heavy equipment operator in the  Seabee construction battalion and was stationed in Japan where he  assisted with efforts to free prisoners of war.   After his service to his country, he devoted himself to his  community, building homes and businesses across Victoria, Texas, and  being an active member of the VFW and the CWV. He also devoted himself  to his family, raising seven children with Amalia, his wife of 74  years.   Victor is a true hero and an example to all of us of what it means to  be an American. I am proud to honor him today and hope he has a  wonderful 100th birthday.                            ____________________
