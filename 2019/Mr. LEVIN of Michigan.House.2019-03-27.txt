 Madam Chair, as vice chairman of the Committee  on Education and Labor, I am so proud that our committee made it a top  priority this year to bring the Paycheck Fairness Act to the floor, and  I congratulate Chairman Scott for his leadership.   This is an issue where the evidence could not be clearer. In  Michigan's Ninth District, which I represent, for example, women's  median annual wage is more than $10,000 lower than men's. I don't care  how many jobs are created or how many women are working, we need to do  something to, at long last, make women's pay equal to men's.   If we allow this gap to persist, we are not just telling women they  aren't worth as much as men. We are doing real damage to entire  families and to our economy. Failure to tackle the pay gap isn't just  discriminatory; it is shockingly shortsighted.   The Paycheck Fairness Act will finally align our treatment of gender  discrimination with other established antidiscrimination policies. This  is an opportunity to realize equal pay for equal work that we simply  cannot afford to miss.   I regret that my good friends across the aisle did not introduce a  single bill to strengthen the Equal Pay Act across the 20 years they  held the gavel in this Chamber. I hope they will join us today to lift  up America's women and families to full equality at long last.   Finally, I include in the Record a strong letter of support for H.R.  7 from the AFL-CIO.                                                        AFL-CIO,                                                     March 25, 2019.        Dear Representative: The AFL-CIO strongly urges your       support of the Paycheck Fairness Act (H.R 7) when it comes to       the House floor this week.        The Paycheck Fairness Act is a long overdue remedial       measure that responds to the demonstrated inadequacies of the       1963 Equal Pay Act. Although the Equal Pay Act made it       illegal for employers to pay unequal wages to male and female       employees who perform the same work, wage disparities between       men and women persist in both the private and public sectors,       at every educational level, across the country. Women working       full time are paid only 80 cents for every dollar paid to       men, and this gap is greater for women of color. While       belonging to a union is the surest way to guarantee equal pay       on the job--unionized women earn some 27 percent more than do       their non-union counterparts--the Paycheck Fairness Act would       provide new effective tools to close the wage gap.        The Paycheck Fairness Act provides targeted remedies       designed to update the 1963 Equal Pay Act. It requires       employers to demonstrate that wage gaps between men and women       doing the same work truly result from factors unrelated to       gender. It prohibits employers' use of prior salary history       in setting pay for new hires and employer retaliation against       workers who discuss their pay with coworkers. Last, H.R. 7       brings Equal Pay Act remedies and class action procedures       into conformance with those available for other civil rights       claims, and strengthens the government's ability to identify       and remedy systematic wage discrimination by requiring       employers to report pay data to the EEOC.        When women endure pay discrimination, entire families       suffer. We urge you to support final passage of the Paycheck       Fairness Act (S. 84), and to oppose any amendment that would       weaken this important and long overdue legislation.            Sincerely,                                                    William Samuel,                                      Director, Government Affairs.     Madam Chair, while I believe belonging to a  union is the surest way to guarantee equal pay on the job, the Paycheck  Fairness Act will provide effective new tools to close the wage gap.
