 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of House  Democrats and their efforts today to protect women and their  fundamental reproductive rights.   In my home State of Texas, more than 50,000 women had an abortion  last year. These are women who made an extremely personal and intimate  healthcare decision based on what is best for them, their families, and  their future.   Yet, MAGA Republicans have never wanted these women to have these  fundamental rights, and they aim to strip away their freedoms.   But to all the women and the families who may be scared and are  listening across America right now, please hear me now:   House Democrats have your back. We trust women. We are fighting for  you. We always have, and we always will.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, it has been interesting to listen  to  [[Page H6716]]  the debate. I feel like it is a rerun of the Judiciary Committee, which  we all serve on.   I think we should tell the folks across the aisle to just spare us  the indignation over this political violence because, as the manager so  aptly characterized, they wrote the book on it. I can think of at least  one doctor who was murdered and, I think, many others injured by  bombings and harassment. It is just beyond the pale what has happened  to abortion providers in the last decade.   I want to get back to appropriations because, Madam Speaker, that is  really what I came to talk about.   The FY23 appropriations minibus bill is something that I support. I  am really pleased that many of the projects that were included in my  request will come to fruition.   One of the six projects included in the bill is $4 million for the  Target Hunger Campus and Education Center, which will focus on hunger  prevention and nutrition education for my constituents.   Also included is $3 million for affordable housing construction  projects in my district for Avenue Community Development, which, of  course, will help us resolve some of the homelessness issues.   This bill also includes a request for almost $3 million for  enhancements to the University of Houston's Technology Bridge.    Madam Speaker, those are just three of the 15  projects that were funded. I think that when they talk about cutting  and inflation, is this what they want to do, to stop a hunger project  in my district? Do they want to stop making sure our kids get a good  education? Just what is it they are doing?   Finally, Madam Speaker, just quickly, I also support, of course, the  bill to protect a woman's right to birth control and the right of same- sex couples to marriage. So, Madam Speaker, there are so many reasons  to support this rule and the underlying bills.                                time  1100     Mr. Speaker, I just want to say that I think we  do understand what we are doing here today; and what we are doing is  supporting people's right to love and their equal protection under the  law, plain and simple.   Extreme, MAGA Republicans continue to weaponize our government  institutions, turning them against the people they are called to  protect.   The Respect for Marriage Act will make marriage equality the law of  the land.   During Pride Month, the extreme Texas GOP openly declared, openly  declared, at their convention their homophobia and bigotry as part of  their agenda. They are going as far as labelling same-sex couples as  having an abnormal lifestyle.   We will not allow this rightwing obsession to impose their personal  religious views on people's private lives to go any further.   To my colleagues across the aisle, and to the Texas GOP, marrying the  person you love is not abnormal. It is, frankly, none of your business.   Abnormal is your obsession with what other people do in their private  lives and in their homes.   ``Love is love.'' ``Amor es amor.''
