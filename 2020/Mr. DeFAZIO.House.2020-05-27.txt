 Mr. Speaker, October 2001, under the shadow of 9/11,  with the House office buildings evacuated because of the threat of  anthrax, a bill authored by Chairman Jim Sensenbrenner and the Bush  White House was brought before the House. It was called the USA PATRIOT  Act.   Now, who could, in the shadow of 9/11, vote against anything called  the USA PATRIOT Act? Well, I did, as did 66 other Members; 3  Republicans, 62 Democrats, and 1 Independent, because of the  unbelievably, unconstitutionally broad powers that would be granted for  surveillance of all the American people in myriad ways.   Now, there wasn't even a copy of the bill available. I came to the  floor, and I said: Can I have a copy of the bill? They said: Sorry,  there is only one. It is on the Republican side. I said: Well, it is  not the Senate. I can't filibuster, but I will make it a long day with  the adjournment votes. Get me a copy. They printed out a copy, it was  hot off the Xerox. I got rushed on this side by Members of the  Judiciary Committee who ostensibly authored the bill to try and find  out what the heck was in it, but people still voted for it. The abuses  that have come under this are myriad and well-documented.   Now, I credit Zoe Lofgren for trying to amend the most egregious  section, 215, and my colleague, Ron Wyden from Oregon. Senator Wyden  almost succeeded in the Senate, short one vote. And Zoe tried on the  last reauthorization and this one to amend that. Unfortunately, she was  pressured by and forced to, since otherwise they would block her  amendment, to water down her revisions to section 215.   Now, Senator Wyden is opposed, as are others. What is section 215?  Unbelievably broad, warrantless, intrusive, internet searches of  everything you look at, browse online. For what purpose? Who knows?  What are they going to do with that information? Well, maybe they are  going to apply an algorithm and find something. They gather so much  data, they don't know what to do with it.                                time  1030    What is the legal standard? A presumption of relevance to an  investigation. Isn't that a laughable standard? You could presume  relevance to virtually anything in the world at any time.   So this bill, even if that amendment should pass, even if the bill  comes up today--it is questionable whether it will. We now have  government by tweet on that side of the aisle.   Trump says jump; they jump. And last night, Trump said he is against  this, even though it has a special provision in the bill for President  Trump because of the Carter Page abuses.   It says the ``Attorney General,'' in quotes--by the way, that means  any senior official in the Justice Department--would have to sign off  on targeting Federal officials or candidates for office.   First off, why should those people be exempt if they are engaged in  terrorist activities or presumptive relevance of terrorist activities?   But, again, ``Attorney General,'' with this laughable clown in the  Attorney General's Office who jumps even higher than they do when the  President tweets, I don't think so. Just think of how they could use  that politically, not for intelligence purposes.   It does nothing to reform section 702, which is incidental backdoor  accumulation of data. There are many, many documented abuses of section  202.   It does finally do away with what was revealed by Mr. Snowden, the  massive gathering of all phone records.   Again, what are they going to do with it? Hundreds of millions of  records, no effective algorithms, no way to figure out what it was  about. It was useless, operationally, as analyzed by numerous  commissions and others, but there was still massive compliance and  errors.   Even the NSA said: No, we don't want that anymore; we can't do  anything with it. But the administration asked that it be continued.  This bill doesn't continue it, one of the few merits of this so-called  reform bill.   This bill does not deserve passage. It does not undo the damage that  was created in the shadow of 9/11, to the ignorance of most Members of  Congress who voted for it.                            ____________________
