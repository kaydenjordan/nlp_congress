 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate  America's longest living President and one of Georgia's finest,  President Jimmy Carter, who is turning 99 years young.   On Sunday October 1, I had plans to be home in Georgia for this  birthday celebration, but the looming Republican government shutdown  has me here in D.C. doing the work for the people.   President Carter has led a distinguished life, winning a Nobel Peace  Prize, eradicating diseases, and uplifting the lives of millions of  marginalized people.   He would probably say that his most important accomplishments are his  Christian faith as a member of Maranatha Baptist Church; marrying his  beloved wife, Rosalynn; raising a strong family; building houses with  Habitat for Humanity; and being one of the best peanut farmers in the  land.   For me, President Carter is an inspiration. My husband, Leslie, and I  even named our son Carter after this great President. I strive every  day to make sure that my Carter Cakes has the same humility and  commitment to service as his namesake.   The best birthday gift that President Carter could receive from us  would be us all working together to make the world a better place for  the most marginalized, and we can do that by following President  Carter's example and building on his legacy--starting with keeping the  government open for the American people.   Mr. Speaker, I wish President Carter a happy 99th birthday.                            ____________________
