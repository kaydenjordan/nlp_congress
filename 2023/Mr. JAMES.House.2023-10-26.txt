 Madam Chair, this is not political theater, far from it.  This is accountability to the American people.   I rise today in support of this amendment to reduce the salary of  Secretary Granholm to $1 because I cannot make her pay us back.   The job of the Secretary of Energy is to secure American energy  independence, but she is not securing American energy independence. She  is depleting it, and she should be held accountable to the people for  failing to deliver on her job.   You see, Madam Speaker, before Ms. Granholm was Energy Secretary, she  promoted the same failed policies while serving as Governor of Michigan  and presided over what is now known as Michigan's Lost Decade, a legacy  that we are still paying for at home.   She presided over the mass exodus of our jobs and our children from  our State. She presided over the crippling of our economy, foreclosures  of so many of our homes, and the closing of our businesses.   She embarrassed us with the RASCO fiasco when she offered $9 million  in tax credits to promote a job program that actually went to a  convicted embezzler who lived out of a trailer.   You know what she did when she was done gutting and embarrassing our  State, Madam Speaker? She left. She got on a plane and headed for  California where she took a faculty position at Berkeley while leaving  Michiganders at home struggling in the snow.   Madam Chair, while this amendment today is not about her time in  Michigan, past behavior is the best indicator of future performance.   We should be appalled but not surprised by the same malpractice,  malfeasance, and mistreatment of the office that she assumes currently,  and she has inflicted serious pain on the  [[Page H5137]]  American people and jeopardizes our American independence moving  forward.   Since this administration took office, Madam Chair, we have gone from  energy independence to energy reliance on dictators and despots around  the world.   Secretary Granholm sold off our Strategic Petroleum Reserve and sold  out Americans and our national security. All the worse, she went on  television and laughed in our faces just before gas prices hit their  peak.   The American people's pain is their plan, Madam Chair. They are  making gas unaffordable and are trading away our national resources to  China, our number one adversary, all so they can implement their pipe  dream of forced EV transition. I won't call it treason, but many in my  district have.   The policies she is seeking to impose, the billions of dollars in  penalties for our autos through her EV mandates would crater the number  one industry in Michigan.   We do not fear the future, but we demand to be a part of it. Madam  Chair, the consequence of her failures is the reason folks in my  district are standing on a picket line right now.   The unrealistic, untimely, and unjust forced EV mandates she supports  is building the Chinese middle class on the backs of middle-class  families in Michigan and around America.   It is time for her to pay, and Congress is holding her accountable.  This is the essence of what the Article I branch of government should  be doing. It is holding an out-of-control administration accountable to  the people. She failed in Michigan, and we will not let her fail  America.   This is a warning to the American people that policies that hurt them  will stop with the 118th Congress.                                time  1400    These policies have not worked anywhere. They have tried and they  have failed. In the real world, failure means your employer takes your  pay. This town needs to start operating a little bit more like the real  world.   Madam Chair, that is why I support this resolution, and I encourage  all of my colleagues to support it as well.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
