 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this resolution  that strongly condemns the dramatic rise of anti-Semitism both here in  our Nation and abroad.   Last week, I had the privilege and the honor, frankly, of speaking  with Amir Ohana, who is the Speaker of the Knesset. We discussed a lot  of things. We talked about how life has changed not only in Israel but  around the world since Hamas' horrific and brutal terrorist attack  against Israelis on October 7. We also talked about how we have seen an  absolute explosion of anti-Semitic incidents, attacks, and harassment  in Israel, here in our own Nation, and across the world.   Mr. Speaker, two interesting statistics, if I can: According to the  Anti-Defamation League, since the Hamas massacre on October 7, anti- Semitic incidents around our Nation have increased over 400 percent  compared to the same time period last year.                                time  1730    The second statistic, Mr. Speaker, more Jews were murdered on October  7 than on any other single day since the Holocaust. Let that sink in.   We have seen Members of this very body repeat blatantly anti-Semitic  rhetoric and spread lies about Israel and her right to exist. Let me be  absolutely clear: Such hate has no place in the Halls of Congress nor  in our national discourse.   It is our fundamental responsibility as leaders and as Members of  Congress to condemn and fight these horrific acts of hate and  discrimination against the Jewish community.   That is why I am proud to work with my colleague, Congressman Max  Miller, to introduce this critical resolution to condemn and denounce  all instances of domestic and global anti-Semitism.   A few months ago, Mr. Speaker, I had the opportunity--really, the  privilege--to take a group of people through the United States  Holocaust Memorial Museum.   A lot of us have been there. It is not too far away from here in the  Capitol where we are standing. That museum serves not only as a  reminder of the atrocities that took place during the Holocaust, but it  also serves as a stark reminder that we can never forget the horrors of  the Holocaust and that we, as leaders, have an obligation and a duty to  make sure that it never happens again.   For these reasons, I urge all of my colleagues on both sides of the  aisle to support this very simple, yet critical, resolution.   It is absolutely important that we send a clear and firm message to  the world that the United States House of Representatives stands  shoulder to shoulder with the Jewish community here in the United  States and abroad.   Mr. Speaker, as Jews around the world celebrate Hanukkah very soon in  the next few days, we should remember the words of Rabbi Lord Jonathan  Sacks.   He said: ``Hanukkah tells us not to curse the darkness, but instead  to bring light to the world. It tells us to fight back and not be  afraid.''   We should truly heed those words. I thank my colleagues for  supporting this resolution.
