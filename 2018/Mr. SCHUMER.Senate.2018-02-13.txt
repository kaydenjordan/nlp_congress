 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, last night the Senate took up a neutral  bill on immigration to begin debate on legislation to protect the  Dreamers and provide additional border security. It is a debate upon  which the lives of the Dreamers depend. They were brought into this  country as kids through no fault of their own. For many of them,  America is the only country they remember. They learn in our schools,  they work at our companies, they serve in our military, and they are  stitched into the very fabric of our Nation.   This week we have the opportunity to offer these Dreamers protection  and the chance to finally become Americans, and this is supported in  every State throughout the Nation. Eighty percent of Americans--a  majority of Democrats, Independents, and Republicans all support  allowing the Dreamers to stay here and become American citizens. We  have an opportunity to improve border security, as well, which is  something that also has broad support.   Both Democrats and Republicans, in large numbers, have supported both  helping the Dreamers become Americans and protecting our borders. That  should be the focus of all our energies--finding a bipartisan  compromise that would achieve those things and pass the Senate.   We can put together a bipartisan plan here in the Senate and sell it  to the Nation. I know that there are other forces swirling around. That  was true of the budget deal, but Leader McConnell and I put together an  agreement. The Senate voted for it in large numbers, the House passed  it with significant support from both parties, and the President signed  it. We can do the same thing on immigration. The Senate can take the  lead once again in a bipartisan way that can get 60 votes and move the  Nation forward.   We all know Americans in every State--your State, Mr. President, my  State, and every State--who ask: Why can't you work together and get  something done? Well, this is a very difficult issue and we are all  aware of that, but we can get something done. We are on the verge, but  it is still hard. We are not there yet, but we can get something done.  Let's work toward that.                  Infrastructure and the President's Budget    Mr. President, on another matter entirely, the White House released  its long-awaited infrastructure plan. After promising a trillion-dollar  infrastructure plan to build ``gleaming new roads, bridges, highways,  railways, and waterways all across our land,'' President Trump's plan  turned out to be less than half a loaf. Instead of a trillion dollars  or more of investment, the Trump infrastructure plan includes only $200  billion in Federal investment, relying on State and local governments  and private entities to pony up the rest of the cash.   There is a great irony that on the same day the President put out the  $200 billion infrastructure plan, the administration's budget slashed  well over $200 billion in existing infrastructure investments that we  do make every year. While the Trump infrastructure plan gives with one  hand, the Trump budget takes more away than is given. That doesn't show  much of a commitment to do infrastructure. That shows sort of a  schizophrenic administration.   Even on the side where they try to give, the Trump infrastructure  plan has a lot of flaws. Already cash-strapped State and local  governments would likely have to raise taxes on their constituents to  fund new investments. Meanwhile, private entities will seek projects  with the quickest return on investment. If you have a big, large resort  with a lot of wealthy people going there, yes, a private person might  build a road, but if you have a bridge in Shreveport or in Rochester, a  middle-sized city or anywhere else in the country, no private investor  is going to invest in that. There won't be any money for it. Large  parts of the country will be left out. And who will be left out most?  Rural America, which lacks the population or traffic to attract  investment, would get shut out. They have a set-aside for rural  America, but it is not close to enough--not close to enough.   Worse, the Trump infrastructure plan would mean a slew of tolls-- Trump tolls--from one end of America to the other. Large developers are  going to want to make a quick buck on new investment, and who is going  to pay for  [[Page S892]]  it? The average, middle-class, working-class American who drives and  pays the tolls.   These companies--let's face it; everyone knows this--are not going to  lend money to build a road and not get any return. When the Federal  Government puts money into roads, they don't ask for a return, other  than jobs created building the roads and jobs created because new  companies, new housing, and other new things will locate alongside the  road. It does pay for itself through what the economists would call  external costs--externalities. But the companies that invest, the big  financiers who invest will want an immediate return, and that means  tolls--tolls, tolls, and more tolls. More tolls may not sound like a  big deal to the bankers and financiers who put together Trump's plan,  but they sure mean a lot to working Americans who commute on these  roads every day.   I would remind people that the Federal Government has invested in  roads and infrastructure for centuries, not decades. Henry Clay, a  Whig--the predecessor party of the Republican Party--first proposed it  in the 1820s and 1830s. Dwight Eisenhower, a Republican President,  expanded our Federal highway system dramatically with huge positive  effect in large parts of America. Ronald Reagan never cut  infrastructure. He cut a lot of other things, but not infrastructure.  He knew it was important. So why are we making this 180-degree, hairpin  turn right now? It doesn't make sense.   There are other problems with the Trump plan. What about ``Buy  American''? Everyone says they are for ``Buy American.'' The Trump  infrastructure plan unwinds ``Buy American'' provisions. If we are  going to rebuild American infrastructure, let's do it with American  steel, American concrete, and American labor.   This is the kind of plan you would expect from a President who  surrounds himself with industry insiders, financiers, people in Wall  Street who look at infrastructure as an investment to be made by  corporations. But infrastructure has always been something the  government invests in because the benefits aren't immediately apparent  to business. A road might not generate short-term profits unless it is  dotted with tolls, but a factory might locate nearby and bring new jobs  to the area. The private sector might not build high-speed internet all  the way out to the house at the end of the road if there isn't a  profit, but that family is just as deserving as every other family in  America to be part of the internet, which is a necessity these days,  just as electricity was in the thirties when Franklin Roosevelt  proposed connecting all rural homes to the electric grid. The private  sector then and the private sector now should not pick and choose. It  will leave large parts of America out. That is why the Trump  infrastructure plan falls short.   For almost our entire history, the consensus in Congress and the  White House was that the government should lead the way on  infrastructure. As I have mentioned, Republicans Henry Clay, Dwight  Eisenhower, and Ronald Reagan believed that we need investment in  infrastructure. Democrats still believe it.   I hope that our mutual desire to fix the Nation's crumbling  infrastructure without shifting the burden onto taxpayers and local  governments motivates us to put the President's proposal to the side,  as we did with the budget, and come up with one ourselves.   Mr. President, yesterday, the Trump administration delivered a budget  to Congress that will drastically slash funding for education,  environmental protection, transportation, Medicare, and Medicaid. Yes,  folks, despite the President's promise that he would never cut  Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security, he is cutting two out of the  three in this budget--or so he proposes.   Even with all those cuts, though, the Trump budget actually increases  the deficit. Even in the realm of budgetary magic, the Trump budget  pulls a trick so absurd that it would even make Houdini blush: Cut  Medicare, cut Medicaid, and yet increase the deficit. How the heck did  that happen? Only in the world of President Trump and his budgeteers.   Just weeks after jamming through a partisan tax bill that would  greatly benefit big corporations and the wealthy while adding $1.5  trillion to the deficit, the Trump administration is now proposing a  massive curtailment of the programs that help almost everyone else in  America and, at the same time, increasing the deficit--a bad magic  trick, very bad.   After an entire campaign's worth of promises to protect Medicaid and  Medicare, President Trump proposes to cut deeply into both of them.  After calling education the civil rights issue of our time in his first  address to the Congress, President Trump proposes a 10-percent cut in  education funding. Ask your school boards throughout America how they  feel about that. Alongside his long-delayed infrastructure plan,  President Trump proposes to cut transportation funding by nearly one- fifth--a decrease so large it would result in a net cut in  infrastructure funding even if you add in the President's new  infrastructure bill.   On the heels of a massive corporate tax cut, this budget is the very  inverse of economic populism. It cuts back from nearly every program  that helps the middle class and those struggling to reach it. The Trump  budget is the encapsulation of an administration that promises populism  but delivers plutocracy where the rich and powerful get the tax cuts,  but everyone else just gets cut out.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, I  appreciate the process the majority leader agreed to this week, but the  proposal he just offered does not address the underlying issues of this  debate and why we are here. It does not address Dreamers, nor does it  address border security.   As I said this morning, the Senate must focus on finding a bipartisan  solution that addresses those two issues--Dreamers and border security.  Rather than the partisan proposal offered by the Republican leader, I  suggest we consider two proposals inside the scope of the debate, one  for each side. Let the Republicans offer the President's plan, in the  form of legislation carried by the Senators from Iowa and Arkansas,  which the leader supports, and the Democrats will offer the bipartisan  Coons-McCain bill--narrow legislation that protects the Dreamers,  boosts border security, and adds resources for immigration courts.   Each is the opening foray--one for Democrats, one for Republicans-- and can start the process and let us know where we stand. Our  legislation is ready to go, and we would be happy to vote as soon as  the Republicans have their proposal drafted and ready for an amendment  vote.   To begin this debate as the Republican leader suggests would be  getting off on the wrong foot--unrelated to DACA and very partisan.  Respectfully, I suggest we move to the bills offered by Senator  Grassley and Senator Coons instead. Let's get this debate started on  the right foot.   So I object to the leader's request.
