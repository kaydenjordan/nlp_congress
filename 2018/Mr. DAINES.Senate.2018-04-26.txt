 Madam President, this week, I have the honor of  recognizing Andy Anderson for his over 60 years of commitment to being  the go-to barber in Judith Basin County.   Andy grew up in Harlowton but spent a few years in Two Dot, where his  parents worked as ranchers. After turning 17, Andy went to barber  school in Washington but swiftly moved back to Montana following the  training. He opened his first barber shop in Stanford and shortly  thereafter opened a second in Denton. In December of 2017, Andy  celebrated his 60th year as a barber.   Andy believes strongly in giving back to his community. He spent 4  years serving as State barber inspector on the State barber board. This  involved visiting barber shops around the State, inspecting their  shops, but also offering any assistance he could to local barbers.  Additionally, he spent a term serving as a member of the city council.  Andy and has wife, Alverta, have been married for 58 years. They have  three kids and eight grandchildren. Andy's son Scott has followed in  his father's footsteps and works in the Denton shop on Thursdays.   I congratulate Andy Anderson on his tremendous career. He has  improved the lives of many around him and will continue to leave a  lasting impact on the people of his community and the greater State of  Montana.                            ____________________
