 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of the fourth annual  Black Maternal Health Week.   As the founder and co-chair of the Black Maternal Health Caucus, I  want to take this time to speak briefly about the Black maternal health  crisis in America, where Black mamas are disproportionately and  needlessly dying.   Across the country, Black women from all walks of life are dying from  preventable pregnancy-related complications at three and four times the  rate of non-Hispanic, White women. However, 60 percent of Black  maternal deaths are preventable.   Research suggests that the cumulative stress of racism and sexism  undermines Black women's health, making them more vulnerable to  complications that endanger their lives and the lives of their infants.  Unfortunately, current healthcare practices are inadequate in  addressing the health consequences of living with stress.   The Black Maternal Omnibus Act of 2021, a package of 12 bills, will  comprehensively address every dimension of the maternal health crisis  in America to save lives and end racial and ethnic disparities in  maternal health outcomes.   This crisis demands urgent attention and serious action to save the  lives of Black mothers, women of color, and other marginalized women  across the country.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues and this Congress to stand together  with me to ensure that our mothers and babies have the resources they  need not only to survive but to thrive. Black mamas can't wait, and  neither will we.                            ____________________     I thank the gentleman for yielding, and for his support,  and for his leadership on the committee.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today, as I have done for my entire career, from  the North Carolina House to the U.S. House, in support of equal pay for  equal work.   It is 2021, and women are still subject to unequal, unfair  compensation in the workplace. This truth, this wage gap is at its  worst for women of color. Black women, for example, earn an average of  63 cents on the dollar compared to men.   This issue persists in nearly every line of work, regardless of  education, experience, occupation, industry, or job title. And if you  don't believe that data, take it from me. I have lived it.   The Paycheck Fairness Act is an opportunity for Congress to  strengthen the Equal Pay Act, to bolster the rights of working women,  and to put an end to the gender-based wage disparity once and for all.   We cannot continue to rob nearly half of our Nation's workforce of  the wages they deserve, nor can we continue to force women to work far  more just to be paid fairly.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the National  Partnership for Women and Families in support of H.R. 7, the Paycheck  Fairness Act.                                            National Partnership for                                                Women & Families,                                                     April 13, 2021.        Dear Member of Congress: The National Partnership for Women       & Families is a non-profit, non-partisan advocacy       organization committed to improving the lives of women and       families by achieving equity for all women. Since our       creation as the Women's Legal Defense Fund in 1971, we have       fought for every significant federal advance for equal       opportunity in the workplace, including the Lilly Ledbetter       Fair Pay Act of 2009. We write in strong support of H.R. 7,       the Paycheck Fairness Act, and urge you to vote for passage       while opposing any harmful amendments. This critical bill       will help our nation build back an economy that works for       everyone by ensuring that all women can work with equality       and dignity.        As the Paycheck Fairness Act recognizes, women and workers       from communities of color continue to face significant pay       disparities in the United States. On average, women working       full time and year-round are paid only 82 cents for every       dollar paid to men, and the wage gap is widest for women of       color. Among women who hold full-time, year-round jobs in the       United States, Black women are typically paid 63 cents,       Native American women 60 cents and Latinas just 55 cents for       every dollar paid to white, non-Hispanic men. White, non-      Hispanic women are paid 79 cents. Asian American and Pacific       Islander (AAPI) women who work full time, year-round are paid       as little as 52 cents for every dollar paid to white, non-      Hispanic men, as Burmese women are. Asian American women       overall are paid just 87 cents for every dollar paid to       white, non-Hispanic men. The wage gap persists across       different industries, occupations and education levels and       exists in nearly every congressional district.        These troubling statistics underscore the need to update       our nation's equal pay laws. The Paycheck Fairness Act would       make it safe for workers to discuss their wages with each       other. Employers can currently mask compensation       discrimination with pay secrecy policies that forbid       employees from discussing pay and benefits. Secrecy and the       threat of retaliation leave workers unable to learn about and       challenge pay disparities. In a survey of private-sector       workers, over 62 percent of women and 60 percent of men       reported that their employers discourage or prohibit       discussing wage and salary information. The Paycheck Fairness       Act would make pay secrecy policies illegal.        The Paycheck Fairness Act would also prohibit employers       from screening job applicants based on their salary history       or requiring salary history during the interview process.       Women are typically paid lower wages than men even in their       first jobs. Salary disparities that begin early in a woman's       career can follow her from job to job when employers are       permitted to base a new hire's salary on her prior earnings.       People should be paid fairly for the job they are being hired       to do.        The bill would also make it more difficult for employers to       justify pay discrimination. Workers in the same company who       do the same job and have the same amount of experience,       education and training should be paid the same. Currently,       however, employers are able to explain away differences in       pay too easily by relying on a catch-all defense in the Equal       Pay Act. The Paycheck Fairness Act would close that loophole       and require employers to prove that any differences in pay       are not sex-based, are job-related concerning the position in       question, and are consistent with business necessity and       account for the entire difference in compensation. Employees       claiming pay discrimination would also have new opportunities       to prove that the employer's defense is the pretext.        In addition to these critical provisions, the Paycheck       Fairness Act would also allow workers alleging pay       discrimination within the same company to file class-action       suits; would change the remedies of the Equal Pay Act to       treat gender-based pay discrimination claims the same as       other civil rights violations that result in unfair pay;       would recognize companies that want to do better; and would       improve fair pay enforcement, data collection and disclosure.        Closing the gender and racial wage gap is a crucial measure       to take in response to COVID-19. Throughout the pandemic,       women and people of color have disproportionately experienced       the adverse effects of the public health and economic crisis.       Women and people of color have been on the front lines       working in our most essential occupations, but forces like       wage inequality have kept them underpaid and undervalued. The       Paycheck Fairness Act would ensure that workers are given the       support needed to ensure pay equity during this time of       crisis.        Updating our nation's equal pay laws is also crucial to       reducing negative impacts resulting from the mass exodus of       women from the labor force during the pandemic. Women's labor       force participation is at a 33-year record low, with nearly a       million moms having left the workforce, largely due to the       difficulties of balancing full-time work and care       responsibilities. Increases in women's labor force       participation rates drove the significant narrowing of the       gender wage gap during the 1970s and 1980s, a narrowing which       stagnated in the late 1990s, around the time women's labor       force participation peaked. Without the Paycheck Fairness       Act, progress on closing the gender wage gap could be set       back decades, especially since women face financial penalties       for taking time out of the workforce, with one study finding       that women who took just one year out of the workforce had       annual earnings 39 percent lower than women who did not.  [[Page H1806]]         The Paycheck Fairness Act would strengthen existing federal       protections, ensure more equitable workplaces and allow women       to remain in the workforce and maintain their economic       stability at all phases of life. At the current rate of       progress, projections are that the gender wage gap will close       in 2041 for Asian women, 2069 for white women, 2369 for Black       women, and 2451 for Latina women. Women cannot--and should       not--wait that long for pay equity. It is time to clarify and       strengthen existing federal protections for women in the       workforce by passing the Paycheck Fairness Act. We urge you       to vote in support and opposed harmful amendments.    Madam Speaker, I was with the Speaker at her press  conference.
