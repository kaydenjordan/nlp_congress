 Mr. Speaker, the September 21 Post and  Courier of Charleston, South Carolina, editorialized an analysis of the  irresponsible Biden tax-and-borrow schemes destroying jobs.         What would you call a neighbor who spent lavishly to       redecorate his house but ignored the badly leaking roof?       Perhaps foolish, irrational, or just plain dumb.        Now, what would you call a Congress seemingly bent on       enacting costly new middle-class entitlements while existing       programs are headed for devastating benefit cuts? Some of       those same words come to mind.        At the end of August, the Treasury Department issued the       annual reports of the trustees for Social Security and       Medicare that showed these trust fund programs are on       schedule to run out of money.        There are very serious fiscal problems, but Congress       instead is focusing on legislation to expand entitlements,       hurting their children in the long run while millions of our       elderly could be thrown into poverty.    In conclusion, God bless our troops, who successfully protected  America for 20 years as the global war on terrorism continues moving  from Afghanistan to America. Our sympathy to the family of General  Colin Powell.                            ____________________
