 Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 330, I call  up the bill (H.R. 1333) to transfer and limit Executive Branch  authority to suspend or restrict the entry of a class of aliens, and  ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and insert extraneous material on H.R. 1333.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself 3 minutes.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 1333, the National Origin-Based  Antidiscrimination for Nonimmigrants Act, or NO BAN Act, is an  important step toward reining in executive overreach and preserving the  power of Congress to establish our Nation's immigration laws.   Section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, the INA,  authorizes the President to suspend the entry of noncitizens when the  President finds that their entry would be detrimental to U.S.  interests.   From 1952, when this provision was enacted, until January 2017,  Presidents of both parties invoked section 212(f) to exclude only  narrow groups of individuals, such as human rights violators, North  Korean officials, and individuals seeking to overthrow governments, for  reasons that would clearly serve the national interest.   But former President Trump abused this authority, twisting it in ways  that were never intended. He first used it to deliver on his campaign  promise to ban Muslims from the United States, an immoral and  disastrous policy that traumatized children and families and made us no  safer, while weakening our standing in the world.   The former President then used this section to rewrite immigration  laws with which he disagreed. For example, the INA expressly provides  asylum eligibility to any individual who arrives in the United States  ``whether or not at a designated port of arrival.'' However, President  Trump invoked section 212(f) to deny asylum to persons who cross the  southern border between ports of entry, in direct conflict with the  statute. Fortunately, the judiciary agreed that this was unlawful and  stopped the policy from taking effect.   H.R. 1333 will prevent such executive overreach by amending section  212(f) to ensure it is used in a manner consistent with its intended  purpose and historical norms.   Although President Biden has repealed the egregious orders of the  Trump era, including the Muslim ban, we must pass the NO BAN Act to  ensure that this authority is never abused again. In advancing this  legislation today, we uphold our Nation's founding ideals and reaffirm  our commitment to the rule of law.   This should not be a partisan issue. Members on both sides of the  aisle should agree that no President, Republican or Democratic, should  be permitted to usurp the powers of the legislative branch enshrined in  the Constitution. The separation of powers is fundamental to our  democratic Republic, and it must be protected.   I would like to thank my friend and colleague, Representative Judy  Chu, for her leadership and her steadfast commitment to this issue. Her  efforts led to the introduction of the NO BAN Act, and I urge all of my  colleagues to support this important legislation.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Chu), the author of this legislation.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 15 seconds to the  gentlewoman from Texas.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Lofgren), the distinguished chairperson of the  Immigration and Citizenship Subcommittee.    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 15 seconds to the  gentlewoman from California.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from New York (Mr. Jeffries).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. Jayapal).    Madam Speaker, may I inquire how much time is remaining.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Correa).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Pelosi), the distinguished Speaker of the House.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Beyer).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. Dingell).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, let me say that I agree with some of what I heard from  the Republicans. They said there is a lot of nonsense spoken on the  floor today. Indeed, there was. Everything they have said about this  bill is nonsense. They have said there is no Muslim ban. Everybody  knows there was a Muslim ban. The President said he was going to impose  a Muslim ban, and then he did.   When Nydia Velazquez and I went to Kennedy airport, when Jan  Schakowsky went to the airport in Chicago, when other people went to  the airport, what did we find?   We found Muslims being kept out of the country. People with perfectly  valid visas, perfectly valid green cards, people whose relatives were  waiting for them here because they had perfectly valid entry  certificates, were being kept out of the country, and they couldn't  even speak to their lawyers.   That is the next bill we will be considering on the floor in a few  minutes.   That is what we found. And that has been in effect for a long time.  It is un-American. It is unconstitutional. It is against the ethics of  this country.   As the Speaker said--I think it was the Speaker who said it--the  motto of the country is E Pluribus Unum; from many, one.   This situation, this Muslim ban, denies that. This says E Pluribus--I  don't know the Latin from a few, not from all.   Madam Speaker, we must pass this bill. More than 400 organizations  and industry leaders support this bill. They include Muslim Advocates,  the ACLU, Airbnb, Asian Americans Advancing Justice, the Hebrew  Immigrant Aid Society.   Yes, the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society. Why? Because the Hebrew  Immigrant Aid Society remembers its futile efforts when Jews were  turned away from this country to go back to the Holocaust; when the St.  Louis was turned back to go back to the Holocaust; when the State  Department deliberately wouldn't even use the quota. The quota was  150,000, and they kept it down to 6,000 because of the anti-Semitism of  some officials in the State Department. And the Hebrew Immigrant Aid  Society--which was formed to aid Jewish immigrants, but has long since  broadened its mission to aid immigrants from any country--knows what  happens and doesn't want to see it happen again. That is why they are  supporting this bill.    Other organizations and industry leaders that support this bill  include the Service Employees International Union, because so many of  their members were born abroad; the National Immigration Law Center,  MoveOn, and United We Dream.   Members on both sides of the aisle should agree that no President,  Republican or Democrat, should be permitted to usurp the powers of the  legislative branch enshrined in the Constitution. The separation of  power is fundamental to our democratic Republic and must be protected.   For all these reasons, that is why passage of H.R. 1333 is so vital.  I urge my colleagues to vote in support of this bill.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 330, I call  up the bill (H.R. 1573) to clarify the rights of all persons who are  held or detained at a port of entry or at any detention facility  overseen by U.S. Customs and Border Protection or U.S. Immigration and  Customs Enforcement, and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 1573.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself 3 minutes.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 1573, the Access to Counsel Act of 2021, is an  important bill that will ensure that individuals who seek to lawfully  enter the United States can contact a family member or an adviser if  they are held for an extended period at a port of entry.   Last September, the Judiciary Committee and the Foreign Affairs  Committee held a hearing to explore President Trump's Muslim ban and  the chaos that unfolded at airports across the country when it was  first announced.   I can personally attest to that chaos, based on my experience at JFK  Airport immediately after the ban was implemented. Refugees,  individuals with valid visas, and even lawful permanent residents were  detained for hours and were prevented from speaking with attorneys.  Some even had their phones taken away and were unable to call their  family.   Although the issue grabbed the headlines then, it is, unfortunately,  a problem that occurs daily. Due to the complexity of U.S. immigration  law and the fact-intensive nature of questions regarding admissibility,  it is not uncommon for some people to spend hours undergoing inspection  by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, or CBP.   During this time, individuals are often prevented from communicating  with those on the outside. And if the individual is lucky enough to  have a lawyer, CBP will often refuse to speak to them, even if they can  provide critical information or correct the legal error. Moreover,  serious consequences can result from being refused admission.   Some have argued that this bill will require CBP to expend  significant resources, but I believe they fundamentally misunderstand  the substance of the bill. To be clear, H.R. 1573 does not provide a  right to counsel, nor does it impose any obligation on the Federal  Government to build any additional space to accommodate counsel or hire  new staff, nor to pay for counsel.   The bill simply ensures that no one who presents themselves at a port  of entry with valid travel documents is completely cut off from the  world during the inspection process. It allows those seeking admission,  including U.S. citizens, to communicate with counsel and other parties  if they are subjected to secondary inspection that lasts longer than 1  hour. The bill specifically contemplates that this could be  accomplished telephonically.   It is absurd to claim that providing these individuals with the  opportunity to call their families or an attorney and potentially  receive their assistance during the inspection process will consume  significant CBP resources.  [[Page H2017]]    Madam Speaker, I would like to extend a special thanks to my  colleague, Representative Jayapal, for her leadership on this issue and  for championing this bill. I encourage my colleagues to support it, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Lofgren), who is the chairwoman of the Immigration and  Citizenship Subcommittee.    Madam Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman from California  such time as she may consume.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute.   Mr. Speaker, I am going to have a lot more to say about this bill a  little later, but I have to respond to one point that the gentleman  just made.   He said he was considering whether the agreement to enter the Union  was valid or was worth it. He is not the first to consider that. John  Calhoun considered that. Others considered it, and they tried it. The  result was a civil war. So I certainly hope that no one is thinking of  that again.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the  distinguished gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. Jayapal), who is the  sponsor of the bill.     Madam Speaker, I yield 6 minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Madam Speaker, I yield 6 minutes to the gentleman from  Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline).    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time is  remaining?    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky).    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, I have heard a lot of nonsense on this floor. I have  heard a lot of fiction on this floor today, but not everything the  Republicans have said is fiction.   They said, for instance, there is a crisis at the border. Indeed,  there is a crisis at the border.   The crisis at the border started under President Trump and has  continued under President Biden; the same crisis. The difference is  that President Trump tried to deal with the crisis in the cruelest way  possible, by tearing babies away from their parents, by tearing  families apart, and by doing so, so incompetently--I assume it was  incompetence; maybe it was malevolence, I don't know--that they didn't  even get the records so that people today can figure out how to reunite  these families.   The crisis continues, but at least we are dealing with it. We are  trying to deal with it in a humane way.   It is also interesting the fictions we have heard about this bill:  This bill will cost money, this bill gives people the right to an  attorney, and the Federal Government will have to pay for that  attorney. Not true. Not true.   I suspect my Republican colleagues have lost the ability to read a  bill somehow. The bill is very clear. The bill simply says that if  someone with valid documents--valid documents--no litigation as to  whether they are valid or not, they have got to be valid in the first  place, a U.S. citizen, a green card holder, someone with a valid visa,  that is all we are talking about. The bill simply says that those  people, if detained at a border entry point for a period of time for  longer than an hour have the right to make a phone call.   A phone call doesn't cost the government anything. They have the  right to make a phone call. To whom? To whoever they want. A family  member, perhaps an attorney, a friend, whoever they want.   Experience tells us that when people can make a phone call to an  attorney in such a situation because the INA, the Immigration and  Naturalization Act, is so complicated, it can often straighten things  out, and that saves the government money. Because they don't have to  litigate, it saves the government money. So this bill will not cost the  government any money. It will save it money.                                time  1500    It will also help people who must be helped--again, I stress, only  those people who have a valid document to enter the United States and  for some reason are detained at the border.   How long does this last? Eight hours, at most. That is what the bill  says, 8 hours.   This bill is limited to a measure that Members on both sides of the  aisle, everybody, should embrace. As I said before, this is not a bill  about a right to counsel. It is simply a bill about fair process. It  ensures that individuals seeking to enter the United States with  facially valid documents--a visa, a green card, including U.S. citizens  who may have a passport--are given an opportunity to call somebody, a  family member, counsel, another interested party, whoever they want, if  they are subject to prolonged inspection.   Admissibility decisions by Customs and Border Protection can have  life-altering consequences. This bill will ensure that CBP has the  relevant facts prior to making decisions, the relevant facts, and facts  that don't cost the CBP anything to get. Well, they do, actually: the  cost of a phone call. I take that back. It would cost the CBP the cost  of a phone call, although not necessarily, because the person may have  their cell phone on him. So, it won't even cost the cost of a  telephone.   I urge my colleagues to vote in support of the Access to Counsel Act.  It makes sense. It hurts nobody. It imposes no duty on the government.  It imposes no cost on the government. But it does mean that people will  not unnecessarily get caught up in bureaucracy. I urge my colleagues to  vote in support of the Access to Counsel Act, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
