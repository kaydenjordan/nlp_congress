 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   I support this bill because Black lives matter.   Gianna Floyd, the 6-year-old daughter of George Floyd, said, ``My  daddy changed the world.'' We are here to prove that she is right.                                time  1445    I spoke to an African American member of my community 2 weeks ago who  told me he feels safe twice a day: when he wakes up in his own house  and after work when he comes into his own house.   He said, ``In between, people look at me, at the nice car I worked  hard to  [[Page H2462]]  buy, and they think that I stole it. I have police officers often  running my plates and then realize I don't have any warrants, and they  drive off.''   This member of our community is a police captain. So if a Black  police captain feels that way, imagine how people in the Black  community who are not in law enforcement feel.   We can change the world with these necessary police reforms, because  Black lives do matter.
