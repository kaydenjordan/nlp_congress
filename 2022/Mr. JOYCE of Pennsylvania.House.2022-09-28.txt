 Mr. Speaker, today, fourth-year medical  students submitted their applications to residency programs across our  country, preparing to enter the workforce as surgeons, specialists, and  family doctors.   As these students begin the process of choosing the hospitals where  they will work, I urge them to consider working in rural communities.  Working in facilities that are struggling right now to recruit new  physicians, and these new medical students--these new, highly-trained  individuals--will be able to serve communities that desperately need  them.   For too long, a lack of doctors has been a significant barrier to  care for families in rural Pennsylvania. To address this critical  shortage, I am proud to have created the Homegrown Healthcare  Initiative, which pairs third- and fourth-year medical students with  hospitals across Pennsylvania's 13th Congressional District.   So far we have been able to place nearly 30 students in hospitals in  Blair, Cambria, Fulton, and Franklin counties. It is time to ensure the  students who were raised in rural communities return to these  communities to live, to work, and to practice medicine.    To all of the medical students applying for residency today, good  luck, and  [[Page H8124]]  I thank them for all the work that they will do on behalf of their  patients.                           out of control inflation     Mr. Speaker, today, we recognize the  problems that we are facing with a country that has spiraling out of  control inflation. We have an opportunity with the Republican  Commitment to America, the commitment that the Republican Party has put  forward, to make a Nation that is safe, to make a Nation that is  accountable.   As Republicans, we have brought forth a four-part statement that will  have the necessary oversight to control and have the citizens have the  ability to have their voices heard.   The Commitment to America is the path forward throughout this  spiraling inflation that is affecting each and every American today.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Americans to look at this valuable commitment  that we as Republicans will bring forward.                            ____________________
