 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and to include any extraneous material on the subject of the Special  Order.    Madam Speaker, first of all, I would like to  thank our Congressional Black Caucus chair, Congresswoman Joyce Beatty,  for her tremendous leadership and for giving us this Special Order hour  on behalf of the Congressional Black Caucus to honor my mentor, one of  the founding members of the Congressional Black Caucus, the late  Congresswoman Shirley Anita St. Hill Chisholm. And to Congresswoman  Beatty, I just want to say how proud we are, and how bold she has led  this caucus by demanding that everyone really understand our power, and  our message. Tonight is no exception. And, in fact, Congresswoman  Chisholm, I am sure, is very proud of the leadership of Congresswoman  Beatty.   As the first African-American woman elected to Congress in 1968--I  want you to listen to this--the first Congress convened in 1789 and the  first Black woman elected to Congress was in 1968. That was  Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm. She was also the first African American  and woman to seek the Presidency.   Shirley Chisholm has truly cemented her place in history as a  trailblazer. I first met Congresswoman Chisholm because of a college  assignment at Mills College in Oakland, California. My government  professor assigned us to do field work on a Presidential campaign.   At the time, several men were vying for the Democratic nomination,  but they didn't speak to the issues that I cared about. I was a young,  single mom on public assistance, and their platforms did not include  issues that related to me or my community, like childcare, public  education, universal healthcare, and ending poverty.   So, of course, even though I had never flunked a class in my life, I  decided to get an F in this class because I could not bring myself to  work for these candidates.   Now, I didn't believe these candidates could see me or had seen my  community in terms of our needs. So I invited Congresswoman Shirley  Chisholm to Mills College. I did not know she was running for the  Presidency, but I invited her to address the Black Student Union  because I was president of the Black Student Union. I had no idea she  was running for President.   In her speech, she stood up for children and struggling working  families. She spoke out against racism and sexism. She was against the  Vietnam war. She advocated for what she knew was right, undeterred by  criticism and without fear of the consequences.   As soon as she finished her speech, I went up to talk to her to tell  her about this class I was about to flunk, and she took me to task. She  asked me if I was registered to vote. And I said: No. I admitted that I  wasn't going to do much in politics because I didn't believe in the  two-party system and its relationship to my needs and my community.   She said: Little girl, you can't change the system if you are on the  outside looking in. Register to vote. And from that moment on, I ended  up working in her northern California  [[Page H999]]  campaign. I vowed to listen to her, allowed her to mentor me and take  me to task.   We organized her northern California campaign out of my class at  Mills College, and the rest is history. I went on to Miami, Florida, as  a Shirley Chisholm delegate and we took a large percentage of the vote  in Alameda County.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs. Beatty),  the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus to deliver, once again, our  power and our message, and then I will return and yield to my  colleagues after the chair of the Black Caucus speaks.    Let me first say to our chair that our power  and our message is exactly what the gentlewoman has delivered tonight.  And I just want to thank her for her very gracious remarks and just  know that I know Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm is proud of her  leadership and proud of the fact that although she was one in 1968, I  believe we have--what--25 bold, brilliant Black women in the  Congressional Black Caucus.   Thank you again for giving us a chance to honor her tonight and for  your leadership.   I now yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Johnson), the chair of  the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology. I have been here since  1998, and she took to me and explained to me why, and I was on the  Committee on Science, Space, and Technology when I first came to  Congress, and I learned so much from her and have really just honored  her for helping us navigate as Black women in this institution.    Madam Speaker, I thank very much Congresswoman  Eddie Bernice Johnson for that powerful statement and also reminding us  of her humble beginnings. She also, when she came to Congress,  championed the rights of domestic workers and of low-income people. It  was in her soul and in her spirit. She turned her vision into  legislation here and was an excellent legislator who never lost touch  with who she was.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson  Lee), the co-chair of our Special Order, another greater leader from  the State of Texas, and, as Chairwoman Beatty said, a fighter for  justice on a lot of fronts.  [[Page H1000]]         Madam Speaker, I thank very much Congresswoman  Sheila Jackson Lee for that very comprehensive statement about our  shero, Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm. Congresswoman Jackson Lee  certainly is the epitome of who she was.   I am so happy that she raised some of the issues and some of her  quotes because she told me personally: Barbara, these rules and  policies weren't made for you and I.   She said: Don't go along to get along.   She said: If you get behind these closed doors in any capacity, you  have to fight to change the rules of the game. You have to fight the  systemic issues. Don't tinker around the edges.   I say that because, once again, when I started, I mentioned the fact  that the first Congress was held in 1789, right? Shirley Chisholm was  elected in 1968. Our country lost so much during that period because  there were no Black women right here in this House of Representatives.   We have to always remember the power of the moment when Shirley was  elected to Congress and then running for President.   Congresswoman Lucy McBath, another trailblazer who has shattered a  heck of a lot of glass ceilings, first of all, and who has been bold  and determined and persistent in making her community and this country  a better place, I am so glad that she is with us tonight.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Georgia (Mrs. McBath).    Congresswoman Lucy McBath, I would like to  share a story with you which reminds me of you that happened during  Shirley's campaign because I know your district, and I know how you  fight each and every day to bring people together, and how you care  about all people, humanity.   You care about people regardless of party affiliation, regardless of  background, and I know that is how you do your work, and that is how  you are so effective as a Black woman.   During Shirley Chisholm's campaign, George Wallace was running for  President also. He was shot and he was hospitalized. He was paralyzed.  This is in the middle of the campaign. Congresswoman Chisholm suspended  her campaign for a few days, and she went to visit that segregationist  George Wallace.   I mean, I was ready to leave. I said no, there is no way that my  first campaign, this hero--shero of mine is going down to see this man  who has blocked African Americans from going to school, who has sicced  dogs on them, who is a horrible human being.   And so I talked to her and said, ``I can't deal with this, Mrs.  Chisholm.'' I was so angry for that decision. And I am thinking of  Congresswoman McBath now, I am thinking of the context in which we live  in terms of so much hate out there because she said to me, she said,  ``Little girl,'' even though I was a grown woman with two little kids,  ``Remember, we are all human beings. Maybe I can teach him something  and help him regain his humanity.''   I said, ``Well, he never had any. He was a bad man.''   And she went on to say, ``I know you are angry. I know people are  really angry who support me, but you have to rise to the occasion if  you are a leader, and you have to try to break down some of these  barriers. You have to break through and try to enlighten other people  who may hate you.''   I said, ``No, that is not good enough. He will never, ever come  around, and I am really angry.'' But she asked me to stay on with her  campaign, so I begrudgingly did.   But what happened was she was able--and I am a good friend with  George Wallace's daughter, Peggy Wallace Kennedy, who is a fighter for  racial justice, who is a phenomenal woman in Alabama, and she is a good  friend of mine, and she told me just recently, she said, ``Honey, you  know, I was at that bedside when Shirley Chisholm visited my daddy, and  she talked to him, and she told him what terrible things he had done,  and she asked him to please, please, please understand that Black  people deserved justice and equality.''   And she didn't know whether she was making an impact on him or not,  but later--I still say too little, too late--he went to Dexter Avenue  Baptist Church in his wheelchair and rolled down the aisle and  apologized for all of his misdeeds.   They became friends from afar, and he got a lot of the Southern  Members to sign onto her legislation for domestic workers and for all  of her bills that she was working on that she needed Southern  Dixiecrats to support.   I share that story now because that seems like something that we  forgot how to do. I mean, I know I have. It is something that she  taught me because not only was she responsible for this apology--again,  too little too late--but it showed me that you have got to step out of  your comfort zone, like you do, and hopefully, hopefully see some good  in people who are your adversaries.   You were talking, and I wanted to share that because I was personally  involved with that story. I want to salute Peggy Wallace Kennedy  tonight because she has really led a life that has been a life of  making sure that every barrier against African Americans and people of  color is dismantled in this country. Thank you again.    Madam Speaker, we will go to another fighter  who has just come here from the great State of Ohio, who has a  remarkable record fighting for voting rights and justice and is a woman  who serves her community in ways that every Member of Congress should  serve their community, Congresswoman Shontel Brown, who I think has  been here for years now, but she has really hit the ground running in  her presence on this floor.    Let me thank you, Congresswoman Brown, for  that statement and for your presentation and laying out many of Shirley  Chisholm's accomplishments. I mean, she was a great legislator. She  passed the 1974 minimum wage law, which expanded minimum wage standards  to domestic workers and a broader swath of government employees, so I  am glad that you laid that out because so many of us and so many  especially younger African-American women and women of color see her as  this icon who ran for President, first Black woman elected, but she was  an excellent legislator.   She used her contacts and leverage, and she knew how to leverage the  folks, as I mentioned George Wallace's people. She understood her  power. You understand your power, and I am so glad that you are here  tonight for this presentation.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson  Lee) for some additional words.    Madam Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Jackson  Lee for reminding us of Shirley Chisholm's history here in the Capitol  as a member of the Agriculture Committee.  [[Page H1005]]    Now, you know I worked for the late Ron Dellums starting in 1975, and  I worked for him for 11 years. I got a chance to be with Congresswoman  Chisholm many times, also with Congresswoman Barbara Jordan, so I got a  chance to know her and her brilliance and her stately demeanor and her  huge intellect.   And I remember very clearly that Congresswoman Chisholm also was on  the Rules Committee. And I know she was only the second woman to ever  be appointed to the Rules Committee. Again, I have to go back to 1789  because I want the public to understand the centuries that took place  during the interim.   First, Congresswoman Chisholm was the second woman on the Rules  Committee since 1789, and I believe--and we are checking--I think that  she may have been the first member of the CBC on the Rules Committee  also. But also, in terms of Congresswoman Chisholm's history and  bringing it current, she was an original board member, first honorary  copresident in 1969 of the National Abortion Rights Action League,  better known as NARAL, and she was a fierce advocate for women's  reproductive rights and justice. And she was also only one of 16 Black  women who courageously led a movement for reproductive freedom that  began with the publishing of the very seminal brochure ``We Remember:  African American Women Are For Reproductive Freedom.'' And that was in  1989.   And so Congresswoman Chisholm has been honored in so many different  ways throughout the years, but we need to do more. We are going to  start with our Chisholm Trail. For those who want to join us this year  we are going to commemorate the Chisholm Trail.   I was so pleased that Chairwoman Beatty mentioned the Shirley  Chisholm stamp. It took us a long time to do this, but it was a  bipartisan effort. We finally have a Forever Congresswoman Shirley  Chisholm's historical stamp from the Postal Service.   Also, she posthumously was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom  from President Barack Obama. For her official portrait, I thank Speaker  Nancy Pelosi because that was one of her first efforts working with us.  And you remember Congresswoman Juanita Millender-McDonald, another  African-American woman, brilliant woman, from Southern California who  passed away. She was chairing the House Administration Committee, and  we got together. And this wasn't easy. And I thank Speaker Pelosi for  helping us because it was a heavy lift to get this beautiful portrait  painted by a young brother down in Southern California into this temple  of democracy.   And at first, there were those who wanted the portrait to be hidden  in some little corner. Well, Speaker Pelosi and Lorraine Miller, Clerk  of the House, made sure that she was placed in a prominent place so  that people, especially young people, could get a chance to know her  and to love her because what she did for this country was so amazing  for everyone, for the voiceless, and she was a person, a woman, a Black  woman who loved to bring people together from all backgrounds.   So there are so many other memorials across the country to remember  her fortitude and to honor her grit and tenacity. And she taught me  once again, and I know Congresswoman Jackson Lee knows this, that Black  women can't go along to get along. Again, 1789.   These rules weren't made for us. So we must change these rules of the  game, so that we must address gender and racial equity at its core.   Before Congresswoman Chisholm passed away, she was asked how she  wanted to be remembered. And I remember she said: I want history to  remember me not just as the first Black woman to be elected to  Congress, not as the first Black woman to have made a bid for the  Presidency of the United States, but as a Black woman who lived in the  20th century and dared to be herself. I want to be remembered as a  catalyst for change in America.   And so I can confidently say that that is her legacy. Well done, Mrs.  C, well done. Her staff and many of us called her ``
