 Mr. Chairman, this has been an issue in  Europe. It has been an issue in the United States. I would like to make  the point that, with respect to looking at economic analysis and making  certain that it is bipartisan, I think there is a way to make certain  it is objective.   As I look at the underlying text and then look at the amendment that  we are accepting, we should reflect on this. We are going to have the  SEC here look at both the protection of investors and the effects to  ensure competition and efficiency. So I would explain to the Members  that adding that into what I already thought was pretty exacting rules  here in terms of an objective analysis should really succeed in our  attempt here.   And what is the attempt in this Regulatory Accountability Act?   It is to make sure that the U.S. capital markets are unmatched in  terms of their size, their depth, their resiliency, and transparency.  And this Regulatory Accountability Act gives the Commission the  opportunity to ensure that its rules and regulations, past and present,  each of those are worth pursuing when measured against their economic  costs.   Growing access to capital, protecting investors, preserving the  world's strongest capital markets are not mutually exclusive objectives  here.   The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.    And here is what I would like to point out.  The European Union clearly recognizes this conundrum right now. They  are launching a call for evidence to investigate the unintended  consequences created by their regulatory framework because they are  searching for balance in this, too, to make sure that they have  retrospective examination.   It is prudent. Frankly, as the effectiveness of regulation is  measured by outcomes rather than volume in a situation like this, it  drives us toward efficiency in the market.   Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself  such time as I may consume.   I want to point out that with Dodd-Frank and the reforms that the  Democrats put in place, our economy bounded back faster and stronger  than all of Europe. And I must say that one of the areas that we need  to work on, where we are falling behind in our economy, is exports. We  need to support exports.   Despite all the talk that we hear from Republicans about enacting  policies that support jobs and job creation, and the slew of tweets  from the President-elect discouraging American companies from moving  U.S. jobs overseas--and I support his efforts to stop our companies  from going overseas--one proven job creator has remained on the  sidelines, and that is the U.S. Export-Import Bank. This Bank has  played a critical role in opening up international markets to U.S.  exporters, which, in turn, helps create and preserve jobs here in  America.   The export-import banks of our competitors are supported by those  countries five times more than what we do here in America. In fact, the  ability of the Export-Import Bank to even operate, even though it makes  money and has succeeded in building up American exports, has been  hamstrung by the leadership of my good friends and colleagues on the  other side of the aisle.   In recognition of the Bank's success and supporting U.S. jobs over  the past 80 years, in December of 2015 the House and the Senate voted  with overwhelming majorities to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank.  Despite this broad support, the Bank has remained hamstrung because,  with three empty seats on its five-member board, the Bank lacks the  quorum it needs in order to approve transactions over $10 million.   Although President Obama nominated two individuals to serve on the  Ex-Im's bipartisan board, the Senate Republican leadership refused to  consider them, and Ex-Im's board remains without a quorum. They can not  approve these exports. I think it is a national scandal.   Indeed, it has been more than 18 months since the Export-Import  Bank's board was last able to consider transactions, which has limited  its ability to ensure U.S. workers and businesses of all sizes are able  to compete around the world for contracts, as well as support jobs for  the many small businesses that contribute to the supply chains for  these high-value exports.                                time  1515    In fact, the bank currently has 50 transactions in its pipeline  valued at nearly $40 billion, which, if approved, would support more  than 100,000 American high-skill and high-wage jobs. I intend to bring  this to the attention of the President-elect.   So, as we talk today about how these Republican bills will create  American jobs, I think it is important that we look at the GOP's full  record on job creation or, might I say in this case, job prevention. As  their record shows, Republican leaders have been all too willing to let  U.S. jobs slip away to our foreign competitors.   Until Congress restores Ex-Im to full functionality, U.S. companies  selling expensive capital goods such as aircraft, locomotives, nuclear  reactors, and turbines will remain at a unique competitive disadvantage  because their foreign competitors all enjoy ample financing from their  home-country export credit agencies--enough to easily knock U.S.  companies out of the competition. This is unfair.   We cannot compete and win in the global economy unless we support our  businesses. We will lose global market share in key sectors such as the  satellite industry, aerospace, and telecommunications. We will lose  tens of thousands of jobs as some of the biggest U.S. exports suffer  declining overseas sales, and, eventually, some of  [[Page H436]]  these companies would be forced to move jobs to where export credit is  still available. We have seen this reported in the news daily where  they are moving to our competitors.   So, in short, we need to support the Export-Import Bank. We need to  not hamstring the SEC by requiring it to have unnecessary, time- consuming, duplicative rules that are already in place and that allow  people to sue them more easily.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who  care, as President-elect Trump does, about job creation to be opposed  to this bill.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
