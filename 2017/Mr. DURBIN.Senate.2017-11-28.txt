 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in  morning business.    Mr. President, this week many things will happen in  Washington, but the focus in the Senate Chamber later in the week will  be the Republican tax plan. It is a plan that has come upon us really  quickly--in a matter of weeks--and it literally will affect the economy  of the United States and virtually every taxpayer. There is hardly a  measure we can entertain that has such broad and far-reaching impact on  the future of this country and its economy.   What we are trying to do now is to analyze this plan. It has been put  on a fast schedule. I can guarantee, as I stand here, that because of  this hurry-up approach on tax reform, when it is all said and done, if  anything is enacted into law, we can look back with regret for not  having taken the time to do this carefully, not having measured the  impact of any tax changes on individuals, families, and the economy,  and, certainly, on our national debt.   So far we have a plan that was considered and passed by the House of  Representatives, also on a fast schedule, and one in the Senate as  well. The one in the Senate will be up for consideration this week. It  is going to be a procedure, which was established in the Senate years  ago, called reconciliation. For the outsider, it is a long word, which,  by Senate definition, means that a simple majority vote is all that is  necessary to pass this measure. It will not be subject to the  traditional filibuster in the Senate nor to the need for 60 votes, as  in most instances.   It was designed, in its inception, to be a way to reduce the budget  deficit. Ironically, what we will see happen with the proposed Senate  tax plan is an increase of our national debt instead of a reduction.  But that seems to be the intent of the sponsors, and it is what we will  consider.   We took a look at some of the proposals in the Senate Republican  plan. It is no secret that this plan would bankroll massive tax cuts  for the wealthiest people in America and the largest corporations, and  it would raise taxes on middle-income families. If that seems like  contrary thinking to what most Americans were looking for, it is.   Time and again we are told that the average American needs a helping  hand. I certainly understand that in Illinois and across the Nation.  This tax plan by the Republicans will not help working families. At  best, it gives them a temporary tax cut, which later ends up as a tax  increase.   However, if you happen to be among the wealthiest of Americans, there  is good news in the Republican plan. There will be substantial tax cuts  in permanent law. So the help for working families is temporary, the  help for wealthy families is permanent, and the help for corporations  is permanent.   To put it in perspective from the corporate point of view, we can  understand those who argue that lowering taxes on businesses will  incentivize them to expand their businesses. Yet there are a couple of  things we have to acknowledge. As a percentage of the gross domestic  product, corporate profits in America have never been higher. As a  percentage of gross domestic product, corporate taxes paid have never  been lower. Profits are at their highest, taxes are at their lowest,  and the Republicans come to us and say: Well, clearly, what we need to  do is to cut corporate taxes again. I disagree.   I asked Secretary Mnuchin at a hearing: Shouldn't our goal be to not  only have a growing economy but to have more fairness in the economy  for working families who continue to put in the hours and put in the  work and watch their own wealth and their own income really fall behind  against the expenses they face? Well, he agreed with my conclusion, but  he couldn't explain how the Republican tax plan would meet that goal. I  don't think it does.   I do not exaggerate when I say that this is a tax cut by the  Republicans for the wealthiest. The nonpartisan Joint Committee on  Taxation analysis of the Republican bill shows that by 2027, as  corporations are enjoying a huge tax cut, on average, taxpayers who  earn less than $75,000 a year will see their taxes go up under the  Republican plan.   You think: Oh, that must have been a press release from the  Democratic National Committee. No, it was an analysis by the Joint  Committee on Taxation, a nonpartisan group that we turn to in order to  measure the impact of tax legislation. It is not the wealthy taxpayers,  not a few taxpayers, not a couple of unfortunate exceptions; on  average, taxpayers at every income bracket earning less than $75,000  would see their taxes increase under the Republican plan.   How would the wealthy fair? Well, it is no surprise that under the  Republican plan, the largest tax cuts under the bill go to the  wealthiest households. I get a lot of letters and emails, telephone  calls and contacts. There aren't a lot of rich people calling me and  saying: We need a tax break, Senator. They are not asking for it. But  they don't have to ask for it when the Republicans are writing a tax  bill.   As Republicans throw huge tax breaks to the wealthiest 1 percent of  Americans, here is what they do: They eliminate the alternative minimum  tax, they lower the top income tax bracket, and they double the  exemption for the estate tax. They go straight after a deduction that  helps one-third of all taxpayers lower their taxes--the State and local  tax deduction. They cut that, but they give these tax breaks to people  who are already millionaires many times over.   The Republican plan would eliminate the State and local tax  deduction--a deduction that helps millions of middle-income families  avoid being taxed twice on their hard-earned income--once at the State  and local level and again at the Federal level. The State of Illinois  is an example--and most other States--where people pay a State income  tax. Currently, taxpayers can deduct that State income tax paid from  any Federal tax liability. The premise is simple: You shouldn't be  taxed on a tax. The Republicans turn that upside down. They would tax  the tax you paid at the State and local level.   Eliminating this vital deduction makes it more expensive for families  to fund local services such as schools, police departments, fire  departments, and local roads and bridges. In my State, which has the  fifth highest number of taxpayers claiming this deduction, nearly 2  million Illinoisans would no longer be able to claim more than $24  billion in State and local tax deductions, as they did in 2015.   So what is the Republican motivation for eliminating this deduction  that is so important for middle-income families? Well, that is how they  pay for the tax cuts for those at the highest income levels, and that  is how they help the largest corporations cut their tax bills.   This is wrong. If there was ever a question about who the Republicans  are writing this plan for, look no further than the changes made during  the committee session when they decided that they wouldn't stop at  merely raising taxes on millions of middle-income families in order to  pay for permanent corporate tax cuts, but they also were willing to  raise families' health insurance premiums. It is not bad enough that  tax bills are going to go up for most middle-income families. Under the  Republican plan, they have devised a way to increase health insurance  premiums at the same time. What a breakthrough.   Republicans can't help themselves. Even in the face of opposition  from the American people, hospitals, patients, nurses, seniors, and  faith leaders, their tax bill would pay for tax cuts for the wealthiest  1 percent by repealing part of the Affordable Care Act.   This change alone means that 13 million Americans will lose their  health insurance, and it means that the health insurance premiums paid  by many others will increase by at least 10 percent a year--perfect.  Not only are they going to raise taxes on working families, but they  are going to raise the cost of health insurance for those buying  policies and eliminate health insurance protection for 13 million  Americans. Thirteen million Americans lose their health insurance, and  millions more see their premiums spike--all to give corporations and  the wealthiest people in America a tax cut.  [[Page S7339]]    To my Republican colleagues I ask: When is it enough? Haven't we  helped the wealthy enough? At least for a day or two, shouldn't we  focus on middle-income families?   Sadly, the threat to working families doesn't stop with a hike to  their tax bill. In order to find even more money to fund tax cuts for  corporations and the highest earners in America, Republicans agreed to  add $1.5 trillion to the national deficit--$1.5 trillion. How many  times have we heard Members of Congress--usually on the Republican side  of the aisle--come to the floor and pose for holy pictures when it  comes to the national debt? Well, they certainly have a lot of sermons  to deliver when they have a Democratic President, but they suffer from  political amnesia when they have a Republican President. Now they are  going to add $1.5 trillion to the national debt to give tax breaks to  wealthy people and big corporations.   I have served in this body for many years. I have heard lecture after  lecture from Republicans, until they are red in the face, about the  importance of fiscal responsibility. I have listened to my Republican  colleagues speak at length about the need for spending offsets. They  wanted spending offsets for food stamps for hungry Americans. They  wanted spending offsets for Hurricane Sandy victims when the hurricane  hit the New York, New Jersey area. They wanted offsets for Meals on  Wheels for seniors.   Where are these deficit hawks now? The Director of the Office of  Management and Budget, Mr. Mulvaney, who made a name for himself while  in Congress railing against increasing the debt ceiling, is now  advocating for the Republican tax plan saying: ``We need to have new  deficits.'' Spare me.   I have heard the calls from Majority Leader McConnell, who once  asked: ``At what point do we anticipate getting serious here about  doing something about deficit and debt?'' Those are the words of  Senator McConnell.   To that Senator and my Republican colleagues I say: How about now?   So-called fiscally conservative Republicans are hiding behind widely  debunked economic growth projections and the so-called ``dynamic  scoring,'' arguing that what looks like a $1.5 trillion increase to the  deficit will not actually be one.   The appropriately named ``Laffer Curve'' suggested that if you cut  taxes on the wealthy, everybody gets well. It didn't work then, when he  proposed it. It hasn't worked since, and it will not work now. Yet the  Republicans find this as the only refuge for their increase to the  deficit.   Over the weekend, however, it was announced that the Joint Committee  on Taxation wouldn't have the time to produce a so-called dynamic score  for the bill before the Senate.   So let me understand this. Not only did Republicans vote to explode  the deficit, but now they don't want to wait to see whether their weak  defense for this fiscally irresponsible plan will actually work? This  is hypocrisy. Maybe it is because Republicans know, as well as the  American people, just how hollow their promises are on junk economics.   Do you want a preview of what dynamic scoring will hold? Last week  the Penn-Wharton Budget Model released an analysis that shows that the  Senate bill would fail the Republicans' own test, even when using their  so-called dynamic scoring. Make no mistake, once this happens,  Republicans will waste no time in making up the difference by calling  for devastating cuts to America's vital programs.   The Republican budget even spells this out for us--where they are  going to turn when their approach falls apart. Here is how they are  going to do it. They are going to do it on the backs of hard-working  Americans, with more than $1 trillion of cuts in Medicaid, and--hang on  tight--$470 billion worth of cuts in Medicare.   The harmful impact to seniors and low- and middle-income families and  some of the Nation's most vulnerable from these budgetary cuts  apparently justify to them the $1.5 trillion deficit hole they are  going to create with this tax plan helping the wealthiest people in  America.   Under our current law, known as the pay-as-you-go law, harmful cuts  could start as soon as January, if this bill is passed.   Republicans are determined to have a ``win'' before the end of the  year. That is because if you were suffering from insomnia and following  the Senate business over the course of last year, you have to wonder  why we were here. In the course of the year, two things happened of any  moment. No. 1, there was filling a vacancy on the Supreme Court, and I  will save my analysis of that for another day. No. 2, there was the  passage of the Defense authorization bill. That is it--two things, 1  year.    So the Republicans, before we leave for the so-called holiday recess,  want to have a feather in their cap. They want to be able to point to  the fact that they have actually passed something. They are saying to  their Members that this is a life-or-death proposal: We have to pass  this or we will not be able to point to hardly anything that we did  during the course of 1 year under Republican control of the Senate.  That is why they are determined to do this, and do it quickly.   The Republicans' irresponsible deficit spending under this plan will  trigger $150 billion in automatic cuts to mandatory spending each year  for the next decade. It includes regular cuts to Medicare.   To my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, you just can't have  it both ways. You can't claim to be fiscally responsible and then vote  for a plan that includes billions of dollars in budget gimmicks that  would explode the deficit by up to $1.5 trillion over the first 10  years and beyond, even with this great dynamic scoring theory that you  are trying to sell. You can't claim to make a tax plan that prioritizes  small business and then spend hundreds of billions of dollars giving  huge multinational corporations--already enjoying record profits--a  massive tax cut as well.   I might add that the Republican tax bill creates incentives-- incentives for American corporations to move overseas, to take American  jobs overseas. Why in the world would we create a tax code incentive  for that to happen?   You can't choose to make the corporate tax cuts permanent at the  expense of protecting working Americans and then still claim that this  plan is going to help those same families. It is based on nothing more  than a wink and a promise to extend half a trillion dollars in middle- income tax cuts that no one wants to pay for.   You can't pretend to be above special interest and then include a  provision in this tax bill--in the tax bill--that would open drilling  leases for 800,000 acres of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge--one of  America's last pristine, untouched wilderness places, home to more than  200 wildlife species, and deserving of preservation.   I have come to the floor over the course of many years in debate  about the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Senator Ted Stevens used to  sit in that chair, and he couldn't wait until I finished my speech. He  would stand up and say: The Senator from Illinois--he would point at  me--doesn't even know where the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is. He  has never been there. He has no idea what is going on up there. So he  should not stand up on the floor and say things that he can't back up  with his own personal experience and knowledge.   What I did at that point was that I decided I was going to call his  bluff. So I picked up and went up to the Arctic National Wildlife  Refuge. I took a bush plane in and camped out overnight in the refuge.  I trekked around. I took a look for myself so that I could back up some  of the things I said on the floor.   We were right on the Canning River. You could look across the river  at parts of the Refuge that were managed by the State of Alaska. On  this side of the river where we camped, it was managed as a national  wildlife refuge. There was a dramatic difference. Roadways had been  built on the State side but not on the Federal side. We had a pristine  refuge area. The net result was really beautiful and impressive.   I couldn't wait to get back to the floor to debate Senator Stevens  since I had been there. I came back for the next debate. He never  raised the question again about whether I had been there. So I didn't  get to give the speech on the floor.   To give up all of this land to drill for oil at a time when we are  saying to the Middle East that we don't need their oil as much as we  have in the past, to  [[Page S7340]]  drill for gas when fracking is finding natural gas in areas all over  the continental United States hardly makes sense. It certainly doesn't  if you have ever been there and seen this beautiful piece of real  estate.   I think the American people know what the Republicans had in mind  with this plan. It really does help their deep-pocketed donors. Some  Republicans in the House have been very open about this. One New York  Republican Congressman said: Our donor said don't come back unless you  give me a tax break. He is very honest about that, but, as far as I am  concerned, that shouldn't be the motivation for passing tax reform.   One of the Republican donors I referred to--and I quote him  directly--said: ``My donors are basically saying, `Get it done or don't  ever call me again.''' Another one said: ``Financial contributions will  stop'' if the Republican tax plan doesn't pass. Thank goodness for  their honesty and candor.   There are special interests that will do well under this Republican  plan, and wealthy people as well, but I think it is time for us to look  at this plan, look at it clearly, and understand the negative impacts  it is going to have on working Americans.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the nomination of  Greg Katsas to the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, but I want to begin  with some general observations.   This year, the Republican-controlled Senate has repeatedly fallen  short when it comes to serving as a meaningful check and balance in our  constitutional system. Senate Republicans have abandoned longstanding  norms of due diligence and careful scrutiny, all in the name of  advancing the agenda of President Trump.   We saw this when Senate Republicans voted in near lockstep to confirm  President Trump's Cabinet nominees. Republicans simply looked the other  way when nominees failed to pay all of their taxes, did not disclose  millions in assets, had conflicts of interest, or could not even answer  basic questions at their hearings. Senate Republicans have repeatedly  tried to rush through partisan bills in the dark of night. Remember  when they revealed the text of the TrumpCare bill just a few hours  before the Senate voted on it? Now Senate Republicans are trying to  pass massive tax cuts for the largest corporations and wealthiest  Americans, by ramming through an enormous bill with little debate and  public scrutiny of how the bill would explode the deficit and raise  taxes on many in the working class.   This pattern, of the Senate abandoning its responsibility to do basic  due diligence when it comes to the agenda of President Trump, has also  infected our process of considering judicial nominees. When it comes to  President Trump's judicial nominees, we are seeing the Senate's  constitutional responsibility of ``advice and consent'' turn into  ``rush through and rubberstamp.''   All year, Senate Republicans have been removing guardrails that help  ensure that judicial nominees have the qualifications, temperament, and  integrity that we need for lifetime appointments to the Federal bench.  Don't just take it from me. Take it from the conservative Wall Street  Journal. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a  November 20 article from the Wall Street Journal entitled ``Checks on  Trump's Court Picks Fall Away'' at the conclusion of my remarks.   This article talks about the series of procedural changes Senate  Republicans have made this year to expedite Trump's judicial  nominations--most recently, the November 16 announcement by Senator  Grassley, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, that he would hold  hearings on nominees who do not receive positive blue slips from both  home-State Senators, something that never happened under the Obama  administration. The article begins by saying:         The Republican head of the Senate Judiciary Committee has       curtailed one of the last legislative limits on a president's       power to shape the federal courts, giving Donald Trump more       freedom than any U.S. president in modern times to install       his judges of choice, legal experts said.    Consider the other changes Republicans have already made in just the  first year of the Trump administration.  [[Page S7345]]    First, President Trump subcontracted the selection of Supreme Court  nominees out to rightwing special interest groups like the Federalist  Society. President Trump publicly thanked the Federalist Society for  assembling a list of candidates from which Justice Neil Gorsuch was  selected. The White House even asked Leonard Leo of the Federalist  Society to call Justice Gorsuch to let him know he was a candidate for  the job. Never before had a President credited a special interest group  with serving as a de facto selection committee for the Federal  judiciary. For anyone who wonders what the Federalist Society is all  about, I urge you to watch the video of this group laughing and  applauding at their convention a few weeks ago when Attorney General  Sessions joked about meeting with Russians. It was shameful.   Senate Republicans also changed the rules of the Senate in order to  get Neil Gorsuch confirmed. He couldn't get 60 votes on the Senate  floor, so the Republicans changed the rules to make 50 votes the  threshold for appointments to the Supreme Court.   When it comes to lower-court nominees, the Trump administration and  Senate Republicans are doing half-hearted vetting at best. We are  constantly learning information that nominees initially failed to  disclose. For example, Alabama District Court nominee Brett Talley  failed to disclose that his wife was an attorney in the White House  Counsel's Office and that Talley had apparently posted online comments  defending the early KKK and calling for shooting death row inmates.  Court of Federal Claims nominee Damien Schiff failed to disclose that  he had called Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy a ``judicial  prostitute'' in a blog post. North Carolina District Court nominee  Thomas Farr reportedly failed to fully disclose his role in an African- American voter suppression effort during the 1990 campaign for Senator  Jesse Helms. Yet all of these nominees were reported out of the  Judiciary Committee on party line votes.   There are other changes that Republicans have made to the nominations  process this year. Republicans have decided not to wait for the  American Bar Association to do their nonpartisan peer review of a  nominee's qualifications before holding a hearing. When the ABA  unanimously finds nominees not to be qualified, Republicans still  support the nominees anyway. Republicans have also begun regularly  holding hearings on two circuit court nominees at a time. Why?  Apparently, they are afraid to let each of their nominees stand on  their own two feet and face questioning from Senators individually. The  circuit courts have the final word on tens of thousands of cases every  year. Every single lifetime appointment to these courts deserves to be  scrutinized on its own individual merits.   Furthermore, Judiciary Committee Republicans are looking to relax the  standards for nominees with a history of past drug use. Republicans  repeatedly blocked judicial candidates proposed by President Obama who  had smoked marijuana in the past, but Republicans now want a more  lenient standard for Trump nominees. I am open to a different standard,  but it must not be a double standard for Democratic versus Republican  nominees.   That takes us to the changes to the blue slip. Republicans now want  to disregard this 100-year-old tradition--meaning they will ignore the  vetting that home-State Senators do for nominees from their State.  Remember, blue slips were respected throughout the Obama  administration. Republicans sent a letter in 2009 asking President  Obama to respect blue slips, and he did. Republicans then proceeded to  block 18 Obama nominees by withholding blue slips. Now, Republicans  have announced that they are doing a 180-degree turn for Trump nominees  and that they will disregard blue slips whenever they feel like it.    Why are Republicans abandoning so many longstanding traditions and  guardrails when it comes to judicial nominations? It is because many of  President Trump's nominees simply wouldn't pass muster under the  traditional ground rules. Many Trump nominees have minimal experience,  a history of ideologically biased statements, serious questions about  their temperament and judgment, or a lack of independence from  President Trump. Senate Republicans want to rubberstamp these nominees  anyway--and confirm them as quickly as possible in their effort to pack  the courts.   Just look at some of the judicial nominees who have already been  confirmed this year--like John Bush, confirmed to sit on the Sixth  Circuit, who blogged about the false claim that President Obama wasn't  born in the United States and said at his hearing that he thinks  impartiality is an aspiration for a judge, not an expectation; or  Stephanos Bibas, now a judge on the Third Circuit, who wrote a lengthy  paper calling for corporal punishment, including putting offenders in  the stocks or pillory and applying multiple calibrated electroshocks.   Now, consider DC Circuit nominee Greg Katsas, who is before us today.  Mr. Katsas works in the White House for President Trump. He is a Deputy  White House Counsel. He testified that he has been personally involved  in many of the Trump administration's most controversial policies,  ranging from the Muslim travel ban to the creation of the Pence-Kobach  election commission, to ending the DACA program, to the Trump  administration's rollback of protections for LGBTQ-Americans.   Mr. Katsas also said that, while working for President Trump, he has  given legal advice regarding the Emoluments Clause, advised on the  administration's efforts to cut off Federal public safety funds to  cities because of disagreements over immigration enforcement, and even  provided legal advice on the Special Counsel's Russia investigation.   This is a laundry list of Trump administration controversies that Mr.  Katsas has been personally involved with. It is likely that many of  these issues will end up in litigation before the DC Circuit. I don't  think appointing President Trump's staff lawyer to the DC Circuit will  strengthen the American people's confidence in the fairness of our  justice system. Instead, we need nominees with a strong track record of  independence and good judgment.   Let me talk for a minute about Mr. Katsas's judgment.   At his hearing, I asked Mr. Katsas some simple questions about the  torture technique known as waterboarding. I was deeply troubled by his  answers. I asked him if waterboarding is torture. He said, ``I hesitate  to answer the question in the abstract, not knowing the circumstances,  the nature of the program.'' I asked him if waterboarding is cruel,  inhuman, and degrading treatment. I noted that Senator John McCain, the  author of the 2006 law that made it clear that cruel, inhuman, and  degrading treatment is illegal, has said ``waterboarding, under any  circumstances, represents a clear violation of U.S. law''--so did all  four Judge Advocates General--the top lawyers in the military--during  the Bush administration. But Mr. Katsas responded evasively, saying  ``anything that is cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment would be  clearly unlawful.'' I then asked Mr. Katsas is waterboarding illegal  under U.S. law. He said ``to the extent it constitutes either torture  or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment, yes it is.''   What a pack of weasel words. Mr. Katsas's tortured logic about  waterboarding is unacceptable. Mr. Katsas should have said, with no  equivocation and no uncertainty, that waterboarding is illegal, that it  is cruel, inhuman, and degrading and that it is torture. That is the  law, and a Federal judge should know it.   I am concerned that Mr. Katsas's refusal to give those answers  reflects a troubling ideological viewpoint when it comes to questions  of torture and interrogation techniques. My concerns were amplified by  a speech Mr. Katsas gave in April 2009 when his speech notes said  ``high bar--a lot of coercive interrogation does not equal torture.''   This is a clear-cut issue for me. I have voted against nominees in  the past who gave the wrong answers to questions about waterboarding,  and I will do it again. In my view, Mr. Katsas has not demonstrated the  independence and judgment that we need for the critical position of DC  Circuit judge. I cannot support his nomination.  [[Page S7346]]    Here is the bottom line. Before I was a Senator, I was a lawyer in  downstate Illinois, and I looked up to Federal judges. I thought that,  to get that job, you had to be a cut above. Otherwise, you wouldn't  make it through the Senate's rigorous advice and consent process.  Sadly, this Republican Senate is turning advice and consent into ``rush  through and rubberstamp.'' Republicans want to pack the courts with  judges who will support President Trump's agenda, and so they are  hurrying to confirm as many of his picks as possible--even if they are  unqualified, ideological, hiding things from the Senate, or too close  to President Trump. Our Federal judiciary is being diminished as a  result.   I wish my Republican colleagues would stand up for an independent  judiciary and a meaningful advice and consent process. We should fill  this vacancy on the DC Circuit with someone who is independent of  President Trump, not one of his staff attorneys. We should choose  nominees who are unafraid to say what the law is on torture, instead of  what they might wish the law to be.   I urge my colleagues to vote no on the Katsas nomination.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:               [From the Wall Street Journal, Nov. 20, 2017]                  Checks on Trump's Court Picks Fall Away                      (Joe Palazzolo and Ashby Jones)   Move to curtail `blue slips' gives the president, and successors, wide                     leeway in picks for federal bench         The Republican head of the Senate Judiciary Committee has       curtailed one of the last legislative limits on a president's       power to shape the federal courts, giving Donald Trump more       freedom than any U.S. president in modern times to install       his judges of choice, legal experts said.        Last week, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R., Iowa) reined in a       tradition that empowered senators to block federal appeals-      court nominees from their home state. His decision came about       four years after Democrats, citing Republican filibusters of       President Barack Obama's circuit-court nominees, eliminated a       Senate rule that required the majority party to mount 60       votes to advance a nominee to a confirmation vote.        Together, the threat of a filibuster--or delaying tactic--      and use of ``blue slips''--so named because senators indicate       support or opposition to nominees on blue slips of paper--      guarded against lifetime appointments for nominees deemed far       outside the mainstream, court experts said. Getting rid of       these checks could foment distrust in judges' work if Mr.       Trump and later presidents prioritize ideology over       experience or legal talent, some of the experts said.        ``When judges lose legitimacy in the public eye, they lose       the ability to enforce unpopular decisions,'' said Arthur       Hellman, an expert on the federal judiciary and law professor       at the University of Pittsburgh. ``And that's when you see an       unraveling in the rule of law.''        Others said the changes were part of a natural progression       away from Senate traditions that allowed the minority party       to stall nominations for partisan reasons.        ``If you're not a fan of the Senate-wide filibuster, you're       probably not a fan of a filibuster by one senator,'' said       Ilya Shapiro, a senior fellow in constitutional studies at       the Cato Institute, referring to the practice of senators       blocking nominees from their states.        So far, the Republican-controlled Senate Judiciary       Committee has approved two nominees pronounced unfit to serve       by the American Bar Association, including Brett Talley, a       Justice Department lawyer who has never argued a motion in       federal court and whose wife is the chief of staff for the       top White House lawyer.        ``If Senate Republicans will confirm him, then there is no       realistic sense of checks and balances,'' said Christopher       Kang, who worked on judicial nominations in the Obama White       House.        The White House declined to address criticisms of Mr.       Talley.        The ABA's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary has       deemed two other Trump nominees ``not qualified''--ratings       Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee dismissed as       the product of what they called a liberal advocacy group.        The ABA has rejected that criticism, saying it has rated       potential judges for more than 60 years, drawing on dozens       and sometimes hundreds of interviews with a nominee's       colleagues and other peers.        Hogan Gidley, a White House spokesman, said Mr. Trump has       delivered on his promise to nominate ``highly qualified       judges.''        ``We appreciate the hard work of Chairman Grassley and       [Senate Majority Leader Mitch] McConnell, and we urge the       Senate to confirm all of the remaining nominees because it's       what the American people deserve,'' he said in an emailed       statement.        Mr. Grassley said on Thursday that he would hold a hearing       on two nominees--David Stras, a nominee to the midwestern       Eighth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, and Kyle Duncan, a       nominee to the Fifth Circuit in New Orleans--over the       objections of home-state senators Al Franken of Minnesota, a       Democrat, and John Kennedy of Louisiana, a Republican.        The blue-slip practice began in the 1910s and, for a large       portion of its history, ``gave Senators the ability to       determine the fate of their home-state judicial       nominations,'' the Congressional Research Service, a research       arm Congress, said in a 2003 report.        Mr. Grassley said that after his recent move, a negative       blue slip would be a ``significant factor'' for the committee       to consider but wouldn't prevent a hearing, a break with the       practice of Senate Judiciary Committee chairmen since at       least 2005.        He blamed the Democrats for abusing the blue slip after       eschewing the filibuster.        ``The Democrats seriously regret that they abolished the       filibuster, as I warned them they would. But they can't       expect to use the blue-slip courtesy in its place. That's not       what the blue slip is meant for,'' he said on the Senate       floor last week.        Mr. Grassley also has parted with common practice by       stacking two circuit court nominees in a single confirmation       hearing, reducing time for preparation and questions, and       holding hearings before the ABA finished its judicial       evaluations.        ``Taken together, it's clear that Republicans want to       remake our courts by jamming through President Trump's       nominees as quickly as possible,'' said Sen. Dianne Feinstein       (D., Calif.), the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary       Committee, in an emailed statement.        The median time from nomination to Senate confirmation for       circuit-court nominees was less than a month in the       administrations of presidents Lyndon Johnson and Richard       Nixon, said Russell Wheeler, a visiting fellow at the       Brookings Institution who studies federal courts. That number       rose through the 1980s and 1990s and ballooned to 229 days       during President Barack Obama's two terms, he said.
