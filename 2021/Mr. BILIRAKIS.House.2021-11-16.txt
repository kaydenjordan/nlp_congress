 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss the dangerous  situation at our southern border.   Since President Biden took office, there have been over 1.4 million  illegal border crossings. These record-high apprehensions keep  increasing with no end in sight, and now a new caravan of migrants is  headed through Mexico to our southern border, as we speak.   Instead of addressing what has become a humanitarian, health, and  national security problem, this administration and congressional  Democrats keep announcing plans that will only exacerbate the problem.   For example, the administration has discussed paying illegal  immigrants settlement payments of up to $450,000, and the spending  package being pushed through this Chamber includes amnesty for up to 10  million illegal immigrants and up to $100 billion in taxpayer-funded  benefits for them.   These irresponsible proposals and dangerous open border policies will  continue to fuel the crisis and encourage more illegal activity at the  border. We must secure our borders and ensure that the rule of law  applies to everyone.                            ____________________
