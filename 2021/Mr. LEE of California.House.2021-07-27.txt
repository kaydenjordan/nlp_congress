 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this  amendment which strikes language that allows funds to go to  universities researching cannabis. We should not be afraid of data and  research. As Co-Chair of the Congressional Cannabis Caucus, we should  be encouraging expanding our knowledge--not limiting it.   Politicians should not be stifling academic freedom.   I am proud to represent California-13 which includes some of the best  research institutes in the country, UC Berkeley and Lawrence Berkeley  Labs. None of us should want to withhold funds from our institutions  and constituents because a university wants to do scientific research  on a plant. UC Berkeley has one of the only cannabis research centers  in the country and these prohibitions just tie the hands of our  professors, researchers, and students by imposing restrictions on  funding and essentially silencing them.   I urge my colleagues to vote no against this anti-science amendment  and to vote no against academic freedom.
