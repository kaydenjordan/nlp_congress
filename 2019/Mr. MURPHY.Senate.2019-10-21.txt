 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I want to tell you a quick story about a  woman from Atlanta. Her name is Dawn Jones. Dawn bought what is  commonly referred to in the insurance industry as a short-term health  insurance plan. She brought it from the Golden Rule Insurance Company,  [[Page S5910]]  which is a unit of UnitedHealth, and she needed it because she needed  some coverage in between jobs. She was then diagnosed with breast  cancer, and she went through a heartbreaking experience, trying to get  her insurance company to cover her for her $400,000 medical bill.   In the end, she could not get her short-term health insurance plan to  cover her breast cancer treatments, and here is the reason why. The  insurer didn't need to cover preexisting conditions. Short-term plans  do not need to cover things we traditionally think of as healthcare  insurance today. The protections of the Affordable Care Act require  that insurance cover you regardless of whether you are diagnosed with a  serious disease, but short-term plans don't need to cover you for those  things.   This short-term plan didn't cover her breast cancer, despite the fact  that she wasn't diagnosed with breast cancer until after she signed up  for the plan. So you may ask: Why is that a preexisting condition if  she wasn't diagnosed with breast cancer until she was on this short- term plan?   Well, the insurer in this case made a very innovative argument. It  said that she actually had the cancer before she signed up for  insurance. So even though she didn't know she had cancer and even  though she hadn't been diagnosed with cancer, because she technically  had cancer before she got the insurance plan, she had a preexisting  condition, and, thus, they would not cover her.   This is a pretty typical story about what happens on these short-term  insurance plans in this country. They are more commonly referred to  these days as junk insurance plans because, for millions of Americans  who sign up for short-term insurance, they find out that it really  doesn't cover much of anything.   One Golden Rule plan excludes pregnancy and provides a lifetime  maximum benefit of $250,000. That is, by the way, an incredibly low  amount of lifetime coverage--$250,000. One hospital stay for a serious  illness can be over $250,000. And the icing on the cake--this  particular junk plan from Golden Rule doesn't cover a hospital room or  nursing services for patients admitted on a Friday or Saturday. So good  luck if you get sick on a Friday or Saturday because you are not going  to get coverage on those 2 days of the week. These are junk plans  because they don't cover what you need, and you, by and large, don't  find out about that until you actually need the insurance.   How about a gentleman from San Antonio who actually had his short- term plan for about 6 years? He had been paying it and paying it for 6  years. Because they are technically short-term plans, he was renewing  them over and over and over again, and when he was diagnosed with  kidney disease, they wouldn't cover him because they went back to his  medical records and found out that he had some blood work done earlier  that had shown the initial signs of kidney disease, but he wasn't  diagnosed until later on.   What they said--just as they did for the woman in Atlanta--was this:  Because you had signs of kidney disease when you were insured with us a  year ago, we are not going to cover you now because, technically, you  are on a new plan.   He had been getting a plan every 6 months every year. He didn't have  any gaps in insurance, but because he technically was signing up for  short-term plan after short-term plan, he didn't get covered for his  kidney disease.   Over and over, we hear these stories about individuals who go on  these junk plans and then find out that they can't get insured for  anything--can't get insured for hospital stays on Fridays and  Saturdays, can't get insured for mental health treatment, no  prescription drug benefits, no coverage for maternity, and all sorts of  backbending activity to try to stop people from getting coverage for  illnesses.   Yet these plans are becoming more and more prolific. Why is that? The  reason is that the Trump administration is using an innovative method  to try to get more Americans to sign up for these junk plans, and that  is what I wanted to come to the floor and talk about today.   These junk plans are a nightmare for people who get on them and then  find themselves on the outside of coverage. When you sign up for health  insurance, you basically think it is going to cover a set of things  like hospital stays on weekends and coverage for your cancer diagnosis,  but these junk plans don't cover those things.   The administration has decided to use a section of the Affordable  Care Act that was designed to strengthen our healthcare system and,  instead, use it to weaken the healthcare insurance system by providing  for more and more of these junk plans.    Here is a little bit of legislative history. There is a section of  the ACA that was set up so that you could apply to the State for a  waiver to improve coverage. The waiver says that you can do some  innovative things in the ACA so long as you prove that whatever you are  going to do is going to provide health coverage that is just as  comprehensive as what is required under the ACA, that you are not going  to cost consumers any more than what they are paying under the ACA,  that the number of people who are insured under the ACA in your State  isn't going to down--it is going to stay stable or go up--and you are  not going to increase the Federal deficit.   Well, President Trump, in October of 2018, issued new guidance that  essentially guts all of those protections for these waivers. President  Trump basically says that these short-term insurance plans can be  approved, even if they cost people more, even if they don't cover  things like preexisting conditions, and even if they result in fewer  people getting insurance.   This October 2018 guidance allowed for these junk plans to be sold in  more States to more consumers. Even worse, the 2018 guidance said that  these junk plans could be sold side by side with the Affordable Care  Act plans right on the same web page, disguising the fact that some  plans would actually cover you for your preexisting conditions and  others wouldn't.   So, today, we have more and more of these junk plans available to  individuals and more people who are vulnerable to all of the old abuses  that used to happen left and right in the healthcare insurance system,  largely to people who have pretty serious illnesses.   Now, 130 million Americans have a preexisting condition. In my State,  over a half million people have some sort of preexisting condition. If  they sign up for one of these junk plans--either because they were  marketed the plan under the belief that it would cover them or by  mistake because they didn't notice the difference between the ACA- regulated plans and the junk plans on the website that they went to-- they are at risk of not getting covered for their preexisting  condition.   It gets even worse than that because what economists tell us is that  these junk plans, which cover very little, are admittedly going to be  attractive to some people who are presently pretty healthy. Young  people and people who don't have any preexisting conditions may sign up  for those junk plans because it doesn't really matter to them at the  time that they don't get coverage for much at all; the junk plans are  going to have prices that are lower, in most instances, than the plans  that cover basic healthcare services. In the short term, that might be  OK for the people who are relatively healthy until, of course, they get  sick and find out that their junk plan doesn't cover anything. But for  the people who have preexisting conditions, who can't sign up for the  junk plans, and who need to be on the plans that are regulated by the  Affordable Care Act, their premiums are going to skyrocket.   This is health insurance 101. As more healthy people go to the junk  plans, leaving behind on the Affordable Care Act plans folks who have  these preexisting conditions, their prices will go up.   The Trump administration's junk plan rule is, frankly, bad news for a  lot of people who are on junk plans if and when they actually need  healthcare insurance, but it is also really terrible news for the 130  million Americans who have preexisting conditions, who are likely going  to see their insurance rates skyrocket.   Next week we are going to have a vote on the floor of the U.S.  Senate, a vote on a resolution of disapproval for the administration's  junk plan guidance. I have listened for a long time to  [[Page S5911]]  Members of the Senate on both sides of the aisle talk about how the one  thing we agree on is that we need to protect people with preexisting  conditions, and though many of our Republican colleagues might not  support the Affordable Care Act, they do agree that we should support  people with preexisting conditions, which I generally read to mean that  we should make sure we don't pass legislation and we don't let the  administration do anything that will make it even harder than it  already is to live with a cancer diagnosis or a diagnosis of serious  heart disease.   Yet it is completely clear that the Trump administration's guidance  is going to make life a lot worse for people with preexisting  conditions, for those who go on the junk plans, and for those who stay  behind.   Here is a quote from an article in The Atlantic magazine, which did a  summary of these junk plans and what they are like and, frankly, how  important they are to insurance companies. The article says that these  short-term junk plans ``make up a high-profit portion'' of the  insurance industry's business.         They are largely designed to rake in premiums, even as they       offer little in return. And even when they do pay for things,       they often provide confusing or conflicting protocols for       making claims. Collectively, short-term plans can leave       thousands of people functionally uninsured or underinsured       without addressing or lowering real systemwide costs.    That is the story of junk plans. They are a pretty good deal for the  insurance industry, which is why they have been pushing the Trump  administration to allow more of these junk plans to be sold. They are a  good deal for the insurance companies because ultimately they don't  require the insurance companies to pay out a lot in benefits, but they  ultimately make a ton for the insurance companies in the premiums they  collect.   It is time for everybody in this body who has stood up and said that  they support individuals with preexisting conditions to vote that way.  Next week, we will have an opportunity to stop in its tracks the Trump  administration's rule allowing for more of these junk plans to be sold  to consumers. Because we know the House of Representatives will join  us, we now have the chance to actually do something about it and stop  this erosion of healthcare for people with preexisting conditions  before it is too late.   I get that the country and this Congress are rightly consumed with  the ongoing scandal surrounding the impeachment inquiry and the recent  heartbreaking, unconscionable events in Syria, but that doesn't mean  folks in our States are as concerned with those headline-grabbing  issues as we are. They still have to make their budgets balance every  single month, and they are deeply worried--at least those families I  talked to in Connecticut who are still struggling with serious  illnesses--about our ability to make sure the protections for  preexisting conditions, which were a lifeline for millions of Americans  when we passed the Affordable Care Act, are not undermined by this  President. We have a chance to step up and do something about it next  week.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
