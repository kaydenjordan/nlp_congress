 Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate Texas  Independence Day. One hundred and eighty-five years ago today, on March  2, 1836, the Republic of Texas declared our independence from the  nation of Mexico. Fifty-nine delegates who adopted the Texas  Declaration of Independence on that day gathered at Washington-on-the- Brazos. The delegates adopted a declaration, modeled in significant  parts after the Declaration of Independence of the United States.   The declaration decried the arbitrary acts of oppression and tyranny  from the Mexican Government under the dictator General Santa Anna. In  particular, it noted that that government had ``ceased to protect the  lives, liberty, and property of the people from whom its legitimate  powers are derived.'' And the Texans signing that declaration sought to  protect their rights of free speech, their rights to keep and bear  arms, and their rights of freedom of religion.   Signing that declaration commenced the Texas Revolution, our battle  for independence, where we won independence from the nation of Mexico.  And for 9 years, the State of Texas became the Republic of Texas, an  independent nation. That, of course, ceased in 1845, when we joined the  United States. And today, we celebrate that spirit of independence that  is still found throughout all 29 million Texans    I withhold my request.                            ____________________
