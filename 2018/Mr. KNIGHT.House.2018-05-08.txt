 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for his leadership. I  thank Mr. Lawson and Ranking Member Velazquez for their leadership in  this very, very important measure.   Mr. Speaker, I do rise today in support of the Women's Business  Centers Improvements Act of 2018.   I introduced H.R. 1680 so that the outstanding growth our country has  seen within women's entrepreneurship within the last decade can  continue.   Over the last 10 years, the number of women-owned small businesses  has increased by 114 percent. With women-owned firms growing more than  two and a half times faster than the average business, we must  recognize women entrepreneurs as a driving force in the U.S. economy.   The legislation modernizes both the Small Business Administration's  Office of Women's Business Ownership and the SBA's Women's Business  Centers program.   The Office of Women's Business Ownership administers the grant  program that funds women's business centers. H.R. 1680 would require  consistent standards and application requirements for grant recipients,  ensuring that those centers have the ability to provide women with  small business counseling and training.   The bill also institutes commonsense oversight requirements,  standards for continued funding, and conditions of participation. This  will increase congressional accountability and responsibility.   H.R. 1680 will allow millions of women throughout the country  continued access to reliable and effective small business resources.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1680.
