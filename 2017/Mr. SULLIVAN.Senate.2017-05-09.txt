 Mr. President, every week I have been coming to the  floor to recognize someone in my State who has made a difference,  someone who has devoted time and energy to making my State a better  place to live for others. We call these individuals our Alaskan of the  Week.   As I have said repeatedly, I believe my State is the most beautiful  State in the country. We have visitors. We want to welcome more and  more visitors. Come on up. I guarantee it will be the trip of a  lifetime.   When you go to Alaska, one town that nobody should miss is Homer, AK.  It is surrounded by the glistening waters of Kachemak Bay, jagged  mountains, glaciers, and snowcapped volcanoes. Some people call it the  Halibut Fishing Capital of the World. Others call it the Cosmic Hamlet  by the Sea. Some, like me, call it a slice of Heaven.   I was there a few weeks ago holding a community meeting. I thanked  them then, and I want to thank them all today for the very warm welcome  I received.   I also wish to thank Homer for the very warm welcome they gave to  Navy destroyer USS Hopper, which spent a few days in Homer before  participating in a joint naval exercise with the Army in the Gulf of  Alaska. The 300-member crew of the USS Hopper was greeted by hundreds  of cheering, flag-waving Homer residents. The commander of the Hopper,  J.D. Gainey, wrote that in his 24 years of naval service, ``I have  never seen as much patriotism as we enjoyed in Homer.'' Thank you,  Homer, from all of us. Alaskans love Homer.   They see it for the landscape but also for the people. It is a tight- knit community. They might not always agree with one another,  particularly with regard to politics, but they look out for each other.  Like any community with a heart, they look out for their animals.   This week I want to recognize a special person as our Alaskan of the  week, Sherry Bess, who spent nearly 30 years--three decades--taking  care of Homer's animals as the manager of the Homer Animal Shelter. In  1989, when Sherry began to volunteer at the pet shelter in Homer, there  was one building, no phone, and only four cages to hold cats. ``It was  basically a shack,'' she said. The snow would come in through the dog  door. The drains in the water bowls would freeze. Sherry's hands and  feet were always cold, and it was infested with mice. There was no  bathroom. Oftentimes, when the shelter was too busy and when the  animals needed extra care, Sherry would take them to her home, where  she would care for them.   Sherry and a handful of residents cared for over 1,200 animals each  year in that little shelter. Along the way, she gathered both happy  stories and heartbreaking stories about the animals she found that were  abused and the ones she found homes for. In fact, one of the members of  my team in Alaska took a puppy that had been abandoned in a crate in  the woods near Homer, took him home, fed him, and Mick Fleagle on my  staff now has a dog. His dog Sookie, 8 years old, has the full reign of  the house. He is loved.    Thanks to Sherry, stories like that abound throughout Homer. For 26  years, she has worked night and day, 7 days a week, for the pets in  that community. She recently stepped down from that job. She is taking  care of her own pets, lots of them--her family she calls them--but she  will always be known to so many people in Homer for what she has done  for their pets and their animals.   ``Over the years, those animals that came to me,'' she said, `` . . .  unwanted and sad and depressed, and then you help them and you love  them and they go to a home and they're loved. That's the most rewarding  thing about what I did.''   Sherry said over the years she has noticed that the residents of  Homer and throughout the country have been kinder to their pets. Part  of that is the result of what Sherry and others like her across the  country do to educate the public on taking care of animals through  vaccinations, neutering. Some of it is more and more because people  like Sherry are considering pets as their families.   So I want to thank Sherry, as our Alaskan of the Week, for all she  has done and for all she has done for pets in our great State. Great  job.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
