 Madam President, reserving the right to object, last  week, Senator Ernst asked unanimous consent to bypass the committee  process and pass her bill. At the time, I committed to work with her  and that we would schedule this bill for a vote at the next Energy and  Natural Resources Committee legislative markup.   That commitment remains. In fact, we are fulfilling it. In fact, just  this morning, both of our staffs were on the National Mall walking  through potential sites with the National Park Service and  representatives from the Foundation to get a better understanding of  the issues associated with the locations proposed in Senator Ernst's  bill.   My goal is to get this memorial built as quickly as possible. I was  the proud lead Democratic sponsor of this legislation to authorize  construction of the National Global War on Terrorism Memorial 4 years  ago and remain just as  [[Page S6813]]  supportive and committed to seeing the memorial built today as I was  then.   It is important that we commemorate and honor the members of the  Armed Forces who served on Active Duty and supported the Global War on  Terrorism. The original legislation authorizing construction of the  Global War on Terrorism Memorial required that the memorial be located  and designed in accordance with the Commemorative Works Act.   The Senator's bill is now proposing to waive a key provision in that  law. I am concerned that trying to legislatively force a memorial into  the Reserve area of the National Mall will result in a more contentious  approval process that will take longer to get the memorial built than  staying with the process that applies to all of our memorials.   I restate my commitment to keep working with Senator Ernst and to  schedule a vote on this bill at the Energy and Natural Resources  Committee's next legislative business meeting so that committee members  can weigh in, which is the process, on with what the appropriate policy  should be.   Again, I remain a very strong supporter of the Global War on  Terrorism Memorial, and I believe that all of our colleagues on the  Republican and Democratic side feel the same. The National Park Service  should give it the highest priority, and they will, in finding an  appropriate site.   But the memorial should be built following the same process--the same  process--that applies to all of our memorials and commemorative works.  I will continue to work with my friend and colleague from Iowa, but I  must respectfully object to the unanimous consent request.    First of all, I want to thank the total commitment and  dedication that my friend from my Iowa has; the same as, I think, all  of us have. But on that, since 2003, when Congress acted about  basically putting a moratorium on the Mall so the Mall would be  preserved for all of us to enjoy, there were some that were still  pending but were allowed to complete. There has not been any new  approved since 2003.   But we have a process, and I respect that, and I am going to work as  hard as I can to make sure that that process is going to be honored and  we go through it in our markup and everyone have input on it. And I  think that is the proper way for us to proceed.   And I appreciate the Senator working and understanding and working  with us. Right now, we just have to continue to do what we are doing  and let this process basically go forth as quickly as possible. That is  my commitment, and I will honor that.    Madam President, my dear friend from Wyoming, we agree  on a lot of things; we just happen to see this one different. We  disagree.   I rise in support of the motion to invoke cloture on a nomination of  Tracy  [[Page S6816]]  Stone-Manning to be the Director of the Bureau of Land Management. I do  so after giving very, very, very careful consideration to this  serious--and I mean serious--allegations that many of our colleagues  have leveled against her.   If there were any truth--a shred of truth--or evidence to support the  charges, I wouldn't be standing here; I couldn't support her. But I  have found no such evidence, and I have looked.   Now, I have said this: Every one of us, we are entitled to our own  opinion here. And we are not bashful to sharing that opinion with  others. We are just not entitled to create our own facts to support our  opinions. That is it. All I am asking for is look at the facts. That is  all.   The facts surrounding the spiking of the trees in the Clearwater  National Forest in March of 1989 are well known. It is public. They are  known because the facts were tried by a jury in a Federal district  court in Spokane, WA, in June of 1993.   I still believe we all believe the rule of law applies to all of us,  and that is who we are. Trial by jury is how we find facts and discover  the truth in this country. That is it. It is the keystone in our  criminal justice system.   A jury heard the evidence in the tree-spiking case. They weighed its  credibility and reached a unanimous verdict that four men spiked the  trees.   I repeat: Four help spiked the trees in the Clearwater National  Forest.   All four of them admitted that they spiked trees. All four of them  admitted they spiked these trees. And each identified the other three  as their accomplice. Each one identified the other.   And you know what. Ms. Stone-Manning was not one of them. None of the  four said she was.   Opponents of her nomination are now seeking to impute the guilt of  the confessed and convicted tree spikers to her. But Ms. Stone-Manning  was never charged with tree spiking. She was never indicted or tried.  There is no evidence in the trial record that she participated in the  tree spiking. Her opponents claim that is because she was given  immunity for her testimony.   I have heard that, so I want to investigate that.   But while the Federal prosecutor agreed not to use her testimony  against her, she still could have been prosecuted if there was any  other evidence against her. If there was any evidence against her, she  could have been prosecuted. But there wasn't. And no charges were ever  brought against her--none.   Finally, opponents of Ms. Stone-Manning's nomination accused her of  lying to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, which is the  committee that I do chair and the committee, Madam President, that you  sit on with us so honorably. On her committee questionnaire, they said  she lied to us.   As the Chairman of that committee, I took that allegation seriously.  I wanted to find out if she lied to us or not.   Each nominee that comes to the Committee on Energy and Natural  Resources is asked whether he or she has ever been investigated,  arrested, or charged with a violation of law.   Ms. Stone-Manning responded, ``No, I have never been arrested or  charged and to my knowledge I have never been the target of such an  investigation.''   She then went on to disclose that she testified before a Federal  grand jury as part of a tree-spiking investigation in 1989, and later  testified at the tree-spiking trial. This allegation seems to be that  her response was false and misleading because she was subpoenaed,  because she was asked to come and testify and had been required to give  fingerprints and hair samples to the grand jury investigating the tree  spiking in 1989.   Being required to testify or give physical evidence to a grand jury  does not make someone the target of a grand jury investigation. It just  doesn't.   Again, I go back to the rule of law, which is unique in this world  today that we are still able to treat everybody as innocent until  proven guilty. And there is no evidence, and she was not involved.   The Justice Department defines a ``target'' as someone the grand jury  is considering indicting. That is the target: They are considering to  go after you.   The Federal prosecutor in the case asked the Forest Service's  criminal investigator--they asked the criminal investigator whether the  investigation in 1989 had identified possibly anyone as a subject in  the investigation. The Forest Service investigator replied under oath-- I repeat: under oath--no; no, it didn't happen.   She could not have been a target of an investigation that had not  identified her or anyone else as a subject. Her response is further  corroborated by recent comments in the press made by the former  Assistant United States Attorney who prosecuted this trial.   You being a prosecutor, Madam President, understands.   They prosecuted the tree-spiking case. This is the person who did  that, who confirmed--he confirmed that Ms. Stone-Manning was not a  target of the investigation in 1993. He confirmed that.   In sum, I am unable to find any credible evidence in the exhaustive  trial record of the tree-spiking case that supports the allegations  levied against Ms. Stone-Manning. What I find instead in the  committee's hearing record on her nomination is compelling evidence  that Ms. Stone-Manning has built a solid reputation over the past three  decades as a dedicated public servant and someone who has worked with  one of our colleagues, a dear friend of ours from Montana, who is about  to say what he believes in his heart, and as he knows, as that person's  credibility.   As a problem-solver, she has been and is a consensus-builder. She  faithfully served Senator Tester for 5 years in a position of trust and  responsibility on his staff. She went on to serve Governor Bullock of  Montana for 2 years as director of Montana's Department of  Environmental Quality and 2 more as Governor Bullock's chief of staff.  That is the evidence on which I will base my vote to support her, and I  would encourage every one of my colleagues to do the same.   This is a person who basically has given herself to public service.  This is a person, as a youth, basically in her compassion--all of the  things she might have believed does not make her guilty. This is a  person who basically deserves an opportunity to be able to serve all of  us in America with her knowledge, her desire, and her absolute,  unwavering dedication to the outdoors and everything that we hold near  and dear.   I just want to say that we are not here to prosecute people. That is  not our job. We are not here to pass judgment, basically, once judgment  has already passed and basically regurgitate something that is not  credible. So I say again: You are truly entitled to your own opinion.  You really are. But before you pass judgment, look at the facts. It  could be you. It could be me. That is not going to happen.   So with that, I urge my friends, I urge all of them to please--John  Adams, the first person to preside in the Senate, said:         Facts are stubborn things; and whatever may be our wishes,       our inclinations, or the dictates of our passion, they cannot       alter the state of facts and evidence.    They cannot. So let us put our partisan passions aside. Put them  aside and look at the facts. Let's vote to confirm Ms. Stone-Manning's  nomination.   I yield the floor.
