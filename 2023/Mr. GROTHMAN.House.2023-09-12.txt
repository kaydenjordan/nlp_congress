 Mr. Speaker, today we return from about a 6-week  sabbatical back in our districts. I would like to address some more  evidence of the moral decline that is coming over our country. I am  talking about the cities, including Columbus, Seattle, Milwaukee, and  New York, that are suing Kia and Hyundai because of car thefts in their  district.   They are not blaming the breakdown in the families encouraged by the  government, not blaming the weak DAs they elect, not blaming the weak  judges they elect. They are blaming the car companies. How must we look  to the South Koreans when they pick up their newspaper and find out the  Americans are suing their car companies because our young people can't  be prevented from taking them?   Wake up, America. Please stop this horrible moral decline before it  is too late. Please, please, American cities, don't sue car companies  anymore because we are doing such a bad job of raising the young  generation.                            ____________________
