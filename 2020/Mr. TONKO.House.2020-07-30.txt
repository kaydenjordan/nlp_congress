 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Dr. Jean Fruci, a  professional staff member with the Committee on Energy and Commerce.  Jean is also one of my most trusted advisers, a former coworker in my  personal office, and a true friend.   Jean first came to the Hill in the 1990s as an AAAS fellow, after  receiving her Ph.D. in soil science from Cornell University. She had  already served in several Member and committee offices before I met her  in 2009 on the Science, Space, and Technology Committee. Her brilliance  and integrity were evident.   After a brief stint away from Capitol Hill to care for her ailing  parents, Jean returned to congressional service as my legislative  director. She was a valued guide and coach as I worked to earn a place  on the Energy and Commerce Committee in early 2013.   Within just a few years, my colleague, Chairman Pallone, was smart  enough to recruit her from my personal office to join the committee,  where she would serve both the Subcommittees on Energy as well as  Environment and Climate Change, which I now chair. Her work in that  capacity has strengthened the quality of our lawmaking and helped  countless Americans in ways most will never realize.   Over her congressional career, Jean has served on multiple conference  committees, helped authorize and reauthorize numerous vital programs,  provided needed oversight, and negotiated many deals. In her exemplary  service, she has reminded us time and again of the importance of our  work in Congress and its potential to help the people we serve.   Jean is a legendary negotiator. I know this because my colleague from  Illinois, Mr. Shimkus, would often remark as such. He knows, however,  that she is also fair, honest, and does her homework.   Jean, as a STEM professional, your skills and knowledge made me and  this institution better.   We need more STEM professionals, more Jean Frucis, to guide us in our  policymaking, as the world and our economy become increasingly complex.   Mr. Speaker, Jean has done so much for this House, far beyond what I  can convey in these brief remarks. I know all of my colleagues join me  in wishing her and her husband, John, a retirement full of health,  happiness, travel when safe to do so again, and fulfillment.   You have earned that and more, Jean, and for that I humbly say thank  you for what you have done for this institution and for all Americans.                            ____________________
