 I suspect history will show that we have       lowered the bar on impeachment so much we have broken the       seal on this extreme penalty so cavalierly that it will be       used as a routine tool to fight political battles. My fear is       that when a Republican wins the White House Democrats will       demand payback.    Mr. Counsel CIPOLLONE. You were right, but I am sorry to say you were  also prophetic, and I think I couldn't say it better myself, so I will  not. You know what the right answer is in your heart. You know what the  right answer is for our country. You know what the right answer is for  the American people.   What they are asking you to do is to throw out a successful President  on the eve of an election with no basis and in violation of the  Constitution. It would dangerously change our country and weaken-- weaken--forever all of our democratic institutions. You all know that  is not in the interest of the American people. Why not trust the  American people with this decision? Why tear up their ballots? Why tear  up every ballot across this country? You can't do that. You know you  can't do that.   So I ask you to defend our Constitution, to defend fundamental  fairness, to defend basic due process rights, but most importantly-- most importantly--to respect and defend the sacred right of every  American to vote and to choose their President. The election is only  months away. The American people are entitled to choose their  President.   Overturning the last election and massively interfering with the  upcoming one would cause serious and lasting damage to the people of  the United States and to our great country. The Senate cannot allow  this to happen. It is time for this to end, here and now. So we urge  the Senate to reject these Articles of Impeachment for all of the  reasons we have given you. You know them all. I don't need to repeat  them.   They have repeatedly said, over and over again, a quote from Benjamin  Franklin: ``It is a republic, if you can keep it.'' And every time I  heard it, I said to myself: It is a republic, if they let us keep it.   I have every confidence--every confidence--in your wisdom. You will  do the only thing you can do, what you must do, what the Constitution  compels you to do: Reject these Articles of Impeachment for our country  and for the American people.   It will show that you put the Constitution above partisanship. It  will show that we can come together on both sides of the aisle and end  the era of impeachment for good. You know it should end. You know it  should end. It will allow you all to spend all of your energy and all  of your enormous talent and all of your resources on doing what the  American people sent you here to do: to work together, to work with the  President, to solve their problems.   So this should end now, as quickly as possible. Thank you again for  your attention. I look forward to answering your questions.   With that, that ends our presentation. Thank you very much.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The majority leader is recognized.                         Unanimous Consent Agreement
