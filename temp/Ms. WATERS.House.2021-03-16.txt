 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1085) to award three congressional gold medals to the United  States Capitol Police and those who protected the U.S. Capitol on  January 6, 2021, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1085         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. FINDINGS.         The Congress finds the following:        (1) Every day, the United States Capitol Police (``Capitol       Police'') protects the U.S. Capitol, Members of Congress,       congressional staff and institutional staff, journalists, and       the visiting public.        (2) On January 6, 2021, a mob of insurrectionists forced       its way into the U.S. Capitol building and congressional       office buildings and engaged in acts of vandalism, looting,       and violently attacked Capitol Police officers.        (3) The sacrifice of heroes including Capitol Police       Officers Brian Sicknick and Howard Liebengood, Metropolitan       Police Department Officer Jeffrey Smith, and those who       sustained injuries, and the courage of Capitol Police Officer       Eugene Goodman, exemplify the patriotism and the commitment       of Capitol Police officers, and those of other law       enforcement agencies, to risk their lives in service of our       country.        (4) Up to seven Americans died following this violent       attack, and more than 140 law enforcement officers suffered       physical injuries, including 15 officers who were       hospitalized.        (5) The desecration of the U.S. Capitol, which is the       temple of our American Democracy, and the violence targeting       Congress are horrors that will forever stain our Nation's       history.       SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDALS.         (a) Presentation Authorization.--The Speaker of the House       of Representatives and the President pro tempore of the       Senate shall make appropriate arrangements for the       presentation, on behalf of the Congress, of three gold medals       of appropriate design to the United States Capitol Police and       those who protected the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021.        (b) Design and Striking.--For the purposes of the award       referred to in subsection (a), the Secretary of the Treasury       (hereafter in this Act referred to as the ``Secretary'')       shall strike gold medals with suitable emblems, devices, and       inscriptions, to be determined by the Secretary.        (c) Disposition of Medals.--Following the award of the gold       medals under subsection (a):        (1) USCP headquarters.--One gold medal shall be given to       the United States Capitol Police, so that the medal may be       displayed at the headquarters of the United States Capitol       Police and made available for research, as appropriate.        (2) DC metropolitan police department headquarters.--One       gold medal shall be given to the Metropolitan Police       Department of the District of Columbia, so that the medal may       be displayed at the headquarters of the Metropolitan Police       Department and made available for research, as appropriate.        (3) Smithsonian institution.--        (A) In general.--One gold medal shall be given to the       Smithsonian Institution, where it shall be available for       display as appropriate and available for research.        (B) Plaque.--In displaying the gold medal given under       subparagraph (A), the Smithsonian Institution shall display       the medal with a plaque that lists the other law enforcement       agencies that participated in protecting the U.S. Capitol on       January 6, 2021.        (C) Sense of the congress.--It is the sense of the Congress       that the Smithsonian Institution should make the gold medal       given under subparagraph (A) available for display elsewhere,       particularly at appropriate locations associated with the       protection of the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021.       SEC. 3. DUPLICATE MEDALS.         The Secretary may strike and sell duplicates in bronze of       the gold medals struck pursuant to section 2 under such       regulations as the Secretary may prescribe, at a price       sufficient to cover the cost thereof, including labor,       materials, dies, use of machinery, and overhead expenses.       SEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS.         It is the sense of the Congress that the United States Mint       should expedite production of the gold medals and duplicate       medals under this Act, so that the sacrifices of fallen       officers and their families, and the contributions of other       law enforcement agencies who answered the call of duty on       January 6, 2021, can be recognized and honored in a timely       manner.       SEC. 5. NATIONAL MEDALS.         Medals struck pursuant to this Act are national medals for       the purposes of chapter 51 of title 31, United States Code.       SEC. 6. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks on  this legislation and to insert extraneous material thereon.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Pelosi), the distinguished Speaker of the House, who is  also the sponsor of this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, every day the men and women of the United States Capitol  Police protect the United States Capitol. They protect us; they protect  our staff; and they protect journalists and other visitors who come  into the people's House.   On January 6, 2021, the United States Capitol building was attacked  by armed insurrectionists who attacked Capitol Police Officers and  engaged in acts of looting and vandalism.   On that day, we witnessed the courage, patriotism, and commitment to  service exemplified by Members of the Capitol Police, Metropolitan  Police, and other law enforcement agencies, who risked their lives and  sustained injuries as they sought to protect those trapped in the  Capitol.   We honor these officers who sustained injuries in the line of duty,  and we honor the sacrifices of heroes, including Capitol Police  Officers Brian Sicknick and Howard Liebengood and Metropolitan Police  Department Officer Jeffrey Smith. And, finally, we honor Capitol Police  Officer Eugene Goodman, whose quick thinking and selfless action  undoubtedly saved the lives of many.   This legislation authorizes the Department of Treasury to mint three  Congressional Gold Medals to be given to the United States Capitol  Police, Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia, and  the Smithsonian Institution, so that we may never forget the valor and  courage displayed by the brave men and women who protected the Capitol  on January 6, 2021.   I thank Speaker Pelosi for introducing this bill. This is one of the  most important bills that we could ever put before the Congress of the  United States, and I urge Members to vote ``yes.''   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H1373]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  the District of Columbia (Ms. Norton).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Beyer).    Madam Speaker, may I inquire, through the Chair, if my  colleague has any remaining speakers on his side?    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   In closing, I commend Speaker Pelosi for bringing forward this  bipartisan legislation, acknowledging the bravery displayed by the men  and women who protected the Capitol on January 6. It is through their  leadership and decisive action on that day that many lives, including  my own, were saved.   I urge all Members to honor the sacrifices and courage displayed by  members of the Capitol Police, Metropolitan Police, and other law  enforcement agencies on January 6 by voting ``yes'' on H.R. 1085.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
