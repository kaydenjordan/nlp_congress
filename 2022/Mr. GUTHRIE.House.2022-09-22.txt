 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to this bill.   Make no mistake, this bill is a Trojan horse to advance the radical  defund the police movement and will hurt people who need help the most.   This bill would not only keep our dedicated law enforcement officers  off the streets at a time when crime is rising and illicit drugs are  flooding communities but, also, could significantly reduce access to  care for individuals with severe mental illness or substance use  disorder. This bill would penalize organizations that have higher rates  of institutionalization.   To be clear, we need to promote access to all types of behavioral  healthcare and substance use disorder services. However, this bill does  not take into account that sometimes these organizations provide the  safest, most effective care for individuals with serious mental  illness.   If Democrats' goal is to provide effective care for individuals with  disabilities, severe mental illness, and substance use disorder, then  we already have legislative solutions which this very body  overwhelmingly passed in June of this year.                                time  1345    In June of this year, the Restoring Hope for Mental Health and Well- Being Act was passed, and it would bolster behavioral health and  substance use disorder treatment and recovery services for millions of  Americans, most notably our children.   Democrats need to work with Republicans on addressing some of the  root causes of crime, such as our border crisis that the Vice President  insists is secure despite record numbers of border encounters and  illicit drugs being trafficked into our country.   We have a solution in the Energy and Commerce Committee to provide  law enforcement officers the tools they need to get drugs off our  streets and break the cycle of addiction. The HALT Fentanyl Act would  permanently schedule fentanyl-related substances as schedule I drugs.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to work with Republicans on passing  this legislation.
