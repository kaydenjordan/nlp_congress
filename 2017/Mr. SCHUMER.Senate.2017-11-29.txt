 Madam President, first, before I get to my main issue of  taxes, I just heard the majority leader talk about taking away the blue  slip. We hear the other side professing they want to work in a  bipartisan way, but every step they take takes away bipartisanship.  Reconciliation takes away bipartisanship. Getting rid of the blue ship  takes away bipartisanship. Unfortunately, the majority leader has taken  many steps this year to remove any hint of bipartisanship--most  notably, reconciliation on this major tax bill.   This is the first time we are doing tax reform in 36 years, but then,  it was done in a bipartisan way. The product lasted, and people, in  retrospect, were proud of it. Because this bill is being done in such a  partisan and narrow way and the idea--I even heard my friend from Utah  say this: Join us. You don't put together a bill in the dark of night  with just Republicans and then say: Come join us. That is not how tax  reform was done in 1986. That is not how major, bipartisan efforts in  this body have ever been done. It is a group from both parties sitting  down and coming up with a plan. And to offer amendments and then to  have them all defeated or ruled out of order and then say that is  regular order? Who are we kidding? Who are we kidding?   This has been a very partisan bill. That is why it is not a great  product. That is why the other side is rushing it through. This is not  a proud day for this Chamber, and history will show that. History will  show that.   Now I would like to talk about the specific plan, although we are  still not sure what the plan will be. According to reports, Republicans  are, right now, furiously debating changes in the bill, and who knows  when they will put the bill on the floor. A bill like this deserves  weeks of debate on the floor. At most, we will get 20 hours of debate-- and maybe not that--depending on when the leader puts the new  substitute bill on the floor. That is so wrong. That is so against the  better angels of this Chamber and the history we have had for  centuries. It is against the best practices that my dear friend from  Utah, the chairman of the Finance Committee, has exhibited throughout  his career. So I hope we can, even at this late moment, change that.    But we are only 1 day away, unfortunately, from a final vote on the  bill to rewrite the entire U.S. Tax Code, and significant parts of the  Republican bill  [[Page S7369]]  are still up in the air. By the time we vote, no one will have a  definitive analysis of how the bill would impact the economy--no one.  No one will know how the last-minute provisions Republicans add will  affect American taxpayers and businesses.   If this bill should pass--and I sure hope it doesn't, for the sake of  America and for the sake of the middle class--my Republican friends  will regret rushing it through in such a brazen way. There will be  unintended consequences. The rush to get something--anything--done will  haunt my Republican colleagues in years to come and, I dare say, in  November of 2018.   I would understand the rush if the Republicans were sure they had a  great tax bill, but they are not sure. I know so many of my colleagues  have expressed real misgivings about this bill. They say that it is  better than nothing, but that is not the alternative. It is not either  this bill or nothing. We Democrats are ready to sit down and work on a  bipartisan bill--it will take a couple of months--and come up with a  much better plan that will get 70 or 80 votes on the floor of this  Chamber, of which we can all be proud.   Every independent analysis has shown that millions of middle-class  people will get an increase in taxes. The Tax Policy Center estimates  that 60 percent of middle-class families will see a tax increase at the  end of the day, while folks making over $1 million will get an average  cut of $40,000. Do millionaires need a tax cut at all? Are they doing  so poorly? Is there any study that shows this kind of tax cut will make  them work harder or create more jobs? No. No. None. So the individual  side here, which reduces the top rate by 1 percent, if that is still in  the bill they are going to put before us, is misguided.   Corporations will get permanent breaks while individuals' will expire  after only a few years. For estates, right now the only estates that  pay any tax are worth over $11 million, and they will get a tax break  while 13 million fewer Americans--middle income, low income--will get  health insurance. Why rush to pass a bill like that?   It is no wonder the bill is so unpopular with the American people. In  every survey that I have seen and in every State survey that I have  seen, the numbers who dislike the bill exceed--in most cases, by a  lot--those who like the bill, just like healthcare.   Now, corporate profits are at an all-time high. Companies are flush  with cash. The richest 1 percent of Americans receive 20 percent of the  overall national income. The richest 1 percent get 20 percent of the  income. God bless them. I don't like that percentage, and that  percentage hasn't been matched in nearly a century since the roaring  twenties. But do they need a tax break? Come on.   Corporations and the wealthy are doing great right now. God bless  them. They don't need a tax cut. To lavish them with huge tax breaks  and ask the middle class to bear so much of the cost--that gets it  backward. That is not a bill anyone in this Chamber can be proud of,  whether your views are for tax cuts or not.   The main argument my Republican colleagues use to counter these  damning facts--what I say is the core argument of their tax plan--is  that a massive corporate tax cut would grow the economy and make it  easier for companies to invest in their workers. The argument that a  massive corporate tax cut leads to more jobs and higher wages is a  flimsy house of cards that falls down under the slightest scrutiny.   Just yesterday, Bloomberg published an article citing the CEOs of  major companies like Cisco and Coca-Cola, who said, according to the  report, that ``they'll turn over most gains from the proposed corporate  tax cuts to their shareholders, undercutting the President's promise  that his plan will create jobs and raise wages for the middle class.''   We have seen similar quotes by major corporate leaders on earnings  calls over the past several months. They admitted that this big  corporate tax break will go, in large part, to stock buybacks,  dividends, which we all know go to the wealthiest people in America.  The preponderance of it goes to the wealthiest people in America. The  additional profits from corporate tax cuts will not go to new  investments or higher wages but to CEO bonuses, stock buybacks, and  dividends.   Perhaps the most compelling testimony was given to top White House  economic adviser Gary Cohn himself, who spoke at the Wall Street  Journal CEO Council earlier this year. The gathering of business  leaders was asked to raise their hands if they planned to invest the  money they got from corporate tax cuts into their companies.   Gary Cohn had to ask: Why aren't there more hands up?   Again, you say: Well, they were afraid to say so. They didn't want to  reveal their plans. Well, corporate executives are revealing their  plans in their earnings calls. And when reporters ask them, so many of  them say: I am not going to invest this in jobs; I am going to invest  it in dividends and stock buybacks, send it back to the shareholders.   The harsh fact of the matter is that tax cuts don't result in the  kind of economic growth and job growth my Republican friends predict.  It didn't happen after the Bush tax cuts. It didn't happen in Kansas,  where there were so many promises: If we cut taxes in Kansas, there  will be huge growth and new jobs. Well, it was a dramatic flop, what  happened in Kansas, that our Republican colleagues are repeating. They  are not learning from history. Kansas's job growth last year was much  lower than the national average, despite all the big tax cuts they  gave.   I am afraid my Republican colleagues and friends are willing to paper  over their serious reservations with this bill in order to say that  they got something done. They are willing to look past the fact that 60  percent of middle-class families will see tax increases by the end of  the day, that healthcare premiums will rise 10 percent, that 13 million  fewer Americans will have health insurance, and that the tax bill will  exacerbate inequality in an economy that is already perilously  unequal--all in the name of deficit-busting corporate tax cuts that  will not create the kind of economic growth and job growth they are  predicting.   I heard the majority leader speak a minute ago and say: The focus of  this bill--these are his words, in effect; I don't know his exact  words, but they are like this. He said: The focus of this bill is on  the middle class.   It is only on the middle class if you believe in trickle-down  economics, that giving money to the wealthy corporations and giving  money to the wealthiest of people will create jobs--trickle-down. It  has never worked. According to a recent poll, 77 percent of Americans  don't believe that big corporations should get tax breaks. They don't  believe in trickle-down. The only people who believe in trickle-down  seem to be the Members of this Chamber and the big corporation leaders  who will get the benefits. Nobody else seems to believe it. Trickle- down is wrong. This bill could be entitled ``the trickle-down tax  bill.'' Let's hope and pray, middle-class people, that when we give  most of the breaks to the wealthiest and biggest corporations, you  might get a few crumbs. Nobody wants that. We could do much better,  working together in a bipartisan way.   In conclusion, I would say to my colleagues on the other side of the  aisle, particularly those who aren't sold on this bill: We can create a  better product by working together. Democrats and Republicans agree on  many principles in tax reform. We both want to lower rates and close  loopholes. We both want to reduce burdens on the middle class and small  businesses and simplify the code. I think many on the other side agree  with us that it should be deficit-neutral. This bill is none of those  things.   If we start over and pursue tax reform in the right way, the  bipartisan way, the open way, the sunlight way, I genuinely believe we  can find a product that both sides can be proud of and one that will be  much, much better--and much better received--by and for the American  people.   I yield the floor.                          Reservation of Leader Time
