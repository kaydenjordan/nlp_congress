 Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Maryland  (Mr. Hoyer), the majority leader, for the purpose of inquiring about  next week's schedule.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for giving that  update on the schedule.   I know that we have been in talks on a budget caps agreement. I met  with the Vice President earlier this morning, talking through some of  the things that may be included.   Obviously, there is no final agreement. We would hope that those  talks go on, and we, hopefully, reach an agreement where we can give  real certainty, especially to our Department of Defense, that we will  look at what sequestration would do to defense. We have been able to  rebuild our defense over the last 2 years. We would like to see that  progress continue.   A lot of other issues are at stake there, and we encourage those  talks to move forward. We will be ready to move if there is an  agreement reached between all the parties, including the White House.   I did not hear mention of anything regarding the BDS legislation. We  have heard that there might be some movement on standing up against the  BDS movement.   I know that when we looked at a number of bills, there are some  resolutions that are out there, some good, some bad. As we know, there  is time for talk, and then, there is time for action. The resolutions  are only talk.   The legislation, H.R. 336 by Mr. McCaul, is the only bill out there.  S. 1 moved through the Senate with a large, overwhelming bipartisan  vote. It is similar legislation that would actually have teeth, not  just words, which are important, but words followed up with action,  real teeth to help not only this country but our States that are also  standing up against the BDS movement, to give them some muscle, some  ability to stand up to the BDS movement.   Madam Speaker, I would ask the gentleman, is there any indication  that there might be movement on H.R. 336, to follow up the words with  real action against the BDS movement?   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman.    Madam Speaker, specifically, if I could ask my friend,  H.R. 336 was not one of those bills that was marked up. The only bills  that were marked up were resolutions.   Again, while some of those resolutions might have some good language  in them, there are no actual teeth. There is no policy. There is no  change in law to give us more tools as a country to stand up to the BDS  movement, to defend our friend Israel.   As we know, the BDS movement really is rooted in anti-Semitism to  undermine Israel's economy, which none of us should want to see. I know  my friend doesn't want to see Israel's economy undermined, but there is  a movement to do that. If we are going to truly stand up against it,  words are not enough. We need action.   H.R. 336, again, reflects similar legislation that passed the Senate  with an overwhelming vote, Republicans and Democrats coming together to  give real tools to stand up to this movement and support our friend  Israel.   Madam Speaker, I would inquire of the gentleman, would that bill be  considered? It was not part of the package of bills that were brought  up in committee this week. I yield to the gentleman.    Madam Speaker, I would encourage that we go back and  look. This committee can do better. If we are going to stand up against  this movement and support our friend Israel against this attempt to  undermine their economy, we need real tools.   H.R. 336 is the only instrument out there. It is similar to S. 1. We  would love to see S. 1 passed. There have been questions about whether  or not it has an origination problem, so that is why H.R. 336 was  filed.   But, again, H.R. 336 has the same language that passed with 77 votes  in the Senate, overwhelmingly, Republicans and Democrats coming  together. I would encourage us to follow that lead of bipartisanship,  standing with Israel.   I am disappointed that it is not included in the package. It moved  out of committee. I would hope we would go back and consider bringing  that bill to the floor.   Again, words are nice, but words without action don't give us the  tools we need to stand with our friend Israel against this undermining  attempt known as BDS.   I yield to the gentleman from Maryland.  [[Page H7130]]                                     time  1215     Mr. Speaker, clearly, if there are issues that need to  be worked out, differences that might exist between the chairman and  the lead Republican on the committee, that work needs to be done. There  have been no indications given to us of some counteroffer, some  different way to do it, some better way to do it, than what is in H.R.  336.   But again, the language in H.R. 336 is the same language that was in  S. 1, which passed the Senate with a 77-23 vote. It doesn't mean that  the Senate has the best idea, but it shows there was a way that  Republicans and Democrats could come together to stand with Israel  against this movement.   If there is a better way to do it, we would be more than happy to  work through those better ideas. None of those better ideas have been  presented to us. They just shut down that bill. They shut down the  ability to have a bill come to the floor to actually put teeth in law  to give us more tools.   I would urge that if there is a better alternative, that the chairman  of the committee or the leadership on your side has, please present  that and let's negotiate it, but none of that has been presented up  until now.   So, I would just encourage us to do better as we try to give more  support to our friend Israel against this growing movement.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask about the agenda as we have seen it  so far in the decorum. The agenda we have seen this week alone,  multiple pieces of legislation--whether it is targeted at the  President, we had a resolution on the President's tweet. There was a  resolution filed to impeach the President of the United States. There  was a resolution to hold Trump officials in contempt of Congress with  no basis for that contempt. There were multiple resolutions just this  week to target and harass different policies of the administration-- there is so much legislation we ought to be on this floor debating to  do things that would actually help real families.   There is a crisis at our border, and there has been no bipartisan  legislation. The bills that are going to be coming to the floor next  week, that the gentleman mentioned, dealing with homeland security are  known by many in the homeland security field as the open borders bill,  not a bipartisan approach to solving our problem at the border. We need  a secure border. We need to solve the crisis at the border.   Fix our broken asylum laws. We want to encourage asylum to work.  There ought to be a way to apply for asylum. But, in all honesty, if  somebody goes through other countries and turns down asylum in those  countries and comes here and just reads a script, because they know  there is a loophole in our law, we ought to work together to fix those  broken loopholes and the things that are causing an overwhelming crisis  at our border. That has not been done.   Bills to lower drug prices. We had a bipartisan agreement in the  Committee on Energy and Commerce, to lower drug prices, and yet that  was abandoned when that bill came to the floor and sent in a way that  became a partisan bill. These shouldn't be partisan issues.   I would hope that we would move away from the harassment agenda and  get back to an agenda that is focused on Republicans and Democrats  working together, not in a partisan way to say, hey, we passed some  bill out of the House, that everybody knows is going nowhere because it  was a partisan approach.   Look at what the Senate has done to move bipartisan bills through  their Chamber. We can do the same. We can do better than the Senate,  but we are not.   When the Speaker breaks the House rules, when you see this break  down, it just raises the ire because there is not that attempt to work  in a bipartisan way to solve these problems. And there are a lot of  good ideas that are bipartisan to solve these problems. The  disappointment is that we don't see those coming to the House floor.   The bills that deal with real policy coming to the House floor are  only brought, by and large, from a partisan perspective, and the  bipartisan approaches are being discarded.   BDS is one clear example where there is a way to solve the problem,  where Republicans and Democrats came together. Even from the  gentleman's acknowledgement, there is no indication that it is going to  move out of committee any time soon. It ought to be out of committee  and it ought to be on the House floor, so that we can not only debate  it, but pass it, and get a bill to the President's desk to allow us to  stand up more against the BDS movement in support of Israel.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman.    Madam Speaker, there is clearly a lot to cover there.  Let's start with the big debate, and that is what the gentleman alluded  to, and that is government control versus freedom, because that is  going to be the debate over the next year where there is already a  Presidential primary debate process going on.   When you see every candidate for President on one side saying that  they want to give free healthcare benefits to people who are here  illegally, yet many of them embrace a plan that would literally end  private insurance for families that enjoy the healthcare plans they  have in the private marketplace, the Medicare for All proposal, there  are so many different areas where we see this debate about government  control versus freedom.   And, yes, to the gentleman, there are some on his side who refer to  themselves as socialist Democrats. And so if they want to call  themselves that, then at least own the things that go with socialism  and recognize the damage that is done by socialism.   To think that any one party has some kind of ownership of capitalism  in the free market system, I would be more than happy to see us engage  in a debate about capitalism, because there are some on the other side  that attack it on a regular basis.   But if you look at how Republican policies have gotten us to where we  are with the most booming economy in the world, our economy is the envy  of the world. People's wages are rising. Low-income people, in fact,  are benefiting the most. And we are seeing the increase in the  rebuilding of our middle class that was evaporating.    For 8 years in a row under the previous administration, every single  quarter, our economy had less than 2 percent growth. The economy wasn't  even that bad during the Great Depression that the gentleman cited.   So when we came in with the Republican majority and the Republican  President, we were able to pass actual policies like the Tax Cuts and  Jobs Act, like reversing so many of the radical regulations that we saw  that had nothing to do with health and safety but had to do with  carrying out an agenda to shut down industries in this country like the  fossil fuel industry and so many others that are providing not only  jobs, lower carbon emission, dominance in the world, helping our  friends around the world, and lowering energy prices for families in  America.   Those policies have actually been increasing wages for lower income  people, not government-controlled prices as passed today where the  government is going to try to come in and set artificial rates for what  people ought to make as opposed to letting this great market that is  working incredibly well raise wages for families.   We have seen the studies. We have seen the University of Washington  study, which was cited today, where we can look at real examples of  communities that have had artificially high minimum wages, like  Seattle, where they put in place a $15 minimum wage. It sounds great.  The government is going to set everybody's rates and tell everybody how  much they are going to make, and what it resulted in is over 5 million  hours lost for workers.   In fact, the lower income families in Seattle were hurt the most by  that policy by a margin of 3 to 1. It damages low-income families.   Again, it might sound good that the government is going to tell  everyone what they can make, but most of us who believe in the free  market system reject that idea that we should set policies that are  crushing jobs in America.   There is a bar in New York that was closed because of the increase in  the minimum wage that one of our colleagues used to work at. It was  closed because of an artificially set price, minimum wage, in the city  of New York.   So when you look at jobs that are fleeing some communities and going  to other communities, that ought to tell you how those policies are  working.   But we have a growing economy, not because we had a lot of government  control out of Washington, but, in fact, because we allowed freedom. We  allowed people to keep more of what they earned. We allowed people to  make their own choices. And it is a successful formula. We want to see  more of it.   Now, if we can get into the issue of the harassment agenda, the  subpoenas, the finding people in contempt, let's talk about Secretary  Ross and the work that was done to comply with the committee's request.   If you look, and this is reading from a document sent by Secretary  Ross and Attorney General Barr to the committee, it says:         The Department's engagement with the committee is a good       faith accommodation process, rooted in the separation of       powers. As part of that process, both Departments have made       multiple witnesses available for voluntary, transcribed       interviews and have produced more than 30,000 pages of       documents to the committee.        Before the committee abruptly and prematurely terminated       the accommodation process last month, the Department of       Justice intended to provide a significant number of       additional documents identified as responsive to the       committee's subpoena.    They go on to talk about how they were complying with the committee,  producing over 30,000 pages of documents just related to the Census.  And then the committee abruptly decides they just want to hold him in  contempt because there were some documents they wanted that the  Attorney General would have actually broken the law if he turned them  over.   So you saw a Department complying and going overboard to ensure that  the separation of powers and the oversight that existed would continue.   Of course, when we were in the majority and the previous  administration of the other party was there, we had a lot of oversight  hearings, exercising our Article I powers as we all should, but we  didn't go week after week.   Just this week alone, there was a resolution condemning the  President's tweets, an impeachment resolution, a resolution to hold two  Cabinet Secretaries in contempt, and three resolutions of disapproval  on policy. That was just this week.   The American people don't want to see us fighting over power. They  want to see us fighting for their needs, the needs of hardworking  families.   Again, I identified so many things.   Just to finish up on the resolution that was discussed earlier, the  gentleman said we need to respond to things that violate this country's  principles.   First of all, we reject racism wholeheartedly. We reject hate. We  reject anti-Semitism.   There have been comments made by Members of the gentleman's party  that have not been addressed on this floor that violate those  principles.   We can all bring resolutions broadly stating things, but if the  intention is to identify people by name, it is, to us, rather  conspicuous that, when people of the other party say those things, they  are not addressed on this floor by name. And so we know that happened.   Again, the way that the Speaker violated the rules of the House, and  then a vote was brought to this floor to basically say that those rules  don't apply to the Speaker.   If the rules don't apply to the Speaker, then who do they apply to?  They ought to apply to all of us equally.   If any of us break the rules of the House and are called out on it  and are found by the Chair to be in violation of the rules, then we  ought to accept that. We ought not have the vote on the House floor to  say, well, the rules apply to some people, but not everybody.   If the rules are in place, they ought to be in place to be enforced  equally, not that some in power have an exemption and have a free pass  to break those rules.   So if we are going to talk about what we reject, let's be fair and  equal about it.   I yield to the gentleman from Maryland.    If I could interject, we share that. That is not an us  versus them issue. We agree with those. Obviously, there are some that  we disagree with. The ones that the gentleman mentioned are things that  we agree with.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman.    Clearly, Madam Speaker, if we talk about what makes this  country great, it is the freedoms and the economic success that we have  seen for families, businesses, and everybody. It is the reason people  come here from all around the world. What we have done to create this  great free market system has unleashed potential for anybody to come  here and be anything they want to be.   I have been proud to help pass policies that have actually increased  wages for families not through government price controls but through  economic growth and through giving people more of their money back  instead of their having to come to Washington to get an amount or come  to a union boss to get the amount that they can earn. They can actually  go do it on their own.   It is playing out in reality, not in theory, but in reality, where we  are seeing the lowest-income workers benefiting the most from our  policies of cutting taxes, not by telling people how much they can make  but by letting them go out and make even more on their own.   They are doing it. It is the lower-income people who are benefiting  the most from those policies. We ought to encourage more of that.   The unemployment rate amongst African Americans and Hispanics is at  the lowest rate in our country's history not through government  controls but by cutting taxes and letting them have more of their  money, by seeing businesses grow, and by hiring more people.   We are seeing more job openings today than there are people looking  for work. That is what is so exciting.   We see that women-owned businesses are up 20 percent over the last  few years because of these conservative policies that I have helped  pass.   Yes, when I support right-to-work laws, if a person wants to go work  for a company that happens to be in a union-based industry or a union- based State, and they say they don't want dues forced out of their  paychecks, to give dues to somebody who believes in things that they  don't agree with, they shouldn't be forced to do that. In many places,  they are.   I want more individual freedom. I want more ability for people to go  out and live that American Dream, to start up their own business in  their garage and then one day maybe become a billionaire because there  was that opportunity provided to them, not our telling them how much  they can make, but our allowing them, in a safe way, the ability to go  be the best they can be.    I will use an example because I know the gentleman and I share the  belief that people need to be safe in the workplace, and we need to do  all we can to ensure that. Look at deepwater drilling in the Gulf of  Mexico, which is based out of parts of my district. Port Fourchon in  Louisiana is the hub of all that deepwater drilling that we saw.   There was the horrible tragedy, the Deepwater Horizon. People died,  and the environment was polluted. That was done not because there  weren't enough laws in place but because a company broke the laws. A  company went around those safety standards that we put in place.   We went and hammered them. We fined them. I passed a bill out of this  House in a very bipartisan way called the RESTORE Act that ensured that  they pay billions of dollars back to fix the damage that they had done  and to hold that company accountable for what they had done. Its  purpose was not to shut the whole industry down, because every other  company that was out there had done things the right way.   What we saw from the previous administration was a rule that came out  called the Well Control Rule that wasn't rooted in safety. After  industry did an even better job to put well containment in place so  that, if something like that ever happened again, they could quickly  move to stop it, instead of government working to help expedite that  process, government sat back and waited until industry came up with a  better way to solve that problem on their own. Then, it came up with a  rule that actually would have undermined the new safety standards they  put in place. It would have made it difficult because Washington would  have been able to tell them how to manage a well in the middle of the  Gulf of Mexico instead of understanding that pressure changes instantly  and that they have to be able to respond to it.   Government was setting a standard that would have undermined safety.  Luckily, we reversed that Obama-era rule that would have made things  less safe.  [[Page H7134]]    Let's not think that every regulation is about increasing safety. We  ought to stand together to support safety standards and strengthen them  where we can. There may be rules and regulations that undermine safety  because some people just don't want drilling for oil, and some people  support the Green New Deal kind of approaches that I and many don't.  But don't try to undermine safety just to shut an industry down because  people don't believe in it.   After September 11, our government came together in many ways,  politically and policy-wise, to address what had happened. We didn't  shut down the entire airline industry. We made safety standards at  airports better so that people who get on a plane feel more comfortable  that somebody doesn't have box cutters, guns, or knives that can  undermine the safety of those people and of our country. Then, we got  planes back up and running very quickly.   Safety standards are something we both share. But when government  gets in the way just because they don't agree with what somebody is  doing, that is a different story. That is the kind of government  control versus freedom battle that we are seeing play out and will  continue seeing play out, I am sure, over the next year and a half  between now and next November.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman.    Madam Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman's comments. I  respect our ability to have these disagreements but, again, to disagree  in a civil way where we can at least talk about the policy and keep it  focused that way and, hopefully, one day address those areas of concern  that we both share and that we can both solve working together.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
