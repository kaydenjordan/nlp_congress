 Mr. Speaker, during Asian American Pacific Islander  Heritage Month, we recognize that diversity is more than a cultural  exchange that enriches our Nation. It is a tool that we can use to save  lives.   Despite being the fastest-growing minority group in our Nation, AAPI  communities remain underrepresented in medical research. In 2019, NIH  invested less than 1 percent of its budget to support clinical studies  in AAPI communities. That is not enough.   In Orange County, our institutions recognize the need to reach all of  our communities with medical research. UC Irvine recently received  $750,000 in Federal resources to increase diversity in clinical  research, and that money is going to help AAPI communities benefit from  the university's groundbreaking Alzheimer's research.   A medical innovation is only a miracle when it reaches patients in  need. The Nation should follow Orange County's lead and work to provide  the benefits of publicly funded research to all communities.                            ____________________
