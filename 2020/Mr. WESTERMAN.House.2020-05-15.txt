 Mr. Speaker, why is it not too big of a health concern  to call us back from all across the country to vote on a useless  messaging bill that will wither on the vine outside this Chamber, but  it is too much to ask us to come back and hold committee hearings?   Proxy voting shouldn't happen; not now, not ever. If Members of  Congress are unwilling to do their job, they should step down and let  someone else do it. If politicizing a process weren't enough, the  Speaker is now weakening the core foundations of Congress.   Already, House Democrats have demonstrated their expertise at  crafting partisan bills behind closed doors. And on the Natural  Resources Committee, they have been holding partisan virtual hearings  disguised as roundtables with no Republican input.    I will concede to my colleagues across the aisle that proxy voting  will keep the process moving: the wrong process, the wrong direction,  and for all the wrong reasons. I am not only concerned about how we  will be voting; I am also concerned about what we will be voting on.   Is the plan now for a handful of Members to come back to D.C. every  other week to vote on yet another messaging bill from the Speaker? This  is wrong and none of us should stand for it. Republicans are ready to  get back to real work. I ask Speaker Pelosi to please quit playing  games with the rules and let us do our jobs.
