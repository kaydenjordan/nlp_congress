 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I come to the floor today to voice my  support for the FDA Reauthorization Act. Within this legislation is a  very important measure that will support the development of innovative  and promising cancer drugs--the RACE for Children Act,  [[Page S4719]]  which is a law that I introduced with Senator Michael Bennet of the  State of Colorado.   RACE for Children is sorely needed, as it would close a loophole that  exists in current Federal law and prompt companies--pharmaceutical  companies--to examine the safety and the efficacy of powerful cancer  drugs and how they work on children. This, in turn, will provide  doctors with the necessary information to properly treat children  battling cancer.   Pediatric cancer is a leading cause of death by disease among  children. A startling statistic: One in every 285 children is diagnosed  with cancer before the age of 20. While the good news is that  researchers are continuing to make significant advances to treat and  cure cancer for adults, the progress to develop safe drugs for  pediatric cancer sadly lags far behind.   One of the problems is that current law, the way it is today, directs  pharmaceutical companies to study the safety and the efficacy of adult  drugs on children. So if you develop a drug on diabetes or heart  disease or anything for adults, it also requires you to do some of that  on children because you want to make sure that it works on both  populations and you don't want to keep a drug out of the market for  children that could work for them. Of course, this requirement is only  in place if the FDA believes that there is a pertinent need--in  essence, a condition that children suffer from. There are some  conditions that are unique to adults; there are few, if any, pediatric  populations who have that disease, so maybe they would decide it wasn't  pertinent to require it.   However, this provision in the law specifically exempts cancer drugs.  In essence, it says to a pharmaceutical company: If you are going to  study the safety and the efficacy of a drug on adults, if there is a  pertinent need, if there is a real population out there that suffers  from the same condition in children, you have to test it on children,  as well, except if it is a cancer drug. One of the reasons that  exemption is in there is because technology--medical technology at the  time that law was put in place--didn't allow researchers to target the  genetic structure of cancer. In essence, at the time, it didn't allow  them to say: We can go in and find the genetic markers of a specific  cancer and test against it. That is why it didn't have that  requirement.   Now, however, we do have that capability. Today, the technology  exists to pinpoint the similarities in adult and childhood cancer  genomes. So the technology has now reached a point where you can treat  the specific genome of a cancer whether it is in an adult or in a  child. That is how far the technology has advanced, but the law has not  been updated to keep up with it. The result is that there are a lot of  adult advances being made, and we don't know if they work on children  because they haven't been forced to test it.   So the RACE for Children's Act, which is a law that Senator Bennet  and I offered and is included in the FDA reauthorization, closes that  loophole.   Let me say that getting to this point here on the floor was not easy.  So I do need to take a moment to thank the chairman, Senator Alexander  of Tennessee, and obviously Senator Bennet, but also the pediatric  cancer community, including organizations like the Live Like Bella  Foundation in my hometown of Miami, Lambs for Life, the Alliance for  Childhood Cancer, St. Jude's, St. Baldrick's, Nemours Children's  Hospital, Arnold Palmer Hospital, the American Cancer Society, and so  many others that came together to the table to address this important  issue in a way that would not limit future innovations for cancer  treatment. It has taken over a year and a half to reach this point, and  I am grateful to all of them for their participation because I would  not be standing here giving this speech without it.   Suffice it to say that, tragically, many of my colleagues in  Congress, here in the Senate but also across the country, have been  affected by cancer. Whether you are fighting cancer yourself or it is  your child, your sister, your brother, your cousin, your friend, I want  to make one thing clear: You are not alone in your struggle.   I would venture to say that I do not know anyone who has not been  impacted by pediatric cancer. I have it in my own family, and some have  confronted it in theirs, in loved ones and children who went to school  with your kids. In fact, Live Like Bella Foundation was founded for a  young girl by the name of Bella from Miami. She was a classmate of my  nephew in grade school, and she lost her battle with cancer. Her father  has been a tireless advocate for this cause. He moved Heaven and Earth  to try to reach a point where they could find a cure for her. That did  not come in time. He has now made it the mission of his life to honor  her life by continuing this work. So we have all been impacted in some  way.   As I said, unfortunately, across this country this disease is a  reality. I want to share some stories of a few of the children who have  been impacted by cancer and who have impacted our office and helped us  to make this a priority over the last year and a half.   The first is the story of a young boy named Jeremy. He is only 5  years old and has been in treatment for 4 of those 5 years. He has had  more than 150 surgeries so far, and ultimately had to have his eyes  removed because of cancer, which left him completely blind, obviously.    Then there is Tatum, who was diagnosed with a rapidly developing  brain tumor just before she was supposed to start kindergarten. Her  parents were told by the doctors that they should take her home and  they should enjoy the little time they had with Tatum because they had  no options to treat her.   There is Princeton, who was diagnosed with cancer when he was 5 years  old. He is now 7. In those 2 years he has undergone 6 chemo cycles, a  bone marrow transplant, 9 surgeries, 12 rounds of radiation, and 6  cycles of immunotherapy. Because of this intense and time-consuming  treatment schedule, Princeton built friendships with others who were  also in the hospital for treatment. Sadly, he has lost many of these  friends.   Princeton's best friend was Trevor. Trevor passed away right before  Princeton's birthday party. Princeton came to my office asking the  Senate to do more for kids like them. Here is what 7-year-old Princeton  said: ``I don't want my friends to die, and I don't want me to die.''   There is the story of Derek. He was a healthy, happy baby until he  developed an aggressive form of cancer and it produced tumors all over  his body. His body was literally taken over by tumors. At only 5 months  of age, baby Derek lost his battle against cancer.   These are real stories. They are real, heartbreaking stories--stories  of our neighbors, friends, and family and what they have endured.   But with the developments in medicine today, there is no reason these  children shouldn't have a second chance. Yet the treatment options for  children with cancer is much more limited than it is for adults, and  some of the reasons why are the issues we are trying to address about  this law here today.   Recent advancements in cancer treatment enable oncology drugs to  specifically target the genetic structure of the cancer, and that makes  it possible to transition certain adult cancer drugs for pediatric use.  However, the basic information you need to do that--about dosing and  safety--needs to be determined to guide the doctors responsible for  treating these children. These treatments, these advances are providing  new-found hope for cancer patients, but mostly only for adult cancer  patients.   Fortunately, we have a chance and an opportunity to change this, and  that is the goal of the RACE for Children Act.   The House recently passed the RACE for Children Act as part of the  FDA user fee reauthorization bill that is before us here today. It is  now our turn to do so and to send this important and potentially  lifesaving legislation to the President for his signature.   In a place where we have had some heated debates over the last 7  years, since I have been here--6\1/2\, and more to come--sometimes it  feels as though, perhaps, our service here doesn't make much of an  impact. But from time to time, we have unique opportunities to vote on  laws and legislation that slightly alter the arc of history and  potentially help people. Standing here today, I can't tell you if there  will be  [[Page S4720]]  1,000 children, 100,000 children, or 5 children who will benefit from a  cancer treatment because of this new requirement in which these adult  drugs will have to be tested on children. We don't know.   Standing here today, believing that we all walk on Earth and our days  are numbered to the glory and grace of God, frankly, we don't know if  one of our own children, God forbid or someone we deeply love or one of  our children's classmates will be impacted by pediatric cancer. But we  know that 1 in about 300 children will be. So the chances are that at  some point, we will once again have someone we care deeply about  impacted. We hope that when that moment comes, if it does, that there  will be options for their parents and their doctors and that they will  have the opportunity to use for them treatments that perhaps would not  have been available, had this requirement not been in the law. That is  why I hope and I urge my Senate colleagues to join me in supporting  this initiative.   In fact, sometimes we give these speeches with a sense of mystery: If  this passes; if it doesn't pass; there is no reason this isn't going to  pass. We all expect the FDA reauthorization bill to pass. I imagine  when people vote on this tomorrow, they will read the title of the  bill, ``FDA Fee Reauthorization.'' It sounds like taking care of the  normal course of business--it is important in its own right, by the  way--that this is just this bureaucratic exercise to reauthorize an  expiring law. Embedded in that law is a very important law, one that I  hope will lead to real life-changing innovation in a way that will  impact lives, change and save the lives of children here in our country  but ultimately in other parts of the world as well.   That is why I felt it was important to come to the Senate floor and,  obviously, urge my colleagues to support this initiative but also to  urge my colleagues to be proud of it.   We are about to go home, whether it is tomorrow or next week, and  answer to our constituents for all the things we didn't do. There are  some significant issues we have not confronted and solved for the  country, but this is a significant issue. There aren't going to be a  lot of articles written about it; there aren't going to be blaring  headlines on the websites about it, mailers and campaign commercials.  That doesn't mean it isn't important. We live in a society where  oftentimes good news doesn't draw ratings, and good news doesn't drive  eyeballs and clicks to a website. It doesn't make it unimportant. It  doesn't make it insignificant.   This is significant. This is an opportunity. This is evidence that  more often than perhaps people realize, fellow Americans of different  points of view, representing diverse States and communities, who  approach the political process with very different ideologies and aims,  come together to make a difference. I am pleased that while there are  many things we have not done, we will leave here tomorrow or next week  knowing that at least we did one thing that will matter. It is an  important thing because these children whom we are trying to help do  not have the time to continue waiting for us to step up and take  action.   I thank the Chair.   With that, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a statement by  Julio Andres Borges Junyent, President of the National Assembly of the  Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:     The National Assembly of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela--In   Rescue of the Constitution, Democracy and Human Rights: Agreement in   Disregard of the Fraudulents Electoral Results on July 30th, 2017 for     Which was Intended To Impose an Illegitimate National Constituent   Assembly, and in Claim of the 1999 Constitution as a Democratic Basis                  of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela                                 CONSIDERING         On July 30th, 2017 the regime of Nicolas Maduro, with the       support of the majority of rectors of the National Electoral       Council, judges of the Supreme Court of Justice and the high       dome of the National Bolivarian Armed Forces, advanced on the       fraudulent constituent process that initiated on May 1, 2017,       realizing a supposed illegitimate ``election'' of such       illegitimate constituent members;                                 CONSIDERING         The authorities of the National Bolivarian Armed Forces       have assumed the prominence in the announcements concerning       the electoral process, investing the constitutional principle       of subjection of the military civilian authorities; which is       a sample of the militarism they intend to impose, in       contravention to the enshrined civic and republican values on       the current Constitution of 1999;                                 CONSIDERING         That this National Assembly has pointed out in various       agreements, and it was ratified by the Venezuelan people in       the referendum of July 16th, 2017, the National Constituent       Assembly is a fraudulent and illegitimate process that only       seeks to repeal the Constitution of 1999 by other mechanisms       than those provided, in order to establish in Venezuela a       dictatorship of totalitarian Court, in reason of which all       acts and processes arising from such constituent must be       unknown to citizens and government employees, who have the       duty to restore the validity of the 1999 Constitution, all       this, in accordance with the articles 333 and 350;                                 CONSIDERING         The fraudulent election of July 30th sought to give       legitimacy to the constitutional process, despite the fact       that such procedure was initiated with the usurpation of the       popular sovereignty, which was never consulted about the       convocation of the constituent Assembly, as ordered by the       constitutional article 347;                                 CONSIDERING         In addition, the fraudulent election of July 30th was held       on the sidelines of international guarantees and       constitutional minimum that must be presented in any       democratic election, which shows the high despite  [[Page S4757]]       abstention in the irregular voting stations admitted for this       election, the President of the National Electoral Council       announced a false call participation of eight million and       eighty-nine thousand three hundred and twenty (8,089,320)       electors, making the committed fraud even more evident;                                 CONSIDERING         The Venezuelan people, in exercise of their right to       resistance, made various peaceful protests during the day of       July 30th, 2017, with the deplorable balance of 16 people       killed, hundreds injured and many arrested in an arbitrary       manner, with the repression which the regime of Nicolas       Maduro has attended for trying to impose its fraudulent and       illegitimate National Constituent Assembly;                                 CONSIDERING         That the international community, like countries such as       Argentina, Colombia, Spain, United States of America and       Mexico, as well as international organizations such as the       Organization of American States (OAS) and the European       Parliament, expressed their rejection on the fraudulent       constituent process of Nicolas Maduro's regime;                                 CONSIDERING         That the fraudulent election of the illegitimate National       Constituent Assembly of July 30th, 2017, implies a major       change in the political and constitutional Venezuelan scene,       having to represent the definitive attempt of restoring the       dictatorship of totalitarian court protected on the figure of       the National Constituent Assembly, which demands the       articulation of effective and immediate action orientated to       deposing a despotic form of government, contributing to the       effective reestablishment of the Constitution in Venezuela,       in context of articles 333 and 350 of the Constitution, with       the democratic legitimacy derived from the popular       consultation on July 16th and the support of the       international community committed on the universal defense of       human rights and constitutional democracy.                                  ACCORDING         First: Confirm that all the acts related to the National       Constituent Assembly including the supposed election effected       on July 30th, 2017 must be unrecognized because it was a       process based on usurpation of the popular sovereignty and of       the original Constituent power that belongs exclusively to       the people of Venezuela. Likewise, we ratify the right to the       resistance of the people of Venezuela against the fraudulent       and illegal National Constituent Assembly, as the officials       and members of the armed forces must do. Armed forces must       disobey all the acts related to the fraudulent Constituent       Assembly, and actively contribute to re-establish the       effective validity of the Constitution of 1999.        Second: Unrecognized the election effected on July 30th,       2017 of the members of the fraudulent and illegal National       Constituent Assembly that was convened without a popular       referendum, and against the peoples' will and in contrivance       of article number 347 of the Constitution.        Third: Reject the massacre and aberrant crimes against the       Venezuelans who in their legal right to freedom of       expression, of protesting and resisting were demonstrating       their rejection to the fraudulent Constituent Assembly, and       who were expressing solidarity to the parliamentarian body       with the victims of repression, arrests, and family members       of the deceased, and with all the Venezuelan people.        Fourth: Ratify the mandate of the people stated in the       Popular Consultation on July 16th, 2017, by which, this       National Assembly, as a legal and exclusive representative of       the Venezuelan people will take all the measures and actions       directed to depose the National Constituent Assembly as a       power that is illegitimate and of fact to establish       effectively the validity of the constitution of the       Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.        Fifth: Urge the citizen Luisa Ortega Diaz, in her       responsibility of General Attorney of the Republic, to       investigate at great length the criminal acts against the       protesters, as well as the committed crimes that took place       during the organization and in the electoral process on July       30th, 2017, and to exercise the relevant actions against the       officers and people that ordered and executed such crimes,       with the purpose to make effective the punitive,       administrative, and disciplinary responsibilities of those       who order and executed the repressive acts against the people       and of those who participated in the constitutional fraud of       the National Constituent Assembly.        Sixth: Urge to the Public Minister to overtake       investigations and formalities directed to establish the       penal responsibility of all public officers and people       evolved in the fraudulent process of the National Constituent       Assembly that aims to impose a change that violates the       constitution and changes the republican foundation of the       Nation.        Seventh: Grateful for the solidarity expressed by the       International Community with regard to the people of       Venezuela and in rejection of the fraudulent National       Constituent Assembly, and for arranging necessary meetings to       execute common actions of states committed to the universal       defense of human rights and of the relevant International       Entities, so that through the admitted mechanisms of Public       International rights and thus contribute to depose the       fraudulent and illegal National Constituent Assembly and to       reestablish the effective validity of the Constitution of       1999.        Eighth: Support to the people of Venezuela in the exercise       of the right to resist the despotism that the National       Constituent Assembly aims to impose. We support both the       organized and planned actions that contribute to depose such       illegal Constituent Assembly, and the execution of necessary       actions to reestablish the validity of the Constitution of       the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela that obeys the mandate       of the Popular Consultation that took place on July 16th,       2017.        Ninth: Ratify the people of Venezuela, faithful to its       republican tradition, to impugn all forms of despotic       government that derived from the National Constituent       Assembly, while the country is linked to the duty of       obedience to such constituent and those who contribute to its       installation operation. The recognized authorities will be       the only ones arising from free and democratic elections.        Tenth: Forward a copy of this agreement to the Secretary-      General and the Permanent Council of the Organization of       American States (OAS), the Organization of United Nations       (UN) to the Inter-American Commission on human rights (IACHR)       and the members of the diplomatic corps, specially to the       representatives of those States that have spoken out without       knowing about the election of the National Constituent       Assembly.        Tenth first: Give publicity to this agreement.        Given, signed and sealed in the Federal Legislative Palace,       seat of the National Assembly of the Bolivarian Republic of       Venezuela, in Caracas, the first day of August of two       thousand seventeen. Year 207 of independence and 158 of the       Federation.      Julio Andres Borges Junyent;        President of the National Assembly.      Freddy Guevara Cortez;        First Vice President.
