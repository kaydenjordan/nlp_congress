 Mr. Speaker, last weekend was the 30th anniversary of  Global Youth Service Day. I spent Saturday morning at the Community  FoodBank of New Jersey to meet with around 50 young people who had  volunteered their day to serve others.   Of course, young people have always been great leaders, but with  social media and other technologies connecting people like never  before, the power of diverse young minds coming together has taken on a  new dimension.   Young people are comparing notes across the country and around the  world, and they are doing something to change the course of history.  Young people are leading marches, they are running for office, and they  are putting their minds and bodies to the service of others.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the Community  FoodBank of New Jersey and the young people across this country who  participated in the 2018 Global Youth Service Day.                            ____________________
