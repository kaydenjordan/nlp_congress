 Mr. President, yesterday, May 9, 2018, I was in Terre  Haute, IN, to attend the funeral services for police officer, Rob  Pitts, a veteran of the Terre Haute Police Department and a Hoosier  hero who was killed in the line of duty while serving his community. As  a result, I was unable to vote.   Had I been present, I would have voted in support of the confirmation  of Kurt Engelhardt to be United States Circuit Judge for the Fifth  Circuit, and I would have opposed cloture on the nomination of Michael  Brennan to be United States Circuit Judge for the Seventh Circuit.                            ____________________
