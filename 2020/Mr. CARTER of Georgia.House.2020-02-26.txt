 Madam Speaker, I rise today to remember the  life of Dr. Wesley Ball who passed away on January 8 at the age of 88.   Originally from Moultrie, Georgia, Dr. Ball came to Savannah in 1964  where he practiced surgery for over 33 years. Not only an exceptional  surgeon, his work transcended that of just healthcare by breaking down  political, racial, and international borders.  [[Page H1215]]    He became a lifelong member of the NAACP where he helped build plans  to desegregate the school system. He made numerous medical mission  trips to Haiti. And he was a mentor to many up-and-coming doctors to  whom he was known as the Godfather of Medicine for his loving and kind  manner.   I am proud to have had someone like Dr. Ball working in the First  Congressional District of Georgia. Simply put, Dr. Ball is leaving  Savannah and much of the rest of the world a better place than he found  it.   Dr. Ball's family will be in my thoughts and prayers during this most  difficult time.                            ____________________
