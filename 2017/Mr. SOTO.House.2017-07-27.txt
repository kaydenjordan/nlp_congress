 Mr. Speaker, recall President Trump's promise on the  campaign trail: we will build a wall and have Mexico pay for it.   Not only is it costly and unnecessary, but it will do more to divide  America than it will to keep us safe. First, taking the fact that  Mexico is not paying for it, nor would anybody in their right mind  think that Mexico was ever going to pay for it, now he is asking for  $1.6 billion of Americans' hardworking taxpayers to pay for it.   We already have 650 miles of border fencing, but representing the  Sunshine State, with over 1,000 miles of coastline, this isn't going to  make us safer. It is not going to help us at all. And then you look to  how there are racial undertones to this.   Notice how there is a focus on the Southern border, but not the  Northern border?   While I would not support that, we can't help but notice that this is  focused on dividing America on racial lines, on making us less safe and  on wasting taxpayer dollars.   It is time to unite America. It is time to look forward to a safer  America, and spend our money on the Coast Guard, on custom border  control, and other works that will make us safer.                            ____________________     Mr. Chair, I want to make a statement regarding the passage  of H.R. 3219, the Make America Secure Appropriations Act, 2018.  Specifically, I would like to make a statement about my amendment, Soto  Number 20, to Division A, the Department of Defense Appropriations Act,  2018. My amendment moved $10 million from the Operation and  Maintenance, Defense-Wide account to the Defense Health Program's Peer- Reviewed Prostate Cancer Research Program.   Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in men and is  the second most common cause of male death. In 2017, approximately  161,360 men in the U.S. will be diagnosed with prostate cancer and an  estimated 26,730 will die from it.   The Prostate Cancer Research Program is a unique research program in  that it prioritizes research that will lead to the elimination of death  from prostate cancer while enhancing the well-being of men experiencing  the impact of the disease.   I support funding prostate cancer research and thank my colleagues  for their support of my amendment.   Mr. Chair, I want to make a statement regarding the passage of H.R.  3219, the Make America Secure Appropriations Act, 2018. Specifically, I  would like to make a statement about my amendment, Soto Number 19, to  Division A, the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2018. My  amendment moved $1 million from the Operation and Maintenance, Defense- Wide account to the Defense Health Program's Peer-Reviewed Gulf War  Illness Research Program.   If we are going to spend money on medical research within the  Department of Defense, the Department must adequately fund research on  those diseases that originate in war and wholly affect our servicemen  and women. Over a quarter of a million veterans display symptoms of  this disease, and the time has come to find, and fund, a cure for it.   I support funding Gulf War illness research and thank my colleagues  for their support of my amendment.
