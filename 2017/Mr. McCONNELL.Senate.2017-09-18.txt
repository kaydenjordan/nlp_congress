 Mr President, our Nation faces many national security  threats across the globe.   The threats and challenges posed by Iran, China, Russia, North Korea,  ISIL, al-Qaeda, and its affiliates represent a diverse range of  conventional and asymmetric capabilities that threaten our national  security and that of our allies.   We also know that the challenges we face have been compounded by  everything from sequestration to the last administration's self- defeating foreign policy, with the Obama administration's focus on  reducing the size of our conventional force only adding to the burden  of our forward-deployed units.   We have to be smart if we are going to address these challenges  effectively and do right by our men and women in uniform appropriately.   We have to provide our servicemembers with the resources and training  they need. That is obvious.   We have to continue the hard work of rebuilding our military and  restoring combat readiness. That is ongoing.   We have to modernize the Pentagon and root out waste within the  military bureaucracy. That is important for strengthening  accountability.   We also have to prepare for the threats of both today and tomorrow by  promoting defense innovation, enhancing cyber security, and--especially  when you consider all the recent belligerence from North Korea-- strengthening missile defense.   For these reasons and many others, like authorizing a well-deserved  raise for our servicemembers, it is imperative that we join together  today in passing the defense authorization legislation before us.   Mr. President, I thank the Armed Services Committee for its good work  on this year's National Defense Authorization Act. The members of that  committee, from both parties, came together to support this year's NDAA  and send it to the Senate floor. It is yet another testament to the  leadership of Senator McCain, the committee's top Republican, and  Senator Reed, his Democratic counterpart.   So thank you, Chairman McCain, thank you, Ranking Member Reed, and  thank you, everyone else, who worked so hard on this legislation.   Now let's pass it.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on an entirely different matter, last  week, the Senate confirmed a talented and experienced nominee with an  impressive career in law enforcement to be the U.S. attorney for the  Western District of Kentucky. Russell Coleman is the right person for  the job.   After graduating from my alma mater, the University of Kentucky  College of Law, Russell entered public service. His wide-ranging  experiences at the Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of  Investigation, the Senate, and in private practice make him  particularly qualified for this new role.  [[Page S5776]]    As the chief Federal law enforcement officer for the Western District  of Kentucky, Russell will use his skills to serve the people of  Kentucky and the United States very well. Having served as a special  agent with the FBI, Russell understands the particular challenges  facing law enforcement. In that role, he regularly collaborated with  Federal, State, and local law enforcement officials on a vast array of  issues, and he is well respected in the law enforcement community.   For instance, Kentucky continues to struggle with the opioid  addiction epidemic that is tearing families and communities apart.  Russell stands ready to collaborate with stakeholders and community  leaders to combat it. He has earned the support of the Kentucky  Narcotics Officers' Association, which looks forward to his leadership  on drug enforcement issues.   Russell also worked in my office as legal counsel, helping me serve  the people of Kentucky. With good humor and an unmatched determination,  he advocated for the issues that were important to my constituents.   The president of the Kentucky Fraternal Order of Police wrote to me  in support of Russell's nomination: ``Russell was forever thoughtful,  courteous, and a true friend to our membership.''   Now Russell has the opportunity to serve once again.   I congratulate him and look forward to his service to the  Commonwealth and to the country.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on one final matter, I would like to  take a brief moment to recognize a talented member of the Senate  community who will be retiring this month after 20 years of service to  this body and to the Nation.   Nancy Kervin is a reference librarian in the Senate Library, and for  years, whenever my office needed assistance with a seemingly impossible  research question, she was always ready to lend a helping hand. I could  not let her depart without giving her the recognition that she so  richly deserves.   Nancy came to the Senate following a wide-ranging career in  publishing and in research, and through her work here, Nancy has made a  lasting mark.   To members of my staff and to numerous others around the Senate,  Nancy has been the first person to call when facing a difficult  research question. Nancy's signature combination of intellectual rigor  and unyielding perseverance has enabled her to skillfully complete  countless research projects on numerous subjects throughout her time in  the Senate, and, of course, she is widely known for her kindness and  her good humor.   My office has worked closely with Nancy on a number of different  projects over the years, but there is one project--a project of  particular personal importance to me--that I would like to mention  today.   A number of years ago, I began a series of lectures at Kentucky  colleges and universities focusing on the lives and legacies of  prominent U.S. Senators from the Commonwealth. Since the project's  inception, my staff has regularly looked to Nancy for help. She has  been an indispensable resource for each historical speech in Kentucky  that I have delivered. Her work in gathering sources and putting the  information in its proper context has helped me to pay tribute to many  distinguished Kentuckians. Therefore, it is fitting that she holds the  highest honor that my State can bestow upon a civilian, that of a  Kentucky colonel.   After her years of dedicated service, Nancy deserves a relaxing  retirement. Along with her husband, Stephen--another stalwart member of  the Senate family who will be retiring from the Senate Historical  Office--Nancy plans to spend time traveling and working in her garden.  She will be sorely missed here.   On behalf of the entire Senate family, I congratulate Nancy and  Stephen on their successful careers in promoting the history and the  legacy of this Chamber and those who have served in it. I wish them  both happy retirements.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, today the Senate will vote on final  passage of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018.  This is the culmination of months of bipartisan work, and it is a  product in which all Senators and all Americans can take great pride. I  want to thank, once again, my friend and colleague the Senator from  Rhode Island. His partnership on this legislation has been invaluable.   The fundamental purpose of this legislation, which has united  Senators from both sides of the aisle, is to provide our Armed Forces  what they need to do the jobs we ask of them. We, in this body, have no  higher duty than to do everything we can to support our fellow  Americans who serve and sacrifice every day to keep us safe.   This legislation does that. It keeps faith with our men and women in  uniform. It supports a national defense budget of $700 billion for  fiscal year 2018, which exceeds the administration's request by $37  billion and the defense spending caps in the Budget Control Act by $91  billion. The decision of the Committee on Armed Services to authorize  these additional resources was unanimous and bipartisan, and it is a  significant statement on the troubling state of our military today.   My friends, for too long, our Nation has asked our men and women in  uniform to do too much with far too little. Much of the blame lies with  the last administration, but we in Congress cannot escape  responsibility. Our military's job is hard enough, but we are making it  harder through continuing resolutions, unpredictable funding, and  arbitrary spending caps that we put into law 6 years ago before the  rise of ISIS, before the current crisis with North Korea, before  Russia's return to aggression on the world stage, and before so many  other dangerous developments.   We have been warned--we have been warned, my friends--that we can't  go on like this. We have been warned. Earlier this year, the Chairman  of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Joseph Dunford, warned us: ``In just  a few years if we don't change the trajectory, we will lose our  qualitative and our quantitative competitive edge, [and] the  consequences will be profound.'' The Secretary of Defense, Jim Mattis,  [[Page S5787]]  also warned us, saying: ``We are no longer managing risk; we are now  gambling.''   We are gambling, my friends. We are gambling with the lives of the  best among us, and we are now seeing the cost--the tragic but  foreseeable cost--of an overworked, strained force, with aging  equipment and not enough of it.   On June 17, seven sailors were killed when the USS Fitzgerald  collided with a container ship off the coast of Japan. On July 10, a  Marine KC-130 crash in Mississippi killed all 16 troops on board. On  August 5, an Osprey helicopter crash off the coast of Australia  resulted in the deaths of three Marines. On August 15, an Army  helicopter crashed off the coast of Hawaii, with five soldiers presumed  dead. On August 21, 10 sailors perished when the USS McCain collided  with a tanker near Singapore. On August 25, an Army Black Hawk  helicopter went down during a training mission off the coast of Yemen,  and one soldier died. Earlier this month in Nevada, two Air Force A-10  aircraft crashed into each other. Thank God the pilots safely ejected,  but the planes were lost, at a cost of over $100 million.   Just last week--just last week, as we debated this legislation--there  were additional accidents. Last Tuesday, one soldier died during  helicopter training at Fort Hood. Last Wednesday, an amphibious vehicle  explosion at Camp Pendleton injured 15 marines. Last Thursday, a  demolition accident at Fort Bragg killed another soldier and injured  seven others.   My friends, more of our men and women in uniform are now being killed  in totally avoidable training accidents and routine operations than by  our enemies in combat. Let me repeat that. More of our men and women in  uniform are now being killed in totally avoidable training accidents  and routine operations than by our enemies in combat.   Where is the outrage? Where is our sense of urgency to deal with this  problem? Congress can criticize this administration or the last  administration all we want, and there is plenty of blame to go around,  but the constitutional responsibility is to ``raise and support  Armies'' and ``provide and maintain a Navy.'' That responsibility is  ours. How can we believe that we are meeting our responsibilities when  young Americans in uniform are not receiving the necessary resources  and capabilities to perform their missions? My friends, that blame  rests with us, the Congress.   I know many of my colleagues agree. I have heard them--both  Republicans and Democrats--speak for years about the harmful effects  sequestration is having on our military and many other Federal agencies  with a national security mission. How do we explain our failure to deal  with this problem last week? We had an opportunity. This legislation  was open for amendments under regular order for an entire week. There  was an amendment offered by the Senator from Arkansas to repeal  sequestration. The amendment was written in a bipartisan way and would  have ended sequestration, not only for defense but nondefense spending  as well. We had an opportunity to tell all of our men and women in  uniform that the Senate finally was doing everything it could to  support them. We had an opportunity, and we failed. Worse than that, we  didn't even try. We couldn't even agree to vote.    It makes me so angry, but more than that it makes me sad. It breaks  my heart.   How do we explain our failure to our men and women who are serving?  How do we explain to Americans who are risking their lives for us that  we could not summon the courage to take some hard votes? How can we  explain we couldn't come together and vote together when it mattered  most? How do we explain the signal our inaction sends to all who are  serving that Congress has higher priorities than rebuilding our  military? We should be ashamed of ourselves.   For those of you who will soon vote for this National Defense  Authorization Act, which will authorize the necessary resources to  begin rebuilding our military, let me thank you; let me thank you; let  me thank you. You can be proud that you are voting for a good piece of  legislation, but this legislation is only part of the solution. We  still have no path to actually appropriate the money that we are about  to authorize. That requires a bipartisan agreement to adjust the  spending caps in the Budget Control Act.   For all of you who will join me in voting to authorize these vital  additional resources for our military, I would also urge you to join me  in demanding and passing a bipartisan agreement so that we can  appropriate those resources. This will require some hard work. It will  require some teamwork and some trust in each other. It will require  having the courage of our convictions. But in the end, it will require  much less of us than the service and sacrifice we ask every day from  our men and women in uniform, which they so dutifully provide us.   I do not want to have to call another grieving mother or father or  spouse after their loved one has perished in a mishap that might have  been prevented if Congress had done its job. Let's find a way to  appropriate the resources for our military that we will soon authorize.  Our men and women in uniform deserve no less.   Mr. President, I will suggest a short quorum call while we get these  final agreed-upon amendments on the bill at this time. It shouldn't  take more than 3 or 4 minutes.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that H.R. 2810,  as amended, be printed as passed by the Senate.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session  to consider Calendar No. 176, William J. Emanuel.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  mandatory quorum call be waived.   Is there objection?   Without objection, it is so ordered.   The Senator from Illinois.    Mr President, for decades, I have supported the  Appalachian Regional Commission, or ARC, and its mission to invest in  communities to strengthen economic growth throughout the Appalachian  region.   As I have expressed before, however, I have grown frustrated by ARC's  shortcomings. Last year, the Senate considered an amendment to abolish  ARC entirely. I voted against that proposal because I believe that the  Commission still serves an important purpose, but since that time I've  been calling on ARC to clarify its clouded focus.   For instance, because of ARC's own rules, the most distressed  counties in the region can only receive up to 30% of its area  development funds. In other words, a substantial portion of the  agency's resources--which should be focused on alleviating poverty--are  intentionally directed away from the counties most in need of help.  This has been a criticism leveled against ARC for years. I believe  that, if ARC serves a valid purpose today, then it is to assist the  most impoverished counties in the region.   Moreover, while the other regional commissions are headquartered in  the areas for which they're designed to serve, ARC maintains its  primary office right here in Washington, D.C. An expensive office near  Dupont Circle, far  [[Page S5803]]  away from the people and the communities it serves, is not the right  place for ARC.   Today, I will introduce legislation along with my friend and longtime  ARC champion, Congressman Hal Rogers, to make desperately needed  reforms at ARC. Our bill is designed to reform the Commission, to focus  its mission on investing more in the poorest Appalachian communities,  and to direct ARC's leadership to relocate the organization to the  region it serves.   These common-sense reforms will help set ARC on a path toward  fulfilling what should be its central mission--poverty alleviation--and  delivering vital assistance to those who need it the most. I hope that  all of my colleagues will join with me to move this legislation forward  and provide necessary relief to communities in Appalachia.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text  of the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                   S. 1824     =========================== NOTE ===========================        On page S5803, September 18, 2017, in the first column, the  following appears: AMENDMENT NO. 1824      The online Record has been corrected to read: S.1824    ========================= END NOTE =========================          Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Appalachian Regional       Commission Reform Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         (a) Headquarters.--Congress finds that--        (1) regional commissions, such as the Delta Regional       Authority, the Denali Commission, and the Northern Border       Regional Commission, are each headquartered in their       respective region;        (2) headquartering regional commissions within the region       affected is a sensible approach to ensure that the       commissions are housed in more affordable locations than the       District of Columbia, thereby reducing administrative       overhead and making the commissions closer and more       accountable to the people the commissions were designed to       serve;        (3) the Appalachian Regional Commission (referred to in       this Act as the ``Commission'') is not headquartered in       Appalachia but in Washington, D.C.; and        (4) the headquarters of the Commission should be relocated       from the District of Columbia to a more affordable location       in the Appalachian region so that it is closer and more       accountable to the people the Commission was designed to       serve.        (b) Performance.--Congress finds that--        (1) the Commission was created to help foster economic       opportunity and close health and educational disparities in a       geographic region of the United States beleaguered by       persistent poverty and high unemployment;        (2) the Commission remains the sole Federal agency focused       singularly on economic revitalization in the Appalachian       region;        (3) in 1998, Congress charged the Commission with       ``address[ing] the needs of severely and persistently       distressed areas of the Appalachian region and focus[ing]       special attention on the areas of greatest need'';        (4) the Commission has long been criticized for its       shortcomings in fulfilling this mission, including in--        (A) a 1999 study titled ``Mountain Money: Federal Tax       Dollars Miss the Mark in Core Appalachia'' by Mark Ferenchik       and Jill Ripenhoff for the Columbus Dispatch; and        (B) a 2008 book titled ``Uneven Ground: Appalachia Since       1945'' by Ronald D. Eller;        (5) in 2004, the Office of Management and Budget noted the       importance of the Commission ``[f]ocusing efforts       on...targeting assistance to areas of distress'';        (6) in 2017, Citizens Against Government Waste       characterized the programming of the Commission as       duplicative and called for drastic reductions in the budget       of the Commission;        (7) in 2017, the Office of Management and Budget, citing a       Government Accountability Office study, concluded that the       Commission should be abolished, and that conclusion was       reflected in the fiscal year 2018 budget request submitted by       the President;        (8) these recent actions reflect a growing chorus that the       Commission should be reformed; and        (9) therefore, given the long-recognized shortcomings of       the Commission, the long-standing criticism of the       Commission, and the need to ensure its optimal performance,       the time has arrived for the Commission to be reformed.        (c) Persistent Poverty.--Congress finds that--        (1) using 1960 data, the Commission (which was created in       1965) concluded that there were 214 distressed counties in       the Appalachian region;        (2) in 2017, according to the Commission, there are 84       distressed counties in the Appalachian region, reflecting the       areas of most persistent poverty in the region; and        (3) therefore, the Commission should be reformed to focus       its attention on the areas of most persistent poverty in the       region.        (d) Area Development Funding for Distressed Counties.--      Congress finds that--        (1) according to the study by the Columbus Dispatch       referred to in subsection (b)(4)(A), of the 22,169 grants       issued by the Commission from fiscal year 1966 through fiscal       year 1998, none of the 5 counties that received the most       Commission funding was considered distressed, and more than       \1/4\ of all Commission spending during that period went to       States with few, if any, distressed counties;        (2) according to author Ronald D. Eller in 2014, ``[the       Commission] policies have concentrated resources in a select       few `growth centers' in the [Appalachian] region, expanding       services to the poor and growing the mountain middle class,       but doing little to alter conditions in the most rural       distressed counties or to address systemic political or       economic inequalities throughout Appalachia'';        (3) until 1995, the Commission allocated up to 20 percent       of its area development grants for use in distressed       counties;        (4) following instructions given to the Commission by the       Committees on Appropriations of the Senate and the House of       Representatives in 1995, this allocation was increased by the       Commission to 30 percent;        (5) section 7.5(c) of the Code of the Commission (as in       effect on the date of enactment of this Act) reflects this       1995 policy change and states that the Commission ``will       allocate up to 30 percent of Commission area development       funds for use in distressed counties'', even though,       according to the Commission's public representations,       economic conditions in distressed areas of the Appalachian       region have not greatly improved since the 1960s;        (6) given the persistent levels of poverty in the       distressed counties in the Appalachian region, more area       development funding and emphasis should be devoted to those       counties; and        (7) therefore, the allocation described in paragraph (3)       should be increased to 60 percent.        (e) Grant Expenditures.--Congress finds that--        (1) section 14524(d) of title 40, United States Code,       provides that ``not less than 50 percent of the amount of       grant expenditures the Commission approves shall support       activities or projects that benefit severely and persistently       distressed counties and areas'';        (2) given the persistent levels of poverty in the       distressed counties in the Appalachian region, more grant       expenditures and emphasis should be devoted to those       counties; and        (3) therefore, the 50 percent threshold in section 14524(d)       of title 40, United States Code, should be increased to 60       percent.       SEC. 3. MISSION OF THE APPALACHIAN REGIONAL COMMISSION.         Section 14301 of title 40, United States Code, is amended       by striking subsection (a) and inserting the following:        ``(a) Establishment and Mission.--        ``(1) Establishment.--There is an Appalachian Regional       Commission (referred to in this chapter as the `Commission').        ``(2) Mission.--The mission of the Commission shall be to       focus primarily on poverty reduction and economic development       in areas in the Appalachian region with the most persistent       poverty.''.       SEC. 4. HEADQUARTERS OF THE APPALACHIAN REGIONAL COMMISSION.         (a) In General.--Section 14301 of title 40, United States       Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:        ``(g) Headquarters.--The headquarters of the Commission       shall be located in the Appalachian region.''.        (b) Implementation.--The Federal Cochairman of the       Commission shall take such actions as may be necessary to       carry out the amendment made by subsection (a).       SEC. 5. GRANT EXPENDITURES.         Section 14524(d) of title 40, United States Code, is       amended by striking ``50 percent'' and inserting ``60       percent''.       SEC. 6. AREA DEVELOPMENT FUNDS FOR DISTRESSED COUNTIES.         Section 14526(b) of title 40, United States Code, is       amended--        (1) by striking ``In program and'' and inserting the       following:        ``(1) In general.--In program and''; and        (2) by adding at the end the following:        ``(2) Area development funds.--        ``(A) In general.--Of the funds made available for each       fiscal year for the Area Development Program of the       Commission, the Commission shall allocate not less than 60       percent for projects in counties for which a distressed       county designation is in effect under this section.        ``(B) Methodology.--The methodology for determining whether       a county is designated as a distressed county under       subsection (a)(1)(A) shall be the methodology in effect on       the day before the date of enactment of the Appalachian       Regional Commission Reform Act.        ``(3) Report.--The Commission shall submit an annual report       that describes the allocation of funds, in dollar amounts and       percentage of total appropriations, for the Area Development       Program to counties described in paragraph (2) to--        ``(A) the Speaker of the House of Representatives;        ``(B) the minority leader of the House of Representatives;        ``(C) the majority leader of the Senate;        ``(D) the minority leader of the Senate;        ``(E) the Committee on Appropriations of the House of       Representatives;        ``(F) the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate;        ``(G) the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of       the House of Representatives; and  [[Page S5804]]         ``(H) the Committee on Environment and Public Works of the       Senate.''.                                  ______                                         By Mr. REED (for himself, Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. Brown, Mr. King, Mr.          Franken, and Mr. Whitehouse):   S. 1828. A bill to change the date for regularly scheduled general  elections for Federal office to the first Saturday and Sunday after the  first Friday in November in every even-numbered year; to the Committee  on Rules and Administration.

(a) Headquarters.--Congress finds that--        (1) regional commissions, such as the Delta Regional       Authority, the Denali Commission, and the Northern Border       Regional Commission, are each headquartered in their       respective region;        (2) headquartering regional commissions within the region       affected is a sensible approach to ensure that the       commissions are housed in more affordable locations than the       District of Columbia, thereby reducing administrative       overhead and making the commissions closer and more       accountable to the people the commissions were designed to       serve;        (3) the Appalachian Regional Commission (referred to in       this Act as the ``Commission'') is not headquartered in       Appalachia but in Washington, D.C.; and        (4) the headquarters of the Commission should be relocated       from the District of Columbia to a more affordable location       in the Appalachian region so that it is closer and more       accountable to the people the Commission was designed to       serve.        (b) Performance.--Congress finds that--        (1) the Commission was created to help foster economic       opportunity and close health and educational disparities in a       geographic region of the United States beleaguered by       persistent poverty and high unemployment;        (2) the Commission remains the sole Federal agency focused       singularly on economic revitalization in the Appalachian       region;        (3) in 1998, Congress charged the Commission with       ``address[ing] the needs of severely and persistently       distressed areas of the Appalachian region and focus[ing]       special attention on the areas of greatest need'';        (4) the Commission has long been criticized for its       shortcomings in fulfilling this mission, including in--        (A) a 1999 study titled ``Mountain Money: Federal Tax       Dollars Miss the Mark in Core Appalachia'' by Mark Ferenchik       and Jill Ripenhoff for the Columbus Dispatch; and        (B) a 2008 book titled ``Uneven Ground: Appalachia Since       1945'' by Ronald D. Eller;        (5) in 2004, the Office of Management and Budget noted the       importance of the Commission ``[f]ocusing efforts       on...targeting assistance to areas of distress'';        (6) in 2017, Citizens Against Government Waste       characterized the programming of the Commission as       duplicative and called for drastic reductions in the budget       of the Commission;        (7) in 2017, the Office of Management and Budget, citing a       Government Accountability Office study, concluded that the       Commission should be abolished, and that conclusion was       reflected in the fiscal year 2018 budget request submitted by       the President;        (8) these recent actions reflect a growing chorus that the       Commission should be reformed; and        (9) therefore, given the long-recognized shortcomings of       the Commission, the long-standing criticism of the       Commission, and the need to ensure its optimal performance,       the time has arrived for the Commission to be reformed.        (c) Persistent Poverty.--Congress finds that--        (1) using 1960 data, the Commission (which was created in       1965) concluded that there were 214 distressed counties in       the Appalachian region;        (2) in 2017, according to the Commission, there are 84       distressed counties in the Appalachian region, reflecting the       areas of most persistent poverty in the region; and        (3) therefore, the Commission should be reformed to focus       its attention on the areas of most persistent poverty in the       region.        (d) Area Development Funding for Distressed Counties.--      Congress finds that--        (1) according to the study by the Columbus Dispatch       referred to in subsection (b)(4)(A), of the 22,169 grants       issued by the Commission from fiscal year 1966 through fiscal       year 1998, none of the 5 counties that received the most       Commission funding was considered distressed, and more than       \1/4\ of all Commission spending during that period went to       States with few, if any, distressed counties;        (2) according to author Ronald D. Eller in 2014, ``[the       Commission] policies have concentrated resources in a select       few `growth centers' in the [Appalachian] region, expanding       services to the poor and growing the mountain middle class,       but doing little to alter conditions in the most rural       distressed counties or to address systemic political or       economic inequalities throughout Appalachia'';        (3) until 1995, the Commission allocated up to 20 percent       of its area development grants for use in distressed       counties;        (4) following instructions given to the Commission by the       Committees on Appropriations of the Senate and the House of       Representatives in 1995, this allocation was increased by the       Commission to 30 percent;        (5) section 7.5(c) of the Code of the Commission (as in       effect on the date of enactment of this Act) reflects this       1995 policy change and states that the Commission ``will       allocate up to 30 percent of Commission area development       funds for use in distressed counties'', even though,       according to the Commission's public representations,       economic conditions in distressed areas of the Appalachian       region have not greatly improved since the 1960s;        (6) given the persistent levels of poverty in the       distressed counties in the Appalachian region, more area       development funding and emphasis should be devoted to those       counties; and        (7) therefore, the allocation described in paragraph (3)       should be increased to 60 percent.        (e) Grant Expenditures.--Congress finds that--        (1) section 14524(d) of title 40, United States Code,       provides that ``not less than 50 percent of the amount of       grant expenditures the Commission approves shall support       activities or projects that benefit severely and persistently       distressed counties and areas'';        (2) given the persistent levels of poverty in the       distressed counties in the Appalachian region, more grant       expenditures and emphasis should be devoted to those       counties; and        (3) therefore, the 50 percent threshold in section 14524(d)       of title 40, United States Code, should be increased to 60       percent.       SEC. 3. MISSION OF THE APPALACHIAN REGIONAL COMMISSION.         Section 14301 of title 40, United States Code, is amended       by striking subsection (a) and inserting the following:        ``(a) Establishment and Mission.--        ``(1) Establishment.--There is an Appalachian Regional       Commission (referred to in this chapter as the `Commission').        ``(2) Mission.--The mission of the Commission shall be to       focus primarily on poverty reduction and economic development       in areas in the Appalachian region with the most persistent       poverty.''.       SEC. 4. HEADQUARTERS OF THE APPALACHIAN REGIONAL COMMISSION.         (a) In General.--Section 14301 of title 40, United States       Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:        ``(g) Headquarters.--The headquarters of the Commission       shall be located in the Appalachian region.''.        (b) Implementation.--The Federal Cochairman of the       Commission shall take such actions as may be necessary to       carry out the amendment made by subsection (a).       SEC. 5. GRANT EXPENDITURES.         Section 14524(d) of title 40, United States Code, is       amended by striking ``50 percent'' and inserting ``60       percent''.       SEC. 6. AREA DEVELOPMENT FUNDS FOR DISTRESSED COUNTIES.         Section 14526(b) of title 40, United States Code, is       amended--        (1) by striking ``In program and'' and inserting the       following:        ``(1) In general.--In program and''; and        (2) by adding at the end the following:        ``(2) Area development funds.--        ``(A) In general.--Of the funds made available for each       fiscal year for the Area Development Program of the       Commission, the Commission shall allocate not less than 60       percent for projects in counties for which a distressed       county designation is in effect under this section.        ``(B) Methodology.--The methodology for determining whether       a county is designated as a distressed county under       subsection (a)(1)(A) shall be the methodology in effect on       the day before the date of enactment of the Appalachian       Regional Commission Reform Act.        ``(3) Report.--The Commission shall submit an annual report       that describes the allocation of funds, in dollar amounts and       percentage of total appropriations, for the Area Development       Program to counties described in paragraph (2) to--        ``(A) the Speaker of the House of Representatives;        ``(B) the minority leader of the House of Representatives;        ``(C) the majority leader of the Senate;        ``(D) the minority leader of the Senate;        ``(E) the Committee on Appropriations of the House of       Representatives;        ``(F) the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate;        ``(G) the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of       the House of Representatives; and  [[Page S5804]]         ``(H) the Committee on Environment and Public Works of the       Senate.''.                                  ______
