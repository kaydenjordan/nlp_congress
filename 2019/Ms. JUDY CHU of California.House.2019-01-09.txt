 Mr. Speaker, this morning I met Chrissy,  an air traffic controller from Ventura, California. Her job is to  ensure the safety and efficiency of air travel, but the Trump shutdown  has caused chaos. Air traffic controllers will not receive their  paychecks on Friday. The FAA support staff has been furloughed, and the  students in the air traffic control  [[Page H307]]  academy have been sent home. Because of this, air traffic controllers  like her are being forced to slow down everything in order to ensure  the same level of air safety.   But it is not just Chrissy's work that is being impacted. She and her  husband, who is also an air traffic controller, lost their home in the  Thomas fire, and now, as they try to rebuild their home and their  lives, Trump is forcing them to do it without a paycheck.   How can we do this to our workers? Last night, Trump tried to make  his case to the Nation. What we heard was a lot of xenophobia and  division. What we didn't hear was any urgent threat that would justify  a shutdown right now over a wall that would be built in the future.   That is why we are bringing up today's bills to reopen government. If  Trump wants to negotiate over border security, he should show concern  for workers like Chrissy and sign these bills. Nineteen days into the  shutdown, Trump is making the American people suffer for the sake of  his ego.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the rule, and  join us in passing these bills to reopen government functions that have  nothing to do with Trump's demand for a wall.
