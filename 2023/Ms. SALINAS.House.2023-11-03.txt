 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize my friend,  colleague, and fellow Oregonian, Congressman Earl Blumenauer.  Throughout his 50 years of public service, Earl has always been a  consistent and vocal advocate for Oregon values.   He helped pioneer the fight against climate change long before others  were doing the same, and his commitment to building healthy communities  and a healthy planet through public transit and cycling was unmatched.  In fact, he wore it proudly every day in the form of that iconic  bicycle pin on his lapel.   I know I speak for the entire Oregon delegation when we say that Earl  will be sorely missed in Congress. He leaves behind a legacy of service  and dedication to making life better for working families not only in  our State but across our great country.   I wish him and his family all the best in his new chapter.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 11 o'clock and 37 minutes  a.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until Monday next,  November 6, 2023, at noon for morning-hour debate.
