 Mr. Chief Justice, I send a question to the desk.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you.   The question from Senator Warren is for the House managers:         At a time when large majorities of Americans have lost       faith in government, does the fact that the Chief Justice is       presiding over an impeachment trial in which Republican       senators have thus far refused to allow witnesses or evidence       contribute to the loss of legitimacy of the Chief Justice,       the Supreme Court, and the Constitution?    Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Senator, I would not say it contributes to a loss  of confidence in the Chief Justice. I think the Chief Justice has  presided admirably.   But I will say this: I was having a conversation the other day on the  House floor with one of my colleagues,   Tom Malinowski, from Jersey--a  brilliant colleague--and I was harkening back to what I thought was a  key exchange during the course of this saga.   This is when Ambassador Volker, in September, is talking with Andriy  Yermak. Volker is making the case that the new President of Ukraine  should not do a political investigation and prosecution of the former  President of Ukraine, Poroshenko. He is making the case we often make  when we travel around the country and meet with other Parliamentarians  about not engaging in political investigations. And when he makes that  remark, Yermak throws it right back in his face and says: Oh, you mean  like the investigation you want us to do with the Clintons and the  Bidens?   I was lamenting this to my colleague. What is our answer to that?  What is the answer to that from a country that prides itself on  adherence to the rule of law? How do we answer that? And his response,  I thought, was very interesting. He said: This proceeding is our  answer. This proceeding is our answer.   Yes, we are a more than fallible democracy and we don't always live  up to our ideals, but when we have a President who demonstrates  corruption of his office, who sacrifices the national interest for his  personal interests, unlike other countries, there is a remedy. So, yes,  we don't always live up to our ideals, but this trial is part of our  constitutional heritage, that we were given the power to impeach the  President.   I don't think a trial without witnesses reflects adversely on the  Chief Justice. I do think it reflects adversely on us. I do think it  diminishes the power of this example to the rest of the world if we  cannot have a fair trial in the face of this kind of Presidential  misconduct. This is the remedy. This is the remedy for Presidential  abuse. But it does not reflect well on any of us if we are afraid of  what the evidence holds.   This will be the first trial in America where the defendant says at  the beginning of the trial: If the prosecution case is so good, why  don't they prove it without any witnesses? That is not a model we can  hold up in pride to the rest of the world.   Yes, Senator, I think that will feed cynicism about this institution,  that we may disagree on the President's conduct or not, but we can't  even get a fair trial. We can't even get a fair shake for the American  people. Oh my God, we can't hear what John Bolton has to say.   God forbid we should hear what a relevant witness has to say. Hear no  evil. That cannot reflect well on any of us. It is certainly no cause  for celebration or vindication or anything like it.   My colleague says that I am a Puritan who speaks in dulcitones. I  think that is the nicest thing he has ever said about me. I wouldn't  describe myself as a Puritan, but, yes, I do believe in right and  wrong, and I think right matters. I think a fair trial matters, and I  think that the country deserves a fair trial.   Yes, Senator, if they don't get that fair trial, it will just further  a cynicism that is corrosive to this institution and to our democracy.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, Mr. Manager.   The Senator from Alabama.
