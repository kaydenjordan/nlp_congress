 Mr. Speaker, last week was the 75th  anniversary of the Normandy invasion. 150,000 American, British, and  Canadian fighting men landed on the beaches of Normandy to begin the  deadly struggle to liberate Europe from Nazism and stop the Holocaust.   Among the heroes were five brothers from Lexington, South Carolina.  Sadly, only four came home alive.   Carroll Floyd Shealy was killed by mortar fire after jumping with the  101st Airborne Division.   Joe Lewis Shealy was wounded and nearly lost his leg after jumping in  with the 82nd Airborne Division.   Muller Everett Shealy served in Normandy with the Army Air Corps.   Billy Ray Shealy and his twin brother, Bobby Rhett Shealy, both  served aboard the USS Dale W. Peterson.   We owe them our deepest gratitude.   Today, congratulations to Bulgaria, recognizing the 29th anniversary  of the first post-Communist election to implement democracy.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________
