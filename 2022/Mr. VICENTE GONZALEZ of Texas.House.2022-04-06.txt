 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate  House Democrats' efforts to pass the Affordable Insulin Now Act, which  would cap the cost of insulin at $35 a month.   This bill will be a game changer for the Rio Grande Valley in south  Texas and the country as a whole. We have the highest rates of diabetes  in the country, and over 25 percent of the population is uninsured.   The stark reality is that the skyrocketing cost of insulin is  crushing south Texans and people across our country.   One in four Americans who rely on insulin have been forced to ration  or skip a dose or choose between buying groceries and filling  prescription drugs.   Pharmaceutical companies manufacture insulin for less than $10 yet  sell it to the American people for more than 10 times that.   I refuse to accept the status quo.   This long-overdue legislation is an important step to lower  healthcare costs for families and hold Big Pharma accountable.   I urge my Senate colleagues to pass the Affordable Insulin Now Act  and send it to the President's desk to sign today.  [[Page H4204]]                                ____________________
