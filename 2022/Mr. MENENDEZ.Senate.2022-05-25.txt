 Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute. Upon such notification,  the Congress has 30 calendar days during which the sale may be  reviewed. The provision stipulates that, in the Senate, the  notification of proposed sales shall be sent to the chairman of the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee.   In keeping with the committee's intention to see that relevant  information is available to the full Senate, I ask unanimous consent to  have printed in the Record the notifications which have been received.  If the cover letter references a classified annex, then such annex is  available to all Senators in the office of the Foreign Relations  Committee, room SD-423.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                    Defense Security                                              Cooperation Agency,                                                      Arlington, VA.

The estimated total cost is       $691 million.        This proposed sale will support the foreign policy and       national security of the United States by helping to improve       the security of a Major Non-NATO Ally that continues to be an       important strategic partner in the Middle East.        The proposed sale will enhance Egypt's capability to       strengthen its homeland defense by replenishing its stocks.       The missiles will be used for counter-terrorism and border       security against armored threats and fortified positions.       Egypt will have no difficulty absorbing these additional       missiles into its armed forces.        The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not       alter the basic military balance in the region.        The principal contractor will be Raytheon Missiles &       Defense, Tucson, AZ. There are no known offset agreements       proposed in connection with this potential sale.        Implementation of this proposed sale will not require the       assignment of any additional U.S. Government or contractor       representatives to Egypt.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.                            transmittal no. 21-33       Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to           Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act                             Annex Item No. vii         (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:        1. The Radio Frequency TOW 2A (RF) Missile (BGM-71-4B-RF)       is a direct attack missile designed to defeat armored       vehicles, reinforced urban structures, field fortification       and other such targets. TOW Missiles are fired from a variety       of TOW Launchers in the U.S. Army, USMC, and FMS partner       forces. The TOW 2A RF missile can be launched from the same       launcher platforms as the existing wire-guided TOW 2A missile       without modification to the launcher. The TOW 2A missile       (both wire and RF) contains two tracker beacons (Xenon and       thermal) for the launcher to track and guide the missile in       flight. Guidance commands from the launcher are provided to       the missile by the RF link contained within the missile case.        2. The highest level of classification of defense articles,       components, and services included in this potential sale is       SECRET.        3. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain       knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements, the       information could be used to develop countermeasures that       might reduce weapon system effectiveness or be used in the       development of a system with similar or advanced       capabilities.        4. A determination has been made that Egypt can provide       substantially the same degree of protection for the sensitive       technology being released as the U.S. Government. This sale       is necessary in furtherance of the U.S. foreign policy and       national security objectives outlined in the Policy       Justification.        5. All defense articles and services listed in this       transmittal have been authorized for release and export to       the Government of Egypt.                                   ____                                                               ____________________
