 Mr. Speaker, one of ObamaCare's most critical  successes was increased mental health services.   Because of ACA, over 48 million are now covered by mental health and  parity laws. Insurance companies can no longer deny coverage for  patients needing mental health services, but we do need tougher  enforcement on this, as well as the insurance rate increases.   The ACA expanded Medicaid, the single largest payer of behavioral  health services, to a new population. That has allowed over 1.6 million  Americans to gain access to substance abuse treatment.   Last month, we signed into law reforms to mental health and substance  abuse grants and services. Repealing ACA would harm those advances. ACA  should be strengthened, not repealed, so more Americans have access to  lifesaving mental health services.   We must move mental health forward, not back. Support ACA.                            ____________________
