 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3542, the Hamas Human Shields  Prevention Act.   Mr. Speaker, this is an act that came before our committee and was  adopted unanimously by voice vote. I was there. My hearing has been  tested recently, and there was not one dissenting voice. I thank  Representatives Wilson and Moulton for their leadership in authoring  the Hamas Human Shields Prevention Act, and I am proud to be a  cosponsor.   This legislation calls out the cowardly use of human shields by Hamas  and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad. It sanctions anyone who supports or  takes part in this horrific practice.   Let us be perfectly clear about what is at stake. There are  designated terrorist entities using innocent civilians, even innocent  children, as a means to camouflage their arsenals. Every time Hamas  does this, every time it is done by Palestinian Islamic Jihad, the  leadership is making a horrific statement: they put a higher value on  their efforts to kill Israeli civilians than they do on the lives of  Gaza's civilians.   Keep in mind, this practice is a violation of the Geneva Conventions  and the rules and laws of war. It is a war crime and should, indeed, be  sanctioned by the United Nations.   First and foremost, this is an issue of basic human rights. Hamas has  forced civilians to gather on the roofs of their homes so they can hide  terrorist military leaders and weapons below. Hamas has even built  their tunnels that they use to move weapons and fighters right under  civilian infrastructure. This puts hospitals, schools, mosques,  markets, and innocent Palestinians at great risk.   It doesn't stop there. Hamas purposely puts rockets in U.N.  facilities, compelling the U.N. to launch daily inspections of each of  their facilities during times of heightened tension and putting  international personnel in harm's way.   Hamas' use of human shields also raises important national security  concerns for Israel. Unlike Palestinian terrorist groups--groups that  seek to kill as many Israeli civilians as possible--in contrast with  that, the Israeli Defense Forces are not blind and cannot be blind to  the plight of innocent civilians.   That is why the Israeli Government has tried to warn Palestinian  civilians of upcoming strikes, including evacuation notices, text  messages and calls, and even low-explosive warning ``knocks.'' These  warnings don't just give innocent civilians the opportunity to  evacuate. They also put the terrorists on notice that strikes are  imminent, giving them an opportunity to escape.   The Israeli Government has made an explicit decision. They care  enough about warning and saving the lives of Palestinian civilians that  they are willing to give an advantage to terrorist groups--groups who  are trying to kill as many Israeli civilians as they possibly can.   The contrast, therefore, is astounding. While Israel has made bold  investments in early warning apps on Israeli phones and developed the  Iron Dome, along with the United States, to protect Israeli civilians  from incoming  [[Page H1086]]  missiles, Hamas makes no effort to protect Gaza civilians and engages  in activities designed to cause Gaza civilians to be killed.   Hamas puts innocent civilians in the line of fire. They hide their  weapons and their leadership beneath schools and hospitals. Then, when  Gaza children die, when innocent men and women are blown apart, Hamas'  leadership cheers quietly at what they perceive as a propaganda coup  against the Israeli Defense Forces.   That is why I support sanctions against Hamas and any of its  supporting organizations and individuals that facilitate the use of  human shields.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she  may consume to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen), who  chairs the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on the Middle East and North  Africa.   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Wilson for presenting this  bill before us today, and I rise in strong support of his bill, the  Hamas Human Shields Prevention Act. I was proud to join Mr. Wilson and  others as an original cosponsor.   Three years ago, the House and Senate both unanimously passed a  concurrent resolution that I authored which denounced the use of human  shields by Hamas and, indeed, any other terror group.   Using human shields is an unconscionable practice. It is a gross  violation of international laws and norms. Yet, invariably, the use of  human shields ends up being a winning strategy for Hamas. Why?   Because the international community falls for its deadly ploy. This  is despite the fact that Israel is unmatched in its efforts to avoid  civilian casualties.   We know Hamas forces Palestinians into becoming human shields, and  the terror group is known for firing on Israeli targets from heavily  populated areas or from places like schools or mosques. They do this on  purpose.   This disgusting practice underscores the fact that Hamas doesn't care  at all about the well-being of the Palestinian people, and the sole  purpose of Hamas is to try to force Israel into a situation in which it  may harm civilians, hoping to turn the public sentiment against the  Jewish State.   Mr. Wilson's bill, therefore, puts down an important marker, Mr.  Speaker. It builds upon our previous efforts by adding punitive  measures identifying and then sanctioning anyone affiliated with Hamas  who uses human shields.   Responsible nations must not allow Hamas to continue to use this  cynical ploy, and we in the United States have a responsibility to lead  and to ensure that this gruesome tactic is ended once and for all.   I thank Mr. Wilson from South Carolina for this initiative, and I  urge my colleagues to join us in supporting this important and much- needed measure before us today. I thank Mr. Wilson for, once again,  highlighting this cynical, deadly, and disgusting ploy being used by  Hamas.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.

I thank Mr. Wilson for, once again,  highlighting this cynical, deadly, and disgusting ploy being used by  Hamas.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he  may consume to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith), chairman of  the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health, Global Human  Rights, and International Organizations.                                time  1600    Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my good friend  for yielding, and I rise in strong support of H.R. 3542, the Hamas  Human Shields Prevention Act, introduced, sponsored, and authored by my  good friend and colleague Joe Wilson; and we are all very grateful he  has brought this important legislation to the floor.   H.R. 3542 is a critical and commonsense measure that addresses Hamas'  cynical and well-documented practice of endangering civilian lives for  the sake of its terror campaign against the State of Israel.   Many independent observers attest to the Palestinian terrorist  group's strategy of locating military equipment and installations  amidst civilian infrastructure. A 2015 Amnesty International report,  Mr. Speaker, entitled, ``Unlawful and Deadly,'' exposed this  reprehensible conduct by the Palestinian terrorist groups during  Israel's 2014 Operation Protective Edge in the Gaza Strip. The report  documented examples of ``attacks launched from the vicinity of civilian  buildings or from residential areas'' in addition to the use of  ``civilian buildings and facilities for other military purposes, such  as storing munitions.''   In one instance chronicled in this report, a foreign journalist  captured footage of a rocket launcher ``located some 50 meters from a  hotel frequented by international correspondents, 100 meters away from  a U.N. building, and very near several civilian homes.'' The footage  additionally showed ``children playing next to the rocket launcher.''   Amnesty further documented the discovery of ``Palestinian munitions  in three . . . vacant''--UNRWA--``schools in the Gaza Strip'' during  the conflict. One of these schools, although vacant, had ``two UNRWA  schools on either side of it''--that--``were each hosting around 1,500  displaced civilians.''   Mr. Speaker, Hamas' perverse practice of using U.N. installations to  shield military infrastructure has not abated since the 2014 Gaza war.  UNRWA discovers military infrastructure in the immediate environs of  its school on an alarmingly regular basis. Last year alone, the agency  reported discovering two militant tunnels located under its schools in  the Gaza Strip.   Of course, human rights reports and UNRWA statements account only for  a limited scope of violations that are observed and documented by  international organizations, media correspondents, and credible NGOs.  The real scope of Hamas' human shield policy is almost certainly far  greater. Israeli authorities, for example, reported that out of 3,600  Palestinian rockets launched in the first month and a half of Operation  Protective Edge, 1,600 of those rockets, nearly 45 percent, were fired  from civilian areas.   H.R. 3542 rightfully calls on the administration to use its voice and  vote in the United Nations Security Council to impose multilateral  sanctions on Hamas for this disgraceful pattern of exploiting innocent  civilians, including women and children, so that it can rain  indiscriminate rockets on innocent Israelis with greater impunity. This  bill would also impose U.S. visa bans and asset freezes on individuals  and entities that direct or facilitate Hamas' use of human shields.   By supporting this measure, Mr. Speaker, this House can advance the  cause of civilian protection for Israelis and Palestinians alike.   Again, I want to thank Mr. Wilson for this excellent bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I have no other speakers on this side, so I will make a few remarks  in closing. Mr. Speaker, I want to put this legislation in the broader  context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. A Palestinian state will  never be born as a result of the use of human shields. No country can  make peace with a group that uses its own women and children in that  manner, and no country can build peace with an entity that makes the  violation of the Geneva Conventions and the international rules of law  established military policy.   I am a firm believer in a two-state solution that results in a secure  Jewish State of Israel and a peaceful Palestinian state by its side. I  hope that this legislation will help move toward that end because it  seeks to empower those who want to make peace and sanctions those who  cheapen human life and violate international law.   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, which passed in our  committee without a dissenting voice.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   First, I would like to thank Congressman Sherman for his leadership  in this bipartisan legislation, which will make a difference on behalf  of the people of Gaza and on behalf of the people of Israel.   The terrorists of Hamas hide behind school children, hospital  patients, and other vulnerable civilians. This cowardly use of human  shields is a grave  [[Page H1087]]  human rights abuse that must be stopped, which sacrifices the lives of  innocent Palestinians.   I again want to thank the bipartisan sponsors of the Hamas Human  Shields Prevention Act, which deserves our unanimous support, and, in  particular, I point out the cosponsorship by the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. Moulton).   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I have no other speakers on this side, so I will make a few remarks  in closing.

Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in support of H. Res. 129 calling on the Department of Defense  and other elements of the Federal Government and foreign governments to  intensify efforts to investigate, recover, and identify all missing and  unaccounted-for personnel of the United States.   I rise in support of H. Res. 129, which affirms our government's  commitment to investigating and recovering missing American personnel.  I especially want to thank Representative Sam Johnson, not only for  introducing this resolution but for embodying our dedication to those  who are captured or missing, whose service to this country, 7 years as  a POW, three of those in solitary confinement, exemplify the highest  honor of our military forces.   I also want to thank Chairman Royce for bringing this resolution  forward. Our brave servicemembers risk their lives for our country  every day, and when they go missing, we owe it to them never to give  up. No matter how many years pass, no matter how many miles we must  travel, our search for them must continue.   More than 83,000 personnel of the United States are still unaccounted  for around the world from past wars and conflicts. This is the  equivalent of an entire city, and their families are mourning the loss  of ones they hold dear.   Although an estimated 50,000 of these are World War II personnel lost  at sea and, sadly, unlikely to ever be recovered, we must continue our  efforts whenever there is any possibility of discovering and recovering  an American who has been lost in the service of our country.   Our brave men and women expect that when they make the ultimate  sacrifice, we will make extraordinary efforts to recover them, and if  we don't do exactly that, we are not only failing those families but  also one of our military's most sacred principles: ``leave no man or  woman behind.''   We honor this principle because it reminds us that, unlike many of  our enemies, whose soldiers are viewed as expendable pawns of the  regime, we value each and every life. Those missing in action need to  be returned home to their families where they belong.   This resolution has a simple message for our government. It is time  to intensify our efforts to investigate, recover, identify, and account  as fully as possible for all those missing and unaccounted-for American  personnel. It also urges foreign governments to cooperate with us in  these important efforts so that every soldier, sailor, airman, and  marine gets the homecoming they deserve.   Thank you to all the men and women who have served and continue to  serve our great country and the principles we stand for. I urge my  colleagues to support this resolution.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as he  may consume to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Sam Johnson), the author  of this measure, a former fighter pilot and prisoner of war, and a true  American hero.   Mr. SAM JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise and say: God bless you  both. Thank you for what you said.   I rise in strong support of H. Res. 129. This resolution I introduced  calls for an intensified effort to account for the tens of thousands of  American servicemembers who are still missing in action. Many folks  don't realize there are still more than 82,000 American servicemembers  who remain unaccounted for.                                time  1615    In fact, I, myself, was classified as missing in action for almost 2  years after my shoot-down over north Vietnam in 1966. That is why it is  so meaningful to have this resolution on the House floor during the  45th anniversary of Operation Homecoming, which brought me and my  fellow Vietnam POWs back to our beloved country after many long years  in hell on Earth.   During my time as an MIA, my family was unsure where I was or whether  I was even alive or dead. But my devoted wife, Shirley, and countless  other families with the National League of POW/MIA Families  continuously advocated for the return of all our POWs and MIAs from the  Vietnam war. It is because of their tireless work, and by the grace of  God, that my fellow POWs and I were reunited with our families 45 years  ago this week.   I am joined today by my two daughters, Gini and Beverly, who, along  with my late wife, were a key part of the effort to bring us home.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask my colleagues to join me in  recognizing the strength and devotion of my two lovely daughters, Gini  and Beverly, who are seated in the gallery.   But, Mr. Speaker, we must never forget our troops who still remain  missing in action; and we must never forget their families, who  anxiously await a final accounting of their loved ones. In many cases,  so much time has gone by that it has fallen to the next generation to  repatriate their missing family members. They deserve our dedicated  help and support.   After my return from Vietnam, I vowed to continue to fight for our  missing troops and their families. During my time serving in the U.S.- Russia Joint Commission on POW/MIAs, I traveled the world to places  like Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, and even to the Russian military archives  in Moscow to try to find our missing troops. And I will never stop  fighting.   For the families of our troops who remain missing in action, this  resolution is for you.   This resolution calls on the United States Government and the  Department of Defense to diligently continue  [[Page H1089]]  efforts to investigate, recover, and identify all missing U.S.  personnel around the world. It also calls on foreign governments that  have information on our missing personnel to cooperate fully with our  government.   We must remain united in our efforts to recover all of our missing  troops and to never forget their sacrifice.   I would also urge my colleagues to remember that, while I was in the  Hanoi Hilton, the north Vietnamese told my fellow POWs and me that our  country had forgotten us. As the days turned into years, we had to  fight that fear. The feeling of being alone and forgotten is horrible.  And the families of POWs and MIAs feel a similar pain. That is why I  will continue to make every effort to repatriate my missing brothers  and sisters in arms and hold true to the promise: ``No Man Left  Behind.''   But I also call on all current and future Members of Congress to  carry the mantle.   We cannot, and must not, forget the faithful servicemen and -women  who deserve to be brought home to the country they gave their all to  protect. It is my sincere hope that we will one day bring home all of  America's missing patriots. These heroes deserve to return to American  soil with all of our honor and respect. And their families deserve the  closure of their loved ones that they have awaited for for so long.   Mr. Speaker, I ask for the support of all of my colleagues and that  they join me in supporting this important resolution.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair would gently remind Members to  refrain from referencing persons in the gallery.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in support of H. Res. 129 calling on the Department of Defense  and other elements of the Federal Government and foreign governments to  intensify efforts to investigate, recover, and identify all missing and  unaccounted-for personnel of the United States.   I rise in support of H. Res. 129, which affirms our government's  commitment to investigating and recovering missing American personnel.  I especially want to thank Representative Sam Johnson, not only for  introducing this resolution but for embodying our dedication to those  who are captured or missing, whose service to this country, 7 years as  a POW, three of those in solitary confinement, exemplify the highest  honor of our military forces.   I also want to thank Chairman Royce for bringing this resolution  forward. Our brave servicemembers risk their lives for our country  every day, and when they go missing, we owe it to them never to give  up. No matter how many years pass, no matter how many miles we must  travel, our search for them must continue.   More than 83,000 personnel of the United States are still unaccounted  for around the world from past wars and conflicts. This is the  equivalent of an entire city, and their families are mourning the loss  of ones they hold dear.   Although an estimated 50,000 of these are World War II personnel lost  at sea and, sadly, unlikely to ever be recovered, we must continue our  efforts whenever there is any possibility of discovering and recovering  an American who has been lost in the service of our country.   Our brave men and women expect that when they make the ultimate  sacrifice, we will make extraordinary efforts to recover them, and if  we don't do exactly that, we are not only failing those families but  also one of our military's most sacred principles: ``leave no man or  woman behind.''   We honor this principle because it reminds us that, unlike many of  our enemies, whose soldiers are viewed as expendable pawns of the  regime, we value each and every life. Those missing in action need to  be returned home to their families where they belong.   This resolution has a simple message for our government. It is time  to intensify our efforts to investigate, recover, identify, and account  as fully as possible for all those missing and unaccounted-for American  personnel. It also urges foreign governments to cooperate with us in  these important efforts so that every soldier, sailor, airman, and  marine gets the homecoming they deserve.   Thank you to all the men and women who have served and continue to  serve our great country and the principles we stand for. I urge my  colleagues to support this resolution.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as he  may consume to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Sam Johnson), the author  of this measure, a former fighter pilot and prisoner of war, and a true  American hero.   Mr. SAM JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise and say: God bless you  both. Thank you for what you said.   I rise in strong support of H. Res. 129.

Mr. Speaker, I ask for the support of all of my colleagues and that  they join me in supporting this important resolution.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair would gently remind Members to  refrain from referencing persons in the gallery.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the  gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith), the chairman of the Foreign  Affairs Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health, Global Human Rights, and  International Organizations; and a longstanding leader on behalf of  veterans' issues.   Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of Sam  Johnson's resolution and join the House in honoring a truly heroic man  who has suffered so much for our country, and I thank him for that.   I would say to my colleagues, having read and observed Sam for so  many years, words are inadequate--they are truly inadequate--to  describe his courage, his tenacity, his faith in God, and his valor. He  is really a hero who stands above with few peers.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Sam for his leadership and for being who he is.  I also thank his family. It is just a privilege to know him and to be  up here supporting legislation that he has sponsored for a full and  thorough accounting of all of our POWs and MIAs.   As Members know, access to the battlefield during and after war is  important. With regards to Japan, Italy, and Nazi Germany, we had  access after the last shot was fired. Indeed, today we are close  friends and allies. So those who are missing in action or POWs are more  likely to be presumed dead if not found.   That is not the case, Mr. Speaker, when it comes to North Korea,  where there is no access to the theatre of operations in the North and  where we remain and the families remain in agony for decades about what  happened to their loved ones.   With regards to Vietnam, there were many live sightings of POWs  especially after prisoners like Sam and others came home, people who  were observed on the ground. I was part of the POW/MIA task force in  Congress in the 1980s. Jerry Solomon and others and I traveled to  Vietnam to talk about those live sightings and the fact that the  Vietnamese did not provide a full accounting. Many who were observed  went missing, and we think they may have been executed by the  Vietnamese long after the peace treaty was signed.   We do have some cooperation, as we all know, to crash sites and the  like. That is all good. It is certainly not enough. We do not have  unfettered access to the battlefield, and that remains a reason why our  great and distinguished colleague, Sam Johnson, is offering this  resolution. We need to redouble our efforts.   I would just point out for the record that Sam Johnson flew 62 combat  missions in the Korean war and 25 missions in the Vietnam war before  being shot down. He was in the Air Force for 29 years. He commanded two  air bases, among other things. He is a lifelong fighter, student of  war, combat warrior, a leader of men, and, of course, a prisoner of  war.   He spent, as my colleagues and I have all noted, nearly 7 years as a  prisoner of war in Vietnam, where torture was systematic. He endured  that, overcame that, and, of course, with his faith, became a great  inspiration to all of us as someone who has suffered so much, yet  continues to have a strong faith in God and a faith in humanity.   As he pointed out in a statement, he was 140 pounds when he was  released and repatriated. He also pointed out that during his  incarceration he was in solitary confinement and in leg stocks, like  the pilgrims, as he put it, for 72 days. Then, the following day after  he was let out, he couldn't walk. He was then put in leg irons for 2\1/ 2\ years: a tight metal cuff around each ankle, with a foot long bar  connecting the legs. He still has little feeling in the right arm and  his right hand after those 2,500 days of horrific captivity.   Again, he saw a silver lining because he still had a dream and hope  for the future, which some people would have lost a long time ago and  just given up--what an inspiration for today's generation of a man who  has suffered so much, has overcome so much, and remains an optimist  deep in his heart.   Again, words are inadequate to describe our colleague. Sam Johnson is  the definition of courage.    Mr. Speaker, having no speakers on my side, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to add my voice to the voice of every other  speaker on this resolution, for what an honor it has been to serve with  Sam Johnson and to see his example of service on the floor of this  House every day.   I want to reiterate the importance of this resolution. It sends a  critical message to our military families that their sacrifices are not  forgotten. Our government must never give up until every last American  is returned to their families and to their homeland.   Today, it is easy to think of Congress as a body divided between  Republicans and Democrats, but, ultimately, we are all Americans, and  each and every one of us owes a huge debt of gratitude to our troops  serving today and those who have served in the past. Their valor and  courage have defined our Nation's course. We applaud them, we honor  them, and we will do everything in our power to see that those who  remain unaccounted-for are returned home.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this resolution, and I  yield back the balance of my time.   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   As I close, I want to commend the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency,  which continues the noble work of accounting for our missing troops and  personnel day in and day out around the world.   I also want to express gratitude to those groups that continue to  keep the home fires burning bright for the many families still awaiting  concrete information on their loved ones. These include:   The National League of POW/MIA Families;   The American Legion;   The Veterans of Foreign Wars;   The Disabled American Veterans;   The Jewish War Veterans;   AMVETS;   Vietnam Veterans of America;   The Special Forces Association;   The Special Operations Association; and   Rolling Thunder.   Finally, I, again, thank Congressman Sam Johnson for introducing this  resolution and for exemplifying the ideals of service, sacrifice, and  honor. He was recognized by his communist suppressors as one of the  most stubborn prisoners, a true tribute of his courage.   All Members of Congress, of both parties, cherish the service of  Congressman Sam Johnson.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support for H. Res. 129, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
