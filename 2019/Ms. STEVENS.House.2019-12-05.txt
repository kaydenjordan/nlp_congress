 Madam Speaker, last week, tragedy struck the South Lyon  community in Oakland County, Michigan, as we learned of the death of  Trevon Tyler.   Just 17 years old, Trevon died from complications following knee  surgery.   Trevon was a beloved member of the South Lyon community and a member  of the South Lyon East High School football team.   His coach called him ``the nicest, most fun-loving, caring kid.'' He  ``walked with a pretty big pep in his step. He always said hi to  everybody. Everybody loved him. He was a little bit of a jokester, had  this big laugh, always made you smile.''   Trevon's incredible family, friends, classmates, and teammates are  all heartbroken by his passing. His life was cut tragically short, but  he will always be remembered by that smile, his laugh, his friendship,  and his contributions to our community.   Today, we are called to live our lives more like Tre, with joy and  love at the forefront.                            ____________________
