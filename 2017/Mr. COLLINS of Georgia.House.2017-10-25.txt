 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and to include extraneous material on H.R. 469.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Norman). Is there objection to the  request of the gentleman from Georgia?   There was no objection.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 577 and rule  XVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House  on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill, H.R. 469.   The Chair appoints the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Duncan) to  preside over the Committee of the Whole.                                time  1621                        In the Committee of the Whole    Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the  Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill  (H.R. 469) to impose certain limitations on consent decrees and  settlement agreements by agencies that require the agencies to take  regulatory action in accordance with the terms thereof, and for other  purposes, with Mr. Duncan from Tennessee in the chair.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the  first time.   The gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Collins) and the gentleman from Rhode  Island (Mr. Cicilline) each will control 30 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Georgia.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I am glad to be here on H.R. 469. We have had the  opportunity, through rule debate yesterday, to discuss this.   What we are coming forward with today is a bill that I have  introduced that basically breaks down to what we know is a sue and  settlement ban on this part of my bill. There are other parts that we  are going to get to as we go forward in this.   But I think I want to start off this debate today by simply stating  some of the foundational issues--things that we come here and talk  about many times on the floor of the House have to do with bills and  discussions. But one of the things I think that has been very  disturbing for me--and I know many of our colleagues as we have come up  here--is the disturbing trend of moving away from Congress relieving  its powers and taking ownership of its Article I authority, and doing  the oversight, doing the planning, doing the budgeting, and then sort  of moving that more toward the executive branch or letting the judicial  system take responsibility.   And I think one of the things that we are starting out with today in  these bills, that we have taken up over the past 2 days, is a general  discussion to move back toward Article I authority, which Congress is  doing the legislating and the oversight that it is supposed to be, and  the executive branch is following through in their role of actually  executing the laws that are made, judicial, of course, being the  interpretive branch.   What we are seeing in this bill--and one of the reasons for our sue  and settlement legislation, which is my part of this bill, and I want  to start here, and we will continue as we go through this through the  other parts as we go--is really a fairness issue. And this is not  specific to one party in the executive branch. I stated this yesterday.  Sometimes it gets mixed up. But hear me clearly: I don't care the party  of the resident at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. I do not care who they may  be in the sense of what they do in that job. What I want to know is:  Are they fulfilling the executive branch role and not overstepping  Congress' role?   What we have seen over previous administrations, including the last  one and the previous administration, especially under this area of sue  and settlement that increased greatly during the last administration,  was this idea of taking a law that we have passed, having the  regulatory agency's job to execute that law; but, at the same point in  time, being sued by a friendly party, or another party, on a deadline  of the bill, or something that they want to, they go into, say, with  EPA or another agency, and they discuss this lawsuit. They come to an  agreement, and they  [[Page H8195]]  file the suit. Many times the suit and the consent were filed on the  same day.   The consent decree--now, look, consent decrees are good judicial  tools. They have been used, and will continue to be used, even under  this bill. But what we don't want to have happen is when the consent  decree basically comes at the time of the suit, or just shortly  thereafter, where the party that wants to see a specific agenda pushed,  along with a willing agency, goes to a judge, is able to get that  consent decree, and then turn around and give it to somebody else and  say: You now have to live under this without any emphasis or any input  from the other party.    So we are simply saying: Let's make this a little fair. You are going  to have to publicize notice, you are going to have to actually include  others who may have a problem with this consent decree, and you are  going to have to do it a little more transparently.   So we are going to start here today, Mr. Chairman. We are going to  talk about these issues and coming forward. We can talk about many  other things as the day progresses, but, at the end of the day, it is  about Congress itself taking control of its Article I authority and  saying, ``We are going to be the legislative branch that we are called  to be,'' and the executive taking their role and judiciary taking  theirs.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the comments,  especially of my friend from Rhode Island. I would agree in principle  with the Meese amendment as well. The problem is that, through the  Clinton administration and through preceding administrations, it has  been watered  [[Page H8197]]  down. I would actually go back to that. The problem is lack of  transparency and the lack of a coherent voice here as we go further,  but I do appreciate the comments.   Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from South Carolina  (Mr. Norman).    Mr. Chairman, I don't believe, as was just  stated, that there is a nefarious plot here. It is to get government  doing the regulation it should with transparency--and that is what  needs to be done--and have Congress do what it should be doing, and  that is writing laws and having the regulatory process start from here.  That is simply what we are looking at. If that is too much, I  understand.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Utah (Mr.  Stewart).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to the  gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Johnson), a member of the Judiciary  Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to the  gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Johnson), a member of the Judiciary  Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   In closing, I just want to say that this is not just something that  has  [[Page H8199]]  been dreamed up, as far as from a bill perspective. And they can point  to studies that say this may or may not be a part, but even the outside  organization, the Environmental Council of the States, sent a letter  and basically did a resolution that said there is a need to reform  State participation in EPA consent decrees which settled through  citizen lawsuits. I mean, this is an issue because there is not the  transparency that is needed. That is why these bills are here.   I would just like to remind everyone why we are considering this bill  today, going back to where we first started, and why the House passed  the Stop Settlement Slush Funds Act and the Congressional Subpoena  Compliance and Enforcement Act earlier this week: to help restore and  reinforce the powers the people gave Congress in Article I of the  Constitution.   Restoring and reinforcing these powers is not some academic issue;  this is something that we practice every day. It goes back to as early  as our elementary school days dealing with our simple civics, saying  this is the way our government is set up.   I have said this before, Mr. Chairman, from this podium, and I will  say it again. If the people in agencies down the street would like to  make law, then I encourage them to leave their job, run for Congress,  and come up here and make law. This is not their job to do it from a  cubicle down the street through a lawsuit. We need to do it up here, as  it should be properly done.   So, for far too long, Congress has been giving away its power. We  want to see that change. We are going to see that. That is why this  bill is here. And although this bill alone is certainly not a silver  bullet for restoring the power the Congress has ceded, just as powers  are gradually lost over time, they will be regained by Congress  gradually reasserting itself.   I ask my colleagues to join me in support of this legislation to  reassert congressional authority and to ensure that individual liberty  protected by the powers of separation of powers between the branches is  maintained.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to express my strong opposition  to H.R. 469 the ``Sunshine for Regulatory Decrees and Settlements Act''  of 2017.   H.R. 469 is yet another attempt to undermine the ability of Federal  regulators to protect the health and safety of Americans.   This ill-conceived bill imposes numerous new procedural burdens on  agencies and courts intended to dissuade them from using consent  decrees and settlement agreements to resolve enforcement actions filed  to address agency noncompliance with the law.   H.R. 469 targets consent decrees and settlement agreements involving  congressionally mandated federal agency actions.   These agency actions in many instances have the purpose of protecting  civil rights, health, safety, and the environment.   H.R. 469 prescribes a host of burdensome--and, in some cases,  ambiguous--steps for courts and parties relating to such consent  decrees and settlements that would favor continued litigation over  settlement.   H.R. 469 establishes a prolonged process of publication,  intervention, and court-supervised mediation for these types of  settlements.   This prolonged process would waste judicial, individuals, and local  governments' resources, while wealthy corporations are empowered to  perpetuate violations of federal rules.   Such hurdles to settlements conflict directly with the expressly  stated and longstanding policy of the federal judiciary system to favor  compromise and the settlement of disputes in order to make the best use  of limited resources.   Proponents of this legislation argue that agencies and interest  groups collude to ``sue and settle'' to avoid compliance with the  procedures set forth in the Administrative Procedure Act.   These allegations are unfounded in fact.   The consent decrees and settlement agreements at issue do not  determine the substance of agency rules.   Rather, such agreements simply seek to enforce mandatory statutory  and procedural duties (such as deadlines enacted by Congress).   In fact, a December 2014 Government Accountability Office report  surveyed settlements over deadlines for major U.S. Environmental  Protection Act rulemakings and found that the settlements did not  influence the substantive results.   Furthermore, all public notice and comment requirements of the  Administrative Procedure Act and the individual laws at issue still  apply when an agency undertakes the substantive action for which a  deadline was missed.   Parties and non-parties alike are provided with numerous  opportunities to provide input in advance of the rules being finalized.   H.R. 469 undermines protections for the American people, masqueraded  as a measure to prevent undocumented and unfounded allegations of ``sue  and settle'' collusion between public interest plaintiffs and  sympathetic federal agencies entering into consent decrees and  settlements.   In fact, H.R. 469 favors industry interests at taxpayer expense and  promotes regulatory uncertainty by making it virtually impossible to  actually enter into consent decrees and settlements that avoid the  costly and time consuming alternative of litigation.   But its most serious flaw is that H.R. 469 is really a back door way  to derail the rulemaking process and undermine federal law, shifting  limited agency resources away from the implementation of health and  safety protections for the very people that we are supposed to be  representing.   What this bill truly targets are the legal rights of citizens to hold  government accountable by enforcing laws designed to protect health,  safety, and the environment, obligations that the supporters of this  bill would prefer to remain unenforced.   A broad coalition of more than 150 civil rights, environmental,  consumer protection and other public interest groups opposed the bill  in the last Congress.   On Monday, October 23, 2017, I received a letter signed by 86  environmental protection and civil rights groups urging me to oppose  this bill.   A bill that attempts to give third parties the power to obstruct and  delay the enforcement of federal law; which will harm plaintiff  corporations, state and local governments, nonprofit groups, and  individuals alike, when their interests have been harmed by illegal  federal agency actions or inactions.   Consent decrees and settlement agreements are simple, streamlined  ways to hold federal agencies accountable when they ignore Congress by  failing to commit congressionally mandated actions by a date  established in statute.   H.R. 469 is a sad attempt to eliminate vital and broadly supported  protections that have improved and saved millions of American lives.   By providing opportunities for industry to subvert or delay the  process of redressing injured groups, H.R. 469 effectively makes it  more expensive for agencies to do what Congress has mandated, that is  to protect the American people and redress any harm to their  livelihood.   Some of the unwholesomeness of this bill could have been mitigated  had the Jackson Lee amendment to H.R. 469 been made in order.   The Jackson Lee amendment would have excepted consent decrees or  settlement agreements that pertain to a reduction in illness or death  from exposure to toxic substances in communities that are protected by  Executive Order 12898.   Executive Order 12898 directs federal agencies to identify and  address the disproportionately high and adverse human health and  environmental effects of agency action on minority and low-income  populations.   It is impossible to understand why even conservative Republicans  would back legislation that hinders enforcement of the law, requires  agencies to waste money in court on cases they believe they cannot win,  and would stymie industry and state settlements along with all others.   I urge all members to vote against H.R. 469 and reject this harmful  legislation.   The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Mitchell). All time for general debate has  expired.

(f) Review by Court.--        (1) Amicus.--A court considering a proposed covered consent       decree or settlement agreement shall presume, subject to       rebuttal, that it is proper to allow amicus participation       relating to the covered consent decree or settlement       agreement by any person who filed public comments or       participated in a public hearing on the covered consent       decree or settlement agreement under paragraph (2) or (3) of       subsection (d).        (2) Review of deadlines.--        (A) Proposed covered consent decrees.--For a proposed       covered consent decree, a court shall not approve the covered       consent decree unless the proposed covered consent decree       allows sufficient time and incorporates adequate procedures       for the agency to comply with chapter 5 of title 5, United       States Code, and other applicable statutes that govern       rulemaking and, unless contrary to the public interest, the       provisions of any Executive order that governs rulemaking.        (B) Proposed covered settlement agreements.--For a proposed       covered settlement agreement, a court shall ensure that the       covered settlement agreement allows sufficient time and       incorporates adequate procedures for the agency to comply       with chapter 5 of title 5, United States Code, and other       applicable statutes that govern rulemaking and, unless       contrary to the public interest, the provisions of any       Executive order that governs rulemaking.        (g) Annual Reports.--Each agency shall submit to Congress       an annual report that, for the year covered by the report,       includes--        (1) the number, identity, and content of covered civil       actions brought against and covered consent decrees or       settlement agreements entered against or into by the agency;       and        (2) a description of the statutory basis for--        (A) each covered consent decree or settlement agreement       entered against or into by the agency; and        (B) any award of attorneys fees or costs in a civil action       resolved by a covered consent decree or settlement agreement       entered against or into by the agency.       SEC. 104. MOTIONS TO MODIFY CONSENT DECREES.         If an agency moves a court to modify a covered consent       decree or settlement agreement and the basis of the motion is       that the terms of the covered consent decree or settlement       agreement are no longer fully in the public interest due to       the obligations of the agency to fulfill other duties or due       to changed facts and circumstances, the court shall review       the motion and the covered consent decree or settlement       agreement de novo.

[[Page H8202]]                   Amendment No. 1 Offered by Mr. Collins of Georgia    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 1  printed in part A of House Report 115-363.    Mr. Chairman, I rise as the designee of  Chairman Goodlatte, and I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 16, line 2, insert after ``otherwise prohibited by       law'' the following: ``(other than section 552a of title 5,       United States Code)''.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 577, the gentleman  from Georgia (Mr. Collins) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Georgia.    Mr. Chairman, the Department of the  Treasury's interpretation of current law prohibits it from making  public the names of plaintiffs. My amendment clarifies that these  names, which this bill requires to be disclosed, will, in fact, be  disclosed.   In January 2016, it was reported that the United States agreed to pay  $1.7 billion to Iran in a settlement arising from an agreement to sell  military equipment to Iran prior to the 1979 Iranian Revolution. At the  time, it was known that $400 million in cash had been transferred to  Iran, but it was unclear, even after public inquiry, how the remaining  $1.3 billion had been paid.   On August 22, 2016, the New York Sun reported that, while conducting  an ongoing but fruitless search of ``Iran'' as a claimant in the  Treasury database, it found 13 payments totaling 13 cents less than  $1.3 billion, as well as an additional payment of just over $10  million. Without further context, however, the New York Sun could not  confirm whether these payments were, in fact, part of the settlement.   It was only after months of increased public scrutiny, long after the  money had been disbursed, that the previous administration acknowledges  that these payments were indeed part of the Iran settlement.   My amendment will ensure that the public knows about the conduct of  its government and the laws that are being faithfully executed and that  justice is being served. The information that this bill requires to be  disclosed, which, in many cases is already publicly available in court  documents, informs Congress and the public in new ways, particularly  with regard to systemic government abuse.   Furthermore, any concerns about the disclosure of the plaintiffs'  names are mitigated by the fact that this amendment does not foreclose  a court's ability to protect private information. Indeed, the  information required to be made public in title II will not be  disclosed if such disclosure is prohibited by a court order. Moreover,  Federal judges have ample discretion to allow a plaintiff to proceed  under the pseudonym as a ``Doe plaintiff'' or to seal and redact  intimate records.   My amendment is necessary to prevent future government abuse by  increasing the overall transparency of the Judgment Fund and, in turn,  increasing government accountability.   I urge my colleagues to support this important clarification, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, you can also go home and tell  them, if they filed a suit, that it is already currently in the PACER  system, probably with more information than just that, or they could  have filed it under a pseudonym or had their lawyers have this  suppressed. This is an issue that is already out there; and as we look  at this, this is moving forward. So I would just ask that this  amendment be reported favorably.   I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Collins).   The amendment was agreed to.                    Amendment No. 2 Offered by Mr. Conyers    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 2 made  in order by the order of the House of October 24, 2017.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.    Mr. Chairman, with much respect for my  ranking member on my committee--we have served together; we have worked  on a lot of issues together, namely, the Police Working Group, and  other things, and his work has been very helpful in that regard--I do  have to oppose this amendment because, really, what this amendment does  is seek less transparency, public participation, and judicial review  for consent decrees and settlement agreements for regulations that  allegedly will help to protect civil rights.   With all due respect, I believe this has matters backwards. More  transparency, public input, and judicial scrutiny will only help to  produce regulations that better protect civil rights.   Further, since the bill promotes the participation of regulated  entities and State, local, and Tribal entities that may be affected by  or help to enforce the regulations, it will promote buy-in from these  groups. That will help the regulation to be better and more promptly  implemented and not held for years in litigation challenging the rules.   I would urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I yield back  the balance of my time.                                time  1715     Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.    I was just sitting here, Mr. Chairman, and I  am excited and welcome my friend from Georgia to the fight for  broadband. I have been leading on this fight now for several years,  especially in my district, which is rural, which has a company called  Windstream that does not provide for its citizens. I am excited to have  the acknowledgment that rural broadband is something that we need to be  fighting for.   My district has areas in which Windstream was supposed to use its  Connect America funds to widen its footprint on rural broadband.  Instead, they have shrunk it, only to compete in areas where they are  competing against other companies, and only widening it in areas where  they already had technology which they could have widened years before.   I think it is really interesting, and I am so glad about this because  it also gives me the opportunity to talk about the GO Act, the Gigabyte  Opportunity Act, which actually will provide real solutions into these  districts for broadband opportunity.   I would encourage my friends from Georgia and from Michigan, and  anybody else, to sign on to this bill. It is a good bill that has  support across the way in the Senate, and also working with the  administration to provide the way for States to actually look at their  own States and provide gigabyte opportunity zones so that they can  actually make ways and get these companies that are monopolizing the  areas and not serving their constituents.   By the way, Mr. Chairman, it is sad because, in some of my districts  right now, it has been over really about 6 weeks or so since Irma came  through northeast Georgia and knocked out power and delayed broadband,  and I still have customers in my district who do not have phone service  or broadband this long after that fact.   This is just unacceptable, so I appreciate the concern here. The only  problem is, this amendment doesn't help. This amendment is not one that  does--again, it just is another amendment, unfortunately, like the last  amendment, that seeks less transparency and public participation. It  does not do anything to discourage people from working to find rural  broadband solutions.   What this actually does, it just, again, tries to seek less  transparency instead of more. But I think there is a positive here. I  choose to look at the positive. I disagree with this amendment and  would ask that it be voted ``no.'' But I look at the positive to say,  as someone from Georgia, we have got a fight we can connect on, and  that is rural broadband, because there is no longer a digital divide.  There is a hope and dream divide. It is not a digital divide. It is a  hope and dream for those students, and those moms, and those dads, and  those families in those areas who cannot access the internet.    For me, it was a radio and a book. It took me all over the world.  Nowadays, it is the internet and a phone where our students can  actually get what they want. Unfortunately, this amendment doesn't do  it. I have to oppose this amendment, but I am glad to welcome to the  fight another friend against the evils of not being able to expand  broadband.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.

The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.    Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman  bringing it forward. Again, we have never said that consent decrees  can't be used. The issue here is how they are used in transparency.  Justice delayed, as has been said, is not one that is denied, but also  transparency not used is also things that are done in the dark and away  from the public view which also can have issues that we go forward.  Very few of these cases are actually brought by Joe Private Citizen.  They are brought by groups with interest.   Even in the Chesapeake Bay, which has an $18 billion compliance tag,  the rushed timeframe did not allow others' input and buy-in from other  localities.   So, again, nowhere has abuse of sue and settle tactics been seen so  much as in the environmental regulation. In fact, the Judiciary  Committee's report on this bill highlights 10 environmental sue and  settle regulations from the Obama administration that equaled up to  $125 billion of cost.   Even the Environmental Council, as I stated earlier, in 2013, adopted  a resolution calling upon the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to  adopt reforms like the ones in this bill.   This amendment would deny reform to precisely the area of regulation  that needs it most and, thereby, substantially gut the bill. We can  have good environmental regulations without shady, backroom dealing of  sue and settle litigation skewing the results and excessively  heightening the burden.   I appreciate the gentleman bringing the amendment, but I would oppose  it, and I would ask my colleagues to oppose the amendment as well.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   Mr. McEACHIN. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman's concerns,  but actually having been a trial lawyer and actually having practiced  law in the courts of the Commonwealth of Virginia and elsewhere, there  is no more transparent process than the litigation process.   I would submit that the notion that somehow these actions are brought  by someone other than our constituents, someone other than citizens of  the United States, is not well taken.   So, Mr. Chairman, I would conclude by simply asking that my  colleagues support this amendment, that we move forward in that regard,  and I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Virginia (Mr. McEachin).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes  appeared to have it.   Mr. McEACHIN. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.   The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further  proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Virginia  will be postponed.   The Chair understands that amendment No. 5 will not be offered.                  Amendment No. 6 Offered by Mr. Cartwright    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 6  printed in part A of House Report 115-363.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.    Mr. Chairman, I do appreciate the gentleman  bringing in the Meese memo. We discussed this earlier that if we  actually went back to the actual intent of the Meese memo which said  the Attorney General would be the part, we could probably agree on  that. But let's get some things straight. There has been nothing  codified. This is a regulation. It has not been codified. Codification  would have to come from actual legislation passed by this body, and it  is not.   The amendment would seek to carve out of the bill consent decrees and  settlements entered into under Department of Justice regulations  ostensibly written to implement this Meese memo.   The Meese memo was a Reagan-era Department policy, issued by Attorney  General Meese, that prohibited the Department from entering into  specified categories of decrees or settlements--particularly those that  allowed the judiciary, through judicial orders, from invading the  constitutionally exclusive authority of the executive branch.   Current regulations, however, require less scrutiny by, and less  accountability for, such consent decrees on the part of the Attorney  General.   What we need is not less Department of Justice accountability for  backroom deals that trespass constitutional lines of authority, but  more accountability. The bill would restore full accountability  consistent with the letter and the spirit of the Meese memo itself.   Further, the amendment would carve out any and all decrees and  settlements entered by the approval of officials as low as the  Assistant Attorneys General--meaning most of the relevant decrees and  settlements entered into by the Department. As a result, the amendment  would gut the bill's consent decree and settlement reforms.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
