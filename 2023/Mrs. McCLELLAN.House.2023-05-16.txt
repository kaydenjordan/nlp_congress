 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate infrastructure  week and highlight the incredible projects made possible in Virginia by  the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.   The IIJA, or bipartisan infrastructure law, is a once-in-a-lifetime,  once-in-a-generation investment to rebuild America's crumbling  infrastructure, improve public safety and climate resilience,  accelerate the deployment of clean energy technologies, and reconnect  historically marginalized and disenfranchised communities.   Since the IIJA was passed, $4.7 billion in Federal funding is headed  to the Commonwealth of Virginia for 192 specific projects. That  includes $3.8 billion for transportation infrastructure, like our  public transit, roads, rails, ports, airports, and bridges, like the  historic Mayo Bridge in my district in Richmond; and approximately $290  million for clean water initiatives in the Commonwealth.   Thanks to IIJA, more than 345,000 households across the Commonwealth  are now receiving affordable high-speed internet.   This is just the beginning. As we continue to work to implement the  provisions from the bipartisan infrastructure law, Virginians can  expect to see billions more in Federal funding.   Thanks to the leadership of the Biden-Harris administration, we  aren't just celebrating infrastructure week, but infrastructure decade.                            ____________________
