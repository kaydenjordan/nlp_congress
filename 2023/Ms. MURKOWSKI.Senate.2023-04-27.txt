 Mr. President, I thank Senator Cardin for his  leadership on this issue, not only in this Congress but in the previous  Congresses when we have attempted to advance this very important  measure.   What we have in front of us right now is S.J. Res. 4, an amendment to  add the Equal Rights Amendment to our Constitution. It is pretty  simple. Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or  abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex. It is  as simple as that. That is it. That is the full substance of the Equal  Rights Amendment. We refer to it as the ERA.   I think most people in this country believe that it is already a part  of the Constitution, that it is already a protection under it.   Justice Scalia stated more than a decade ago now:         Certainly the Constitution does not require discrimination       on the basis of sex. The only issue is whether it prohibits       it. It doesn't.    A little bit of the history here: The ERA was first proposed back in  1923, 3 years after ratification of the 19th Amendment guaranteeing  women the right to vote, fully 100 years removed from where we are  today. Now, 50 years later, the ERA finally passed Congress, was signed  by President Carter in 1972.   There was a 7-year deadline for ratification. Thirty-five States  moved quickly, including the State of Alaska, within that deadline. It  was extended once, in 1982, to give the remaining States some more time  to consider it. But momentum waned as other things took precedent.   The ERA didn't go away, though. Nevada, Illinois, and Virginia became  the 36th, the 37th, and the 38th States to ratify it between 2017 and  2020. And so where we are today is there are 38 States that have  ratified the ERA. That meets the threshold of the three-quarters of the  States that are needed to ratify a constitutional amendment, but that  can't happen because of a technicality because the preamble of the ERA  contains an outdated deadline for ratification.    And that is where our simple resolution comes in. It removes that  arbitrary deadline to reflect what has actually happened instead of  what Congress thought was going to happen some decades ago. It would  affirm the Equal Rights Amendment has been ratified by 38 States, met  the threshold to be made part of the Constitution, and allow that to  finally occur.   Now, some have suggested that the ERA is no longer needed. We have  certainly made great strides as women since 1923, but there is a lot  more that needs to be done. Women are a majority of the U.S. population  but continue to be underrepresented in elected office, in the courts,  in the business world, and in so many other areas.   There remains, of course, a pay gap. We know of this. We hear the  statistics all the time--a pay gap between men and women: 18 cents on  the dollar according to the GAO--and that gap is wider across  industries and within certain groups, to 22 cents on the dollar for  women at private, for-profit companies and 23 cents for full-time  managers.   As the Senator from Maryland has mentioned, the ERA is also needed to  help address violence against women. Statistics from the National  Coalition Against Domestic Violence, for example, show that 1 in 7  women compared to 1 in 25 men have been injured by an intimate partner.   Again, what the Equal Rights Amendment provides: It would establish  fundamental protections against discrimination based on sex. Every one  of us should agree that such discrimination is completely unacceptable  and that every citizen, regardless of sex, should enjoy the same rights  under our Constitution, and that is all we are doing here today.   Again, equality of rights under the law should not be denied on  account of sex. It shouldn't be controversial, but just about  everything nowadays somehow is.   There has been debate about whether Congress has the authority to act  on this resolution. I believe we do. There is no constitutional  provision, there is no law, no Supreme Court decision telling us that  we can't. The Constitution contains no time limit for ratification of  amendments, and there is clear precedent for States taking years-- decades, even centuries--to do so.   The 27th congressional pay act amendment was ratified in 1992. That  was a full 203 years after it was enacted in 1789.   Another issue that has been raised is the five States that have  attempted to rescind their ratification, but the Constitution does not  contemplate rescissions, and there is clear precedent for Congress  determining that rescinding an amendment after ratification is  ineffectual. In 1868, Congress adopted a concurrent resolution  declaring that the 14th Amendment had been ratified despite the fact  that two States--New Jersey and Ohio--had attempted to rescind their  prior ratifications.   Again, the purpose of the ERA is to secure full equality for women,  and there should be no time limit on that. Men and women should be  treated equally under the law, and that is not a controversial  position; it is a widely held view. The fact of the matter is, the vast  majority of Americans support the ERA: 73 percent, according to one  poll from 2020; 78 percent according to another; and 85 percent  according to a poll from last year, including 93 percent of Democrats,  93 percent of Independents, and 79 percent of Republicans. At least  half of the States have Constitutions like Alaska that guarantee equal  rights based on sex in some way.   So I am proud, again, that our State stepped up in 1972 and, a few  months later, by an overwhelming vote, amended our constitution to  prohibit sex discrimination.   Mr. President, we are at the point where we are going to take a vote  here right now. I am not entirely pleased by the timing of our debate  on this resolution because we have not yet secured the 60 votes needed  for its passage. I don't really like it being used as a filler on the  floor, as somewhat of an exercise that runs the clock in a largely  empty legislative calendar.   I don't see how the ERA or women in this country will ultimately  benefit from that, but I am proud to lead this resolution with Senator  Cardin. I am proud to be working with him and others that, again, would  see through the hollow arguments against the Equal Rights Amendment and  would join us in passing it.   The American people are waiting for this. It is long overdue for  Congress to act.
