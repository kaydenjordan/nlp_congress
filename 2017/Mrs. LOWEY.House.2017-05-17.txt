 Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friends, Chairman Ed Royce  and Ranking Member Eliot Engel, and all those involved in advancing  this important legislation.   I rise in support of H.R. 672, the Combating European Anti-Semitism  Act, which was introduced by the co-chairs of the Bipartisan Taskforce  for Combating Anti-Semitism.   With the rising threat of anti-Semitism in Europe, this bill would  require enhanced reporting to Congress on anti-Semitic incidents in  Europe, the safety and security of European Jewish communities, and the  efforts of the United States to partner with European entities to  combat anti-Semitism. This bill also urges the Department of State to  continue encouraging European governments and multilateral institutions  to adopt a clear and comprehensive working definition of anti-Semitism.   I find it hard to believe that in the 21st century European Jews  worry about whether or not there is a future for their communities in  Europe. But with increased anti-Semitic sentiments throughout Europe  and many Jews becoming the targets of verbal, physical, and even deadly  terrorist attacks, the security and quality of life for European Jewish  communities has deteriorated. This is simply unacceptable.   Anti-Semitism is not simply a Jewish problem. Xenophobia and other  forms of racism are never far behind when this pernicious threat rears  its ugly head. The United States must remain a leader in the fight  against anti-Semitism wherever it occurs to ensure that our commitment  to ``never again'' remains a reality.   Finally, I want to express my appreciation to my fellow co-chairs of  the Bipartisan Taskforce for Combating Anti-Semitism, Representatives  Smith, Engel, Granger, Deutch, Ros-Lehtinen, Veasey, and Roskam. The  task force remains committed to working across regions, religions, and  party lines to condemn all anti-Semitism and fight for the right of  Jews to live freely without fear at home and abroad.
