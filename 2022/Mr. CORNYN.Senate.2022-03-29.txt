 Mr. President, it has been more than a month since Russia  launched an unprovoked and unwarranted attack against the people of  Ukraine. In the interim, the world has marveled at the strength, the  resiliency, and the courage of Ukrainian forces, as well as their  leadership in President Zelenskyy.   Ukraine has a real shot at defeating this Russian aggression, but  that can only happen if it has the weapons and resources it desperately  needs.   I recently traveled to Poland and Germany with a bipartisan group of  Senate colleagues to learn more about what Ukraine needs and the  challenges our NATO allies are up against.   Over the course of 3 days, we met with American military leaders and  diplomats, as well as members of the 82nd Airborne. We spoke with our  NATO partners, who are supporting both the military and humanitarian  needs of Ukraine, and we had the opportunity to talk to some of the  Ukrainian refugees themselves. The primary message we heard, consistent  message that we heard was, we need more and we need it faster--more  Stingers, more Javelins, more air defenses, more lethal aid--and they  reiterated their need for aircraft like the Poland MiGs.   Statements of support are important, but they do nothing to help  Ukrainian forces defeat this Russian aggression.   It was an incredibly powerful and enlightening experience to hear  directly from the incredible men and women on the ground, and I want to  thank our friend, Senator Ernst from Iowa, for leading this bipartisan  congressional delegation. I think it also sent a very strong message to  our friends and allies in the region that 10 Senators--one-tenth of the  United States Senate--were willing to make this trip on a bipartisan  basis. I think we all came back with a deeper understanding of  Ukraine's needs and a renewed sense of urgency to do everything in our  power to make it happen.   Over the last 4 weeks, Russia has bombed Ukrainian hospitals,  schools, apartment buildings, humanitarian refugee corridors even, and  even civilians waiting in a bread line. It is pretty clear that we need  to use every tool available to bolster Ukraine's defense and weaken the  aggression of the Russian forces. It is not a matter of one or the  other; we need to do both.   To support Ukraine, we need to answer the call for more defensive  weapons. Whether intentionally or not, the administration has given  Ukraine the bare minimum--just enough to keep it from being completely  overrun by the Russians but not enough to help it win the war. In other  words, the Biden administration is propping up Ukraine to keep taking  further hits rather than giving it the full forces it needs to win the  fight.   We need to help Ukraine vanquish Russian forces from its territory  entirely, not just to extend the length of this war. Actually, by not  giving Ukraine everything it needs in order to repulse Russian  aggression, we are playing into Putin's hands, because Putin has  clearly changed his tactics. From the initial reports of trying to  encircle Kyiv and perhaps assassinate President Zelenskyy and install a  puppet government, clearly, Putin has bitten off more than he can chew  when it comes to invading Ukraine and executing on that original  mission.   But now, he is engaged in a war of attrition, flattening Ukrainian  cities, killing innocent civilians from outside of Ukrainian airspace  because he is worried about the anti-aircraft capabilities of the  Ukrainians using things like MANPADS and Stinger missiles.   Well, time is on Putin's side, and we need to level the playing field  and actually give the Ukrainians what they need in order to stop this  war as soon as possible, before further loss of life and further damage  to their country is done.   Now, the most effective way to do this--since Ukraine is not a member  of NATO, we are not going to send troops there, as President Biden has  said, appropriately so; but we need to ensure that the Ukrainians have  everything they need in order to do the job themselves. As President  Zelenskyy has said:         Ukraine can't shoot down Russian missiles with shotguns and       machine guns.    Unfortunately, there are a lot of roadblocks standing in the way, and  unfortunately, one of those is the reluctance of the Biden  administration to quickly and expeditiously get the Ukrainians what  they need.   For example, Poland offered to transfer its entire fleet of MiG-29  fighters to the United States for delivery to Ukraine. Ukrainian forces  already know how to fly these Russian aircraft, and President Zelenskyy  assured us that they are desperately needed. But the Biden  administration rejected the offer after, first, Secretary Blinken  seemed to give it the green light. The administration changed its mind  out of fear that they might provoke Putin--once again, playing right  into his hand. All Putin has to do is rattle his saber to deter the  United States and its allies from helping Ukraine to the maximum of our  capability.   Another big obstacle that the Ukrainians are finding is the redtape  associated with anything that the Federal Government seems to do.  Ukraine has provided a detailed list of the resources it needs:  fighters, anti-aircraft missile systems, more Stingers, more Javelins.  It is not a list of items they will need next month or the next; it is  what they need right now in order to survive. The process of getting  defense articles into Ukrainian soldiers' hands includes some big  bureaucratic hurdles that not only make it harder to act quickly but  make it more difficult to send Ukraine the resources they desperately  need.   Fortunately, there is strong precedent from World War II that we  could follow to help expedite the process. During World War II, when  Britain was hanging on by a thread and the United States was a  noncombatant in that worldwide war at the time, President Roosevelt  vowed to transform the United States into the ``arsenal of democracy,''  as he called it; and he worked with Congress to pass the Lend-Lease  Act.   This legislation allowed the United States to use its industrial  might to supply Britain and our other allies with the resources they  needed at a critical time in World War II and without lengthy delays.   Borrowing inspiration from President Roosevelt, I introduced  bipartisan legislation with colleagues called the Ukraine Democracy  Defense Lend-Lease Act, which will expedite getting Ukrainian forces  the resources they need to win the fight without any unnecessary  delays.   I also think that, in addition to the actions by the administration,  I think it sends a strong bipartisan message of support from this body  and gives encouragement to our friends in Ukraine, who are fighting for  their very existence. This legislation authorizes the President to  enter lend-lease agreements directly with Ukraine and provide Ukrainian  forces with lethal weapons needed to defend their sovereignty.   But I think, rather than the piecemeal approach being used by the  administration, this would open this arsenal of democracy known as the  American industrial base to provide Ukraine what it needs and give them  the assurance that, whether they need it today or tomorrow or they need  it replenished next week, it will be there for them as long as they  need it.   I am proud to have worked with a number of colleagues on this  bipartisan bill, including Senators Cardin, Wicker, Shaheen, and many  others. So far, more than 20 Senators have cosponsored this  legislation, and I hope we can pass it without any further delay. This  is obviously an urgent crisis.   Putin thought this was going to be like the Taliban taking  Afghanistan after the United States and NATO's withdrawal. He thought  he could take Ukraine without firing a bullet--well, so much for  Putin's plans, his arrogance, and his underestimation of the  willingness of the Ukrainian people to fight for their own country.   But we need to pass this legislation and ensure Ukrainian forces that  they will have what they need when they need it. As I said, we have a  moral obligation--maybe not a treaty obligation under NATO, but I  believe we have a moral obligation to support people fighting for their  very freedom and their very lives in a democratically run country like  Ukraine.    The United States and our allies have imposed crippling sanctions on  Russian businesses, banks, and oligarchs, which  [[Page S1824]]  have sent the country's economy into a tailspin. But in typical Russian  fashion, they planned for some of these sanctions, and they have found  loopholes in the current sanction regime. It has taken a page out of  Venezuela's book by using the purchase and sale of gold to bring in  cash with which to run their economy. The Russian Federation is buying  gold to offset the devaluation of the ruble, its currency, and then  selling that gold in international markets in exchange for high-value  currency.   In short, Russia is laundering money through the gold market, and we  need to put a stop to it. I, along with other colleagues, introduced  the Stop Russian GOLD Act that would bring an end to this practice. We  talked to Secretary Yellen, and she agreed that this would be  supplemental to what the administration has already done unilaterally.   This legislation would apply sanctions to parties who help Russia  finance their war by buying or selling this blood gold. That means  anyone who buys or transports gold from Russia's central bank would be  the target of sanctions. This would be a huge deterrent to anyone  considering doing business with Russia and helping them evade  sanctions. In short, we need to take every possible step to cut the  financing for Putin's war machine, and this is one additional way to do  so. Along with the lend-lease bill I mentioned a moment ago, I hope we  can pass this legislation without further delay.   There is more we can do to support Ukraine and hit Russia where it  hurts and to raise the costs associated with its unprovoked and  unwarranted invasion of Ukraine, but it is past time to continue to  ramp up the pressure to the maximum ability that we can.   At this juncture, principled leadership and decisive action are  absolutely critical. As Leader McConnell put it, President Biden has  generally done the right thing, but never soon enough. For example,  last year, the President ignored the immense pressure to sanction the  Nord Stream 2 Pipeline. He finally, after resisting, imposed those  sanctions last month.   As Russian troops mounted on Ukraine's borders late last year, the  administration withheld millions of dollars in aid for weeks before  finally releasing it. President Biden disregarded bipartisan calls to  impose paralyzing sanctions on Russia before the invasion in order to  try to deter it. Instead, he waited until after the invasion happened  to try to impose costs on Russia. President Biden ignored calls to stop  Russian oil imports until it became clear that Congress would pass  legislation to do just that. Once the handwriting was on the wall, the  President announced an import ban to try to get ahead of congressional  action.   President Biden has been so preoccupied with how Putin might react  that Putin has been deterring the administration from acting with the  sort of expediency and dispatch that are absolutely necessary and  called for. Waiting until the court of public opinion is not the kind  of leadership that this emergency requires. Mr. President, Ukraine is  being bludgeoned by Russia every day. We need to act with all  deliberate speed to get them the additional resources they need, which  means we need to do it now so they can fight and ultimately prevail.   The United States may be an ocean away from this conflict, but  democracy itself is on the front lines. We know President Putin is  motivated by a vision of restoration of the Russian Empire, after  having called the fall of the Soviet Union one of the greatest  geopolitical tragedies in history.   So we don't know when Putin will stop or if he will stop, which gives  us the only option of doing everything we can to assist our Ukrainian  friends from stopping him themselves. We stand in solidarity with our  partners in Europe, and we are committed to supporting Ukraine as it  defends its sovereignty.   So, in the coming days--hopefully in the coming hours--I hope the  Senate will take action on these bipartisan bills and impose greater  costs on Russia in the interest of peace and Ukrainian sovereignty.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
