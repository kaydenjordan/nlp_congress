 Madam Speaker, I accept the gentlewoman from the  District of Columbia's--my dear friend--challenge.   While I congratulate the historic once-in-a-century-win of the  Nationals, let me be very clear: The Houston Astros have won the most  games of any of the Major League Baseball teams.   Let me thank the owner and management, but also the team, the  unifying team, the team that does not have one icon, one star, but all  of them are stars. Let me thank them for the great work they do in  charity throughout our community helping our young people.   Madam Speaker, might I take you down memory lane, when the Astros-- can you imagine that late-night game on Saturday night when you thought  there was not any hope and there was going to be another game with the  Astros and the Yankees?   But what happened? My friend, Altuve--what happened? You didn't even  see the ball go. He hit a home run and two came in.   I know this is going to be a great game, and the new world champions  of baseball will be the Houston Astros.   Go `Stros. Go Astros.   I accept, Madam Speaker, and if we win, she will wear this shirt with  her staff.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (H.R. 835) to impose criminal sanctions on certain persons  involved in  [[Page H8340]]  international doping fraud conspiracies, to provide restitution for  victims of such conspiracies, and to require sharing of information  with the United States Anti-Doping Agency to assist its fight against  doping, and for other purposes, as amended.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank all of my sponsors, but I particularly thank Dr.  Burgess, who I will mention again, who joined me more than a year ago  to move forward on a bill that we hope will give fairness to all the  wonderful young athletes around the world.   H.R. 835, the Rodchenkov Anti-Doping Act of 2019, would strengthen  the integrity of international sports competitions by imposing criminal  sanctions on certain persons involved in international doping fraud  conspiracies. It would also provide restitution for victims of such  conspiracies and would require coordination and sharing of information  with the United States Anti-Doping Agency to assist its fight against  doping.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record an article from The New York  Times regarding manipulated drug tests.     Russian Doping Chief Says Thousands of Drug Tests Were Manipulated                  [From the New York Times, Oct. 14, 2019]                              (By Tariq Panja)         Colorado Springs.--Russia made thousands of changes to the       drug-test results of an unspecified number of its athletes,       the head of the country's own antidoping agency said this       week, confirming the suspicions of global officials who are       considering severe penalties against Russian sports programs.        The official, Yuri Ganus, the director general of the       Russian antidoping agency, suggested in an interview at a       conference in Colorado that the data had been concealed or       altered to protect the reputations and positions of former       star athletes who now have roles in government or who       function as senior sports administrators in Russia.        His comments went farther than his previous remarks about       possible Russian manipulation of doping results, and they       could complicate the country's efforts to avoid new       punishments from global antidoping officials. Russian was       already barred from international sporting events, including       the 2018 Winter Olympics, after the discovery of a broad,       state-sponsored doping program in 2015.        In less than two weeks, a committee at the World Anti-      Doping Agency will decide whether to press for more serious       bans against Russian sports federations. Russia faces       possible expulsion from international sports--a return to the       pariah status that followed the 2015 discovery--if its       authorities  [[Page H8341]]       cannot provide an explanation for missing or manipulated test       results in a database that Russia turned over to WADA.        Russia's promise to deliver that database of thousands of       athlete records was a key factor in WADA's decision to lift a       suspension of the country's antidoping agency in late 2018.       That determination, criticized by athletes and other       antidoping officials at the time, ended a three-year       suspension that had been imposed after the discovery of one       of the most audacious and sophisticated cheating schemes in       history, a conspiracy that corrupted a number of major       international sporting events, including several Olympics.        Ganus, 55, said Sunday that he believed only individuals       with access to some of Russia's most powerful institutions       could have been able to manipulate the data, which WADA       investigators crosschecked against a separate set provided by       a whistle-blower in 2017.        ``In this case, you have to understand what has to be the       power which will receive access,'' Ganus said.        Ganus said he had spoken out to ensure that current and       future generations of Russian athletes do not suffer because       of the actions of others.        But his outspokenness has come as a surprise to some, given       the risks whistle-blowers with information related to the       case appear to face. Two other Russian antidoping officials       with ties to the scandal--including one of Ganus's       predecessors--have died under suspicious circumstances in       recent years, and Ganus said he believed the Russian       authorities were monitoring his electronic communications and       his phone calls, as well as conducting surveillance near his       home.        ``It's really dangerous for me,'' he said. But Ganus said       he was driven to complete what he described as ``the       mission'' to assure that a new generation of Russian athletes       could return, untainted, to international sports.        ``Russia is a high level sports country, but those people       who are responsible to solve this situation for many years       chose the wrong way, the wrong approach,'' he said.        There is a suspicion in sporting circles that Russia has       allowed Ganus to speak out publicly so that he can separate       the work of his agency, which has drawn praise from WADA for       changes it has made, from that of the state authorities that       control the Moscow laboratory where the athletes' data was       stored. The government still considers that lab a crime scene       under the control of state officials, not of domestic       antidoping regulators.        ``Certainly if he's speaking truth to power, maybe he's       going to defect sometime soon or it's a strategic move,''       Travis Tygart, the head of the United States Anti-Doping       Agency, said of Ganus. ``I think the real issue is: Can the       WADA system hold the national antidoping system responsible       for something that the minister's office is ultimately       responsible for?''        By lifting its ban on Russia last year before the country       had complied with two remaining provisions of its so-called       road map to reinstatement--namely, providing the athletes'       data to WADA and acknowledging that Russia's doping program       was state-controlled--WADA effectively freed the authorities       who control the lab from the need to follow the terms of that       agreement. Those officials might not fall under WADA's       jurisdiction, as the Russian antidoping agency, known as       Rusada, does.        ``When they let them out of that road map, it put a lot of       pressure on their ability under the new rules to hold       Russia's state minister's office and sport community       responsible through their authority over the national       antidoping organization,'' Tygart said. ``That's what's going       to come to a head. And let's hope it does:'        Last month, the English lawyer Jonathan Taylor, who leads       the WADA committee overseeing Russian compliance, said the       country would need to ``pull a rabbit out of the hat'' to       provide a credible explanation for anomalies in the data       extracted from the Moscow lab.        Taylor's committee will convene, probably by phone, on Oct.       23 to decide whether to recommend to WADA's executive board       that Russia be designated ``noncompliant:'' If the board       agrees, a case most likely will be fast-tracked to the       international Court of Arbitration for Sport for a final       ruling.        In the past, individual sports had the power to decide       whether to punish countries for doping offenses. But rules       adopted in April 2018 mean a negative ruling for Russia at       the arbitration court could trigger an automatic suspension       for the country across a wide range of sports and federations       bound by the WADA code. Under such a ban, Russian teams and       athletes would be ineligible to compete in international       sporting events, and the country would be barred from hosting       them, until the WADA suspension was lifted.        That could lead to Russia's missing out on next summer's       Olympics in Tokyo, and even put at risk its national soccer       team's participation in qualification matches for the 2022       World Cup in Qatar.                                   ____                   [From the New York Times, June 12, 2018]      U.S. Lawmakers Seek To Criminalize Doping in Global Competitions                            (By Rebecca R. Ruiz)         United States lawmakers took a step on Tuesday toward       criminalizing doping in international sports, introducing a       bill in the House that would attach prison time to the use,       manufacturing or distribution of performance-enhancing drugs       in global competitions.        The legislation, inspired by the Russian doping scandal,       would echo the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which makes it       illegal to bribe foreign officials to gain a business       advantage. The statute would be the first of its kind with       global reach, empowering American prosecutors to act on       doping violations abroad, and to file fraud charges of a       different variety than those the Justice Department brought       against top international soccer officials in 2015.        Although American leagues like Major League Baseball would       not be affected by the legislation, which would apply only to       competitions among countries, it could apply to a league's       athletes when they participate in global events like the       Ryder Cup, the Davis Cup or the World Baseball Classic.        The law would establish America's jurisdiction over       international sports events, even those outside of the United       States, if they include at least three other nations, with at       least four American athletes participating or two American       companies acting as sponsors. It would also enhance the       ability of cheated athletes and corporate sponsors to seek       damages, expanding the window of time during which civil       lawsuits could be filed.        To justify the United States' broader jurisdiction over       global competitions, the House bill invokes the United       States' contribution to the World Anti-Doping Agency, the       global regulator of drugs in sports. At $2.3 million, the       United States' annual contribution is the single largest of       any nation. ``Doping fraud in major international       competitions also effectively defrauds the United States:'       the bill states.        The lawmakers behind the bill were instrumental in the       creation of the 2012 Magnitsky Act, which gave the government       the right to freeze financial assets and impose visa       restrictions on Russian nationals accused of serious human       rights violations and corruption. On Tuesday, the lawmakers       framed their interest in sports fraud around international       relations and broader networks of crime that can accompany       cheating.        ``Doping fraud is a crime in which big money, state assets       and transnational criminals gain advantage and honest       athletes and companies are defrauded;' said Sheila Jackson       Lee, Democrat of Texas, who introduced the legislation on       Tuesday. ``This practice, some of it state-sanctioned, has       the ability to undermine international relations, and is       often connected to more nefarious actions by state actors?'        Along with Ms. Jackson Lee, the bill was sponsored by two       other congressional representatives, Michael C. Burgess,       Republican of Texas, and Gwen Moore, Democrat of Wisconsin.        It was put forward just as Russia prepares to host soccer's       World Cup, which starts Thursday. That sporting event will be       the nation's biggest since the 2014 Sochi Olympics, where one       of the most elaborate doping ploys in history took place.        The bill, the Rodchenkov Anti-Doping Act, takes its name       from Dr. Grigory Rodchenkov, the chemist who ran Russia's       antidoping laboratory for 10 years before he spoke out about       the state-sponsored cheating he had helped carry out--most       notoriously in Sochi. At those Games, Dr. Rodchenkov said, he       concealed widespread drug use among Russia's top Olympians by       tampering with more than 100 urine samples with the help of       Russia's Federal Security Service.        Investigations commissioned by international sports       regulators confirmed his account and concluded that Russia       had cheated across competitions and years, tainting the       performance of more than 1,000 athletes. In early 2017,       American intelligence officials concluded that Russia's       meddling in the 2016 American election had been, in part, a       form of retribution for the Olympic doping scandal, whose       disclosures Russian officials blamed on the United States.        Nations including Germany, France, Italy, Kenya and Spain       have established criminal penalties for sports doping       perpetrated within their borders. Russia, too, passed a law       in 2017 that made it a crime to assist or coerce doping,       though no known charges have been brought under that law to       date.        Under the proposed American law, criminal penalties for       offenders would include a prison term of up to five years as       well as fines that could stretch to $250,000 for individuals       and $1 million for organizations.        ``We could have real change if people think they could       actually go to jail for this,'' said Jim Walden, a lawyer for       Dr. Rodchenkov, who met with the lawmakers as they considered       the issue in recent months. ``I think it will have a       meaningful impact on coaches and athletes if they realize       they might not be able to travel outside of their country for       fear of being arrested?'        The legislation also authorizes civil actions for doping       fraud, giving athletes who may have been cheated in       competitions--as well as corporations acting as sponsors--the       right to sue in federal court to recover damages from people       who may have defrauded competitions.        Ms. Jackson Lee cited the American runner Alysia Montano,       who placed fifth in the 800 meters at the 2012 Summer       Olympics. Two Russian women who placed first and third in       that race were later disqualified for doping, elevating Ms.       Montano years later. ``She had rightfully finished third,       which would have earned her a bronze medal:' Ms. Jackson Lee       said, noting the financial benefits and sponsorships Ms.       Montano could have captured.  [[Page H8342]]         The bill would establish a window of seven years for       criminal actions and 10 years for civil lawsuits. It also       seeks to protect whistle-blowers from retaliation, making it       illegal to take ``adverse action'' against a person because       he or she has disclosed information about doping fraud.        Dr. Rodchenkov, who has lived in the United States since       fall 2015, has been criminally charged in Russia after he       publicly deconstructed the cheating he said he carried out on       orders from a state minister.        ``While he was complicit in Russia's past bad acts, Dr.       Rodchenkov regrets his past role in Russia's state-run doping       program and seeks to atone for it by aiding the effort to       clean up international sports and to curb the corruption       rampant in Russia,'' Ms. Jackson Lee said, calling Tuesday's       bill ``an important step to stemming the tide of Russian       corruption in sport and restoring confidence in international       competition.''     Mr. Speaker, I introduced this bill, as I said, with  Mr. Burgess of Texas because the widespread use of performance- enhancing substances had come to light in recent years, harming  athletes and fans alike.   Clean U.S. athletes and sports organizations that participate in  these competitions, as well as their U.S. sponsors, are denied their  due recognition and economic rewards. Young people who have worked all  of their lives for this miraculous and important time in their lives  and their fans lose when the legitimacy and integrity of the  competition they enjoy are debased.                                time  1545    In recent years, there have been numerous allegations and instances  of doping by professional and amateur athletes. The Summer and Winter  Olympic Games, in particular, have been plagued with doping scandals,  which has left an indelible stain on the reputation of those major  international sports events.   The infamous Russian doping scandal during the 2014 Sochi Winter  Olympics is one notable example of the corruption and fraud that has  damaged the integrity of sports competitions. After the Sochi games,  whistleblowers Yuliya Stepanova, a former Russian track star, and her  husband, Vitaly Stepanov, a former employee at the Russian Anti-Doping  Agency, exposed the Russian Government's vast state-sponsored doping  system, which subsequently led to further revelations by Dr. Grigory  Rodchenkov, the chemist who ran the Russian anti-doping laboratory.   Mr. Speaker, they simply could not take it anymore. Mr. Rodchenkov  became a whistleblower and exposed the dozens of Russian athletes  participating in the Sochi games, including 15 medal winners, who were  part of a state-run doping program.   In addition, Dr. Rodchenkov revealed that with the help of Russian  intelligence--I want our Members to hear that again--Russian  intelligence--the laboratory switched steroid-tainted urine of the  Russian national team with clean samples, evading positive detection.  It was an intelligence catastrophe, using that community to undermine  the healthy work and the healthy commitment and participation of  athletes all around the world.   The ineffective response from international organizations with  oversight responsibilities, such as the World Anti-Doping Agency, the  Court of Arbitration for Sport, and the International Olympic Committee  has only emboldened the Russian Government.   Although Russia has denied its involvement, evidence shows that it  operated a systematic state-sponsored doping program and cover-up  scheme.   Russia has cheated and defrauded all Olympic athletes, including its  own and the general public, and has degraded the meaning and purpose of  the games. Unfortunately, because the orchestrators of the Russian  doping scandal operated with the blessing of the Russian Government,  and because there is no legal mechanism in the United States to bring  them to justice, they all escaped punishment for their actions. But  imagine the hurt of all of these young athletes, in all of the  countries, who worked so hard all of their life.   Currently, there is no Federal statute that provides explicit,  comprehensive protection against doping conspiracies in international  sports competitions, and the actions are crying out for relief. The  Federal statutory protections that currently exist are limited, and  criminalize activities, such as conspiracies to commit wire and mail  fraud, bribery, kickbacks, and money laundering.   This legislation that we have introduced would fill that gap by  establishing appropriate criminal penalties and civil penalties for  international doping fraud. In addition to imposing criminal penalties  on the conspirators, the bill would authorize private civil actions for  doping fraud, which would give athletes and corporate sponsors the  right to sue in Federal court to recover damages from individuals who  may have defrauded competitions.   We thought it was extremely important to cover our corporate  sponsors. They willingly and enthusiastically help these young  athletes, particularly these amateur athletes who have no other sources  of income. They provide our international competition the support to  have these athletes travel and provide other necessities so that they  can compete without worry.   This bill will provide justice to clean U.S. athletes, such as  Olympic runner Alysia Montano, skeleton racer Katie Uhlaender,  bobsledder Steve Holcomb, and many other champions who pursue  excellence over glory. They have been denied medals that were  rightfully theirs and cheated out of lucrative opportunities such as  sponsorships. Most importantly, they have been deprived of the pride of  seeing their country's flag being raised on the Olympic podium, an  emotional moment that was stolen from them.   In the case of Mr. Holcomb, his bobsled team's bronze medal was  upgraded to silver in the spring of 2019 after the Russian teams were  disqualified for doping offenses during the 2014 Sochi games.  Tragically, Mr. Holcomb was not here to see it, having died in 2017.   This bill also would provide much-needed protection and support for  brave whistleblowers, such as Dr. Rodchenkov, who appeared here in the  United States before the Helsinki Commission, and the Stepanovs, who  have exposed major international doping fraud conspiracies, all at  considerable personal risk and sacrifice. They should be honored. The  exposure of this criminal activity would not have occurred without the  courage and strength of these individuals, and this legislation would  not have the very strong basis upon which it is written.   Accordingly, I support H.R. 835, and I ask my colleagues to do so.   Mr. Speaker, the proliferation of legal performance-enhancing drugs  (``PEDs'') in sports damages the integrity of competition and defrauds  individuals and corporate entities who participate in sporting  competitions, including clean U.S. athletes and U.S. corporate  sponsors.   However, due to the efforts of gallant whistleblowers, the complex  inner workings of large-scale doping schemes are public knowledge.   In 2016, Dr. Grigory Rodchenkov exposed the Russian state-sponsored  doping scandal during the 2014 Sochi Olympics, which teams were  disqualified for doping offenses during the 2014 Sochi Games.   Tragically, Mr. Holcomb was not here to see it, having died in 2017.   The Rodchenkov Act comes at a crucial time for the international  fight against doping in sports and is supported by the U.S. Helsinki  Commission.   On October 14, 2019, the New York Times reported that, as suspected,  Russia made thousands of changes to the drug-test results of an  unspecified number of its athletes, the head of the country's own  antidoping agency said this week, confirming the suspicions of global  officials who are considering severe penalties against Russian sports  programs.   The Russian doping fraud scandal shook the very foundations of the  global anti-doping system and the problem shows no signs of stopping.   The ultimate victims of doping fraud are clean athletes, who want  nothing more than to compete on a level playing field.   There are countless examples of U.S. athletes who have been defrauded  by international doping fraud conspiracies.   These athletes are deprived of Olympic glory and denied their  rightful prize money and sponsorships.   The Rodchenkov Act is fully compatible with the UNESCO Convention  Against Doping in Sport and the World Anti-Doping Code, greatly  enhances the fight against doping by creating additional legal tools to  help guard against the type of behavior discovered in the Russian  doping scandal.   By criminalizing international doping conspiracies, the Rodchenkov  Act provides law enforcement with a greater ability to investigate and  pursue, and ultimately hold accountable, doping fraud perpetrators.   In addition, this act will provide doping whistleblowers the same  protections that are given  [[Page H8343]]  to whistleblowers of other serious crimes, and are all acutely aware of  the current importance of protecting whistleblowers.   This legislation is not only vital, but it is fully consistent with  international law.   I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, we all have an interest in ensuring that our country and  our athletes are not defrauded in international sports competitions.  This bipartisan bill would fill an unfortunate gap with regard to the  U.S. law enforcement to hold accountable those who engage in such  fraud. It would also serve as a deterrent to those considering engaging  in doping fraud conspiracies, and would provide a mechanism to gain  visibility into a wider net of international corrupt practices that are  connected to doping fraud.   I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense measure.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 835, the ``Rodchenkov Anti-Doping Act of 2019,''  would strengthen the integrity of international sports competitions by  imposing criminal sanctions on certain persons involved in  international doping fraud conspiracies. It would also provide  restitution for victims of such conspiracies, and would require  coordination and sharing of information with the United States Anti- Doping Agency to assist its fight against doping.   I introduced this bill along with Mr. Burgess of Texas, because the  widespread use of performance enhancing substances has come to light in  recent years, harming athletes and fans alike. Clean U.S. athletes and  sports organizations who participate in these competitions, as well as  their U.S. sponsors, are denied their due recognition and economic  rewards. And their fans lose when the legitimacy and integrity of the  competitions they enjoy are debased.   In recent years, there have been numerous allegations and instances  of doping by professional and amateur athletes. The summer and winter  Olympic Games, in particular, have been plagued with doping scandals,  which has left an indelible stain on the reputation of these major  international sports events.   The infamous Russian doping scandal during the 2014 Sochi Winter  Olympics is one notable example of the corruption and fraud that has  damaged the integrity of sports competitions. After the Sochi Games,  whistleblowers Yuliya Stepanova, a former Russian track star, and her  husband Vitaly Stepanov, a former employee at the Russian Anti-Doping  Agency, exposed the Russian Government's vast state-sponsored doping  system, which subsequently led to further revelations by Dr. Grigory  Rodchenkov, the chemist who ran the Russian anti-doping laboratory.   Dr. Rodchenkov became a whistleblower and exposed the dozens of  Russian athletes participating in the Sochi Games, including 15 medal  winners, who were part of a state-run doping program. In addition, Dr.  Rodchenkov revealed that with the help of Russian intelligence, the  laboratory switched steroid-tainted urine of the Russian national team  with clean samples, evading positive detection.   The ineffective response from international organizations with  oversight responsibilities, such as the World Anti-Doping Agency, the  Court of Arbitration for Sport, and the International Olympic  Committee, has only emboldened the Russian Government. Although Russia  has denied its involvement, evidence shows that it operated a  systematic, state-sponsored doping program and cover-up scheme.    Russia has cheated and defrauded all the Olympic athletes, including  its own, and the general public, and has degraded the meaning and  purpose of the Games. Unfortunately, because the orchestrators of the  Russian doping scandal operated with the blessing of the Russian  government, and because there is no legal mechanism in the United  States to bring them to justice, they all escaped punishment for their  actions.   Currently, there is no federal statute that provides explicit  comprehensive protection against doping conspiracies in international  sports competitions. The federal statutory protections that currently  exist are limited, and criminalize activities such as conspiracies to  commit wire and mail fraud, bribery, kickbacks, and money laundering.   This legislation would fill that gap by establishing appropriate  criminal penalties and civil remedies for international doping fraud.  In addition to imposing criminal penalties on the conspirators, the  bill would authorize private civil actions for doping fraud, which  would give athletes and corporate sponsors the right to sue in federal  court to recover damages from individuals who may have defrauded  competitions.   This bill would provide justice to clean U.S. athletes, such as  Olympic runner Alysia Montario, skeleton racer Katie Uhlaender,  bobsledder Steve Holcomb, and many other champions who pursue  excellence over glory. They have been denied medals that were  rightfully theirs and cheated out of lucrative opportunities, such as  sponsorships. Most importantly, they have been deprived of the pride of  seeing their country's flag being raised on the Olympic podium an  emotional moment that was stolen from them.   In the case of Mr. Holcomb, his bobsled team's bronze medals were  upgraded to silver in the spring of 2019, after the Russian teams were  disqualified for doping offenses during the 2014 Sochi Games.  Tragically, Mr. Holcomb was not here to see it, having died in 2017.   This bill also would also provide much-needed protection and support  for brave whistleblowers, such as Dr. Rodchenkov and the Stepanovas,  who have exposed major international doping fraud conspiracies at  considerable personal risk and sacrifice. The exposure of this criminal  activity would not have occurred without the courage and strength of  these individuals.   Accordingly, I support H.R. 835.   Mr. Speaker, we all have an interest in ensuring that our country and  our athletes are not defrauded in international sports competitions.  This bipartisan bill would fill an unfortunate gap with regard to the  U.S. law enforcement to hold accountable those who engage in such  fraud. It would also serve as a deterrent to those considering engaging  in doping fraud conspiracies, and would provide a mechanism to gain  visibility into a wider net of international corrupt practices that are  connected to doping fraud.   I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense measure.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                          House of Representatives,                                      Committee on the Judiciary,                                   Washington, DC, October 18, 2019.      Hon. Frank Pallone, Jr.,      Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Pallone: I am writing to you concerning H.R.       835, the ``Rodchenkov Anti-Doping Act of 2019.''        I appreciate your willingness to work cooperatively on this       legislation. I recognize that the bill contains provisions       that fall within the jurisdiction of the Committee on Energy       and Commerce. I acknowledge that your Committee will not       formally consider H.R. 835 and agree that the inaction of       your Committee with respect to the bill does not waive any       future jurisdictional claim over the matters contained in       H.R. 835 which fall within your Committee's Rule X       jurisdiction.        I will ensure that our exchange of letters is included in       the Congressional Record during floor consideration of the       bill. I appreciate your cooperation regarding this       legislation and look forward to continuing to work with you       as this measure moves through the legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                    Jerrold Nadler,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                Committee on Energy and Commerce,                                   Washington, DC, October 18, 2019.      Hon. Jerrold Nadler,      Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Nadler: I am writing to you concerning H.R.       835, the ``Rodchenkov Anti-Doping Act of 2019,'' which was       additionally referred to the Committee on Energy and       Commerce. Certain provisions in the bill fall within the       jurisdiction of the Committee on Energy and Commerce. In the       interest of permitting your committee to proceed       expeditiously to floor consideration of this important bill,       the Committee on Energy and Commerce agrees to waive formal       consideration of the bill.        The Committee takes this action with the mutual       understanding that it is not waiving any jurisdictional claim       over this or similar legislation, and that the Committee will       be appropriately consulted and involved as this bill or       similar legislation moves forward so that we may address any       remaining issues within our jurisdiction. I further request       that you support my request to name members of the Committee       on Energy and Commerce to any conference committee to       consider such provisions.        Finally, I would appreciate a response to this letter       confirming this understanding and your inclusion of that       response into the Congressional Record during floor       consideration of H.R. 835.            Sincerely,                                                 Frank Pallone, Jr,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                      Committee on the Judiciary,                                   Washington, DC, October 18, 2019.      Hon. Frank Pallone, Jr.,      Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Pallone: I am writing to acknowledge your       letter dated October 18, 2019 responding to our request to       your Committee that it waive any jurisdictional claims over       the matters contained in H.R. 835, the ``Rodchenkow Anti-      Doping Act of 2019,'' that fall within your Committee's Rule       X jurisdiction. The Committee on the Judiciary confirms our       mutual understanding that your Committee does not waive any       jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in this or       similar legislation,  [[Page H8344]]       and your Committee will be appropriately consulted and       involved as the bill or similar legislation moves forward so       that we may address any remaining issues within your       Committee's jurisdiction.        I will ensure that this exchange of letters is included in       the Congressional Record during floor consideration of the       bill. I appreciate your cooperation regarding this       legislation and look forward to continuing to work with you       as this measure moves through the legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                    Jerrold Nadler,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I  continue to reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Virginia for  his kind remarks and support. And I thank Dr. Burgess, as well, for his  involvement and commitment to this  [[Page H8345]]  legislation. I also thank the chairman and ranking member of the  Judiciary Committee for really helping us move this bill very quickly.  I thank the staffs of both the majority and the minority who have  worked so very hard on moving this bill forward. And I acknowledge, in  particular, the staff on the Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, and  Homeland Security for their particular help and leadership on this.                                time  1600    Mr. Speaker, I am glad that we are talking about healthy sports and  the recognition and the acceptance, if you will, of those who worked so  long and so hard, many from their earlier years, to be Olympians, to  play baseball, basketball, football, track, and the many sports that  come under the Olympic mandate.   This bill, in particular, I wish to remind our colleagues, again,  provides relief, but we really hope it is a deterrent and works to move  other nations, the European Union, to be able to establish these kinds  of responses to doping.   This act establishes criminal penalties for participating in a scheme  in commerce to influence a major international sports competition  through prohibitive substances or methods. It also provides restitution  to victims of such conspiracy, athletes in particular, many of whom  have suffered great losses because of this fraud.   It protects whistleblowers from retaliation by criminalizing  participation in international doping fraud conspiracies.  Whistleblowers will be included under existing witness protection laws.   It establishes coordination and sharing information with the U.S.  Anti-Doping Agency to establish a matrix, if you will, a format.   I want to say that we all have an interest in ensuring our country  and our athletes are not defrauded in international sports  competitions. This bipartisan bill would fill an unfortunate gap with  regard to U.S. law enforcement to hold accountable those who engage in  such fraud.   It would also serve as a deterrent to those considering engaging in  doping-fraud conspiracies and would provide a mechanism to gain  visibility in a wider net of international corrupt practices that are  connected to doping fraud.   I leave my colleagues with the very visual that so many of us, if we  were not able to be at the Olympics, watched as our athletes were able  to stand under our flag, the emotion of that moment, the emotion of the  athletes, the emotion of those watching, the excitement of standing in  honor of your Nation and representing your Nation. Anyone who has  talked to an Olympian knows that that is one of their greatest honors.  Let's give them that honor fair and square, if you will.   Since we believe in fairness and squareness in all of our athletic  endeavors here in the United States, I certainly will end, as my friend  commented here on the floor, I will end with the healthiness and the  upstanding of the World Series and those who will play in it.   I will take the opportunity at this time to say: Go Astros.   I urge my colleagues to support the underlying, commonsense measure,  and I yield back the balance of my time.
