 Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentlewoman from the  District of Columbia's leadership throughout the years on many of these  issues.   Mr. Speaker, confirmation of Judge Gorsuch to the Supreme Court would  be detrimental to the interests of working Americans, particularly  African-Americans and other vulnerable communities.   Just as President Trump's agenda prioritizes special interests, Judge  Gorsuch's record shows that he favors powerful interests and businesses  over regular people. His hostility to class action lawsuits would  threaten protections for workers, especially African-Americans and  other minorities.   What is particularly of concern to me is Gorsuch's opinion in what is  known as the ``frozen trucker'' case. Gorsuch ruled against an African- American truck driver who, after breaking down in freezing weather,  ignored his supervisor by unhitching the broken trailer from his truck  and driving away in search of assistance.   In freezing cold weather, the truck driver is nearly freezing to  death. He has a truck that won't work with frozen brakes. They are  telling him to move--to use the truck and drive away. If he takes his  truck with frozen brakes, the harm potentially to other citizens is  great. An 18-wheeler truck with no brakes, that doesn't seem logical.   Gorsuch believed that the employee should have followed the orders,  even though the driver's life was at risk. Gorsuch was the sole vote  against the driver, who was put in the position of having to choose  between freezing to death, driving an unsafe vehicle and endangering  the lives of others, or unhitching his trailer and seeking help.                                time  2000    Judge Gorsuch's record is also troubling when it comes to issues  around police accountability. Gorsuch believes in granting police  qualified immunity, which protects law enforcement from being held  liable for any excessive use of force. Now, this is deeply concerning  given the widespread use of excessive force against African Americans  by police and the increasing number of police shooting deaths of  unarmed African Americans.   This is particularly concerning to me. I come from Newark, New  Jersey, and the police department is being overseen by a Federal  monitor following a 2014 review that determined officers repeatedly  violated citizens' civil rights.   Additionally, Gorsuch's record on civil rights is deeply troubling.  The National Bar Association, our Nation's oldest and largest national  association of predominantly African-American lawyers and judges, notes  that Gorsuch has shown a strong tendency to be biased in favor of  powerful corporate interests and unapologetically biased against  workers and victims of civil and human rights violations.   The confirmation of Gorsuch would threaten the protections and the  rights of African Americans. Gorsuch is in lockstep with the President,  favoring the wealthy over ordinary Americans. This is why I oppose his  confirmation.   Even those who disagree that Gorsuch would bring a biased view to the  Court should see the necessity in delaying consideration of Gorsuch,  given the ongoing controversy over the Trump-Russia connection. It is  inappropriate to rush forward with a lifetime appointment made by a  President who is under investigation by the FBI and trapped in scandal.  The Senate should delay consideration of Gorsuch until an independent  commission investigates Russia's election interference and any ties  between Trump and Russia.   Let me just say that Judge Gorsuch has put on a very good show in  front of the Senate, seeming to be very confident and thoughtful, but  never really answering a lot of the questions that were asked of him.   We feel that this jurist should not sit on the highest court in the  land because of the bias that he has shown against working people and  regular citizens in this country. Justice is supposed to be blind, but  it seems that this jurist has a bias against the American working class  person, the normal Joe, the minority looking for an equal break, and to  have him sit on the highest court in the land would be a grave, grave  mistake.
