 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, it seems like light years ago, but it  was July 9 when President Trump nominated Brett Kavanaugh to be the  next Justice on the Supreme Court of the United States. I want to recap  to refresh everybody's memory of what has happened since July 9 and  explain briefly why I will be voting for Judge Kavanaugh to be the next  Associate Justice on the Supreme Court.   Most importantly, I want to make one point emphatically clear. The  Senate should not be intimidated under the circus-like atmosphere that  has unfortunately surrounded this entire confirmation process. We  should not be intimidated, and we should not be complicit in the  orchestrated attempt to assassinate one man's character and destroy his  career and to further delay this confirmation vote.   When Judge Kavanaugh was nominated, it quickly became clear that we  were dealing with somebody who was well qualified and well respected.  He served for 12 years on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals. He was well  known for his expertise and his talent and his experience. Former  colleagues and judges said that. Lawyers who argued before him at the  DC Circuit Court said that. His former law clerks said that. Legal  scholars, including those who did not share his views on the law, said  that as well.   What happened? I think opponents of this nomination knew they  couldn't beat his nomination the old-fashioned way--on the merits--so  they decided to throw in the kitchen sink. First came the trash  talking. There are claims that supporters of Judge Kavanaugh's  nomination would somehow be complicit with evil. That was a U.S.  Senator who said that. Another said his confirmation could spell the  destruction of the Constitution itself.   These are apocalyptic words and rhetoric. Most Americans can spot  wild untruths and petty shaming when they see it. So that didn't work  very well. Opponents had to move on to round 2.   They then argued that Judge Kavanaugh could not be fair and impartial  on the bench because of his views on executive power or because of his  experience in working on the terrorist detention policy following the  attacks that devastated this country on September 11, 2001, when he  worked at the White House. Thankfully, the fact checkers did their due  diligence and spotted errors with each of these arguments. So opponents  of the nomination moved on.   Next came the great paper chase--the insistence that more and more  documents needed to be produced, including those that had traditionally  been held back because of executive privilege, because these were not  documents that Brett Kavanaugh owned. These were documents held by  either the National Archives or the George W. Bush Library. Yet it is  important to note that more documents about Judge Kavanaugh were  produced for him than for all of the other past Supreme Court Justices  combined--more paper on Judge Kavanaugh than all of the other Supreme  Court Justices combined. Once again, that argument eventually ran out  of gas.   Fourth, came the normally scheduled confirmation hearings, which  Judge Kavanaugh sailed through with flying colors. Opponents couldn't  lay a finger on him, but that is when things began to take a darker  turn. I am talking about the accusations that our Democratic colleagues  sat on for a month before seeing them leaked into the press, contrary  to Dr. Ford's wishes and against her consent. These allegations, of  course, regarded alleged high school misconduct on the part of Judge  Kavanaugh, but the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee didn't  share that with the FBI for 6 weeks or more and didn't share it with  bipartisan Senate Judiciary Committee investigators, who were  responsible for supplementing the investigation of the FBI and the  background investigation. The ranking member didn't share it with the  committee itself during a closed-door session during which sensitive  material would not be made public and where Dr. Ford's identity,  consistent with her request, could have remained confidential, as well,  while that allegation was investigated. Of course, Judge Kavanaugh  himself was never told of the allegation until sometime after his  initial hearing.    Now, that includes when our friend and colleague, the senior Senator  from California, met one-on-one with Brett Kavanaugh. Don't you think,  if somebody had a question about an allegation being made against the  nominee, that would be the perfect time to confront the nominee and  say: I have this allegation. What do you have to say about it? But she  said nothing.   By that point, we know she had already spoken to Dr. Ford. We know  she had already recommended partisan lawyers to represent her. We knew  there had been arrangements by her lawyers to conduct a polygraph  examination. This is all during the time when the senior Senator from  California had assured Dr. Ford that her name would be kept out of the  press and out of the public limelight.   Once she was sent to these partisan lawyers, they were preparing for  battle. They got a polygraph examination, plans were being made and  hatched, but the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, who sat on  these allegations for 6 weeks, said nothing, including hiding the  allegations from the very man whose name in the next few days would be  tarnished when the full fury of our Democratic colleagues' wrath was  unleashed.   These accusations are very serious. They are crimes. Judge Kavanaugh  has been accused of multiple crimes.   I have said earlier that I wanted Dr. Ford to be treated the same way  my own daughters or my wife or my mother would be treated in similar  circumstances. That is the sort of respect  [[Page S6511]]  we owe any person making a serious allegation like this, but while we  were doing everything we could to treat Dr. Ford with the dignity and  respect she deserves, our Democratic colleagues did her a huge  disservice, not only to her but any other woman across the country who  believes they have been a victim of a sexual assault. I say that  because of the way they handled Dr. Ford's accusations and hid them  along the way.   We know Dr. Ford requested confidentiality, but our Democratic  colleagues deprived her of that against her will. Her letter alleging  misconduct on the part of Judge Kavanaugh was leaked to the press along  the way, which is the way this sort of character assassination begins-- anonymous reports to the press.   We know Dr. Ford is struggling to come to grips with difficult  moments in her past, but eventually she summoned the courage to share  her story. What she didn't fully appreciate is, she was simultaneously  being used and deployed as a political weapon, a last-minute timebomb  that was designed to destroy one man's reputation and blow up the  confirmation process once and for all.   I would say to our colleagues across the aisle who claim to be acting  in Dr. Ford's best interest: It sure doesn't look like it to me. We did  everything we could, under the awful circumstances presented to us by  our Democratic colleagues, to show respect for Dr. Ford and to  accommodate her wishes for safety and privacy. The Judiciary Committee  wanted to do what was best for her when it offered a bipartisan team of  investigators to go to California and give her an opportunity to tell  her story to them out of the limelight, with the TV cameras off,  respectfully and privately.   One of the suspicious circumstances surrounding this whole event, the  very lawyers the ranking member sent her to, these partisan lawyers,  apparently didn't even tell Dr. Ford this option was available to her.  That is what Dr. Ford said at the hearing.   We also brought in an experienced sexual assault investigator and  lawyer from Arizona to help us elicit the facts of her claim.  Throughout the hearing, we listened and tried to learn from what Dr.  Ford was telling us. We took Dr. Ford's statements seriously.   Then it was Judge Kavanaugh's turn. Some of our colleagues now feign  concern about Judge Kavanaugh's judicial temperament because of the way  he forcefully defended himself at the hearing where he had been accused  of multiple crimes and accused of lying under oath.   We know what Judge Kavanaugh's temperament is like on the bench  because he spent 12 years on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals. That is  why the American Bar Association gave him their very highest rating,  not only for his experience but for his temperament as well. They  interviewed hundreds of lawyers and people who had knowledge of Judge  Kavanaugh's expertise and his temperament, and they all said it was  deserving of the highest rating the American Bar Association could  give.   I wonder how any of us would feel if we were accused of a crime we  didn't commit and were forced into the public limelight to defend our  good name and our honor and our reputation and to protect our family  against the threats that were being made against them. I would be  angry. I would do everything possible to push back against the false  accusations, and that is what Judge Kavanaugh did. Along the way, he  again offered his denial of any of the allegations of Dr. Ford under  penalty of felony.   So the question is, How do we decide? Because we are going to be  voting starting tomorrow on this nomination. Isn't it somebody's word  against another's? Don't we either have to believe everything that one  says or another? Do we know whom to trust, whose word to accept, when  allegations are made about something that allegedly happened 35 years  ago with gaps in the story, inconsistencies?   Well, I think the first thing we have to do is put these questions  into the proper context, but here is the bottom line: This is not a  case of he said, she said. It is a case of she said, they said. In  other words, the allegations made by Dr. Ford are not confirmed or  corroborated by any of the other people she said were present that day.  One of those people she said was present was Leland Keyser, a female  friend, one of her closest friends, who said not only does she not  remember being involved in anything like this, she said she never even  met Brett Kavanaugh.   This is not about believing women or believing men. That is a false  choice. It is not about having to choose between a man and a woman when  it comes to allegations of sexual assault. It is not about being for  the #MeToo movement or against it because who, after all, could be  against it--women coming forward and telling their story when they  believe they have been assaulted.   No, what this is about is looking at the specific relevant evidence  in this case in the proper framework. That evidence goes well beyond  the impassioned and unequivocal denial by Judge Kavanaugh.   In this case, as I said, there were three eyewitnesses Dr. Ford said  could confirm her story, and all of them directly refuted her story.   What is more, nothing like this ever came up in the context of six  previous FBI background investigations conducted by the FBI during  Judge Kavanaugh's long and very public career.   We have been told the FBI, during the course of these now seven  background investigations, including the supplemental background  investigation, has talked to 150 witnesses about Judge Kavanaugh. Don't  you think somebody, somewhere, sometime would corroborate what Dr. Ford  said if there were such a person?   We know these claims conflict with the accounts of many women who  said they have known this nominee to behave honorably not only in high  school and college toward them but the countless other women who have  known and interacted with Judge Kavanaugh since. It just seems simply  out of character for the Brett Kavanaugh we have come to know as a  result of these hearings and these investigations.   Finally, the timing of these allegations seem awfully calculated and  unusual, even politically motivated, and compound that with the fact  that our Democratic colleagues chose not to act on the opportunity to  investigate them either through the Judiciary Committee staff or the  FBI when it was much more appropriate to do so.   Well, those are the facts I believe we should consider, and that is  the evidence that suggested Judge Kavanaugh is telling the truth.   The counterarguments offered by our Democratic colleagues are not  compelling, and I think deep down they realize it. That is why they  keep changing their position, moving the goalpost, as you have heard.  That is why they have finally resorted to talking about alleged ice- throwing incidents in college. Man, that is disqualifying, they say,  apparently, or let's look at his high school yearbook. I would  stipulate that teenage boys--well, I was one once. We are not that  smart when we are teenage boys, and the dumb things that people say and  do, I think, as the judge said, are cringeworthy sometimes.   Then we have seen conspiracy theories spun up involving his calendar  from 1982. Now, I admit it is a little odd, I think, for anybody to  have kept a daily calendar and still have it at age 53, but Judge  Kavanaugh said that is what his dad did, and it was a combination  calendar and diary. So it tells us some of what he was doing at the  time we are concerned with.   I would suggest this whole enterprise has gotten so far afield from a  search for the truth and become just a relentless, unhinged attempt to  defeat the nomination, and in the process, chew up and spit out the  reputation of a good man.   We know this play has been telegraphed. Our friends across the aisle  made known their opposition would be equal parts merciless and  relentless months ago when the minority leader said he was going to  oppose Judge Kavanaugh's nomination with everything he has--everything.   Well, apparently ``everything'' includes last-minute, uncorroborated  accusations made almost 40 years ago. ``Everything'' involves refusing  to participate in the normal committee process, walking out of  hearings, breaking the rules. It involves making loud, baiting  statements designed to incite people. It includes seeing some of our  colleagues get hangers sent to their offices, chasing Senators and  their  [[Page S6512]]  spouses from restaurants or through airports, not to mention delays and  obstructions at every step along the way.   Here is what I really think needs to be understood: Our colleagues  across the aisle claim to be looking out for the victim. They claim to  be on the side of empathy, but there is nothing empathetic about the  cruelty they have shown Judge Kavanaugh, his wife, and their children.  There is nothing empathetic about presuming that somebody is guilty  without evidence, and there is nothing consistent about our colleagues  who forget many of their standard refrains about our criminal justice  system convicting too many people when the evidence is thin.   Some commentators have called this our Atticus Finch moment,  recalling the famous novel ``To Kill a Mockingbird'' by Harper Lee. We  all remember that Atticus Finch was a lawyer who did not believe that a  mere accusation was synonymous with guilt. He represented an unpopular  person who many people presumed was guilty of a heinous crime because  of his race and his race alone. We could learn from Atticus Finch now,  during this time when there has been such a vicious and unrelenting  attack on the integrity and good name of this nominee.   What I find the most distressing is that our colleagues who have  engaged in this relentless and vicious attack express no remorse over  violating Dr. Ford's wishes regarding confidentiality. They make no act  of contrition about thrusting her into the spotlight and using her for  partisan purposes or for recommending partisan lawyers to shepherd her  along and withholding information from the Judiciary Committee and the  FBI for weeks on end.   I have spent much of my career in elected office fighting to make  sure that victims of sexual assault and domestic violence and human  trafficking are never ignored, but at the same time, I will never  apologize for 1 second for believing in the constitutional presumption  of innocence and due process of law--one of the bedrock principles of  our justice system, and that is because those principles are grounded  in basic fairness and fair play. The spirit of that principle and the  concept of due process applies to Judge Kavanaugh just as much as it  does to any defendant taking a stand in any courtroom across this  country. He has, in fact, been accused of a crime--multiple crimes.   I believe we will remember last week's hearings for years to come,  and I am sure history will ultimately judge all of us, but in the  meantime, we need to act. We have had more than enough time to evaluate  this nominee. The Senate must do its job, and we will not be  intimidated. This is about the principles we stand up for and defend-- yes, sometimes even when it is unpopular.   This vote that we will have beginning tomorrow is about upholding  long-established constitutional principles and creating the right  precedent, not establishing the wrong one. Can you imagine, if this  orchestrated smear campaign and relentless effort to destroy this  nominee is successful, what kind of precedent that would set in the  future? Woe be to all of us and shame on all of us if we allow that to  happen.   This vote is about validating years of public service and decades of  honorable conduct. It is not about forgetting everything that a person  has done, all that he is, and all that he has worked for at the drop of  a hat based on unproven allegations. It is not about shifting with the  turbulent political whims. It is about what is just, and not just what  is popular in some circles.   The FBI has submitted its supplemental background investigation.  Democrats and Republicans are in the process of being briefed on that.  Having been briefed, I can tell you this: Nothing new. No witness can  confirm any allegation against Judge Kavanaugh. As I said, Judge  Kavanaugh has been investigated seven times now by the FBI through  background investigations where they have talked to 150 witnesses.   It is time to vote. I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting  Judge Kavanaugh's nomination starting with the cloture motion we will  vote on tomorrow morning.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.
