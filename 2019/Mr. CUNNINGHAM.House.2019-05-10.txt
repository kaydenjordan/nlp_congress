 Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, my bipartisan amendment will allow the  Air Force to repair and rebuild bases that were badly damaged by recent  natural disasters and will restore funding for critical projects aboard  the Nuclear Power Training Unit at Joint Base Charleston.   Without the additional $270 million my amendment provides, the Air  Force has stated that they will need to divert funding from projects  across the country to rebuild Tyndall and Offutt Air Force Bases.   This would have disastrous effects on the readiness of our armed  forces and on our national security.  [[Page H3704]]    The operational success of our Navy is dependent on highly trained  crews. The NPTU uses real nuclear power plants aboard retired  submarines to train sailors to operate and maintain our nuclear power  fleet.   And starting this month, the Lowcountry will be the only place in the  Nation where sailors can learn these highly technical skills, which are  fundamental to our Navy's ability to maintain its worldwide presence  and ensure the security of the global commons.   That is why it is urgent that we pass this amendment and ensure the  NPTU has the resources to modernize and repair its training facilities  and ensure that the pipeline of newly trained nuclear operators is not  disrupted.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Dunn).    Madam Chair, I thank my colleagues Mr. Dunn, Mr.  Fortenberry, and Mr. Bacon for their commitment, and for joining me in  offering this bipartisan amendment. I also thank the men and women of  our Armed Forces.   I urge all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote in favor  of this bipartisan commonsense amendment.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate Academic  Magnet High School in North Charleston, which was just ranked the  number one high school in the country by U.S. News & World Report.   Academic Magnet students embody hard work and determination in the  classroom, along with the passionate teachers and administrators who  work tirelessly to help students achieve their goals and dreams.  Scholarship, honor, and character are the principles that guide  students and faculty at Academic.   Academic Magnet has a graduation rate of 100 percent, a college  readiness score of 100, and is nationally ranked as one of the top STEM  high schools in the country. This educational achievement should not go  unrecognized.   I know, personally, the quality of students that they produce by the  legislative assistant we have, Paniz Rezaeerod, and I am honored to  recognize them today. I am proud of this institution for representing  Lowcountry excellence in South Carolina's school system.                            ____________________
