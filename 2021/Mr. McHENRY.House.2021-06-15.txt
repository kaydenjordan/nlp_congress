 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3642, a bill that awards a  Congressional Gold Medal to the 369th Infantry Regiment commonly known  as the Harlem Hellfighters. This gold medal is in recognition of their  bravery and outstanding service during World War I.   I would like to thank Congressman Suozzi and the numerous original  cosponsors for getting this important bill to the floor today.   I have heard from constituents who had family members and I have  heard from folks from around the country about the importance of our  recognizing this heroic group of--at that point--men. The 369th  Infantry Regiment nicknamed the Harlem Hellfighters were the first  African-American infantry unit to fight in World War I. They were also  one of the most decorated.   This is extraordinary. They became one of the most feared units  fighting for the Allies in World War I, and they were notorious for  never yielding ground to their enemies. This is extraordinary.   Their name, Harlem Hellfighters, which was given to them by the  Germans, is reflective of that reputation. That was a hard-won  reputation that they had, and that name is synonymous with the fear  that produced in our enemies. They fearlessly spent 191 consecutive  days on the front lines, which was more time in combat than any other  American unit during the Great War--during World War I.   Additionally, I would be remiss if I did not point out that at least  249 North Carolina-born African-American men served in this prestigious  unit. These brave sons of Carolina fought valiantly just west of the  Argonne Forest in defense of an outpost against a German raiding party.  During this conflict, four North Carolinian Hellfighters were wounded,  including Sergeant Henry Johnson, a native of Winston-Salem that I have  the honor to represent.   Not only were these men fierce fighters, they were also instrumental  in influencing art and culture, including introducing jazz to Europe,  and for that the Europeans should be grateful. Their leader, James  Reese Europe, directed their regimental band to international acclaim.   Madam Speaker, the Harlem Hellfighters of World War I deserve a  Congressional Gold Medal as the highest recognition of national  appreciation. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. I am grateful  for the bipartisan nature of this bill and also bringing attention to  the valiant soldiers who protected us during the Great War, especially  this very special decorated unit of intense fighters but fantastic  humans.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, may I inquire if there are additional  speakers? I am prepared to close.    Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I yield  myself the balance of my time.   There is an extraordinary story to tell about the American Armed  Forces. There is an extraordinary story to tell about African Americans  in our Armed Forces in the United States.   The Harlem Hellfighters were representative of a really amazing  achievement during the war to end all wars, World War I. But there are  also stories before this. That was not the first group of African  Americans to fight to defend our Nation.   It was not the Civil War where African Americans fought for our  Nation for the first time. It was not. It was actually our liberation  from Great Britain. It was George Washington's army that had African  Americans serving alongside other Americans to liberate us from Great  Britain.   Our founding of this Nation is one of a multiracial, multiethnic,  multilingual, amazing group of folks who wanted the same things, which  is freedom to make decisions for themselves and for their families. And  it was that first integrated army, which was George Washington's army,  the Continental Army, that begat the African Americans who served  alongside other Americans in the Civil War.   And, sadly, that established capacity was lost for two generations  before the Great War, and the Harlem Hellfighters showed the American  people that African Americans can fight just as well as any other  American, and, in fact, do better in unmitigated harsh treatment on the  front lines of the biggest war that anyone thought they would ever see  in their lifetimes; which then said, during World War II, actually, we  are all in this together; which then changed the whole face of the 20th  century.   So what the Harlem Hellfighters represent to us in this debate is not  just the good work of the Congressional delegation from New York, or  Congressman Suozzi in bringing this to the floor today, but giving us  the opportunity to highlight what this generation of men showed to the  American people and to our allies in Europe about who we are as  Americans.   So for us to honor the Harlem Hellfighters today has given us the  opportunity to recognize 100 years of progress. Not even progress, not  fulfillment of every dream that we have as Americans, not perfect, not  perfect, but a whole hell of a lot better than we were 100 years ago  when these Harlem Hellfighters showed the world not just what America  is about, but specifically what African Americans were about and their  capacity. Not just capacity to fight, but to be smart, to be capable,  to deliver results, to be the best, the best.   So the last hundred years, you can go back to that generation of  Harlem Hellfighters and you can see what they brought to the public and  the understanding that they brought over the last hundred years, and it  made us better.   So for us to have this opportunity to recognize them also lets us  recognize ourselves as a country and who we are, and to actually say,  you know, it is pretty amazing. We have an amazing country. And these  men who fought and died--many who died--they loved their country. They  love their country and they are willing to not just support it with  words like I am right now, but with their lives.   So, with a grateful heart, I say thank you to Congressman Suozzi and  his constituents for bringing this debate to the floor.   I want to thank my colleagues for doing this in a very wide,  bipartisan way, and giving us the opportunity to have a broader look at  history and the greatness of the last century and the improvement that  we have as a result of what they broke through over 100 years ago in  the Argonne Forest.   Madam Speaker, I urge adoption of this bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2332, and I  yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, debt bondage is a terrible crime, and many victims  find themselves trapped in a perpetual cycle of forced labor and  coerced debt because of it.   Earlier this year, the House Financial Services Committee held a  hearing where we focused on the financing of human trafficking. This is  an area of bipartisan cooperation on the House Financial Services  Committee. I want to commend my Democrat colleagues for leading this  discussion and finding time on the committee docket for us to continue  the conversation we have had over the last couple of Congresses.   In that hearing, we heard from many powerful witnesses, including  Rev. Dr. Marian Hatcher, who is a trafficking survivor. Rev. Dr.  Hatcher had the courage to tell us her story, and because of it, we now  have legislation that will help others.   This is the way Congress is supposed to work. We are supposed to  listen to experts and get ideas out of that on how we can construct  legislation. Because of Dr. Hatcher, we know a lot more.  [[Page H2786]]    Dr. Hatcher, like so many others in this country and around the  globe, but in this country, in particular, fell victim to human  traffickers. Thankfully, she was able to escape a terrible situation  and restore her life.   However, she struggled to reestablish herself because of a credit  score, which was negatively affecting her whole financial life. She was  affected by loans in particular that she was forced to obtain on behalf  of her traffickers.   So not only does she have to go through the emotional and social  struggles, but she has this that is a weight around her. This is  something where we can legislate and make her life and make the lives  of trafficking survivors like hers better.   You see, Madam Speaker, this is where traffickers trap a victim into  a debt cycle. Traffickers will take out loans, open businesses, and  destroy a victim's credit, which forces them to remain a victim until  they pay off the debt.   Now, you think this happens in other places around the globe. You  think that this is some other country. No, it is here. It is here in  our midst, and they are doing it through what seems like legal means.   Too often, these victims are never able to get out. This is something  that we have to be aware of and focus on.   That is where this bill, the Debt Bondage Repair Act, comes in. This  simple, 4-page bill has the potential to help thousands of victims  every year by ensuring that a consumer reporting agency may not furnish  a credit report with adverse information from a severe form of  trafficking.   While this does not erase the terrible crimes committed against them,  it will help victims to regain their financial freedom and begin to  rebuild their lives.   I would like to note that this bill has a very tailored rulemaking  provision.   We want to fix this problem. We provide the CFPB a window of 180 days  for rulemaking. This should be sufficient time to hear from all the  stakeholders. But it is my hope that they will complete this rulemaking  quickly so that the victims can get relief as soon as possible.   I would like to thank the many victim advocates and consumer data  industry representatives who provided technical assistance to get this  bill where it is.   I would say the difficulty of legislating is that you have to take in  folks who are on opposite sides of an issue. Not that they don't care  about the same issue, but you have folks that are on one side of a  business and those advocates that see things differently. It takes time  to bring them together to see what is a workable solution, maybe not a  perfect solution, but a workable solution.   I include in the Record statements of support from Shared Hope  International, the National Center on Sexual Exploitation, Rev. Dr.  Hatcher herself, and the Consumer Data Industry Association.                                       Sharedhope International,                                                      June 11, 2021.      Letter of Support for the Debt Bondage Repair Act.         Dear Ranking Member McHenry and Congressmembers Wagner,       Gonzalez, Taylor, and Hill: Traffickers financially benefit       from exploiting human trafficking victims through forced       labor and commercial sex, but also by exploiting their       victims' credit history. With credit cards, loan       applications, and access to financial services all dependent       on an individual's credit history, the impact of this       financial exploitation is both far reaching and long-term.        We thank you for taking an important step in addressing       these harms by introducing and sponsoring HR 2332, the Debt       Bondage Repair Act (DBRA). The DBRA supports trafficking       survivors by preventing consumer reporting agencies from       issuing credit reports containing adverse information that       resulted from a survivor's victimization. This legislation is       essential to address the long-term impact of human       trafficking by eliminating adverse credit history that would       otherwise remain on a survivor's credit report. Most       importantly, the DBRA provides survivors an opportunity for       financial independence and stability that can help end the       cycle of exploitation.        Good credit history is essential for opening bank accounts,       and applying for loans, credit cards, insurance, and housing.       Credit reports are also sometimes necessary for applying for       student loans, and utility and cellphone service contracts.       Individuals with adverse credit history and low credit scores       experience higher interest rates or denial altogether.        Traffickers use coercion and control to financially exploit       their victims in various ways. One survivor described her       trafficker coercing her into obtaining a loan and then credit       cards by threatening the survivor's family. This left the       survivor with poor credit and more than $25,000 in debt.       Traffickers may also try to access credit that has not yet       been exploited by intentionally targeting younger victims.       One survivor recalled a trafficker targeting seventeen-year-      old girls, who were about to turn eighteen because the       trafficker could exploit their fresh credit by having them       sign up for credit cards. In addition, as Rev. Dr. Marian       Hatcher powerfully recounted in her testimony to the House       Committee on Financial Services, traffickers may also use       their victim's credit to purchase expensive items, such as       cars. Traffickers also control their victim's bank accounts,       passwords, and use the victim's accounts to engage in       criminal activities. Consequently, financial institutions may       later deny the survivor services because of criminal       activity. Traffickers often exploit their victim's credit       history at a time when the victim is not present in the       formal economy and unable to build positive credit history.        Trafficking survivors then experience adverse credit       history and burdensome loan obligations because of their       financial exploitation. Consequently, when survivors leave       their trafficking situations, they often cannot access       financial resources. Trafficking survivors report difficulty       opening bank accounts and obtaining safe housing, employment,       cars, and cell phones. Access to housing is especially       important to ending the cycle of vulnerability and       exploitation. In one study, 64% of trafficking victims       reported that lack of affordable housing prevented them from       escaping their trafficking situation. Lack of resources may       result in survivors returning to their exploitative       circumstances. In her testimony to the House Committee on       Financial Services, Rev. Dr. Marian Hatcher testified that       lack of resources leads to reexploitation because ``survivors       feel they have no option other than returning to the       commercial sex industry.'' Also, obstacles to accessing       financial resources and student loans may also hinder a       survivor's educational aspirations. This negatively impacts       the survivor's academic empowerment and long-term goals.       Furthermore, survivors may feel stigmatized or embarrassed       because of their poor credit. By preventing a consumer       reporting agency from reporting adverse information resulting       from a survivor's trafficking, the DBRA prevents a survivor's       credit report from becoming an apparatus for continuing       victimization.        Poor credit due to financial exploitation has long-term       impacts on a survivor's ability to access financial       resources, build financial independence, and navigate life       after exploitation. The Debt Bondage Repair Act is crucial to       providing trafficking survivors a clean slate and path toward       financial independence. We support this critical legislation       and urge Congress to support trafficking survivors by passing       the Debt Bondage Repair Act.            Sincerely,                                                Christine Raino,                                   Senior Director of Public Policy,      Shared Hope International.                                   ____                             NCSE Letter of Support         The National Center on Sexual Exploitation is grateful to       Rep. Patrick McHenry for introducing HR 2332, the Debt       Bondage Repair Act (DBRA) and to Survivor Leader Marian       Hatcher, whose testimony before the Financial Services       Committee inspired this solution.        H.R. 2332 provides financial relief to victims of human       trafficking by preventing adverse credit reporting of       incidents which occurred while being trafficked. The ability       to move forward in life after tremendous adversity requires       financial well-being along with personal well-being. In       America, financial health depends on good credit. HR 2332       allows victims to put the past behind them and seek a much-      needed fresh start. It is an excellent complement to the       Trafficking Victims Protection Act in supporting justice for       survivors.        We look forward to working toward passage of this act as       well as continued efforts on behalf of trafficking survivors.                                   ____            Reverend Dr. Marian Hatcher Letter of Support: H.R. 2332         Survivors spend a great deal of time trying to heal in ways       you would expect; physically, mentally, emotionally and       spiritually.        However, another critically important aspect of healing is       often left unattended and impedes the path to holistic       health. That aspect is financial healing.        In many cases, the lack of financial wellness causes       victims to have no option but to return to exploitive       situations.        In other circumstances, survivors may be held civilly or       criminally liable for debt incurred during their trafficking.        Any of these scenarios prevent the life of liberty and       wholeness that survivors yearn for and deserve.        The Debt Bondage Repair Act will help provide survivors       with a viable chance at full wellbeing, inclusive of       financial stability and security.        I strongly support this critical legislation and urge       Congress to support trafficking survivors by passing the Debt       Bondage Repair Act.                                           Rev. Dr. Marian Hatcher.  [[Page H2787]]                                          ____                            Consumer Data Industry Association,                                      Washington, DC, June 14, 2021.      Hon. Maxine Waters,      Chairwoman,      Hon. Patrick T. McHenry,      Ranking Member,      Committee on Financial Services,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairwoman Waters and Ranking Member McHenry: I write       on behalf of the Consumer Data Industry Association in       support of H.R. 2332, the Debt Bondage Repair Act. This bill       will give victims of human trafficking and debt bondage the       ability to prove that they were victims of human trafficking       and financial abuse so they can remove that information from       their financial history.        This bill will help to address the financial trauma victims       of human trafficking often endure. These victims should not       have to bear the burden of fraudulent debts and ruined credit       from their exploitation as they begin to rebuild their lives.       Any verified fraudulent data on a credit report should be       removed promptly from credit reports. In fact, the current       practice credit bureaus follow is to remove any verified       fraudulent data from reports. This bill will be helpful as it       will specifically acknowledge in the law that these kinds of       abuses occur and that the resulting tradelines should be       deleted from reports.        Thank you for your work on this legislation.            Sincerely,                                                 Francis Creighton,                                                   President & CEO.     Additionally, I would like to thank Polaris for their  support of this legislation.   This is a great example of what happens when both parties work  together. I want to thank Chairwoman Waters for her help and  assistance, and her staff, the Financial Services Committee majority  Democrat staff, for their help with my staff and the Republican  minority staff on the House Financial Services Committee.   We have a bipartisan solution to help trafficking victims pick up the  pieces and begin a new life. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.  I think this will be helpful to the lives at stake and let them rebuild  their lives, not just financially but rebuild their lives.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote for this  good bipartisan bill that will help victims.    Madam Speaker, I thought I reserved.   Madam Speaker, I urge adoption of this important measure, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   We can all agree data is important. But we need to recognize,  particularly as it relates to obtaining data on companies, that each  one is unique. Mandatory reporting metrics do not accurately measure  progress.   Just look at the mandatory disclosure bills on the floor this week.  They are a mess. The only outcome we can expect to see with those bills  is a higher compliance cost on companies, leaving fewer resources to  build out a workforce and invest in research and development.   Simply put, one size does not fit all, and one-size-fits-all doesn't  work.   However, the bill we have in front of us today does not impose a new  mandatory reporting regime. It adds on a list of voluntary data and  adds a new item to that voluntary data. Data is collected on a  voluntary basis under ECOA, under this law that is being amended. Any  loan applicant who does not wish to provide information can decline to  provide it, meaning there are fewer concerns over privacy or a one- size-fits-all reporting regime.   These are the things I have raised about this bill. I want to commend  the sponsor for being willing to work with Republicans on getting back  to the essence of the bill. I appreciate that my Democrat colleagues  have offered a solution to promote diversity and inclusion without  imposing new requirements on businesses or business owners that do not  effectively measure their success.   I support this bill. I will vote for this bill. And I want to commend  my Democrat colleagues for working with us on a number of concerns that  we had with the various drafts of the bill.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1545     Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3325, a bill to award the  Congressional Gold Medal to the U.S. Capitol Police and those who  protected the Capitol on January 6, 2021.  [[Page H2790]]    I would like to thank the Speaker for bringing this legislation to  the floor to honor the officers who work tirelessly to protect us in  and out every day, to not just protect this building, but to protect  the Members in this building. Not just protect the Members, but to make  sure that staff is safe on a daily basis. And the staff, indeed, makes  Congress what it is and gives us the capacity that we have to  legislate. We want to make sure that staff and Members and our visitors  here are protected on a daily basis, and the Capitol Police, indeed, do  that.   Madam Speaker, what happened to this institution on January 6 was  horrific. This building is a working monument to our Nation's Founding  Fathers and our founding principles. It is a testament to the freedoms  we hold dear and that we strive for, and we strive to become a more  perfect Union on every day that we are here. Not perfectly, but we  strive for a more perfect Union.   Madam Speaker, the brave men and women who stood and faced danger on  January 6 deserve to be recognized for their actions. Without their  courageous work and their dedication, many of us here today could have  been seriously injured or worse.   This gold medal will also honor another Capitol Police Officer,  William ``Billy'' Evans. Officer Evans, an 18-year veteran of Capitol  Police, was killed at his post when a car rammed into the Capitol  barricade on Good Friday. Any life lost is a tragedy, especially those  of our friends on the police force.   Once this bill is enacted, a Congressional Gold Medal will be  displayed at the U.S. Capitol Police headquarters. It will be a  recognition of the good work the Capitol Police do on a daily basis.  Another will be displayed at the D.C. Metropolitan Police headquarters,  and the third will be given to the Smithsonian Institution so everyone  who visits D.C. will be reminded of the bravery by our police officers  on that very day.   Madam Speaker, I think I speak for all my colleagues when I say thank  you, thank you to each and every officer who was here on January 6.  Their bravery will not be forgotten.   The U.S. Capitol Police and those who protected us on January 6  deserve this Congressional Gold Medal. I urge my colleagues to support  this bill.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, I think this is a special moment for the House in a  very tough year for us to pause and to say thank you to those men and  women who stand guard over this institution; not just this building,  not just this campus, but the people who work here every day.   It is not Members; it is staff that are here every day. It is the  people that make the Capitol work physically. It is the folks who are  at the daycare, the folks who are in the press. They are the folks who  are frequent visitors here, such that they feel like they work here,  too.   It is the Capitol Police that keep us safe not from one another, but  safe from the harms that can happen in a very dangerous world. And we  want to say thank you to the men and women of the Capitol Police for  their dedication, for their bravery, for their training every day.   And we honor you not just in word, but with deed; not just with word  and this deed of a Congressional Gold Medal, but our ongoing support.  Our ongoing support, such that you can operate every day to the best of  your training with the best training and tactics available to police  and law enforcement anywhere in the world, the best equipment, the best  training resources, but also the freedom to use those things in a way  that is commensurate with public safety.   So I want to thank the Capitol Police for their service and their  sacrifice in making this institution safe; safe so we can debate  important things that need to be debated, to disagree, for us to be  able to disagree as a civil society, yet still come together for the  important things of being friends and neighbors and lovers of this  great country.   Madam Speaker, I encourage a ``yes'' vote, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
