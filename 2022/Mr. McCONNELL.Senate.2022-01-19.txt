 Mr. President, the Democratic Party has had control of  Washington for exactly 364 days. Tomorrow will mark exactly 1 year  since President Biden was inaugurated on the West Front and promised to  ``unit[e] our people,'' ``lower the temperature,'' and brin[g] America  together.'' But today, the President and his party will try to use fear  and panic to smash the Senate, silence millions of Americans, and seize  control of our democracy.   Now, there is no shortage of real crises Democrats might consider  tackling: the worst inflation in 40 years, the seemingly endless  pandemic, soaring homicides, the border crisis, and Russia flirting  with war in Europe.   But the administration and this Senate majority are focused on none  of that. Instead, they have been consumed by a fake panic over election  laws that seem to exist only in their own imaginations.   So let's put a few basic facts on the table. Fewer than one-half of 1  percent of American adults believe that election law is our country's  most important problem. When polls ask people what new Federal election  laws they want, the most popular response is ``none of the above.''   Actually, more Americans believe current voting laws are too lax than  believe they are too restrictive. Let that sink in. You could have  taken in hundreds of hours of leftwing rhetoric and media coverage over  the past year and had no inkling of this basic fact. Significantly more  Americans believe current voting laws are too loose and insecure than  believe are too restrictive.   Professional liberals have spent 3 straight years talking down our  democracy, except a short period after they liked an election result  and questioning elections was, at least briefly, off limits. But the  American people are not buying that. Democrats have spent years stoking  fear and panic over voting laws and the American people simply do not  buy it. But while Washington Democrats' fake panic has failed to  persuade the country, it could still deal permanent damage.   Today, the Senate will need to prevent this factional frenzy from  damaging our democracy, damaging the Senate, and damaging our Republic  forever.   First, our democracy. Professional liberals' fake hysteria over State  voting laws is literally collapsing before our eyes. Even normally  friendly media outlets are asking Democrats why a law like Georgia's is  supposed to be outrageous when it is objectively more open than rules  in blue States like Delaware and New York. President Biden's false  statement about one State law earned him--listen to this--``four  Pinocchios'' in the Washington Post. That is not easy to get. There is  no factual standard by which any State in America is creating a civil  rights crisis, not compared to their own prepandemic baselines, not  comparing across with other States.   What is more, Democrats' own paper trails refute the notion that this  is about new State laws from 2021. Three years ago, in 2019, Leader  Schumer was already giving interviews about supposed voter suppression.  The same conspiracy theories were being pushed back then. The same  ominous buzzwords were in vogue. And 3 years ago, in 2019, Democrats  had already introduced their first version of the legislation they will  be pushing today.   This party-line push has never been about securing citizens' rights.  It is about expanding politicians' power. That is why their bill tries  to weaken voter ID laws that are popular with Americans of all races.  That is why their bill is stuffed with strange policies that have zero  relationship to ballot access, new powers for bureaucrats to police  citizens' speech online, new schemes where the Federal Government would  directly fund political campaigns.   This is not some modest bill about ballot access. It is a sprawling  takeover of our whole political system. It was never even intended to  attract bipartisan support. This partisan Frankenstein bill that the  House Democrats slapped together was intended to do one thing, just one  thing only: Give the Senate Democratic leader a pretext--a pretext--to  break the Senate.   Later today, this Chamber will host a sad spectacle that has not been  seen before in living memory. A sitting majority leader will attempt a  direct assault on the core identity of the Senate. Our colleague from  New York will try to kill the character of the institution he is  supposed to protect and to serve.   Now, the Democratic leader once said that breaking the rules to kill  the filibuster would turn the Senate into a ``rubberstamp of  dictatorship,'' make America a ``banana republic'' and trigger ``a  doomsday for democracy.''   Several years ago, with no connection to this particular issue, he  began talking about shredding minority protections if--if--he ever got  power.   And now he wants to press that doomsday button.   The legislative filibuster is a central Senate tradition. It is the  indispensable feature of our institution. It makes the Senate serve its  founding purpose--forging compromise, cooling passions, and ensuring  that new laws earn broad support from a cross section of our country.   The Senate is not supposed to be a duplicate House of Representatives  with fewer Members and fancier desks. This body is not supposed to  amplify huge swings in Federal law with every election. It exists to  slow those swings and to bring stability.   The legislative filibuster is the only reason the Senate provides  what James Madison called a ``complicated check'' on ``improper acts of  legislation.'' It embodies Thomas Jefferson's principle that ``great  innovations should not be forced on slender majorities.''   Killing the legislative filibuster--any way it happened--would hugely  damage the Senate, but doing so by nuking the rules would destroy the  Senate. As I have explained at some length, this is true on the most  practical level. A Senate in nuclear winter would not be a hospitable  place for either side.   As then-Senator Obama explained a decade and a half ago, ``If the  majority chooses to end the filibuster, if they choose to change the  rules and put an end to democratic debate, then the fighting and the  bitterness and the gridlock will only get worse.''   Please note that, even in the Democratic leader's manufactured case,  even when he presumably wanted the most persuasive theater he could  possibly muster, the Senate will have only spent about a day and a half  on this bill before he tries to ram it through. Since when does the  Senate pass any significant bill in a day and a half, much less a  gigantic elections overhaul? Our colleague is not trying to conclude an  unending discussion that  [[Page S280]]  he cannot stop; he is trying to short circuit a debate that he cannot  win. This is just the kind of shortsighted power grab this body was  actually built to stop.   The case that most of our Democratic colleagues are making this week  boils down to a claim that everything is somehow broken. The Senate is  broken because they can't get everything they want. Our democracy is  broken because Democrats sometimes lose elections. Entire States are  broken because voters vote the wrong way, and so their voices in this  Chamber should be totally silenced. Millions of American voters should  be denied any say whatsoever in this Chamber. Really? Really? Our  Democratic colleagues claiming our entire Republic is broken? That is  what their anger and pessimism boils down to.   They say that we are hopelessly divided; that governing institutions  that have served us for centuries need to be smashed and steamrolled;  that we are fated to keep escalating brute-force battles with no end in  sight. This is exactly the kind of toxic world view that this President  pledged to disavow, but it is exactly what has consumed his party on  his watch. You can literally hear it in their voices.   In the last few days, our President and his top allies have been  reduced to shouting angrily at reporters and at the American people.  They are so certain they know best. How dare the rules, how dare the  facts, the Republicans, and millions of voters all obstruct their  unique wisdom?   Well, the good news is that the fear is false. The rage is misplaced.  And today, factional fevers will not carry the day.   The Senate is not broken. We have passed major, bipartisan bills this  year, and we have stopped partisan bills that lack support; exactly-- exactly--the mixture the Framers imagined and Senators on both sides  praised--praised--until the last few months. Our democracy is not  broken either. Citizens across America have ample opportunity to vote  and say so to anybody who will listen to them. Our Republic is not  broken. Even with all the crises that Democrats' policies have created,  we remain fellow citizens who are blessed to live in the greatest  country on Earth.   Today, it appears that a narrow, bipartisan majority of Senators will  vote to save the Senate. With hope, with confidence, we will stand up  and say that our institutions are worth protecting; that rules matter;  that no American deserves to have his or her voice in this Chamber  silenced. Ah, but a partisan minority will do the opposite. They will  try to smash and grab as much short-term power as they can carry.   For both groups of Senators, this vote will echo for generations.  Before we part ways tonight, all 100 of us will have marked our  legacies in permanent ink. Who will vote with hope and confidence in  our people, and who will vote from anger, fear, and fake panic? Who  will vote to protect checks and balances, and who will try to purchase  power at any price? Who has the courage to protect every single  American voice in this Chamber, no matter their home State, no matter  their politics, and who will vote to silence millions of citizens for  the sin of voting for the wrong team? The American people deserve to  know, and from this day forward, they will.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois.    Excuse me. No.                                  H.R. 5746     Mr. President, well, I think we can all agree on one  thing: It has been a long day. Almost everybody has had something to  say, and the reason for that is this is an important day in the history  of the Senate. It could be argued it is the most important day in the  history of the Senate as an institution. This very day that we are just  wrapping up is, in all likelihood, the most important day in the  history of the Senate as an institution.   This evening, fewer than 60 Senators voted to advance a piece of  legislation so it didn't move forward. It is pretty common around here.  It happens frequently. In fact, it happened less than a week ago, as we  know, when our Democratic colleagues used the 60-vote threshold to  block sanctions against Putin's pipeline.   In 2020, the Democrats used the filibuster multiple times to delay  the CARES Act, kill Senator Tim Scott's police reform bill, block  bipartisan protections for unborn children.   Senate minorities can apply the brakes to small majorities. Senate  minorities can apply the brakes to small majorities. This institution  makes major changes earn major buy-in. This institution requires that  major changes receive major buy-in. For decades, Americans on all sides  acknowledged this.   Believe it or not, 15 years ago--several of us were here 15 years  ago--there were 180 civil rights organizations--180 civil rights  organizations--that weighed in in support of the filibuster because, at  that particular point, the filibuster was being used to stop judges  appointed by Bush 43. So over 100 civil rights organizations wrote us a  letter saying the filibuster is indispensable. It served their purpose  at that particular time.   For decades--literally, decades--Senators on both sides agreed. We  have quoted each other back and forth here, eloquent filibuster  defenses from colleagues across the aisle when it benefited them to  make those speeches.   But, colleagues, a leader's true colors are not revealed when long- term principles and short-term power line up together. That is easy,  when what you are trying to achieve lines up with the tactics. The  measure of a leader is not what he or she chooses; it is what they  choose when those two paths diverge, go in a different direction.   Now, half of us, on this side of the aisle, just spent 4 years--4  years--when we were in the majority and we had a President of our party  asking us to do what they are trying to do tonight, and we had a one- word answer: No. No. We are not going to fracture the institution to  achieve some short-term advantage.   And actually, astonishingly enough--Grassley was here then--in 1994,  the best Republican off-year election, arguably, in American history  took the House for the first time in 40 years, got the majority back in  the Senate.   Tom Harkin--Chuck Grassley's colleague from Iowa, the Democrat--on  day one of that session, through the regular order, offered a rule  change to lower the threshold to 51. So who would have benefited from  that? This brand-new, enthusiastic majority just having swept the  country would have been the principal beneficiary of lowering the  threshold to 51. Not one single Republican in the new majority voted to  give themselves an advantage that would break the Senate--not one. So  we have been consistent on this side of the aisle in support of this  institution as long as I have been here.   They face the same decision now. They have a choice. They could break  the institution to achieve what they want or defend the institution.  And so they pivoted. And that is why so many of them look so foolish  because they have been on the opposite side of this, not a long time  ago but quite recently. And so they tried to carve out a special  category here that somehow this issue is different from all the other  issues and should be treated differently.   Well, on the merits, as we have discussed ad nauseam here, this is  something they have been trying to do for a long time. The rationale  for it has changed periodically, depending upon what seemed to make  sense. But dial it up any way you choose to, this is a plot to break  the Senate--a plot to break the Senate. Over the issue they have  chosen, one-half of 1 percent of the American people say election law  is their most pressing concern--one-half of 1 percent of the American  people.   Actually, Americans, as a number of you have said during the course  of this long day, believe voting laws are actually too loose, rather  than too strict, and as you have said over and over and over again,  Georgia's new law is arguably more progressive than New York or  Delaware. All of you have said that all day long.   And this? This is the basis upon which the President of the United  States calls people like us racists, traitors? Over this? Over how many  days of early voting you are going to have? Really? This is the basis  on which 40-plus Senate Democrats want to not  [[Page S346]]  only break their word but break the Senate.   Now, the so-called talking filibuster proposal is smoke and mirrors,  just smoke and mirrors. There is really only one question we are  dealing with here, just one. It is not complicated. Will it take 60  votes to pass massive changes or a simple majority to ram them through?  That is what is at stake here, nothing else. Will slender majorities  need to build coalitions across the aisle or not? Will huge chunks of  Federal law reverse themselves whenever gavels change hands? We have  talked about this all day long. That is what this is about.   But, colleagues, something even more fundamental is at stake tonight.  Everyone in this Chamber knows that factional fires are burning hot all  across our country. As I look around, I don't know if this many of us  have actually gathered in this Chamber since January 6 of last year. We  were all in here then. I stood up that day, and I said self-government  requires shared respect for basic ground rules. I said we couldn't keep  drifting into two tribes and delegitimizing the few institutions we  still share.   Yes, the divisions run deep. Compromise is certainly challenging. But  it would not serve a divided country if two factions take turns ruling  over one another with an iron fist.   Here is a solution for a divided country: Thoughtful compromise  everywhere we can agree, and, when we can't agree, it just doesn't  happen.   The American people are closely divided. We are reflected here with a  50-50 Senate, for the longest time in American history.   There is not a mandate to fundamentally transform America into  something it has never been. It is not what the voters voted for. We  have a narrow majority trying to jam through, one after another,  proposals to fundamentally turn us into something we have never been.   Well, here is the good news: The Framers custom built--custom built-- the Senate to stop this kind of thing. That is why this institution was  constructed in the first place. We are sitting in the place designed to  stop this kind of thing, and we have an opportunity to do it here  tonight.   This is the first time in history that a Senate majority leader, who  is supposed to safeguard this institution, has convinced--convinced-- nearly all of his party to attack the institution. That hasn't happened  before.   Tonight, for the first time in history, almost an entire political  party will write in permanent ink that they would shatter the soul of  Senate for short-term power--shatter the soul of the Senate for short- term power. But the brave bipartisan majority of this party is about to  stop them--about to stop them. We will stop the Democratic leader from  silencing the voices of millions upon millions of Americans who have a  right to be heard in this Chamber, many of them represented by us who  come from small States. They derisively look down on us as a flyover  territory, a place nobody wants to stop.    The Senate was designed to represent those people. Every State gets  two Senators. Some States have only one House Member but two Senators.  We are here to protect middle America, and the supermajority threshold  in the Senate makes that even more possible. So they can't run  roughshod over us. They can't run roughshod over us and the people we  represent.   When our country needs leaders to fight the fires of factualism,  almost half the Senate over here wants to literally dump more gasoline  right on top of it.   When our institutions needed defending, a sitting President and a  majority leader have made smashing the Senate an unofficial part of  their party's platform. The President of the United States and the  majority leader of the Senate have made breaking the Senate a central  part of their plan for America.   Thanks to the courageous position of at least a few of their Members,  they will not succeed. This country will be shielded from their  radicalism tonight. And make no mistake about it, this is radicalism  designed to fundamentally change America in every conceivable way, to  the disadvantage of virtually all of the constituents represented by  people on this side of the aisle--and theirs as well, if they were  willing to admit it.   So the Senate will be safe tonight. The Senate will be safe tonight.  America can breathe a sigh of relief. This radicalism will have been  stopped, and it is a good day for America.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.    Madam President, very few people find the time to lead  their city's largest law firm, serve on a university's board of  trustees, represent their country at the United Nations, and remain  active in civic life in their hometown. Even fewer can accomplish these  things before the age of 40. But Jennifer Barber of Louisville, KY, has  managed to do all this--and more. Today, I ask my colleagues to join me  in honoring Jennifer for her recent career milestone and for her years  of service to the Commonwealth of Kentucky.   Jennifer, the daughter of Chinese immigrants, grew up working  alongside her parents in the family's restaurant, learning to value  sacrifice, ambition, and effort. She became the first member of her  family to graduate college, earning both her bachelor's degree and  juris doctorate from the University of Kentucky. From there, she  developed a specialty in tax law, taking her expertise to Frost Brown  Todd in 2013 and working her way up the corporate ladder.  [[Page S348]]    Jennifer's professional and academic successes only tell half the  story of her remarkable career. She has also dedicated her time,  energy, and talent to a range of important Kentucky organizations, from  the University of Kentucky Board of Trustees, to the Kentucky State  Fair Board, to the Kentucky Bar Foundation. In 2020, she took a brief  break from her law firm to take her talents to the global stage,  serving as a special adviser to the U.S. Ambassador to the United  Nations and a U.S. Delegate to the United Nations where she helped  advance American priorities on human rights and foreign aid.   Jennifer's professional accomplishments are so exciting because she  achieved them at such a remarkably young age. Jennifer has done  incredible work to improve Kentucky and serve our Nation, and I am  confident her recent promotion is just the first in a long list of  successes yet to come.   Louisville Business First highlighted Jennifer Barber's new role in a  recent article. I ask unanimous consent the article be printed in the  Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:              [From Louisville Business First, Jan. 18, 2022]          Louisville's Largest Law Firm Names New Member-In-Charge         Jennifer Barber was the first in her family to graduate       high school. Now, she's stepping into the member-in-charge       role at Frost Brown Todd LLC, the largest law firm in       Louisville.        In an interview with Business First last week, Barber, the       daughter of Chinese immigrants, recalled working alongside       her parents in the restaurant they owned, attributing her       belief in the value of sacrifice and hard work to them. She       said she saw their determination to provide a greater       opportunity for her and her sisters.        ``I'm very proud to be the first in my family to graduate       from high school and then college and law school, and I say       that very humbly. It's not something that I feel is something       to pat myself on the back for,'' she said. ``I feel very much       like, if not for our great country, which has endless       opportunities for people who live here, and my parents being       able to immigrate here and to make sacrifices and work hard .       . . I wouldn't be able to be now the member-in-charge.''        She's been with Frost Brown Todd since 2013. Her focus       there has been on tax law, economic incentives and government       affairs. She's also taken the lead on the firm's civic and       charitable engagement. She took a brief break from her       practice to serve as a United States delegate to the United       Nations and as a special adviser to U.S. ambassador to Canada       Kelly Craft for the 2020 session.        As Barber spoke about each of these roles: the UN, the law       firm, the charitable work, and her parents, she kept coming       back to the concept of wanting to give back to her community.        As a young attorney, she said she sought opportunities       where she'd be able to help people, and she ultimately landed       on tax law. She said her work with companies in this field       allows her to assist with the city's economic development.        ``Part of my civic engagement is to help these companies       thrive, because when they thrive, we see that our communities       are thriving,'' she said. ``Our citizens, our residents are       employed and through taxes, we fund schools, and we fund fire       departments, and we fund libraries . . . I think to the       extent that we can spur stronger economic growth in our       communities, everything else tends to rise as well.''        She completed both her undergraduate and law degrees from       the University of Kentucky. She served on the university's       board of trustees, as well as its athletic committee. (Plus,       she's an avid sports fan--specifically cheering for the       Wildcats.)        She's also served on the Kentucky State Fair Board, U.S.       Bank Advisory Board, Louisville Bar Association Board of       Directors, Kentucky Bar Foundation, and American Bar       Association Tax Section Executive Committee.        While working with the UN, Barber said her main focus was       on foreign policy, human rights and humanitarian assistance.       She said it was a humbling experience to serve the country       and see firsthand the positive impacts the U.S. has on the       rest of the world.        She said her background as a daughter of immigrants helped       her understand and empathize with others during her work at       the UN.        ``My family immigrated here from China . . . for me to be       able to sit behind that United States placard and deliver       remarks on behalf of the United States, it's really one of       the greatest honors,'' Barber said.        At the time of our conversation, Barber had only held the       member-in-charge role for about two weeks. She said her       mission within the role was for the firm to continue to       provide good client service and give back to its communities.        ``It's not lost on me that . . . I am minority, and I am a       woman, and I'm so pleased to have this role for many       reasons,'' she said.'' . . . I just think it's a reflection       of our firm and the legal profession as a whole really       diversifying leadership and different perspectives.''        Barber is taking over the member-in-charge role from Geoff       White, who held the position for seven years. White is still       working for the firm in other leadership roles, according to       a news release on the leadership changes.        The law firm, which has 294 local employees in total and       153 local attorneys according to the most recent LBF       research, also announced that member Jason Williams will       serve on the executive committee, the firm's equivalent of a       board of directors.                            ____________________
