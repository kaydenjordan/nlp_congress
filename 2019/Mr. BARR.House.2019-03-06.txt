 Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong opposition to H.R. 1.   This is my fourth term in the U.S. House of Representatives, and I  can say, without reservation or equivocation, H.R. 1 is the single  worst, most unsound, unconstitutional legislation that I have seen in  my 6\1/2\ years in Congress.   The bill federalizes elections in violation of basic constitutional  principles, usurping States' primary authority over the conduct of  elections, including Federal elections.   The bill effectively legalizes voter fraud, and destroys the  integrity of elections by degrading the accuracy of registration lists,  ensuring duplicate registration and registration of ineligible voters.   The bill unconstitutionally rations core free speech protected by the  First Amendment by empowering a powerful partisan bureaucracy to impose  onerous legal and administrative compliance burdens and costs on  candidates, citizens, civic groups, and nonprofit organizations. These  provisions violate the First Amendment; they protect incumbents; and  they diminish the accountability of politicians to the public.   And finally, worst of all, the bill gives welfare to politicians,  coercing Americans to support candidates with whom they fundamentally  disagree. This doesn't enhance democracy, the idea that we, the people  establish a government based on the consent of the government. It  corrupts democracy by taking away the fundamental right of the people  to choose their own representatives, and giving it to a partisan  election bureaucracy in Washington, D.C.   Mr. Chairman, Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin once famously said:         The people who cast the votes don't decide an election; the       people who count the votes do.    H.R. 1 would ``Stalinize'' American elections by legalizing voter  fraud, giving partisan election bureaucrats the power to ration free  speech, and by coercing Americans to support candidates and causes with  whom they fundamentally disagree.   I urge everyone, for the sake of the First Amendment and for our  Constitution, vote ``no.''
