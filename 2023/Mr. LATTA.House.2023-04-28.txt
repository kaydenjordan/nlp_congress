 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.J. Res. 39, a bipartisan  joint resolution of which I am proud to be an original cosponsor.   We are a Nation of laws. It is not up to the President to determine  which laws to enforce and which laws to ignore if they don't conform to  that President's particular agenda.   If we allow Communist China to blatantly violate our trade laws with  impunity, as the Commerce Department has concluded is occurring, how  can we expect other nations to follow those laws and conduct business  with us in a fair manner?   Those who oppose this joint resolution will say the imposition of  these tariffs will handicap renewable projects across this country that  rely on a continuous supply of solar panels and materials. I understand  this concern, and I am not opposed to the deployment of more renewable  energy projects.   However, I am opposed to the United States maintaining a supply chain  reliant on Communist China and their forced slave labor. We should  instead be working to build up our own solar manufacturing industry and  send signals to the industry that the time to shorten supply chains is  long past due. Unfortunately, these domestic companies operate at a  disadvantage when Communist China gets to break the rules and undermine  the markets with their cheap prices.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to stand up for American workers  and for American energy independence. Vote ``yes'' on H.J. Res. 39.
