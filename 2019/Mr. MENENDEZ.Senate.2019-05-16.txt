 Mr. President, May 18 marks the 10th anniversary of the  end of the civil war in Sri Lanka. In May 2009, the war between the  government and the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, LTTE,  ended. The civil war was a 27-year-long assault on the coexistence of  the Sri Lankan people, leaving scars that remain today. Both the Sri  Lankan state and the LTTE targeted dissidents and members of other  ethnic communities, indiscriminately bombing places of worship,  hospitals, and public transport. On this 10th anniversary, I urge the  people of Sri Lanka to renew their commitment to peace, reconciliation,  and accountability for human rights violations and crimes committed  during the conflict. In the wake of the devastating terrorist attacks  last month, the international community should also renew its  commitment to supporting those Sri Lankan citizens committed to a  peaceful and democratic society where the rights of all are protected  under the law.  [[Page S2920]]    The final years of the war saw heightened intensity of fighting and  soaring human rights abuses, including hundreds of enforced  disappearances, extrajudicial killings of aid workers, arbitrary  arrests, torture, and the use of child soldiers. The government labeled  any reporters critical of the government's war against the LTTE as  ``traitors'' and ``terrorists,'' and the LTTE tolerated no dissent in  areas it controlled. The last few months of fighting resulted in the  deaths of as many as 40,000 civilians in the final assault against the  LTTE. Victims' groups say the fates of more than 100,000 people remain  unknown. UN satellite images showed that the government repeatedly and  indiscriminately shelled no fire zones, where it had encouraged  civilians to concentrate, and where estimates show that as many as  330,000 civilians were trapped. UN investigations determined that  ``gross violations'' of international rights law occurred on all sides  of the conflict, including the thousands of civilian deaths in the  military assault that ended the rebellion. Many deaths and tens of  thousands of disappearances remain unaddressed.   For many Sri Lankans, the terrorist attacks last Easter Sunday,  evoked emotions reminiscent of war times. I express my deepest  condolences to the families who lost loved ones and denounce in the  strongest terms this vile attack on the Sri Lankan people. As families  recovered bodies of loved ones and buried and cremated them, they felt  a pain that is sadly too familiar to so many Sri Lankans. While the  perpetrators of the Easter Sunday attacks sought to sow hatred between  communities and bring chaos to Sri Lanka, the government bears the  responsibility to respond swiftly to retaliatory attacks against Muslim  communities and ensure communal harmony and national unity. To be Sri  Lankan is to be Buddhist, to be Hindu, to be Muslim, and to be  Christian. All these communities have the right to exercise their  religious identity and to live in peace and security in Sri Lanka.   On January 9, 2015, the Sri Lankan people voted to unseat President  Mahinda Rajapaksa. A few months later, the government of Maithripala  Sirisena cosponsored United Nations Human Rights Council, UNHRC,  resolution 30/1 on ``Promoting reconciliation, accountability and human  rights in Sri Lanka,'' ushering in what appeared to be a new era  dedicated to justice and reconciliation. This enthusiasm and hope has  unfortunately faded over the years. In 2017, Sri Lanka received a 2- year extension to implement the commitments in the resolution. This  past March, the UNHRC adopted a new resolution again cosponsored by the  government of Sri Lanka, extending the timeline to implement  outstanding promises another 2 years.   Resolution 30/1 contains 36 actionable commitments. The Sri Lankan  Government has fulfilled only six over a period of 4 years. These  include recent decisions to criminalize enforced disappearances, create  an office on missing persons, and appointing commissioners to the  office for reparations. Why did these few steps require 4 years of  time?   Despite the long list of promises, there has been little to no  progress in establishing a commission for truth, justice,  reconciliation, and nonrecurrence. Despite commitments made by the  government, Sri Lanka has not adopted constitutional reforms that would  address the long held grievances of communities across the country. The  government has failed to strengthen the victim and witness protection  law. Security sector reforms, including repealing and replacing the  Prevention of Terrorism Act, have not taken place. The lack of  accountability with respect to war crimes suspects remains a serious  concern. Limited legal action has been taken to prosecute and hold  alleged perpetrators to account. There is a lack of trust and  confidence in domestic structures, so I echo the UN Human Rights  Commissioner's calls that the international community use the principle  of universal jurisdiction to hold accountable those who face  allegations of serious human rights violations.   Sri Lankan people deserve justice, peace, and protections. The  country cannot move forward, rebuild, and prosper without a timebound  plan for the government to fully implement its HRC commitments.  Accountability, transitional justice, and reconciliation are hard, but  left unresolved, these issues fester over time and could lead to  renewed instability. Clearly, such an outcome should be avoided as it  benefits no one in or outside of Sri Lanka.   The war in Sri Lanka was a terrible episode in a country with a proud  past. How Sri Lanka finally decides to deal with the legacy of the  conflict is critically important for its future. My hope is that the  government of Sri Lanka delivers on all its stated commitments, and  that the international community maintains its focus on these postwar  promises. As the country contends with the impact of reprehensible  violence last month, it must renew its focus on the fundamentals of an  inclusive multireligious and multi-ethnic society. I call on the  friends of Sri Lanka around the world to support true reconciliation  and healing as those constructive elements of society work hard to  chart a positive future for all of the country's people.                            ____________________
