 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to oppose this solely  Democrat payoff spending bill.   I will agree with my colleagues, it is historic. I agree with my  colleagues, it is consequential. There is no doubt about it. I am sure  that with $1.9 trillion, somebody will be helped. I am quite sure of  that. But the next generation of Americans are not going to be  thankful.   Let's be honest with the American people. This is not a COVID relief  bill. Members of this body came together four times last Congress and  passed legislation that actually provided relief to our constituents.  This bill is so incredibly far away from that, as Republicans have been  completely frozen out of this process.   Mr. Speaker, what is the result? Only 9 percent goes towards  defeating the virus.   $1.5 billion for Amtrak, which is already sitting on $1 billion in  unspent aid. Maybe riding Amtrak is a good place to socially distance.  Maybe that is the reason.   $50 million for environmental justice grants, Mr. Speaker. That  doesn't educate our children.   Roughly $1 trillion on other liberal pet projects, when we have $1  trillion from the previous bipartisan bills that has been left unspent.   Can someone explain what that has to do with COVID relief? Anybody?   If Members are serious about directly addressing the medical and  economic challenges our country faces, like getting businesses open,  getting students back to school, getting vaccines to Americans who want  them, I will work with anyone in this body to do so. You know  Republicans will, because we did several times until Democrats ignored  us this Congress.   Please, let's not pretend this bill is about COVID relief. That  simply is not true.
