 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3973) to amend the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to  require certain entities to develop internal risk control mechanisms to  safeguard and govern the storage of market data.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3973         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Market Data Protection Act       of 2017''.       SEC. 2. INTERNAL RISK CONTROLS.         The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.)       is amended--        (1) by inserting after section 4E the following:       ``SEC. 4F. INTERNAL RISK CONTROLS.         ``(a) In General.--Each of the following entities, in       consultation with the Chief Economist, shall develop       comprehensive internal risk control mechanisms to safeguard       and govern the storage of all market data by such entity, all       market data sharing agreements of such entity, and all       academic research performed at such entity using market data:        ``(1) The Commission.        ``(2) Each national securities association registered       pursuant to section 15A.        ``(3) The operator of the consolidated audit trail created       by a national market system plan approved pursuant to section       242.613 of title 17, Code of Federal Regulations (or any       successor regulation).        ``(b) Consolidated Audit Trail Prohibited From Accepting       Market Data Until Mechanisms Developed.--The operator       described in paragraph (3) of subsection (a) may not accept       market data (or shall cease accepting market data) until the       operator has developed the mechanisms required by such       subsection. Any requirement for a person to provide market       data to the operator shall not apply during any time when the       operator is prohibited by this subsection from accepting such       data.        ``(c) Treatment of Previously Developed Mechanisms.--The       development of comprehensive internal risk control mechanisms       required by subsection (a) may occur, in whole or in part,       before the date of the enactment of this section, if such       development and such mechanisms meet the requirements of such       subsection (including consultation with the Chief       Economist).''; and        (2) in section 3(a)--        (A) by redesignating the second paragraph (80) (relating to       funding portals) as paragraph (81); and        (B) by adding at the end the following:        ``(82) Chief economist.--The term `Chief Economist' means       the Director of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis,       or an employee of the Commission with comparable authority,       as determined by the Commission.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and to include extraneous material on this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, cybersecurity is critical to consumers, investors,  market participants and, frankly, the very markets themselves. However,  in April of 2016, the GAO--the Government Accountability Office-- identified weaknesses regarding information security protocols at the  Securities and Exchange Commission, and noted that the SEC's failure to  implement an agencywide data security program had occurred.   Once confirmed in May of this year, SEC Chairman Jay Clayton  initiated an assessment of the SEC's internal cybersecurity risk  profile and their approach to cybersecurity from a regulatory and  oversight perspective. The SEC's internal assessment found that the  agency had inadequate controls and that there were serious cyber and  data risks.   Unfortunately, in September of this year, Chairman Clayton issued a  statement on cybersecurity in which he revealed that a cyber breach  ``previously detected in 2016 may have provided illicit gain through  trading.''   Specifically, a software vulnerability existed in the test filing  component of the SEC's Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and  Retrieval--also known as the EDGAR system--which resulted in access to  nonpublic information. While this breach provided hackers access to  highly sensitive material, at the time, the SEC believed ``the  intrusion did not result in unauthorized access to personally  identifiable information''--or PII, as we commonly refer to it-- therefore, ``jeopardize the operations of the SEC, or result in a  systemic risk.'' And that was a quote from the SEC's report.   However, unfortunately, in a follow-up disclosure shortly after that,  Chairman Clayton revealed that personally identifiable information,  including names, birth dates, Social Security numbers, were actually  compromised for two individuals in that particular breach.   The GAO report and the EDGAR data breach underscore what is now even  of greater concern, the sufficiency of risk control mechanisms for the  SEC-approved consolidated audit trail, or also known as the CAT system.  The CAT will be the most comprehensive repository of market data we  have seen, and it will collect and identify every order, cancellation,  and trade execution for all exchange-listed equities and options across  all U.S. markets. It will also collect personally identifiable  information beginning 1 year after it begins accepting market data.   Thesys Technologies, which was selected to be the plan processor for  the CAT, is scheduled to begin accepting data from self-regulatory  organizations who must provide data to CAT on Wednesday, November 15,  just merely days from today.   Many of my colleagues, as well as market participants, have voiced  concerns about the cost of building and implementing such a system and  the amount of PII that will be required to be collected by the CAT.   Last Congress, several Members wrote to former SEC Chair Mary Jo  White expressing serious concerns  [[Page H9141]]  about the security of such sensitive information held within that CAT  system, as well as those who will have access to such information.   As I mentioned, the deadline for the SROs to begin reporting to this  CAT system is just 2 days away. It is paramount that the SEC has  adequate data security controls in place before that implementation.   Previously, in committee, I had put it this way: That is a repository  of the information of gold. Gold is the equivalent of information  today. What they are doing is they are putting more gold into that data  vault, and we don't have the security to support it.   So while the CAT may be a helpful resource for the SEC, and even the  self-regulatory agencies or organizations--SROs--once fully  implemented, insufficient data security controls will undermine  confidence in our markets and may very well result in the CAT being  counterproductive.   Thus, I joined with Financial Services Committee Chairman Hensarling  in writing Chairman Clayton to ``encourage the SEC to delay  implementation of the CAT system until the SEC can implement  information security safeguards and internal controls to ensure the  security of confidential and sensitive data.''   No assurances for a delay in implementing the CAT have been provided,  and even if they have, it is appropriate for Congress to set baseline  standards to ensure that controls are in place. In other words, Mr.  Speaker, we are trying to do our job.   H.R. 3973, the Market Data Protection Act, introduced by  Representatives Davidson and Sherman, is necessary to ensure that the  SEC is properly securing critical data that supports our financial  markets as well as the personal information of millions of customers  with broker-dealer accounts.   Specifically, the bipartisan legislation would mandate that the SEC,  FINRA, and the operator of the consolidated audit trail, in  consultation with the SEC's chief economist, develop comprehensive  internal risk control mechanisms to safeguard and govern the storage of  market data, all market data-sharing agreements, and all academic  research using that market data.   The bill also halts market data reporting to the consolidated audit  trail until the operator of the CAT system develops such internal risk  control mechanisms that they are deemed satisfactory.   The EDGAR security breach and the recent massive Equifax data  breach--and I might add, Mr. Speaker, we just saw a report of an NSA  breach that had just happened, our largest database--well, this would  become the second largest database in the country.    Those breaches--in which the sensitive information of nearly 150  million Americans have been compromised, in the Equifax breach--only  underscore the importance of proactively ensuring that any highly  sensitive data being collected by the Securities and Exchange  Commission or at the SEC's discretion, subject to their oversight, is  protected with appropriate safeguards. We owe that to the American  people.   The importance of cybersecurity at the SEC cannot be overstated. The  SEC's ability to safeguard nonpublic financial information and other  highly sensitive data instills confidence in the markets.   SEC Commissioner Michael Piwowar recently commented regarding CAT  that ``deadlines are important, but the SEC has one chance to get this  right. We have to make sure that we have everything locked down. We can  get it done, or we can get it done right. We need to get it done  right.''   I couldn't agree more with Commissioner Piwowar. That is why this  legislation is so urgently needed. I commend the bipartisan work of  Representatives Davidson and Sherman, and I urge my colleagues to vote  in favor of this very important bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Davidson), the sponsor of this legislation and  a member of the Financial Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, as I had said before, when information is the equivalent  of modern-day gold, we need to make sure that whatever vaults that  information, that gold, is going into are properly protected--properly  protected for consumers and their personally identifiable information.  We have an obligation, as the government, to make sure that their  information is protected as best as possible, and doubly so when it is  going into government-run systems. That is the reason why H.R. 3973 is  so imperative that it be passed.   Mr. Speaker, I again commend my friend from Ohio (Mr. Davidson) and  my friend from California (Mr. Sherman) on their bipartisan work on  that.   Mr. Speaker, I urge passage, and I yield back the balance of my time.
