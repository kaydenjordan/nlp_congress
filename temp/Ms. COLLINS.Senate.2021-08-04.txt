 Madam President, first, let me offer to work with both  Senators from Louisiana to secure the funding that their State so  desperately needs, in my capacity as ranking member of the  Transportation, HUD Appropriations Subcommittee.   Louisiana has been particularly hard hit, experiencing three  hurricanes almost back to back, and, certainly, the need for disaster  assistance is clear. But we also have other States that have been  affected: Alabama, California, Florida, Iowa, Michigan, Oregon, Puerto  Rico--a Territory, not a State, obviously. But they need help too.   What I would propose is that we work together on an emergency  disaster supplemental that will take care of all these needs, including  the needs of the people in hard-hit Louisiana.   I pledge my personal help and support to both of my colleagues and  friends from Louisiana to bring this about.   Finally, let me just say, I am surprised that the administration has  not submitted a request for supplemental disaster assistance. And I  look forward to see--    Thank you.                          Vote on Amendment No. 2210
