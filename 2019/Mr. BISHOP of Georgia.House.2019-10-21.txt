 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Truly, this is the day that the Lord has made. In spite of the fact  that our hearts are heavy, we must rejoice and be glad in it because we  have the opportunity to celebrate the life of our longtime friend and  our colleague, Congressman Elijah Cummings.   As you have heard, Elijah rose from modest beginnings to become one  of the greatest public servants that our country has seen. Elijah  always did what he believed was right, which earned him respect and  friendship on both sides of the aisle. His courage, his passion, and  his integrity were undeniable to anyone who crossed his path.   Elijah inspired us regularly as one of the greatest orators in this  House. He came to my district in Georgia as a guest speaker, and when  he finished, everyone was in awe. Elijah's powerful voice made everyone  take notice, listen intently, and then act.   America has lost a fierce warrior who was committed to doing the  right thing, regardless of politics. We will truly feel his absence in  this House, where he spoke truth to power and passionately advocated  for justice and equality for all.   My wife, Vivian, and I send our prayers and our deepest condolences  to his wife, Maya, his children, and his family as we mourn this great  man.   Winston Churchill once said: ``We make a living by what we get, but  we make a life by what we give.''   Elijah Cummings gave so much to so many for so long. He made his  life, but even greater, he made a life for his constituents and for  countless others all across this Nation.   Truly, this world is a better place because of the life and legacy of  Elijah Cummings.   To God, be the glory for our friend, our colleague, and the legacy of  Elijah E. Cummings.
