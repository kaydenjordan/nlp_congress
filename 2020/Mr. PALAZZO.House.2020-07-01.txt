 Madam Speaker, just a year ago, south Mississippi  mourned the senseless murder of Officer Robert McKeithen, and this  month, Mississippi lost one of our sheriff's deputies, James Blair, in  the line of duty.   Despite the dangers from criminals and lawlessness in our  communities, some in America continue to call for defunding and  dismantling police departments across the country. While we watched  stores looted and cities burned by street thugs and anarchists, the men  and women of law enforcement were labeled as the enemy.   Madam Speaker, police officers are not the enemy. They are the thin  blue line standing between good and evil, civilization and chaos. I  stand here today in 100 percent support of defending our police  officers and not defunding them.   Madam Speaker, I ask all the good citizens of America to stand up and  do the same. Defunding law enforcement is not the answer to the  problems of this country. Removing criminals from our streets is.   May God bless the men and women in blue and their families.                            ____________________
