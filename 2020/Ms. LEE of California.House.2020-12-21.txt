 Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of  this desperately needed omnibus measure.  [[Page H7290]]    The COVID-19 pandemic is devastating our communities, especially,  disproportionately, African-American, Latinx, Asian-American, and  Indigenous people, who are suffering the worst of this pandemic. Eight  million people have slipped into poverty since the start of this  pandemic, and one in four adults are suffering from hunger during  COVID-19.   I am pleased that we were able to come to this agreement.   I want to thank our Speaker, Nancy Pelosi, who has worked day and  night for what some of us are calling a survival package. It is a  lifeline payment until we can do something and do justice by the  American people.   I also want to just thank Chairman Pallone, Congresswoman DeLauro,  Chairwoman Nita Lowey, and all of our staffs for the amazing work that  they have done to put in so many of our priorities on a wide range of  issues.   This bill sets aside $2.8 billion to ensure that minority communities  hit hardest by COVID get the testing and vaccine support they need.   I look forward to working with my Tri-Caucus and Native American  colleagues to see that this funding is used to engage local community  organizations and trusted messengers in the community so people can get  the information that they need to keep themselves and their families  safe.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, first, let me thank Chairwoman  Nita Lowey for once again doing such a phenomenal job. I am going to  miss her tremendously.   Let me just say how much I support this survival bill, which provides  a few months of relief for those suffering from the severe impacts of  COVID.   Mr. Speaker, I also thank Congresswoman Chair DeLauro and Chairman  Pallone for their work with our Tri-Caucus to include $2.8 billion for  testing and vaccine support in the communities of color hardest hit by  COVID.   Mr. Speaker, I also thank our subcommittee chairs and staff for  including so many of our priorities and for their diligent work on  this.   It is really shameful that it has taken Republicans so long to  realize that their constituents are desperate for help and need their  government to give them a lifeline during this terrible time, also.   Eight million people have slipped into poverty since the start of  this pandemic, and one in four adults are suffering from hunger during  COVID-19. 318,000 people have died from the Trump administration's  scandalous mismanagement.    Mr. Speaker, I support this bill. Let's give  this lifeline to people. Let's move forward and build on this  downpayment.
