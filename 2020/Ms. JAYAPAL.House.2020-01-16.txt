 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Nevada for her  fierce leadership on this.   I rise in strong support of this resolution to block Betsy DeVos'  callous attempt to rewrite the borrower defense repayment rule. That  original rule protected student borrowers who have been cheated by  predatory, for-profit colleges.   This rule change would make it nearly impossible for defrauded  students to have their loans forgiven, and it strips away justice for  240,000 borrowers whose claims the Trump administration has refused to  process. That includes my own constituents, whom I had a roundtable  with, and they have filed claims after their school, the for-profit Art  Institute of Seattle, abruptly closed last year.   Some of those students have rightly applied for loan forgiveness  through the borrower defense to repayment process because they are  ineligible for closed school discharge, and now they face extreme  barriers to the relief that they deserve because Secretary DeVos has  put profits before the students she took an oath to serve.   One of those students said: I am left with no degree, extra thousands  of dollars in private loans that they pressured me to get. I feel  tricked, guilted, and screwed.   Today, Mr. Speaker, I urge support for this resolution that will  defend students, and I call on the House to also pass the College  Affordability Act, which will crack down on predatory for-profit  colleges in a comprehensive manner.   I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.
