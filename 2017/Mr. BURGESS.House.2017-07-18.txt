 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 451 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 451         Resolved, That at any time after adoption of this       resolution the Speaker may, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule       XVIII, declare the House resolved into the Committee of the       Whole House on the state of the Union for consideration of       the bill (H.R. 806) to facilitate efficient State       implementation of ground-level ozone standards, and for other       purposes. The first reading of the bill shall be dispensed       with. All points of order against consideration of the bill       are waived. General debate shall be confined to the bill and       shall not exceed one hour equally divided and controlled by       the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on       Energy and Commerce. After general debate the bill shall be       considered for amendment under the five-minute rule. In lieu       of the amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by       the Committee on Energy and Commerce now printed in the bill,       it shall be in order to consider as an original bill for the       purpose of amendment under the five-minute rule an amendment       in the nature of a substitute consisting of the text of Rules       Committee Print 115-26. That amendment in the nature of a       substitute shall be considered as read. All points of order       against that amendment in the nature of a substitute are       waived. No amendment to that amendment in the nature of a       substitute shall be in order except those printed in the       report of the Committee on Rules accompanying this       resolution. Each such amendment may be offered only in the       order printed in the report, may be offered only by a Member       designated in the report, shall be considered as read, shall       be debatable for the time specified in the report equally       divided and controlled by the proponent and an opponent,       shall not be subject to amendment, and shall not be subject       to a demand for division of the question in the House or in       the Committee of the Whole. All points of order against such       amendments are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of       the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report       the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been       adopted. Any Member may demand a separate vote in the House       on any amendment adopted in the Committee of the Whole to the       bill or to the amendment in the nature of a substitute made       in order as original text. The previous question shall be       considered as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to       final passage without intervening motion except one motion to       recommit with or without instructions.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 1  hour.    Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Polis),  pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Polis),  pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Texas?   There was no objection.                                time  1230     Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 451 provides for a  structured rule to consider a bill out of the Energy and Commerce  Committee pertaining to the Environmental Protection Agency's ozone  standards. The rule provides for 1 hour of debate equally divided  between the majority and the minority on the Energy and Commerce  Committee. The rule further makes in order six Democratic amendments  for consideration. Finally, the minority is afforded the customary  motion to recommit.   Under the Clean Air Act's National Ambient Air Quality Standards  program, the EPA is tasked with setting standards and regulations for  certain defined pollutants, including ground-level ozone, commonly  referred to as smog. The Environmental Protection Agency has set these  standards and adjusted when necessary in 1971, 1979, 1997, and 2008.   Since 1980, ozone levels have declined by 33 percent, according to  the EPA, thanks in large part to diligent State oversight of industries  and planning, along with weather patterns and outside temperatures,  which all contribute to ozone levels.   Ozone has been a particular issue in the north Texas area that I  represent, where hot summer days and prevailing southerly breezes cause  air quality issues that affect outdoor activities and may create health  concerns.   In 2015, the EPA proposed changing the 2008 ozone standards that had  not yet been fully implemented, despite nearly 700 national, State, and  local organizations and stakeholders requesting that the EPA allow the  2008 standards to be adopted before moving the goalposts on these  regulated parties. In fact, the EPA did not publish its implementation  regulations for the 2008 standards until March of 2015, nearly 7 years  after the standards had been issued, and then promptly that same year  decided to change the rules entirely.   The EPA ignored the request from stakeholders and moved ahead with  lowering the ozone standard, manipulating scientific findings in order  to justify the move. In fact, nearly two-thirds of the so-called  benefits that the EPA claimed would result from this new standard are  not based on ozone reductions at all, but instead on reductions from an  entirely different pollutant regulated under a different set of rules.   H.R. 806, the Ozone Standards Implementation Act of 2017, is an  important step toward focusing the EPA's efforts at science-based  regulating of the environment and a rejection of the politically  motivated actions of the previous 8 years.   The legislation phases in implementation of the 2008 and 2015 ozone  standards, extending the date for final designation for the 2015  standard to 2025, aligning the permitting requirements of the Clean Air  Act with the implementation schedule set by the EPA. This allows for a  thoughtful and methodical implementation process to proceed at the  State level to address the varied needs and nuances that exist in the  States based upon industry and based upon weather patterns.  [[Page H5928]]    The measured approach contained in H.R. 806 will allow States to  pursue cost-effective and practical implementation plans to enforce the  EPA's ozone standards. Further, it utilizes a process that will benefit  from the States' practical experiences at implementing previous ozone  standards.   Nothing in the legislation before the House today changes any  existing air quality standards or regulations. Let me say that again.  Nothing in the legislation before the House today changes any existing  air quality standards or regulations.   This legislation is focused solely on providing States and businesses  the proper tools, time, and flexibility to implement the EPA's  regulations most effectively. This is a goal we should all support.   According to the EPA's own analysis in 2015, the vast majority of  U.S. counties will meet the 2015 standards by 2025, the same timeframe  that the bill before us contemplates implementation.   H.R. 806 is important, however, because it gives States the  flexibility to focus on the most pressing environmental issues in each  individual State, rather than having the EPA dictate where resources  must be used regardless of need.   The Energy and Commerce Committee has been reviewing the issue of  finding the correct balance for ozone implementation for years and has  crafted legislation that reflects that measured approach.   In 2015, I wrote to the EPA's Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee  expressing my concern over the EPA's expedited implementation of the  2015 standards despite concerns on how the ozone rules could affect  other pollutants, namely nitrogen oxide, which has been found to  actually increase inversely when ozone levels decrease. This increase  of nitrogen oxide is especially present in urban environments where  many at-risk populations live.   Given the many implementation questions surrounding EPA's political  decision to move forward with the 2015 standards, H.R. 806 is a prudent  and justified course that this government should be taking.   For these reasons, I encourage my colleagues to support today's rule  and the underlying bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute.   Mr. Speaker, I want to reference a letter that I sent on May 23,  2014, to Dr. Christopher Frey, who was then the chairman of the EPA  Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee.   The letter reads:   ``I understand that, due in part to recommendations by the Clean Air  Scientific Advisory Committee, EPA's new draft Health Risk and Exposure  Assessment for Ozone concludes that''--I am quoting from the EPA here-- `` `mortality from short- and long-term ozone exposures and respiratory  hospitalization risk is not greatly affected by meeting lower  standards.' ''   Again, that is from the EPA draft of the Health Risk and Exposure  Assessment for Ozone, from May of 2014.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the letter.   [[Page H5932]]                                       Congress of the United States,                                        House of Representatives,                                                       May 23, 2014.      Dr. H. Christopher Frey,      Chair, EPA Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee,           Distinguished University Professor, Department of Civil,           Construction, and Environmental Engineering, North           Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC.        Dear Dr. Frey: In January 2015, pursuant to a court imposed       deadline, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is       expected to propose revisions to the current National Ambient       Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for ozone set in 2008. The       agency's proposed revisions may well represent the most       costly standards the agency has ever sought to impose on the       U.S. economy. The Administrator's judgments about the       adequacy of the standard and any such proposed revisions       accordingly will be subject to close Congressional oversight       and scrutiny. A critical question will concern whether the       Administrator has fully and clearly evaluated the risk       reduction estimates associated with the standard and proposed       alternatives.        The Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee's (CASAC) by       statute serves to review the information supporting EPA's       assessment of the existing NAAQS for ozone and to help assure       that EPA conducts a full and objective evaluation of risks       and risk tradeoffs in its proposals. In the context of this       review, given the potential costs and impacts of any revision       to the current standard, I believe it is critically important       that such risks and risk tradeoffs are fully evaluated.        Presently, EPA appears to be moving forward without fully       addressing important risk tradeoff questions regarding the       impact of emissions reductions of nitrogen oxides       (NOX), which CASAC has also been reviewing, on       ozone concentrations. I write today to draw your attention to       concerns that have been raised that EPA has not fully       evaluated the risk reduction outcomes identified in the       agency's risk assessments used for the upcoming proposed       rule.        I understand that, due in part to recommendations by CASAC,       EPA's new draft Health Risk and Exposure Assessment for Ozone       (HREA) concludes that ``mortality from short- and long-term       [ozone] exposures and respiratory hospitalization risk is not       greatly affected by meeting lower standards.'' According to       the HREA, this is due in part to the fact that further       reductions in nitrogen oxides (NOX) emissions will       actually increase ozone levels on low concentration days in       urban areas where at-risk populations live.        For instance, in modeling a 50 percent reduction in       NOX emissions from existing levels, the HREA found       that April-to-October ozone exposures actually increased for       large percentages of exposed populations in several major       urban areas where at-risk populations are likely to live,       including New York, Detroit, Los Angeles, and Chicago. In       other words, even though reducing NOX emissions       may yield direct benefits by reducing NOX related       health effects, they may also lead to increased ozone       levels--the issue under review by the CASAC Ozone Review       Panel.        If EPA is correct to assume that all ozone exposures should       be of concern, any increases in ozone exposure throughout the       year are important to assess. However, testimony submitted to       CASAC this past March notes that EPA's analysis likely       underestimates the potential for increases in ozone exposures       because the agency does not evaluate the effect of       NOX emission reductions on ozone levels throughout       the full year. Specifically, EPA's analysis of       epidemiologically-based short-term mortality and morbidity       risks fails to consider the likely increases in ozone levels       during the cooler months of the year when NOX       emissions are reduced. This March testimony reported that       such a full year-round analysis of the impact of       NOX emission reductions in urban Philadelphia       resulted in increases in total ozone exposures.        The EPA's analysis itself notes that wintertime increases       in ozone ``were significant in 11 out of the 15 areas''       evaluated when nationwide NOX emissions were cut       ``almost in half,'' but fails to address how increases in       wintertime ozone levels from further NOX       reductions will affect the proposed health benefits of       meeting a lower ozone standard. Potential changes in       wintertime ozone levels also pose a problem for EPA's       assessment of mortality risks from long-term exposure to       ozone.        In light of these shortcomings in analysis, we ask that you       recommend that EPA conduct a full year-round analysis of the       effect of further NOX emission reductions on the       epidemiologically-based, short-term mortality and morbidity       health benefits front meeting a lower ozone standard. This       should be done in a manner that clearly distinguishes between       exposure changes projected for urban, suburban, and rural       portions of each of the Urban Study Areas. In addition, EPA       should provide a discussion of the limitations of projecting       future mortality risks from long-term exposure given that the       epidemiological study used did not account for potential       differences in wintertime ozone levels.        Finally, I understand that transcripts of your public       proceedings may not always be preserved for future public       access and review. If this is the case, I ask that you ensure       that CASAC preserve a full transcript or recording of the       telephone conference and related public deliberations for       future public access and review.        Thank you for your attention to this request.            Sincerely,                                           Michael C. Burgess, M.D.     Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter that was sent by  Representative Joe Barton, who was then the ranking member on the  Energy and Commerce Committee, and myself, as the ranking member of the  Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee, June 11, 2010, asking for  the economic data that the EPA was supposed to provide regarding their  proposed rule changes back in 2010.                                           House of Representatives,                                Committee on Energy and Commerce,                                      Washington, DC, June 11, 2010.      Hon. Lisa Jackson,      Administrator, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency,      Washington, DC.        Dear Administrator Jackson: While the President has       repeatedly stated that job creation and economic growth are       his top priorities, in the environmental arena it appears the       Administration is allowing ideology to trump objective       science and sound public policy, and is issuing new rules       that will significantly impede economic development and       growth throughout the United States, In particular, we are       concerned that the Administration, through the Environmental       Protection Agency (EPA), is promulgating a whole host of       unworkable, multi-billion dollar environmental regulations       without fully considering all available scientific       information, and without regard to, the realistic compliance       costs, job impacts, or the ability of states, municipalities       and/or businesses to implement the new regulations.        In the past we have expressed very serious concerns about       the Administration's global warming regulations and EPA's       process for developing its endangerment finding, the agency's       highly expedited issuance of that finding, and the agency's       reliance on the scientific assessments of outside groups,       including the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on       Climate Change (IPCC), without a  [[Page H5933]]       careful and critical examination of their conclusions and       findings. Further, we have significant concerns about the       potentially hundreds of billions of dollars or more in       compliance costs that are triggered by the finding, the over       6 million entities that may ultimately be subject to complex       new permitting requirements, potential enforcement actions,       fines and penalties, and threats of citizen suits and other       third-party litigation. EPA itself has acknowledged that the       stationary source permitting requirements triggered by the       endangerment finding are totally unworkable, and that it       would be administratively impossible for EPA and states to       administer those new requirements, or for employers and       businesses to comply.        We write today regarding another set of multi-billion       dollar regulations proposed by the Obama Administration which       also appear to be extraordinarily expensive and unworkable.       Specifically, in January 2010, EPA proposed new National       Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for ground-level ozone,       the main component of smog. NAAQS ozone standards have been       revised a number of times over the past several decades,       including in 1997 when EPA set an 8-hour ``primary'' ozone       standard, as well as an identical ``secondary'' standard, to       a level of 0.08 parts per million (ppm), or effectively 0.084       ppm. While EPA significantly strengthened that standard in       2008 to a level of 0.075 ppm, in January 2010 this       Administration took the unprecedented step of setting aside       the 2008 standards, and proposing its own alternative       standards based on the prior administrative record and a       ``provisional assessment,'' and without conducting a full       review of the currently available scientific and technical       information. EPA is now proposing a new primary ozone       standard within the range of 0.060-0.070 ppm, as well as a       distinct cumulative, seasonal secondary standard within the       range of 7-15 ppm-hours. EPA has also proposed an accelerated       implementation schedule.        We are very concerned about the proposed standards, not       only because there appear to be questions about the       development of the proposed standards, but also because EPA       estimates that the costs would range from $19 billion to $90       billion annually, or nearly a trillion dollars over ten       years. Moreover, it appears, based on EPA's own ozone maps       and estimates, that most counties in the country could       violate the standards, particularly if EPA chooses to set the       standard at the lower end of the proposed range. Further, it       also appears many areas of the country, including rural and       remote areas, could never be in attainment because the       standards are so low that they may exceed natural background       ozone levels, or ozone levels due to foreign emissions from       Asian or other sources.        We understand EPA plans to finalize the proposed ozone       standards by August 31, 2010. Before EPA finalizes such       standards, we believe your agency should provide the Congress       with fuller information about the EPA's process for       developing and proposing the new standards, the counties or       municipalities expected to be in violation, whether the new       standards can realistically be implemented by areas that have       higher ozone levels due to natural background ozone levels or       foreign emissions, and the potential restrictions that the       new standards will place on future economic growth and       development for non-attainment areas.        We request your responses to the following questions within       two weeks of the date of this letter:        1. Under Sections 108 and 109 of the Clean Air Act (CAA),       EPA is authorized to set NAAQS for certain criteria       pollutants, including ozone, and the Act sets out specific       procedures for revising those standards.        a. In proposing the new standards, why isn't EPA conducting       a full analysis of all available data, including more recent       data?        b. In proposing the standards, why isn't EPA following the       express procedures set forth in Section 109 of the CAA?        2. Under the Clinton Administration's 1997 ozone standards:        a. What types of measures have been required by state and       local governments to come into compliance with those       standards?        b. What were the estimated costs for compliance with the       1997 standards and how do those compare with estimated costs       for the proposed new standards?        c. What analysis, if any, did EPA conduct relating to the       potential impacts on employment of the 1997 standards?        d. What were EPA's projections with regard to attainment of       the 1997 standards, and approximately how many counties in       the United States have still not been able to come into       compliance?        e. What are the primary reasons for the inability of these       counties to come into compliance?        3. Under the Obama Administration's proposed ozone       standards, we understand that EPA projects, based on 2006-      2008 data, that of the 675 counties that currently monitor       ozone levels, 515 counties (76%) would violate a 0.070 ppm       standard, and 650 counties (96%) would violate a 0.060 ppm       standard.        a. Please identify the 515 counties that would violate a       0.070 ppm standard, and the expected time needed for       attainment.        b. Please identify the additional 135 counties that would       violate a 0.060 ppm standard, and the expected time needed       for attainment.        4. According to the attached map from EPA's Clean Air       Status Trends Network (CASTNET) 2008 Annual Report, it       appears many areas of the country that do not currently have       ozone monitors would also be likely to violate the new smog       standards, including in very rural and remote areas.        a. How many counties don't currently have ozone monitors?        b. Based on CASTNET data and any other data EPA may have       regarding ozone levels in non-monitored counties, how many       additional counties could be in violation of EPA's proposed       ozone standards if a monitor were present? Please identify       those counties using the CASTNET data and any other data       available, and the expected time needed for attainment.        c. Would there be areas with monitored air quality that       attain the proposed standards but that might nevertheless be       considered to be in ``nonattainment'' because they are in a       Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area (CMSA) in which       one monitor or more exceeds the proposed standards?        5. According to the EPA Fact Sheet for the Obama       Administration's proposed ozone standards, the implementation       costs range from $19 to $90 billion annually while EPA       projects the value of the health benefits would range from       $13 to $100 billion per year.        a. What are the primary studies EPA is relying upon in the       development of its health benefits estimates? What are the       major uncertainties in those studies that could affect the       estimates?        b. How many of the health-based studies included in the       criteria document for the proposed ozone standards were based       on statistically significant evidence compared to those       studies that were not?        c. How many of the new health-based studies included in the       provisional assessment for the proposed ozone standards were       based on statistically significant evidence compared to those       studies that were not?        d. Can EPA provide any assurances that the value of the       health benefits will outweigh the implementation costs?        6. Under the Obama Administration's proposed ozone       standards, what control requirements, including offsets,       transportation planning measure or other measures, may apply       to nonattainment areas?        a. It appears the proposed standards would create a       significant number of new nonattainment areas in the Western       United States. How would nonattainment in rural or remote       Western states and tribal lands be addressed?        b. In the event that an area fails to attain any new       standards by the applicable date, what would be the potential       consequences, including any sanctions or penalties?        c. What will happen to states or localities that cannot       come into compliance with the proposed standards because of a       lack of economically or technically feasible technology       necessary to attain compliance?        d. What will happen to states or localities that have       natural background ozone levels, and/or ozone levels due to       transport from outside the United States, that are currently       close to or exceed the new standards?        i. Will such areas be designated as being in nonattainment?        ii. Will EPA require states or localities to attain       standards lower than concentrations below the non-      controllable background levels?        7. Given, as EPA recognizes, that there would be many new       nonattainment areas, does EPA believe it is realistic to       require states to provide recommendations to EPA by January       7, 2011? Is it reasonable to require State Implementation       Plans by December 2013?        a. If EPA believes these deadlines are realistic, please       explain the basis for that conclusion.        8. Does EPA anticipate requiring separate planning       requirements for a seasonable secondary standard if one is       adopted as proposed? How does EPA plan to implement this type       of secondary standard?        9. Has EPA prepared any analyses of the potential       employment impacts of the proposed standards on specific       sectors of the economy, including the manufacturing and       construction sectors? If yes, please provide copies of such       analyses.        10. Has EPA prepared any analyses of the potential       relocation of production facilities outside the United States       as a result of implementation of the proposed standards?

Should you have any questions, please contact Minority       Committee staff.            Sincerely,      Joe Barton,        Ranking Member.      Michael Burgess,        Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Oversight and       Investigations.     Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute.   Mr. Speaker, it is ironic that the gentleman would reference the cost  of asthma inhalers. It was, after all, two Congresses ago where the  Environmental Protection Agency actually outlawed the manufacture and  sale of over-the-counter asthma inhalers and took them away from those  of us who suffer from that disease. And, indeed, losing that over-the- counter option for an over-the-counter epinephrine inhaler for the  treatment of asthma as a rescue inhaler, we have, indeed, seen the cost  of prescription inhalers quadruple over that time frame.   So, in many ways, as an asthma patient, I hold the EPA directly  responsible for my inability to get an inexpensive over-the-counter  rescue inhaler. And for many asthma patients, who may find themselves  caught short, that means a trip to the emergency room and, probably, a  $1,200 or $1,500 event that otherwise could have been solved by a  Primatene inhaler that sold two for $16.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Will the gentleman yield?    Will the gentleman yield?    Will the gentleman yield?    Will the gentleman yield?    The reason is because the manufacture of over-the- counter epinephrine inhalers has been prohibited by the EPA and the  Food and Drug Administration.    Will the gentleman yield?    Will the gentleman yield?    Will the gentleman yield?    Number one, it is not germane, and it is more  complicated now because the Food and Drug Administration has gotten  involved in the process. I wish it were straightforward. It is  something I continue to work on.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, today's rule provides for the consideration of an  important piece of environmental legislation to protect the lives and  health of all Americans while providing smart tools to the States to  implement the EPA's standards.   I thank my fellow Texan, Pete Olson, for his work on this  legislation, which I know affects his district in the Houston area as  much as it does mine in the Dallas-Fort Worth region.   I encourage my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on today's rule and to  support the underlying bill.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Polis is as follows:              An Amendment to H. Res. 451 Offered by Mr. Polis         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections:        Sec. 2. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the       Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare       the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       2510) to amend the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to       authorize appropriations for State water pollution control       revolving funds, and for other purposes. The first reading of       the bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order against       consideration of the bill are waived. General debate shall be       confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure.       After general debate the bill shall be considered for       amendment under the five-minute rule. All points of order       against provisions in the bill are waived. At the conclusion       of consideration of the bill for amendment the Committee       shall rise and report the bill to the House with such       amendments as may have been adopted. The previous question       shall be considered as ordered on the bill and amendments       thereto to final passage without intervening motion except       one motion to recommit with or without instructions. If the       Committee of the Whole rises and reports that it has come to       no resolution on the bill, then on the next legislative day       the House shall, immediately after the third daily order of       business under clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into the       Committee of the Whole for further consideration of the bill.        Sec. 3. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 2510.                                   ____           The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous  question.   The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the ayes appeared to have it.
