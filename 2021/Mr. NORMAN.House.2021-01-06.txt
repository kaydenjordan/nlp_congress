 Madam Speaker, I rise today to support the foundation of  our democracy, the Constitution of the United States of America. This  document is the fabric and the solid foundation of a nation we call  America, which has been a beacon of hope and a shining city on the hill  for over 230 years.   The words of our Constitution, as spelled out in Article II, Section  1, are very clear when it comes to our elections: mandating, not  suggesting, not implying, but mandating that State legislatures, not  secretaries of State, not State commissions, not county officials, not  Governors, but State legislators prescribe the time, place, and manner  of holding elections.   This mandate was not followed in the great State of Pennsylvania. If  we allow this fraud to go on--in a football analogy, the moving of the  goalpost after the ball has been kicked and in the air--the preview of  coming attractions will be future elections that do not adhere to  honest and open voting by ``We the People'' and the loss of our great  Republic.   As a lady told me not long ago, don't spit in my face and tell me it  is raining. This is exactly what has happened to the American people in  this election. In the words of Winston Churchill, when Great Britain  was under siege by Germany, he said: There will be a  [[Page H103]]  time when doing your best is not good enough. We must do what is  required.   And we must do what is required to save this great Republic.
