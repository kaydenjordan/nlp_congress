 Mr. Speaker, the coronavirus pandemic, racial violence,  and the climate crisis have all highlighted systemic and pervasive  inequalities in our country, especially for Black communities and other  people of color. Racial, economic, and climate justice are  intrinsically linked.   As a member of the Select Committee on the Climate Crisis, I am  pleased to stand with my colleagues this morning to release our climate  action plan. It is centered on the principles of justice and equity  because all people deserve access to clean air, clean water, and a  planet free from toxic pollution.   After more than a year of hearings, round table discussions, and  feedback from people and groups across the country, we have a bold,  science-based, comprehensive plan to address the climate crisis. It  sets our Nation on a path to reach net-zero emissions no later than  mid-century and net-negative thereafter. Our plan focuses on the needs  of frontline communities, accelerating our transition to a 100 percent  clean-energy economy, and opportunities to create good-paying jobs.  Climate solutions are economic solutions.   The climate crisis is an existential threat, and we cannot wait to  act. In the Pacific Northwest, climate change is already our reality.  Raging wildfires each summer result in hazy skies, smoky conditions,  and hazardous air quality comparable to some of the most polluted  places on the planet. Decreased snowpack in the winter is upending the  outdoor recreation industry. Our ocean is absorbing carbon dioxide and  becoming more acidic, devastating commercial fisheries. Warmer water  temperatures in the Columbia River are further endangering salmon,  which are a fundamental part of the identity and culture of northwest  Tribes. Droughts and extreme weather jeopardize the livelihoods of our  specialty crop farmers who were already struggling to make ends meet.  Despite these conditions, there are reasons to remain hopeful.   As I travel across northwest Oregon, I have visited with constituents  who are already hard at work to protect our planet. At 46 North Farms  near the majestic Oregon coast, Teresa Retzlaff and her CSA members are  using dry farming practices to provide sustainable food and beautiful  flowers for their community. In Hillsboro, Oregon, First Tech Community  Credit Union constructed its headquarters out of cross-laminated  timber, which creates an airy and healthy workplace and is an example  of how we can reduce emissions with our choice of building materials  while helping to revitalize rural communities.   In Astoria, more than 100 people filled a community room on a Friday  afternoon to hear from scientists about how the climate crisis is  affecting the health of our ocean. TriMet and Portland General Electric  launched the region's first battery electric bus powered by 100 percent  renewable wind energy.   In Portland, workers at Vigor constructed a massive wave energy buoy  that was deployed off the coast of Hawaii to capture the power of our  ocean in generating clean energy.   And to mark the 50th anniversary of Earth Day, I joined environment  and labor leaders to discuss a green road to recovery that creates  good-paying jobs. These examples, and so many more, informed our work  on the select committee.  [[Page H2677]]    Our climate action plan is a comprehensive road map for Congress to  build a healthy, resilient, and just America. By enacting our  recommendations, we would achieve net-zero carbon pollution by no later  than mid-century, save more than 60,000 lives each year from reduced  air pollution, and generate health and climate benefits that would help  save close to $8 trillion.   I am also pleased to see many of our recommendations, included in  H.R. 2, the Moving Forward Act.   As a leader on the Education and Labor Committee and the  granddaughter of a coal miner, I know the way we transition to a clean  energy economy and support workers is as important as the transition  itself.                                time  0915    At a time when more than 47 million workers are unemployed, our  recovery package must focus on creating and restoring good-paying jobs.  We have the opportunity to incorporate investment in climate resilience  and clean energy in the process.   As co-chair of the House Oceans Caucus and the Congressional Estuary  Caucus, I am pleased that our climate action plan recognizes the power  of the ocean to be part of the solution.   The climate action plan calls for the conservation of at least 30  percent of our ocean by 2030 to help preserve and protect blue carbon  ecosystems that can help serve as a natural climate solution by  absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.   Our plan provides solutions to protect the planet and make it more  resilient for future generations. It will result in communities and an  economy that is stronger, healthier, and fairer.   Now, we must turn this roadmap into action.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Chair Castor and the select committee staff for  their tireless work.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman DeFazio for his  leadership.   Long-term investments in transportation and infrastructure create  good-paying jobs and drive commerce. When  [[Page H2947]]  we rebuild systems in a sustainable and resilient manner, we reduce  carbon emissions, improve energy efficiency, and support vulnerable  communities.   I am very pleased that the Moving Forward Act includes many of the  recommendations of the Select Committee on Climate Crisis to invest in  transit and zero-emission buses, electric vehicle charging stations,  pedestrian and bike infrastructure, and predisaster mitigation.   As a member of the Education and Labor Committee, I am also glad that  H.R. 2 includes the Reopen and Rebuild America's Schools Act and  childcare infrastructure funding. Schools and childcare facilities  across the country are in desperate need of repairs to protect the  health and safety of students and staff.    In northwest Oregon, it is not a question of if but when we will have  a significant earthquake, and so I am very grateful that this bill  specifically provides funding for schools vulnerable to seismic natural  disasters.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman DeFazio and his hardworking staff.
