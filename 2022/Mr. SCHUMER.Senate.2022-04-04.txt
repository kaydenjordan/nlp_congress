 I ask unanimous consent that I be recognized at 5 p.m.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.   The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.   (Mr. HICKENLOOPER assumed the Chair.)    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, this week, the U.S. Senate will commence  the final stage--the final stage--of confirming Judge Ketanji Brown  Jackson as the 116th Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court.   It is a joyous and history-making moment for the Senate as 115  individuals have come before this Chamber for consideration to the  highest Court in the land, but none--none--were like Judge Jackson.  Like many before her, she is brilliant; she is esteemed and highly  accomplished, but never--never before--has the Supreme Court had a  Black woman bear the title of ``Justice,'' and she will pave the way  for others to follow in her example.   Not long from now, the Senate Judiciary Committee will conclude their  markup of Judge Jackson's nomination by voting to report her out of  committee. Chairman Durbin has adjusted the schedule to make sure all  members are able to vote, but the process is moving forward. There is  no question--no question--that Judge Jackson deserves a strong  bipartisan vote in committee; but, sadly, despite the judge's  qualifications, the Republicans on the committee have made clear that  not one of them will vote to report her out of committee.   If the Judiciary Committee does reach a deadlocked vote later today,  I will move as soon as I can to have the Senate hold a discharge vote  so that her nomination can be considered by the full Senate.   It is obvious, in listening to Republicans, that their objections are  entirely unserious. Many who label Judge Jackson as ``radical'' and  ``far left'' today conveniently ignore that she received bipartisan  support not once, not twice, but three times in this Chamber, including  by voice vote. They also fail to mention that Judge Jackson commands  strong support from across the political spectrum, from conservative  judges to the Nation's largest police unions to a long list of former  colleagues who say she is nothing short of the best of the best.   Republicans in committee have ignored, in other words, the plain  facts of Judge Jackson's record, and that is deeply disappointing.  Judge Jackson is a brilliant and historic nominee, and her elevation as  the first Black woman to the U.S. Supreme Court should bring the Senate  together.   Let's be clear: Despite Republican opposition, Judge Jackson has  enough votes to get confirmed to the Supreme Court on a bipartisan  basis. The Senate is going to keep working until she is confirmed.   Once Judge Jackson is out of committee, I will file cloture on her  nomination as quickly as possible and, in doing so, set in motion a  process that will set up a final confirmation vote by the end of this  week. I hope both sides can work together to advance her all-but- certain confirmation through the Senate without delay.   Once again, I want to finish by commending Judge Jackson for  conducting herself brilliantly and unassailably during the entire  confirmation process. It is not easy to be thrown suddenly and abruptly  into the national spotlight and have every detail of your life  scrutinized. It is even harder to then  [[Page S1922]]  engage in marathon sitdowns with nearly every Senator in this body in  just a few weeks, and it is nothing short of herculean to endure 3 days  of lengthy and, at times, deeply unfair and mendacious questioning  before the Judiciary Committee--with the eyes of the Nation upon you.   But 6 weeks after her nomination was announced, Judge Jackson has  proven that she is up to the task before her. She has shown that she  merits the title of ``Justice,'' and from this moment on, the Senate  will not stop working until we finish the work of confirming Judge  Jackson to the U.S. Supreme Court.                          Business Before the Senate    Now, Mr. President, on other Senate business, this week, the  confirmation of Judge Jackson to the Supreme Court remains the highest  Senate priority by far, but Senate Democrats will continue our work to  lower costs for the American people.   Last week--little noticed but quite important--the Senate passed  bipartisan ocean shipping reform, spearheaded by Senators Klobuchar and  Thune and Cantwell. This is very significant and much-needed  legislation that will reduce costs for the American people by  unclogging our ports from Los Angeles to New York to Savannah to  Seattle. These backlogs have caused not only great harm for American  exporters trying to send their products out in the world; it has also  skyrocketed the price of goods coming into the country, and,  ultimately, American consumers pay that price. I commend my colleagues  for getting this important bill done.   This week, the Senate is also close to entering a conference  committee with the House to finalize our jobs and competitiveness act;  and tomorrow, Chair Cantwell will turn the focus of the Commerce  Committee to an urgent matter for the American people: ensuring  transparency in petroleum markets.   We all know that big oil companies are dramatically expanding  corporate stock buybacks and reporting record profits while Americans  struggle with higher gas prices. Just today--this is so confounding, so  upsetting--ExxonMobil indicated that its profits this quarter will be  its highest since 2008. And what are they going to do with this surplus  cash? They announced, in the coming months, they will spend $10 billion  on corporate stock buybacks. According to Bloomberg, oil and gas  companies' stock buybacks were up 2,000 percent in the fourth quarter  of last year. Using that to enhance worker productivity? Nope. Using  that to do something some people might object to, increasing  exploration for oil and gas? Nope. Lining the pockets of their  shareholders and their corporate executives in stock buybacks, which do  nothing--absolutely nothing--to advance the American economy or to deal  with the oil prices.    Maybe they should think instead of giving the money to shareholders,  they should give money to their customers, give it back, by lowering  the price.   It is the latest reminder of a disturbing trend with the oil and gas  companies. As the price of gas goes up and as Americans are struggling  more and more to keep up, the Nation's largest oil companies are up to  their eyeballs in massive profits and then use that money for  unproductive stock buybacks, which, if anything, increase income  inequality at a time when the country needs to decrease it.   There is something deeply incongruous and wrong about seeing the  largest oil companies and gas companies in the world drench top  executives and wealthy shareholders in cash while Americans are  struggling at the pump. I thank Chair Cantwell for holding tomorrow's  hearing so we can provide accountability, transparency, and relief,  hopefully, for the American people.                                 Coronavirus    Mr. President, finally, on COVID. Very briefly, over the last few  days, my Democratic colleagues and I continue talks with Senator Romney  and Republicans, working all hours of the night and into the weekend. I  will have more to say on this matter shortly.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, pursuant to S. Res. 27, the Judiciary  Committee being tied on the question of reporting, I move to discharge  the Judiciary Committee from further consideration of Ketanji Brown  Jackson, of the District of Columbia, to be an Associate Justice of the  Supreme Court of the United States.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, in a few moments, the Senate will begin  to make history this week by voting to discharge the nomination of  Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson out of the Judiciary Committee so we can  confirm her as the next Associate Justice of the Supreme Court.   This procedural step should be entirely unnecessary. There is no  question--no question--that Judge Jackson deserves a strong bipartisan  vote in committee, but sadly, despite the judge's qualifications, not a  single Republican on the committee voted to report her out of  committee.   So we shouldn't have to be taking this step, but we are moving  forward all the same without delay. Despite Republicans opposing her in  committee and despite this procedural vote tonight, the end result will  remain unchanged: Judge Jackson ultimately has enough support to get  confirmed on a bipartisan basis, and the Senate is going to keep  working until this nomination is complete.   In closing, I want to emphasize something I said earlier today. This  is a joyous and history-making moment for the Senate--a historic one.  One hundred fifteen individuals have come before this Chamber for  consideration to the highest Court in the land, but none--none--were  like Judge Jackson. Like many before her, Judge Jackson is brilliant.  She is esteemed. She is highly accomplished. But never, never has the  Supreme Court had a Black woman bear the title of ``Justice.''   Imagine the impact this will have on our democracy. Imagine what it  will mean for young people across the country to look at our courts and  see them better reflect our Nation's makeup. Judge Jackson's brilliant  record will surely light a fire of inspiration for others to follow in  her footsteps, and our country will be all the better for it.  [[Page S1930]]    So let us move forward with this brilliant, this resoundingly  qualified, this historic nominee to the highest Court in the land, and  let us work together to finish the job of confirming the judge by the  end of this week.                         Vote on Motion to Discharge    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all time remaining be  yielded back, and I ask for the yeas and nays.    Madam President, pursuant to S. Res. 27, the Banking  Committee being tied on the question of reporting, I move to discharge  the Banking Committee from further consideration of Julia Ruth Gordon,  of Maryland, to be an Assistant Secretary of Housing and Urban  Development.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that at a time  to be determined by the majority leader, in consultation with the  Republican leader, that the Senate proceed to executive session to  consider Calendar No. 783, James C. O'Brien, of Nebraska, to be Head of  the Office of Sanctions Coordination, with the rank of Ambassador; that  there be 30 minutes for debate equally divided in the usual form on the  nomination; and that upon the use or yielding back of time, the Senate  vote without intervening action or debate on the nomination.    I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to  legislative session and be in a period of morning business, with  Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I have one request for committees to meet  during today's session of the Senate. They have the approval of the  Majority and Minority Leaders.   Pursuant to Rule XXVI, paragraph 5(a), of the Standing Rules of the  Senate, the following committees are authorized to meet during today's  session of the Senate:                          COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY    The Committee on the Judiciary is authorized to meet during the  session of the Senate on Monday, April 4, 2022, at 10 a.m., to conduct  an executive business meeting.                            ____________________     Finally, Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that  when the Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m.  on Tuesday, April 5; that following the prayer and pledge, the morning  hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date,  the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the  day, and morning business be closed; that upon conclusion of morning  business, the Senate proceed to executive session to resume  consideration of the motion to discharge the Gordon nomination; that at  10:30 a.m., the Senate vote on the motion to discharge and that,  following the vote, the Senate resume legislative session; further,  that the Senate recess from 12:30 p.m. until 2:15 p.m. to allow for the  weekly caucus meetings; finally, that if any nominations are confirmed  during Tuesday's session of the Senate, the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table and the President be  immediately notified of the Senate's action.    Madam President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask that it stand adjourned under the previous  order, following the remarks of Senator Portman.
