 Madam President, today, we learned that America has  lost a trailblazing leader with the passing of Colin Powell.   It is hard to imagine a more quintessentially American story: A son  of Jamaican immigrants who learned Yiddish from his boyhood neighbors  in the Bronx becomes a four-star general in the U.S. Army and serves  four Presidential administrations, including as National Security  Advisor, the youngest ever Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and  the first Black Secretary of State.   As a young officer, General Powell rendered brave and distinguished  service on the frontlines. As a senior leader, he helped four  Presidents protect our Nation, represent us on the world stage, and  chart our course through uncertain and turbulent times that included  the dawn of a new century and the beginning of our global war on  terrorists, who will not leave America alone even if we leave them  alone.   Today, we remember and honor a man who truly dedicated his entire  life to serving his country.
