 Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the distinguished gentleman,  Mr. Newhouse, for giving me the time.   Mr. Speaker, it is true that, from time to time, the Rules Committee  does need to take the authority and the responsibility that they have,  and the distinguished gentleman from Massachusetts will soon learn this  next year as I assume he will assume that role as the new chairman of  the Rules Committee.   In fact, the arguments that are being made today relate to the  substance of the bill. The bill that is at hand is very important, and  that is the farm bill, the farm bill that we know has a 10-year window,  that is net neutral, that protects the balances that we have talked  about.   But it updates not only the opportunities for people who were in  rural areas to update that policy, but it reinvigorates our  establishment by this House, and the United States Senate, that has  already handled this bill, and the President, to reassert that which  they believe is important; and that is, the men and women who live in  the rural areas, the men and women who get up at 4 o'clock in the  morning; men and women who are there protecting the grass roots, the  soil, the topsoil of this country. We need them to serve not only this  Nation but the world.   It is true that hemp was added. Mr. Comer, who is a Member of  Congress from Kentucky, last year began engaging me on this issue. We  agreed that we would put it in. It is an important agricultural product  and will aid and help very much so, not only a marketplace, but farmers  in Kentucky and other places.                                time  1315    As it relates to the Authorization for Use of Military Force, AUMF, I  would like to tell my colleagues that, in fact, I did make that  decision that we would include by not allowing, not debate, but a vote  that would take place on this floor.    Mr. Speaker, so what we are going to do is, we are  going to have a classified briefing tomorrow that will further allow  debate based upon the facts of the case. Mr. Speaker, I assure you that  we will be here all next week, and if the facts of the case warrant, we  will address the issue then.
