 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 5, line 9, before the semicolon, insert ``and the       percentage of such individuals whose employment is in an area       that matches their previous training and work experience''.    The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 396, the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Krishnamoorthi) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I rise in support of my bipartisan amendment. I would like to thank  my good friend, Congressman Lloyd Smucker of Pennsylvania, for helping  me to introduce this amendment.   Right now what is being taught in classes doesn't necessarily align  with what is needed to get a job. Yesterday, the House passed a  bipartisan bill unanimously that would make sure that there is stronger  alignment and collaboration between career and technical education  programs and the employers that will be hiring.   Our amendment would require that States report the percentage of  subsidized individuals whose jobs match their previous experience.  Incentivizing States that opt into this pilot program expands on  yesterday's bill to ensure that resources are being used as efficiently  as possible by guiding students towards the jobs they were trained for.   Mr. Chairman, I hope everybody will support passage of our amendment,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for his support.   I urge all Members to support this amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.   The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman  from Illinois (Mr. Krishnamoorthi).   The question was taken; and the Chair announced that the ayes  appeared to have it.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.   The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on  the amendment offered by the gentleman from Illinois will be postponed.                   Amendment No. 5 Offered by Mr. Davidson    The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 5 printed in  House Report 115-187.
