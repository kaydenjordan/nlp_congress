 Mr. Speaker, I have always been a strong ally of the  disability community and have paid close attention to the concerns many  have had with this rule.   I'm proud to have been the lead sponsor of the Americans with  Disabilities Act in 1990,  [[Page H907]]  which opened doors of independence, access, opportunity, and equity for  millions of Americans with differing abilities.   In Congress, Democrats have put forward commonsense gun safety laws  that would prevent violent and dangerous individuals with mental  disabilities from purchasing firearms. However, the Republican-led  Congress would not allow even a vote on such legislation.   President Obama took a series of limited steps within his authority,  one of which was this rule, whose aim has been to prevent those who  shouldn't have guns from obtaining them. I believe that, absent action  from Congress to enhance our background check system, this rule  represents an imperfect but necessary step.   It is imperfect because it stigmatizes the disability community  unfairly and needs a stronger appeals process to protect the rights of  those who fall under its purview. I disagree with the premise that  having a mental disability that precludes independent management of  one's finances correlates with a heightened risk of violence. I have  read the rule and recognize that it was written in a narrow way so that  it applies only to those with severe mental illnesses.   I've had many discussions over the past several days with leaders in  the disability community. I've grappled with the very difficult  questions this resolution poses and ultimately decided that, given  these circumstances, the best step right now is to oppose this  resolution.   I look forward to working closely with the disability community and  gun safety advocates to push for Congress to take up legislation that  keeps all Americans safe from gun violence while protecting the rights  of those with differing abilities.
