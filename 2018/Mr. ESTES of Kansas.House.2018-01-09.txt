 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 4578) to authorize certain counter terrorist  networks activities of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and for  other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4578         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Counter Terrorist Network       Act''.       SEC. 2. DUTY TO COUNTER TERRORIST NETWORKS; DETAILS AND                     ASSIGNMENT.         Section 411 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C.       211) is amended--        (1) in subsection (g)(4)--        (A) in subparagraph (C)--        (i) in clause (vi), by striking ``and'' at the end;        (ii) by redesignating clause (vii) as clause (viii); and        (iii) by inserting after clause (vi) the following new       clause:        ``(vii) collaborate with appropriate agencies, including       Federal, State, local, tribal, and international entities, to       enhance border security through operations such as operations       that seek to disrupt and dismantle networks, including       foreign terrorist organizations (as such term is described in       section 219 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C.       1189)), that pose terrorist or other threats; and'';        (2) by redesignating subsections (p) through (r) as       subsections (q) through (s), respectively; and        (3) by inserting after subsection (o) the following new       subsection:        ``(p) Assignment of Personnel.--The Commissioner may detail       or otherwise assign personnel of U.S. Customs and Border       Protection to other appropriate agencies, including to serve       overseas in support of global information sharing partnership       operations in furtherance of enhancing border security,       including by preventing entry into the United States by       individuals known or suspected of being associated with a       network, including a foreign terrorist organization (as such       term is described in section 219 of the Immigration and       Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1189)), that poses terrorist or       other threats.''.       SEC. 3. BRIEFINGS.         The Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection       shall biannually brief the Committee on Homeland Security of       the House of Representatives and the Committee on Homeland       Security and Governmental Affairs of the Senate regarding       activities, during the prior six months, in furtherance of       clause (vii) of section 411(g)(4) of the Homeland Security       Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 211(g)(4)), as added by section 2 of       this Act. Such briefings may be provided in a classified       setting if the Commissioner determines such is appropriate.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and to include any extraneous material on the bill under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4578, the Counter Terrorist  Network Act.   The fine men and women in uniform at U.S. Customs and Border  Protection are tasked with an incredibly important mission. Every day,  they protect our Nation from transnational criminal organizations,  human traffickers, and terrorists who wish to exploit vulnerabilities  at our Nation's borders.   To execute this critical mission, the CBP has developed a cadre of  subject matter experts that are well versed in counternetwork  operations. These experts work tirelessly at our Nation's seaports,  airports, and land border crossings, honing their skills, stopping the  flow of illicit goods and people, and creating actionable intelligence.   Given the fact that the CBP is uniquely positioned on our Nation's  front line, it would seem expected that members of the CBP would have  the authority to participate in counternetwork activities that target  terrorists and transnational threats, both domestically and  internationally.  [[Page H41]]    However, this is not the case. Currently, the CBP lacks the statutory  authority to assign CBP personnel to specialized counternetwork details  and liaison assignments with a national security focus.   H.R. 4578 seeks to mitigate this deficiency by giving the  Commissioner of the CBP the statutory authority to assign personnel to  these specialized task forces and collaborate with appropriate Federal,  State, local, and Tribal entities to enhance border security operations  that focus on disrupting and dismantling transnational criminal  organizations and foreign terrorist networks.   By granting this authority to the Commissioner, the CBP's  collaborative efforts will result in enhanced information sharing and  an increase in intelligence-driven enforcement operations.   Lastly, H.R. 4578 requires the Commissioner to provide a report to  Congress within 6 months of enactment, substantially describing the  ongoing efforts to defeat threats posed by transnational criminal and  foreign terrorist groups.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Border and Maritime Security Subcommittee  Ranking Member Vela for introducing this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the law enforcement  community and to vote in favor of this important legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I, once again, urge my colleagues  to support H.R. 4578, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 4559) to conduct a global aviation security review,  and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4559         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Global Aviation System       Security Reform Act of 2017''.       SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and to include any extraneous material on the bill under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Katko for his leadership on this  important piece of legislation.   It is essential that we continue to improve aviation security in  order to stay ahead of the evolving threat posed by Islamist  terrorists. It is clear that terrorists around the world remain intent  on attacking aircraft.   That is why over the past year the Department of Homeland Security  and the Transportation Security Administration have worked to raise the  global level of aviation security. One area of potential improvement is  through working to increase security at overseas last point of  departure airports.   In October, I joined a bipartisan delegation of congressional members  from the House Homeland Security Committee to several of the largest  last point of departure airports, including Amman, Jordan; and  Frankfurt, Germany. We examined current threats to aviation security  and got to look at how our foreign partners have worked to stay ahead  of all the potential threats.   This legislation seeks to improve global aviation security standards  by directing the Administrator of the Transportation Security  Administration to conduct a comprehensive review of aviation security  implementation and challenges across the global aviation system. This  legislation will help improve coordination and outreach, both within  the United States Government and with foreign partners regarding  improvements to aviation security.   It makes sense for our security agencies to work with our foreign  allies who are facing the same security threat that we face. This  legislation will help the DHS locate and implement best practices,  which are being used overseas. The fight to protect travelers isn't one  that we face alone in America, and this threat isn't going to dissipate  anytime soon. That is why this legislation is focused on ensuring that  our agencies build partnerships and can learn from our foreign  partners.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill. One of the  things that we are seeing today, in an increasingly dangerous world, is  how do we face these threats and work together. This bill is intended  to help work to be more efficient across not just America but with our  allies in making our aviation travel more safe and secure.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 3202) to require the Secretary of Homeland Security  to submit a report on cyber vulnerability disclosures, and for other  purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3202         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Cyber Vulnerability       Disclosure Reporting Act''.       SEC. 2. REPORT ON CYBER VULNERABILITIES.         (a) Report.--Not later than 240 days after the date of the       enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Homeland Security       shall submit to the Committee on Homeland Security of the       House of Representatives and the Committee on Homeland       Security and Governmental Affairs of the Senate a report that       contains a description of the policies and procedures       developed for coordinating cyber vulnerability disclosures,       in accordance with section 227(m) of the Homeland Security       Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 148(m)). To the extent possible, such       report shall include an annex with information on instances       in which such policies and procedures were used to disclose       cyber vulnerabilities in the year prior to the date such       report is required and, where available, information on the       degree to which such information was acted upon by industry       and other stakeholders. Such report may also contain a       description of how the Secretary is working with other       Federal entities and critical infrastructure owners and       operators to prevent, detect, and mitigate cyber       vulnerabilities.        (b) Form.--The report required under subsection (b) shall       be submitted in unclassified form but may contain a       classified annex.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and include any extraneous material on the bill under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3202, the Cyber Vulnerability  Disclosure Reporting Act.   It is hard to find an electronic device today that doesn't connect to  the internet. From smartphones to alarm clocks, everything is part of  the Internet of Things. Americans can do everything, from personal  banking to unlocking the front door, with the palm of their hands.   As the world has become increasingly interconnected, vulnerabilities  in computer code underlying these devices and the applications they run  can often expose the average American to exploitation by hackers,  criminals, and even bad actors from nation states.   As more and more critical and personal information is being stored on  the internet and more industrial systems are being operated  autonomously, it is vital that we are able to plug the holes in  vulnerable technology.   It seems like every day we read about another data breach that could  have been prevented if only the company had known about a vulnerability  in the product or network, occurrences such as the WannCry ransomware  that affected hundreds of thousands of computers in more than 150  countries, and the recently reported meltdown that could affect  millions of personal computers throughout the world. That is why, in  this world of ever-increasing intrusions, we must do our best to make  sure our computer systems are as invulnerable to attack as possible.   The Department of Homeland Security was given the authority by the  Cybersecurity Act of 2015 to improve cybersecurity in the United States  through enhanced sharing of information about cybersecurity threats.   The Homeland Security Act of 2002 allows the Secretary to coordinate  with industry to develop departmental policies and procedures for  coordinating the disclosure of cyber vulnerabilities as described in  the Vulnerabilities Equities Policy and Process published by the White  House on November 15, 2016. This disclosure is important, as it  highlights vulnerabilities and allows the public and private sector to  work to prevent and mitigate cyber threats.   H.R. 3202, the Cyber Vulnerability Disclosure Reporting Act, is an  important tool, in that it requires the Secretary of Homeland Security  to submit a report to Congress on their policies and procedures for  disclosing vulnerabilities.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I once again urge my colleagues to support this bill.  With an ever-increasing reliance on technology today, we need to make  sure that it is secure and safe for us to use and that the  vulnerabilities are addressed so that we can maintain a safe and secure  environment.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
