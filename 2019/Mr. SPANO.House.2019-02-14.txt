 Mr. Speaker, 28 years ago today was a very good day. In  fact, it was one of the best days of my life. You see, it was the day  that Amie Sue Wurzel said yes. She said yes to my clumsy marriage  proposal.   Since then, we have been through a lot together. We raised four kids,  completed undergraduate school and law school, moved eight times,  started and grew a business, grieved the death of her brother and my  father, struggled through my significant health challenges, and won six  elections.   I loved her back then, but the days, months, and years of shared  heartache, struggle, laughter, sickness, joy, commitment, and  faithfulness have caused my love for her to grow stronger and deeper  than my words can possibly express.   She has put up with and even supported my crazy ideas and dreams,  even when they have required great sacrifice for her and for our  family.   On this Valentine's Day, Amie Sue, even though we are apart, I need  you to know and understand how grateful I am that you said yes and how  very much I love you.                            ____________________
