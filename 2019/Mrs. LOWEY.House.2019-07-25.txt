 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3877.   For months, House Democrats have insisted on raising unworkable  budget caps so Congress can responsibly fund our government and uphold  our commitments to American families.   Unless Congress and the President act, the United States will face  $125 billion in devastating cuts that will hurt American families and  weaken our national security.   That is why this bipartisan legislation to avoid this fiscal cliff is  so critical. It thoroughly rejects the President's slash-and-burn  budget proposal, which would have pulled the rug out from under  families and communities by decimating initiatives and services that  make a real difference in people's lives.   Instead of reckless cuts, Democrats were successful in securing the  largest-ever increase in base funding above sequestration levels. With  these more reasonable budget caps, we can undertake an orderly  appropriations process to invest in critical domestic priorities for  the people.   While this bipartisan deal represents a compromise, I am proud that  it ends the senseless austerity of the Budget Control Act once and for  all.   I urge support for this legislation, so that we can help give every  American a better chance at a better life.                                time  1415
