 Mr. President, I rise today to honor a great  advocate for the Mississippi River. After a distinguished career of  public service at the Army Corps of Engineers and the National Park  Service, Dr. John Anfinson will retire at the end of this month from  his position as superintendent of Minnesota's Mississippi National  River and Recreation Area.   During my time as a board member for Friends of the Mississippi  River, I saw firsthand Dr. Anfinson's tireless commitment to the river  ecosystem. John has delighted in introducing people to the mighty  Mississippi as it flows through the twin cities of Minneapolis and  Saint Paul and sharing stories about the historic, economic, and  cultural significance of America's great river.   In each of his roles, from historian for the Saint Paul District of  the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to chief of resource management and  superintendent of the Mississippi National River and Recreation Area of  the National Park Service, Dr. Anfinson has shared his love for the  Mississippi with countless people in the Twin Cities and beyond.   Dr. Anfinson has been a leader in protecting the river ecosystem from  invasive species and has been instrumental in saving and repurposing  the Fort Snelling Upper Post buildings,  [[Page S7500]]  which will soon come back to life as a new community, housing families  and individuals. He and his work remind us of the cultural, commercial,  and ecological importance of the river. It is fundamental to our very  identities as Minnesotans.   Through his work, Dr. Anfinson has educated countless Minnesotans  about the unique cultural heritage of the Mississippi, and he has  inspired the public to appreciate and take advantage of the treasures  the river offers to our State and country. He has contributed to our  understanding of the history of the river through his books, ``River of  History'' and ``The River We Have Wrought.'' His impact will be felt as  generations and generations of Americans have the opportunity to learn  about the Mississippi enjoy all that it has to offer.   As our climate changes and our State changes in countless other ways,  it is vital that we prioritize good stewardship of the river. That  means cleaning the waters. That means maintaining our river communities  and the infrastructure--natural and manmade--necessary to protect them  from flooding. We will be challenged to constantly envision, plan, and  take action to make sure we have a Mississippi River worthy of the  legacy we want to pass on to the next generation of Minnesotans. Dr.  Anfinson and his work will continue to guide us for years to come.   It is an honor to offer my sincerest congratulations to Dr. Anfinson  on his retirement. Minnesota thanks him for his countless contributions  to the environment and our treasured Mississippi River.                            ____________________
