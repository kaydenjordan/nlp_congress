 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding.   In a bill that professes to push back on the influence of China's  authoritarian regime, this amendment runs the risk of putting the  personal information of every one of America's college students in the  hands of the Chinese Communist Party.    It will allow the Biden administration to create a Federal database  that will track every single student pursuing a postsecondary degree  without their consent or any ability to opt out, even if they don't  accept Federal aid. The Biden administration will also be able to use  this data to match with other databases across the Federal Government  with few limits on what can be tracked and gathered.   While the bill claims the data will be secure, once the data comes  from the Federal Government, there are no guarantees information will  not fall into the hands of criminals or our adversaries.   Madam Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on this Federal database  amendment.
