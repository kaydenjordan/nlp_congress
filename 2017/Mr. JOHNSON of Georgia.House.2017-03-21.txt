 Mr. Speaker, I rise to introduce a bipartisan  resolution which designates October 17 as National Vitiligo Awareness  Day.   Vitiligo is a chronic medical condition resulting in the loss of skin  pigmentation. Studies show that about 50 million people worldwide are  diagnosed with vitiligo. In the United States, around 2 to 5 million  individuals are affected. Michael Jackson had it.   The American Academy of Dermatology refers to vitiligo as a life- altering disorder that can result in low self-esteem, anxiety, and  depression. Children with vitiligo are especially vulnerable to being  bullied because of their looks. They have a harder time making friends  and are more likely to perform poorly at school. We have the power to  change this. By naming October 17, 2017, as National Vitiligo Awareness  Day, we highlight the importance of providing support to individuals  diagnosed with vitiligo in an effort to improve their quality of life.                            ____________________
