 Madam Speaker, this impeachment charade did not start  with the whistleblower complaint. The campaign to impeach a duly  elected President and overturn the will of 63 million Americans started  19 minutes after the President took the oath of office.   Nineteen minutes after the inauguration, The Washington Post  published a story, headline, ``The Campaign to Impeach President Trump  Has Begun.''   The first day of this Congress, on day one, a Democratic member of my  class called for the impeachment of the President long before the call  to Ukraine. Then it was the Russia collusion hoax, then obstruction of  justice, then bribery, then quid pro quo--none of which are included in  these articles before us today.   The first Article of Impeachment crafted as a fiction is not an  enumerated basis in the Constitution for impeachment. The Democratic  majority would have you believe that abuse of power is a high crime or  misdemeanor. It is not. It is an opinion. It is not even a crime that  can be charged in a court of law.   Unlike Presidents Nixon and Clinton who were tried for actual crimes,  this President is being impeached on vague phrases that appear nowhere  in our Constitution.   The second article, obstruction of Congress, again, doesn't exist in  the Constitution as a basis for impeachment and is attempting to  impeach a duly elected President for asserting constitutionally based  privileges that have been asserted on a bipartisan basis by  administrations of both political parties throughout our Nation's  history.   This House is impeaching a President over a phone call to another  world leader, a few lines in a phone transcript that have been  completely and utterly misrepresented by the majority. The process that  ensued was anything but open, transparent, bipartisan, or equitable.   Abandoning all past historical due process afforded the minority and  the President, the Democrats ran a partisan investigation, refusing  rights of the minority, refusing the ability of the President's counsel  to call witnesses, refusing to allow the President's counsel to cross- examine fact witnesses, and refusing a minority hearing day, just to  name a few.  [[Page H12169]]    The majority waves around a report drafted that the Democratic staff  concocted as a matter of fact. When they needed backup for their  approach, they paraded out liberal professors with animus against the  President who gave them license to impeach the President for any reason  they wish.   House Democrats are making themselves kings in a manner far worse and  more obvious than what they are accusing the President of doing. The  only abuse of power here is by the Democratic-led Congress.                                time  1645
