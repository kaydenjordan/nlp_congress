 Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished ranking member  of the Ways and Means Committee, Mr. Neal, for the time.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today for my constituents in Nevada, my  Democratic colleagues here in the House, and as chairman of the  Congressional Black Caucus to address the latest attempt by extremist  MAGA Republicans to put politics over the American people and to put  billionaires and corporations over working families and children.   Just last week, Speaker McCarthy introduced the default on America  act that would tank our economic recovery and sabotage job growth,  underscoring Republicans' lack of interest in governing for anyone  besides the wealthy and the powerful.   Speaker McCarthy and his MAGA extremists are demanding that Congress  cut programs like SNAP, nutrition programs for seniors and children, at  the expense of the wealthy.   Everyday costs on families like car payments, student loans, credit  card bills, and mortgage payments would increase.   In fact, their plan, default on America, would affect veterans,  seniors, families, people, and jobs, including 7,000 in my State alone.   I urge my colleagues to vote against this default on America and to  put people over politics.
