 Mr. President, today I made the decision to return  to Illinois because of the challenges faced by the region's residents  due to the extreme cold. As a result, I was necessarily absent from  this afternoon's cloture vote on McConnell amendment No. 65 to the  Strengthening America's Security in the Middle East Act of 2019 S. 1.   On vote No. 13, had I been present, I would have voted nay on the  motion to invoke cloture.                            ____________________
