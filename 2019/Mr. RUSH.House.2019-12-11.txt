 Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate and commemorate  the life of the prescient priest and prophetic pastor that was the  Reverend Clay Evans.  [[Page H10029]]    Reverend Evans was the inspirational icon and tireless servant to his  church, to his community, and to the people of Chicago and borders  beyond. His untimely passing has left us all with yet another stunning  and unimaginable loss.   Born in Brownsville, Tennessee, Reverend Evans founded the Fellowship  Missionary Baptist Church in 1950. For the next 70 years, he would  nourish and strengthen the souls of his flock with his unwavering  wisdom, his incorruptible courage, and his unyielding devotion to the  Word of the Lord, the Good News, the Gospel of Jesus Christ. The Bible,  Madam Speaker, says at Psalms 119:105: ``Your word is a lamp to my feet  and a light to my path.''   Reverend Evans lived his faith humbly. He was a prophet to both  parishioners and pastors alike. When the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther  King brought his movement to Chicago, Reverend Evans had the courage to  welcome Dr. King into his church against the objections and the  retribution of then-Mayor Richard J. Daley and many others.   Reverend Evans was instrumental in founding the Rainbow/PUSH  Coalition alongside the Reverend Jesse Louis Jackson, Sr. As chairman  of the board of PUSH from 1970 to 1976, Reverend Evans worked  diligently to establish Rainbow/PUSH as a national powerhouse in the  fight for civil rights.   Madam Speaker, Reverend Evans leaves behind a long legacy of pastors  who greatly benefited from his teachings, including Reverend Jesse  Jackson, Sr. and Mother Consuella York, the first Chicago woman to be  ordained in the Baptist denomination. In total, Reverend Evans ordained  93 preachers and pastors, inspiring them to go forward and spread the  good news of the Gospel of Jesus Christ.   No celebration of Reverend Evans' life would be complete without  mentioning the innovative role music played in his ministry. His radio  broadcast reached far and wide into our Nation, into the homes of  millions of Americans. Reverend Evans recorded 11 gospel albums and  creatively infused gospel music into his sermons, evoking even more  truth and life into the Scriptures from which he was preaching.    In October 2007, Reverend Evans graced this very Chamber with his  powerful presence, serving as a guest chaplain. It was my deep honor to  sponsor Reverend Evans. Even today, I can still feel his presence in  the same way that I felt it all those years ago when he took us to  church here in this very Chamber.   Madam Speaker, although we all feel deep pain with the passing of  Reverend Evans, I am comforted in knowing that he is now with our Lord  and Savior Jesus Christ and with our Father in Heaven.   Reverend Evans' wife, Lutha Mae; his daughters, Gail Claudette Pye  and Faith Evans; his sons, Michael and Ralph; and all who loved him are  in my deepest prayers and have my greatest sympathies as they mourn the  loss of this truly great religious giant, Reverend Clay Evans.                            ____________________
