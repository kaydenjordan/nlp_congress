 Madam President, I want to first commend my colleague  from Kansas for his passion for our veterans and for his hard work on  legislation that is really going to help in Ohio and around the country  to ensure they have the care they deserve and also for his mention of  Senator McCain, who is a true national hero. He now has a documentary  about him on HBO, as some of us saw earlier today. It will soon be  available for everyone to see. It is very powerful.                                   STOP Act    Madam President, we heard earlier from one of my colleagues from  Indiana who talked about the fact that this is National Police Week. A  number of us have come to the floor to talk about our incredible men  and women in uniform back home who protect us every day through their  dedication, their public service, and it is appropriate to commend  them.   I will say, as I have talked to police officers from Ohio this week,  one issue came up again and again that doesn't get the attention it  deserves; that is, the influx of synthetic opioids, like fentanyl, and  the effect it is having on our law enforcement community, our first  responders, in general, and, for that matter, all of our citizens. What  they told me is, this is the issue that is creating so much crime in  our communities. This is the issue that is filling our courtrooms and  our jails.   One police officer I met with this week is a corrections officer at a  jail in one of our urban areas in Ohio. I asked him to just give me an  estimate. What percentage of the inmates in this jail are there because  of the drug crisis and specifically the opioid issue?   He thought for a minute, and he said: Probably 90 percent--90  percent. Some are there because of selling drugs, some of them are  there, though, because they have committed a crime while they were  trying to get the money to be able to pay for their habit--so it is  shoplifting; it is fraud; it is burglary. This issue is now everywhere.   The last year for which we have good information would be 2016. We  have a lot of information nationally on that, and 2016 was the worst  year on record in terms of overdose deaths attributable to these  synthetic drugs coming into our country. Guess what. Almost certainly,  2017 is worse.   As one example, the coroner for Franklin County, OH--that is the  Columbus area in Ohio, our fastest growing city--recently released  their 2017 overdose report for the county. Franklin County had 520  overdose deaths in 2017. That is a 47-percent increase from 2016. So  2016 was the worst year on record; 2017, almost a 50-percent increase  in overdose deaths. By the way, sadly, those overdose deaths are on  track again this year to reach a record.   Two-thirds of those overdose deaths in Columbus, OH, Franklin County,  involve fentanyl, which is this synthetic opioid that is overtaking our  communities in Ohio. Think about that. Two-thirds of those overdose  deaths last year in Columbus, OH, were due to fentanyl.  [[Page S2766]]    Just last week, a Cleveland man was sentenced to more than 11 years  in Federal prison for selling fentanyl that resulted in a 46-year-old  Ohio man's death. Earlier this month, a man in Lorain, OH, was  convicted of selling fentanyl, resulting in a 23-year-old's death.   This drug and the opioid crisis knows no bounds. It is in every age  group. It is in every ZIP Code. It is everywhere.   Unbelievably, this fentanyl drug--a synthetic form of heroin, a  synthetic form of opioids--we are told by the experts is coming into  our country through the U.S. mail system. This is shocking to me, and  it should be something we can do something about. This is a Federal  agency, after all.   Unlike other drugs--let's say heroin or even crystal meth, which tend  to come over land, mostly from Mexico--this drug primarily is coming  through the U.S. mail system from one country primarily--China. It is  coming from laboratories in China, where some evil scientist is mixing  this deadly brew and then sending it through the U.S. mail into our  communities. It is being shipped directly into your community in small  packages. These are the deadliest drugs we have ever experienced, and  they are being shipped directly through a Federal agency.   What is fentanyl? It is 50 times more powerful than heroin. It is  inexpensive. It is readily available now in many communities. It is the  new scourge, killing more people in my State of Ohio last year than any  other drug. We need to do all we can to stop more of these poisons from  entering our communities. At the very least, if we can't stop it all,  let's raise the price because the cost of this drug, being so  inexpensive and it being so powerful, is one of the things that is  driving these overdoses and these deaths.   It is not just overdoses. It is people whose lives are getting off  track, families breaking apart, community dysfunction, people leaving  work. It is the babies who are being born with this neonatal absence  syndrome, so they have to go through withdrawal as little babies whom  you can hold in your two hands. It is affecting our communities in so  many ways.   There is a new study out showing that of the men who are out of the  workforce altogether--probably 8\1/2\ million men--roughly half of them  are taking pain medication on a daily basis. When pushed, two-thirds  say it is prescriptions. What does that mean? This means it is  affecting one of the big issues we are all hearing about back home,  which is lack of a workforce. Well, here you have millions of Americans  who are off track because of this issue. So, yes, it is tragic and  unbelievable that over 60,000 Americans a year are dying from  overdoses, but it is even worse than that. That is the tip of the  iceberg, in a way. There are so many other aspects of this that are  affecting the communities we represent in the Chamber.   With regard to fentanyl, this new scourge, we conducted an 18-month  investigation in the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which I  chair. We did this because we are hearing more and more about fentanyl.  We wanted to look into how fentanyl is being shipped into the United  States and what can be done at the Federal level to stop it. The  investigation revealed just how easy it is to purchase fentanyl online  and have it shipped to the United States. It is so easy, in fact, we  found that most of the overseas providers essentially guaranteed  delivery if you use the U.S. mail system.   Through a simple Google search, our staff found hundreds of websites,  many affiliated with Chinese labs openly advertising fentanyl for sale.   We went undercover, using an investigator from the Department of  Homeland Security to help us find some of these websites. We found that  in several cases--seven different cases--individuals who receive  fentanyl through some of these websites had died from an overdose  shortly after receiving their fentanyl. We were able to find that the  sellers would tell you to ship the drugs through the Postal Service,  not a private carrier like FedEx or DHL or UPS or any other private  carrier. As we have learned in our investigation, this is because the  Postal Service, unlike these private carriers, is not required to have  what is called advanced electronic data as part of the package. In  other words, law enforcement is not given information on these  packages.    The data that is in this advance electronic information is the name  and address of the sender, the name and address of the person who is  receiving the package, and what the contents of the package are. How  does this help? Well, this gives law enforcement the ability to use big  data to find out what region it is coming from--again, if there is a  region in China that is sending a lot of this poison, they will know  that; where it is going; if it is going to a particular post office box  where they have reason to believe that it might be suspect, or perhaps  it is going to an abandoned warehouse.   The information about what is in the package obviously is very  interesting to Customs and Border Protection. They need this help. Why?  Because they can't otherwise identify suspicious packages. There are  900 million packages a year now coming into the United States through  the mail system--900 million packages. It is like finding a needle in a  haystack.   Yes, we need better detection equipment, and we have actually passed  legislation recently do to that. We have additional legislation to be  able to hire more individuals to help detect whether these packages  have opioids contained within them. But this advance information that  you can have on the package is so incredibly important, and it is the  reason the traffickers are saying: Don't send it through a private  carrier; send it through our own government agency because we think we  can guarantee delivery there. It is a glaring loophole in our screening  process, and it is a national security threat. It is a clear example of  where Congress ought to come together on a bipartisan basis and enact  Federal policies to fix this flaw.   Shortly after the tragic events of 9/11--September 11, 2001--Congress  did pass a law in this regard, and the law did require all private  carriers to obtain advance electronic data on all international  packages entering the United States and did require them to share that  data with law enforcement. The concern was not just contraband or  opioids; it was also explosives. They passed that legislation here in  Congress because they knew it was important to have law enforcement get  that information.   With regard to the post office, they made it optional. Congress  required the Postmaster General and the Secretary of the Treasury to  determine whether the post office should also collect such data. This  was 17 years ago. That determination was never made. They did not  follow the law. From one administration to the next, to the next, to  the next, there was no determination, which, of course, has resulted in  no data requirements for the Postal Service. Again, that was in 2002.   For about 14 years, the Postal Service sat by and did nothing on this  issue, knowing that this was a loophole, that this was an opening in  the law for traffickers and others to be able to send things into our  country. To me, that is unacceptable.   In the last couple of years, after pressure from Congress and,  frankly, our investigation that I talked about earlier and the hearings  we held talking about this issue in the Permanent Subcommittee on  Investigations, the Postal Service did actually start to do what, in my  view, they should have done starting 16 years ago, but unfortunately  what they are doing is not nearly enough. They have begun getting some  data on some international packages, but the efforts are inadequate.  One hundred percent of private carriers' packages have to have it, and  do, and they provide it to law enforcement.   The U.S. Postal Service last year began an effort to get more of this  advance electronic data, but they received it, based on testimony they  provided to us, on only about 36 percent of the international packages.  This means that the United States received more than 318 million  packages last year that had no screening on them, no information for  law enforcement to be able to identify the package.   We also found that the quality of the data that was provided by the  Postal Service was inadequate in many cases and therefore not helpful  to law enforcement. That is again based on testimony before our  committee.   Even when the Postal Service conducted a pilot program to screen for  [[Page S2767]]  drugs, they only presented 80 percent of the packages targeted by  Customs and Border Protection for inspection. So even when they did  have information on it and law enforcement said ``I want that  package''--again, using big data in figuring out what might be a  suspicious package--only 80 percent of them were even delivered to law  enforcement out of the 36 percent that had electronic data. So the  other 20 percent of those suspicious packages were allowed to go into  circulation, into our communities, without having any screening.   Frankly, it has been a challenge to get the post office to address  this problem on their own. We are talking about 900 million packages a  year. And they have funding problems. I get that. But, folks, this is a  crisis. It is a true epidemic. It is the No. 1 killer in my State.   It is time for Congress to act. People are dying every day because of  these synthetic drugs. How many more of our people have to die before  our own Postal Service takes the measures that we know can be taken to  stop these poisons?   The STOP Act is a bipartisan bill I introduced with Senator Amy  Klobuchar, a Democrat from Minnesota, that will close this loophole and  therefore help stop these deadly drugs from entering our communities.  Senator Klobuchar was on the floor earlier this afternoon and wanted to  speak at this time about the legislation. She had to catch a plane to  get back to her home State of Minnesota, but I appreciate her  partnership on this issue and her promotion of our dealing with this  issue here on the floor of the U.S. Senate.   The STOP Act is very simple, and it is common sense. It is going to  hold the U.S. Postal Service to the same standard as these private mail  carriers that we talked about and require that they get advance  electronic data not on 36 percent but on 100 percent of packages  entering the United States--and good data--and then present that to law  enforcement.   We are not punishing the Postal Service or forcing them to jump  through unnecessary hoops. We are simply saying that, given the crisis  we face, the U.S. Postal Service, a Federal agency, should require the  same types of advance electronic data from foreign countries that  private mail carriers do, and we give the Postal Service a year to do  it.   By the way, when I talked to mail carriers about this issue, when I  talked to postal inspectors about this issue, certainly when I talked  to Customs and Border Protection individuals about this issue, they all  agreed. Who wouldn't? They have families too. They understand. This  issue needs to be addressed, and it needs to be addressed urgently.   The United States of America provides this advance electronic data on  90 percent of our packages that we send to other countries, so we are  not asking for something that we are not doing. It makes sense all  around the world. It makes sense here, and it will help save lives.   Thirty-three of my Senate colleagues--20 Republicans, 12 Democrats,  and 1 Independent--have signed on as cosponsors of this legislation.  The Presiding Officer today, who is from West Virginia--her State has  been getting hit really hard like Ohio. She has a passion for this  issue. She knows that we need to do all we can do to stop this poison  from coming in.   The legislation has the support of a broad cross-section of this  body. It has also been endorsed by President Trump's opioid commission.  This is a commission that he formed to look at answers, and this is one  of their specific recommendations: The STOP Act--pass it.   Just this week, the Secretary of Homeland Security, Kirstjen Nielsen,  reaffirmed her support for this measure.   The House companion bill has 271 cosponsors--more than half of the  U.S. House of Representatives.   By the way, asking every country for this kind of information, this  advance electronic data, is not just common sense, it is also  reasonable. The United States provides that data on nearly all of our  packages that go into China, as an example, so why shouldn't China do  that for us? At least one country--Sweden--recently returned packages  from China that did not comply with Swedish postal rules on providing  this information. So the Postal Service's argument that they have to  accept and deliver packages from foreign posts under treaty obligations  is simply not the case. If a country doesn't play by our rules, we can  simply choose to return their packages. By the way, threatening to do  so is all we need to do because these countries then will comply. We  have the largest market in the world. We are the biggest economy in the  world. We just have to insist on it.   China is already starting to recognize the importance of providing  this data for access to U.S. markets. For example, as of early this  year, when we published our report from the Permanent Subcommittee on  Investigations, we had information that China had already provided  electronic data on roughly 50 percent of the packages headed to the  United States. So this notion that somehow China can't do it--of course  they can.   Yesterday, instead of marking up this bipartisan STOP Act I talked  about, the STOP Act legislation, the House Ways and Means Committee  considered a weaker alternative to our bill. Apparently, they were  hearing from some at the Postal Service who don't want Congress to  require them to get this electronic data within 1 year, which we think  is not just doable but reasonable. They don't want Congress to put in  place penalties if they don't get that data, and our legislation, yes,  has penalties.   The Postal Service doesn't mind if Congress simply recommends that  they get the data, but remember, Congress recommended that way back in  2002. That was 16 years ago. And until very recently, just the last  couple of years, the Postal Service did nothing to provide that crucial  information.   Unfortunately, the weaker alternative approved by the committee  yesterday would eliminate the real, enforceable, and immediate  requirement that the Postal Service provide law enforcement with the  information they need to identify and stop the shipment of deadly  synthetic drugs into our communities.   In particular, the STOP Act requires that within 1 year, the Postal  Service secure advance electronic data on 100 percent of packages here  in the United States and transmit that data to law enforcement, to  Customs and Border Protection. The version reported out yesterday gives  the Postal Service 4 years--4 years. Remember the No. 1 killer in my  State and in many States. Last year, there was an increase from the  year before, and this year looks worse again. We can't wait 4 years. We  don't have to.   The version they reported out also requires only 95 percent of the  packages to have that data.   In addition, this alternative to the STOP Act that was reported out  yesterday actually gives the Federal Government the authority to waive  the requirements in the STOP Act that would get advance electronic data  if it is in the ``national security interest of the United States.''  They can waive it altogether. I am struggling to think of a time when  knowing less about what is coming into our country is in our national  security interest.   As the permanent subcommittee investigation's report from January  makes clear, there are hundreds of millions of packages coming into  this country through the Postal Service every year with little or no  screening at all. That is frightening. This loophole is allowing drug  traffickers to exploit our own Federal Government, and we can't allow  this status quo to continue.   The organization Americans for Securing All Packages--ASAP--issued a  statement last week urging the Ways and Means Committee to ``reject  this weakened alternative, and pass the STOP Act, a bill with 271  bipartisan cosponsors.''   Just yesterday, Shatterproof--another addiction advocacy group  fighting against the opioid addiction issue--issued a similar statement  calling on Congress to pass the STOP Act, not the watered-down version.   I want to say today on the floor that I very much appreciate the fact  that Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady has acknowledged  these concerns and has committed to working with us to resolve these  differences during the legislative process. I know him. I know he is a  passionate advocate of addressing this issue. He wants  [[Page S2768]]  to reverse the opioid epidemic, and he wants this to work, so I look  forward to working with him.   I particularly appreciate the House coauthors of the STOP Act,  including Representatives  Mike Bishop and Bill Pascrell. I talked to  Mr. Bishop today, and I know his passion to deal with this issue as  well.   The coalition of support for the STOP Act, by the way, also includes  the Fraternal Order of Police. I talked about the fact that police  officers understand the dangers of this. By the way, to give an example  of how dangerous this is to them, it is not just the overcrowding of  our prison system and the courts and the crime that is being committed,  it is a personal danger to them as law enforcement officers.   In East Liverpool, OH, a police officer pulled over two men for a  traffic violation, and he noticed there was a powdery substance in the  car. Being alert, he put on his mask and his gloves and arrested those  two gentlemen because the powdery substance was fentanyl. They had  stupidly tried to spread it around the car. He took them down to the  station and booked them.   After he booked them, he was talking to his fellow officers, and he  looked down on his shirt and noticed a few white flecks. So, as anyone  would do, he took his hand and flicked the pieces of something white  off of his shoulder. It was fentanyl. That exposure to his fingers  caused him to drop, unconscious, on the floor. This is a big guy, 6  feet 2 inches, over 200 pounds, and in good shape. He overdosed and  nearly died.   As his police chief said, if we had not been there to apply Narcan-- not once, twice, or three times but five and six times, having taken  him to the emergency room--if we hadn't been there, he didn't think he  would have made it. Think if he would have gone home to hug his kid  without brushing those flecks off his shoulder.   Our police officers are subject to this all the time, as are other  first responders. It is appropriate that police organizations around  the country are strongly in support of the STOP Act. So are the  National Association of State EMS Officials, the U.S. Chamber of  Commerce, and anti-opioid groups like Shatterproof, which I talked  about, but also groups like SAFE, or Stop Addiction Fatality Epidemic,  and other groups which have said: This is crazy; we have to stop this  stuff from coming into our communities and, again, at a minimum, get  the price up, because part of the reason it is spreading so much is  that it is not just deadly and powerful, but it is inexpensive.   There is a strong bipartisan consensus that this bill, the Senate  STOP Act, is absolutely needed to help combat the wave of opioid  addiction and overdose deaths on the front end, by keeping some of  these more deadly drugs from ever entering our communities in the first  place.   This is a step we can take in the Senate to make accessing these  deadly and inexpensive synthetic drugs more difficult.   The STOP Act will make life a little easier for the people of Ohio  and across the country who are increasingly fatally overdosing or being  unknowingly exposed to these deadly drugs.   Of course, this is only one part of combating the opioid epidemic. We  understand that. We passed legislation here, which I coauthored, that  increases treatment options, does more in terms of prevention, provides  longer term recovery, and helps to provide our police officers and  other first responders with the Narcan that is needed to reverse the  effects of overdoses.   But, to my colleagues, this one is common sense. Stopping more of  these deadly drugs from ever entering the country in the first place  and raising the price of these drugs will make a difference and will  save lives.   Let's pass this legislation. Let's work with the House to be sure it  is legislation that will be effective immediately to be able to stop  the increasing danger these opioids are causing in our communities all  around the country.   I yield the floor.
