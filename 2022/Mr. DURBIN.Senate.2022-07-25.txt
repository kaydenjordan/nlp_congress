 Madam President, like 17 million other Americans, I  watched the January 6 committee in its latest session last Thursday  night. For 2 hours, I was there watching closely as they presented  witnesses and evidence of the obvious. It reminded me that our  committee--the Senate Judiciary Committee--last October released a  report that showed in alarming detail how former President Donald Trump  tried to bully the Justice Department into overturning an election  which he lost.   Our report showed just how aggressively the defeated President tried  to hold on to power, how some with the Justice Department were actually  conspiring to help him, and how hard the Department's leadership had to  work to prevent Trump's illegal scheme from succeeding.   We knew when we produced our report that it was just one chapter in  an intricate plot to subvert America's democracy.   In eight public hearings over the last 6 weeks, the House Select  Committee to Investigate the January 6 Attack on the U.S. Capitol has  laid out in clear and chilling detail more chapters in the plot to  overturn the 2020 Presidential election.   The facts are damning. What makes them even more shocking and  credible is that they have been revealed, under oath, not by former  President Trump's political foes but by people who once believed in  him--people who worked with him for years, close aides, advisers, even  his own family members.   I am sure you remember January 6, 2021. Those of us who were in this  Chamber will never forget it.   We were here in the Senate to count the electoral ballots forwarded  from the States to the Senate and the House to confirm the results of  the 2020 Presidential election. We heard the furious mob outside. They  attacked Capitol Police officers with hockey sticks, iron bars, toxic  bear spray, flagpoles--whatever weapons they could find. The Trump mob  was on the march. They smashed windows and doors, broke into this  Capitol Building.   Capitol Police officers ordered the Senators to evacuate the Chamber  immediately. I remember it well. They first told us: Well, wait here.  This will be a safe room. Ten minutes later, they said: Leave through  these back doors as quickly as you can; the mob has taken over the  Capitol. We rushed to a secure location.   For hours, as the Capitol Police and DC Metropolitan Police battled  the mob in brutal hand-to-hand combat, we asked the same questions:  Where is the protection? Where is the National Guard? Where is the  President? Donald Trump set this carnage in motion by riling up his  supporters with the Big Lie and ordering them to march on the Capitol.  We thought to ourselves, Why won't he tell them to stop? This has gone  too far.   The public hearings of the January 6 Committee have answered the  question in frightening detail. Where was the President? We now know  from last Thursday's hearing, Donald Trump knew within 15 minutes of  finishing his remarks that the mob was on its way to attack this  building and the people inside. What did he do? What did Donald Trump  do for 3 hours 7 minutes? He sat in his private dining room next to the  Oval Office watching the violence  [[Page S3622]]  on TV. He refused to contact his national security leaders to defend  the Capitol of the United States of America. He refused pleas from  congressional leaders of both parties, from his own staff and family,  from his allies in the media at FOX News to call off the mob. He  refused to walk less than 60 seconds to the White House briefing room  to make a simple statement asking for the violence to stop. He was  silent, and he watched FOX News every second of that 3 hours 7 minutes.   We learned that members of Vice President Pence's Secret Service  detail actually thought that they might die as they confronted this  mob. As some of those agents made what they feared might be their last  calls to their families to tell them that they loved them, President  Donald Trump sent out a tweet telling the mob Vice President Pence had  betrayed them. Instead of calming the riot, Donald Trump poured  gasoline on the fire.   Illinois Representative Adam Kinzinger, a Republican member of the  January 6 Committee, summed it up well. He said:         Trump didn't fail to act . . . he chose not to act.    Only when it was clear that his coup had failed did Donald Trump  reluctantly record a video telling his supporters to leave the Capitol  and go home. And he carefully chose his words--we can tell from the  outtakes--not to concede the Big Lie. There was not a word of  condemnation about the violence, not a word of concern for the police  officers who battled that mob to protect our safety and our democracy.  More than 140 police officers--Capitol Police, DC Metropolitan Police-- suffered serious injuries on January 6. Where is this President who  loved law and order? Silently watching on FOX.   Over the next few days and weeks, sadly, several officers who  defended the Capitol died. Not a word from former President Trump.   In the committee's earlier hearings, we learned how the President had  ignored his own aides and advisers and relentlessly pressed false  claims of voter fraud, listening to his ``gifted'' legal counsel, Rudy  Giuliani, even when he was told repeatedly that these claims were  wrong.   We learned how he pressured Vice President Pence to go along with the  plan to overturn his loss even after he was told by the experts around  him: President Trump, it would be illegal.   We learned how President Trump pressed elected leaders in key States  to change the vote totals in their States. When that failed, he pressed  allies to send false slates of electors that would make him the winner.   He learned how to summon a mob to Washington and turned them loose on  this building, even after being told the mob was carrying weapons. And  even after all the harm his Big Lie has done to our democracy, he is  still relentlessly peddling it.   Outtakes aired by the House committee last week showed on the day of  insurrection, he still refused to say the election is over. This little  man just can't bring himself to accept reality.   Wisconsin's Assembly Speaker, who happens to be a Republican, said  Donald Trump called him to urge him to overturn the State's vote in the  2020 election. When did he call him? Two weeks ago. He is still on a  rampage.   The Senate will soon consider a bipartisan Electoral Count Reform Act  to make it plain that a Presidential election cannot be overturned by  wrongful partisan interference by a Vice President or any State or  congressional officials. I support this effort. Senators Klobuchar,  King, and I offered our own ideas several months ago on this  anticipated Electoral Count Act reform. I hope that this bipartisan  effort can get 60 votes in the Senate.    I hope that 10 Republicans will join us in modernizing this law so it  works for today. It was written in haste in the middle of political  controversy in the 19th century. Some of the sections of that law are  almost unintelligible. Let's clarify it. Let's give the American people  an assurance that we learned a lesson on January 6, 2021, and in the  election that preceded it. And in that lesson, we learned that the  American people want their votes to count accurately, honestly, and  fairly.   Ultimately, however, the only way we can protect our elections and  our democracy is by respecting the rule of law and the will of the  American people and telling them the truth. By laying out the truth  clearly for the American people and for history, the January 6  Committee is performing an invaluable public service. They deserve our  respect.   One closing comment. There wasn't supposed to be a committee in the  House. Madam President, you remember and I do, too, the proposal was  for a bipartisan Commission to be created to investigate this travesty  on January 6 as they investigated 9/11--take politics out of it, take  elected officials out of it, bring together people who are respected  from across the political spectrum, and get to the bottom of it. That  proposal for a bipartisan Commission was stopped by Republican  leadership in the House and the Senate. After all of the statements  they made expressing outrage over January 6, when it came time to  appoint the Commission--bipartisan Commission--they refused. There is  only one conclusion you can draw: They don't want to face the truth.  They don't want the truth to be on the record from a bipartisan  Commission. Luckily, in the House of Representatives, the January 6  Committee has achieved that, and there is more to come.   I might add, people say: Why didn't the Senate Judiciary Committee  take this on? That is a very valid question. The difference is this. In  order to issue a subpoena from the Senate Judiciary Committee in such a  committee hearing, we need to have agreement from at least one  Republican member of the committee. We had no assurance that that  agreement would be offered. So I supported the January 6 Committee in  the House, and I am glad that they moved forward as they have.                                   Abortion    Madam President, it was a month ago the Dobbs decision was handed  down. One of the most controversial issues in American politics is the  issue of abortion and reproductive health.   We know that Justice Alito's opinion, a 6-to-3 decision, overturned  Roe v. Wade. Since then, we have been trying to sort out the impact of  that decision on America. There are many things that have happened  which have been shocking--the fact that they have called into question  some of the things that we had accepted for 50 years as  constitutionally guaranteed rights.   Yes, there was a 10-year-old girl who was viciously raped and turned  up pregnant in the State of Ohio. And, yes, under the law in the State  of Ohio because she was 6 weeks 3 days pregnant, she couldn't qualify  for a procedure to terminate her pregnancy in the State of Ohio. She  had to go to Indiana, the neighboring State. There were those who  disputed that it ever happened and denied that such a thing could  occur. As it turned out, they were wrong. It did happen. I was saddened  to read that one of the leaders in the right to life movement said she  should carry that baby to term--a 10-year-old girl.   Madam President, I am sure you have seen a lot of 10-year-old young  people. I have seen them, too, even in my household, one of my  grandchildren. At that age, you are still questioning whether they can  cross a busy street without help. And to think someone would say she  should carry that baby to term ignores her own health and ignores the  reality of that situation. That is the kind of rhetoric we are hearing  from people who are proposing a national ban on abortions.   I was reading this morning an article in the New York Times.   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have this New York Times  article printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:               After Roe, Urgent Questions About Cancer Care                              (By Gina Kolata)         In April of last year, Rachel Brown's oncologist called       with bad news--at age 36, she had an aggressive form of       breast cancer. The very next day, she found out she was       pregnant after nearly a year of trying with her fiance to       have a baby.        She had always said she would never have an abortion. But       the choices she faced were wrenching. If she had the       chemotherapy that she needed to prevent the spread of her       cancer, she could harm her baby. If she didn't have it, the       cancer could spread and kill her. She had two children, ages       2 and 11, who could lose their mother.        For Ms. Brown and others in the unlucky sorority of women       who receive a cancer diagnosis when they are pregnant, the       Supreme  [[Page S3623]]       Court decision in June, ending the constitutional right to an       abortion, can seem like a slap in the face. If the life of a       fetus is paramount, a pregnancy can mean a woman cannot get       effective treatment for her cancer. One in a thousand women       who gets pregnant each year is diagnosed with cancer, meaning       thousands of women are facing a serious and possibly fatal       disease while they are expecting a baby.        Before the Supreme Court decision, a pregnant woman with       cancer was already ``entering a world with tremendous       unknowns,'' said Dr. Clifford Hudis, the chief executive       officer at the American Society of Clinical Oncology. Now,       not only the women but also the doctors and hospitals that       treat them, are caught up in the added complications of       abortion bans.        ``If a doctor can't give a drug without fear of damaging a       fetus, is that going to compromise outcomes?'' Dr. Hudis       asked. ``It's a whole new world.''        Cancer drugs are dangerous for fetuses in the first       trimester. Although older chemotherapy drugs are safe in the       second and third trimesters, the safety of the newer and more       effective drugs is unknown and doctors are reluctant to give       them to pregnant women.        About 40 percent of women who are pregnant and have cancer       have breast cancer. But other cancers also occur in pregnant       women, including blood cancers, cervical and ovarian cancer,       gastrointestinal cancer, melanoma, brain cancer, thyroid       cancer and pancreatic cancer.        Women with some types of cancer, like acute leukemia, often       can't continue with a pregnancy if the cancer is diagnosed in       the first trimester. They need to be treated immediately,       within days, and the necessary drugs are toxic to a fetus.        ``In my view, the only medically acceptable option is       termination of the pregnancy so that lifesaving treatment can       be administered to the mother,'' said Dr. Eric Winer, the       director of the Yale Cancer Center.        Some oncologists say they are not sure what is allowed if a       woman lives in a state like Michigan, which has a law that       criminalized most abortions but permits them to save the life       of the mother. Does leukemia qualify as a reason for an       abortion to save her life?        ``It's so early we don't know the answer,'' said Dr. N.       Lynn Henry, an oncologist at the University of Michigan. ``We       can't prove that the drugs caused a problem for the baby, and       we can't prove that withholding the drugs would have a       negative outcome.''        In other words, doctors say, complications from a       pregnancy--a miscarriage, a premature birth, birth defects or       death--can occur whether or not a woman with cancer takes the       drugs. If she is not treated and her cancer gallops into a       malignancy that kills her, that too might have happened even       if she had been given the cancer drugs.        Administrators of the University of Michigan's medical       system are not intervening in cancer treatment decisions       about how to treat cancers in pregnant women, saying       ``medical decision making and management is between doctors       and patients.''        I. Glenn Cohen, a law professor and bioethicist at Harvard,       is gravely concerned.        ``We are putting physicians in a terrible position,'' Mr.       Cohen said. ``I don't think signing up to be a physician       should mean signing up to do jail time,'' he added.        Oncologists usually are part of a hospital system, Mr.       Cohen said, which adds a further complication for doctors who       treat cancers in states that ban abortions. ``Whatever their       personal feelings,'' he asked, ``what are the risks the       hospital system is going to face?''        ``I don't think oncologists ever thought this day was       coming for them,'' Mr. Cohen said.        Behind the confusion and concern from doctors are the       stories of women like Ms. Brown.        She had a large tumor in her left breast and cancer cells       in her underarm lymph nodes. The cancer was HER2 positive.       Such cancers can spread quickly without treatment. About 15       years ago, the prognosis for women with HER2 positive cancers       was among the worst breast cancer prognosis. Then a targeted       treatment, trastuzumab, or Herceptin, completely changed the       picture. Now women with HER2 tumors have among the best       prognoses compared with other breast cancers.        But trastuzumab cannot be given during pregnancy.        Ms. Brown's first visit was with a surgical oncologist who,       she said, ``made it clear that my life would be in danger if       I kept my pregnancy because I wouldn't be able to be treated       until the second trimester.'' He told her that if she waited       for those months her cancer could spread to distant organs       and would become fatal.        Her treatment in the second trimester would be a mastectomy       with removal of all of the lymph nodes in her left armpit,       which would have raised her risk of lymphedema, an incurable       fluid buildup in her arm. She could start chemotherapy in her       second trimester but could not have trastuzumab or radiation       treatment.        Her next consult was with Dr. Lisa Carey, a breast cancer       specialist at the University of North Carolina, who told her       that while she could have a mastectomy in the first       trimester, before chemotherapy, it was not optimal.       Ordinarily, oncologists would give cancer drugs before a       mastectomy to shrink the tumor, allowing for a less invasive       surgery. If the treatment did not eradicate the tumor,       oncologists would try a more aggressive drug treatment after       the operation.        But if she had a mastectomy before having chemotherapy, it       would be impossible to know if the treatment was helping. And       what if the drugs were not working? She worried that her       cancer could become fatal without her knowing it.        She feared that if she tried to keep her pregnancy, she       might sacrifice her own life and destroy the lives of her       children. And if she delayed making her decision and then had       an abortion later in the pregnancy, she feared that the fetus       might feel pain.        She and her fiance discussed her options. This pregnancy       would be his first biological child.        With enormous sadness, they made their decision--she would       have a medication abortion. She took the pills one morning       when she was six weeks and one day pregnant, and cried all       day. She wrote a eulogy for the baby who might have been. She       was convinced the baby was going to be a girl, and had named       her Hope. She saved the ultrasound of Hope's heartbeat.        ``I don't take that little life lightly,'' Ms. Brown said.        After she terminated her pregnancy, Ms. Brown was able to       start treatment with trastuzumab, along with a cocktail of       chemotherapy drugs and radiation. She had a mastectomy, and       there was no evidence of cancer at the time of her surgery--a       great prognostic sign, Dr. Carey said. She did not need to       have all of her lymph nodes removed and did not develop       lymphedema.        ``I feel like it has taken a lot of courage to do what I       did,'' Ms. Brown said. ``As a mother your first instinct is       to protect the baby.''        But having gone through that grueling treatment, she also       wondered how she could ever have handled having a newborn       baby and her two other children to care for.        ``My bones ached. I couldn't walk more than a few steps       without being out of breath. It was hard to get nutrients       because of the nausea and vomiting,'' she said.        The Supreme Court decision hit her hard.        ``I felt like the reason I did what I did didn't matter,''       she said. ``My life didn't matter, and my children's lives       didn't matter.''        ``It didn't matter if I lost my life because I was being       forced to be pregnant,'' she said.    I want to read this because it tells you the  complications that have been created by what seemed like a very simple  decision overturning a previous Supreme Court case. This writer, Gina  Kolata, wrote an article entitled ``After Roe, Urgent Questions About  Cancer Care.'' It was in Sunday's New York Times, July 24, 2022. I was  struck by this article because it suggests the complexity of this issue  and the real-world impact of this decision:         In April of last year, Rachel Brown's oncologist called       with bad news--at age 36, she had an aggressive form of       breast cancer. The very next day, she found out she was       pregnant after nearly a year of trying with her fiance to       have a baby.        She had always said she would never have an abortion. But       the choices she faced were wrenching. If she had the       chemotherapy that she needed to prevent the spread of her       cancer, she could harm the baby. If she didn't have it, the       cancer could spread and kill her. She had two children, ages       2 and 11, who would lose their mother.        For Ms. Brown and others in the unlucky sorority of women       who receive a cancer diagnosis when they are pregnant, the       Supreme Court decision in [Dobbs], ending the constitutional       right to an abortion, can seem like a slap in the face. If       the life of a fetus is paramount, a pregnancy can mean a       woman cannot get effective treatment for her cancer. One in a       thousand women who gets pregnant each year is diagnosed with       cancer, meaning thousands of women are facing a serious and       possibly fatal disease while they are expecting a baby.        Before the Supreme Court decision, a pregnant woman with       cancer was already ``entering a world with tremendous       unknowns,'' said Dr. Clifford Hudis, the chief executive       officer at the American Society of Clinical Oncology. Now,       not only the women but also the doctors and hospitals that       treat them, are caught up in the added complications of       abortion bans.        ``If a doctor can't give a drug without fear of damaging a       fetus, is that going to compromise outcomes?'' Dr. Hudis       asked. ``It's a whole new world.''        Cancer drugs are dangerous for fetuses in the first       trimester. Although older chemotherapy drugs are safe in the       second and third trimesters, the safety of the newer and more       effective drugs is unknown and doctors are reluctant to give       them to [a] pregnant [woman].    This woman decided to terminate her pregnancy, take the cancer  therapy, and save her life. She closes with the following statements:         But having gone through that grueling treatment, she also       wondered how she could ever have handled having a newborn       baby and her two other children to care for.        ``My bones ached, I couldn't walk more than a few steps       without being out of breath.

The Supreme Court decision hit her hard.        ``I felt like the reason I did what I did didn't matter,''       she said. ``My life didn't  [[Page S3624]]       matter, and my children's lives didn't matter.        ``It didn't matter if I lost my life because I was being       forced to be pregnant,'' she said.    That is the reality today. I hear my colleagues come to the floor  with absolute certain moral clarity on this issue. I have learned  during the course of my life and my public life that there is not that  element of certainty when it comes down to real life. And to jeopardize  the health and safety, even the life of the mother in this  circumstance, to leave doctors wondering if they have criminal  liability for professional medical care is something this Nation should  never see. But we face it now, and it is up to us to show leadership  and come together, I hope, and bring back the constitutional  protections that have been the case for 50 years in this country.   I yield the floor.
