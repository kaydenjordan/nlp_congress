 Madam President, while the distinguished leader is still  on the floor, I thank him for his comments. It is very late at night,  and I will speak further about this next week.   I must admit, when I came here as the junior-most Member of the  Senate, I did not expect to be in this position, but I have had the  privilege now of serving with slightly over 20 percent of all of the  Senators who have served in the history of this country, and some were  very, very good Senators--and all were Senators. All were Senators, and  some were very good.   (Laughter.)   I will speak about this later in the week. I appreciate the comments,  and it has been a privilege serving with all of those hundreds and  hundreds of Senators I have served with.   Thank you.   (Applause.)
