 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize former  Georgia State Senator Ed Zipperer.   Senator Zipperer was a dedicated public servant who served coastal  Georgia in numerous ways. He was the president of the Chatham County  Farm Bureau for 40 years. He also served 8 years in the State Senate  representing coastal Georgia. One of his many contributions includes  the new State parks he brought to the area.   This July in Chatham County, lawmakers named the 204 interchange  bridge as the Edward H. Zipperer Bridge, a fitting addition to his  legacy because of his work on the assembly's transportation committee.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to see this great Georgia public servant,  Senator Zipperer, get the recognition he deserves.   Senator Zipperer, you are a dear friend, a great Georgian, and I am  grateful for your service.                            ____________________
