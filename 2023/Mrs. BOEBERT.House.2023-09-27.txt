 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise today to offer my amendment that  utilizes the Holman rule to reduce the salary of Shawn Skelly,  Assistant Secretary of Defense for Readiness. That salary shall be  reduced to $1.   As the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Mr. Skelly is the principal  adviser to the Secretary of Defense and the Under Secretary of Defense  for Personnel and Readiness on all matters related to the readiness of  our Armed Forces.   In that capacity, he is supposed to develop policies and plans,  provide advice, and make recommendations for total force readiness  programs, reporting, and assessments of readiness to execute the  national defense strategy.   Like many of Biden's bureaucrats, Mr. Skelly is failing at his job  and the basic responsibilities. On his watch, the Army missed their  recruiting goal by 15,000 soldiers last year, and all other branches  were forced to dig deep into their pools of delayed entry applicants to  meet their recruitment goals.   On top of that, the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard are all  expected to fall short of their recruitment goals this year.   Mr. Skelly has also been with the Biden administration since the  beginning and was appointed to the transition team--some irony there-- in November of 2020.   As the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Readiness, Mr. Skelly  played an instrumental role in the disastrous and shameful withdrawal  from Afghanistan that killed 13 of America's finest, 13 American heroes  in that embarrassing surrender to the Taliban.   As DOD's highest ranking trans official, this delusional man,  thinking he is a woman, embodies and espouses the wokeism that is  causing significant harm to our military readiness and troop morale.   The military shouldn't be focused on this woke agenda and combating  climate change. With Mr. Skelly at the helm of readiness, these  misguided policy pursuits will continue to be at the forefront of DOD's  priorities.   I urge my colleagues to support my amendment to restore the focus of  our Department of Defense to defend our Nation. Mr. Chair, I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I guess delusion runs deep in the Democratic  Party. I would go on the record to say that science is a friend in this  case and, sure, if you want to call Mr. Skelly a ``her,'' his  chromosomes are still X-Y, and we trust the science over here rather  than delusion and playing dress-up and imaginary games with our  military readiness.   Our military needs to be lethal and able to defend our national  security, not pander to the woke extremist left and make up fairy  tales.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I just want the Record to reflect that there  is nothing hateful about truth. Again, I urge my colleagues to support  my amendment to restore the focus of our Department of Defense to  defend our Nation. I look forward to this Holman rule being utilized to  reduce the salary of Secretary Shawn Skelly, the Assistant Secretary of  Defense for Readiness, to $1.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise in favor of my amendment, which will  reduce the salary of Norvel Dillard, director of Diversity and  Inclusion Management at the Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion  of the Department of Defense, to $1.   Norvel ``Rock'' Dillard is a part of Joe Biden and Lloyd Austin's  attempt to woken and weaken our military. He works in an office that  should not exist doing a job that also should not exist.   Our military is not a social experiment, and we definitely should not  be treating it like one or spending taxpayer dollars to do so.   Woke ideology undermines military readiness. It undermines  cohesiveness by emphasizing differences based on race, ethnicity, and  sex.   It undermines leadership authority by introducing questions about  whether promotion is based on merit or quota requirements. It leads to  military personnel serving in specialty areas for which they are not  qualified or ready. It takes time and resources away from training  activities and weapons development to contribute to readiness.   Unelected bureaucrats at the DOD need to be held responsible for  their failed leadership, which has distracted from DOD's mission and  jeopardized the United States military's ability to defend our country.   From the botched Afghanistan withdrawal that left 13 American  soldiers dead to the implementation of a woke agenda that has weakened  our military and caused recruitment to suffer, bureaucrats like Norvel  Dillard have continued to put a leftist agenda ahead of our national  security.   The Federal Government's obsession with diversity, equity, and  inclusion needs to come to an end, especially at DOD, where our brave  servicemembers volunteer to put themselves in harm's way to fight for  freedom. They don't care about the skin color of their brothers and  sisters in uniform. They care about completing the mission and going  home to their families. Our Defense Department should have the same  mindset.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support my amendment to restore  the focus of our Department of Defense to defend our Nation.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle  agree that there is a recruitment crisis. Why is that? I think it is  because our brave men and women who put their lives on the line to  serve our Nation dutifully, with honor, don't see a true Commander in  Chief in office. They don't see true leadership that they can be proud  to serve alongside, to serve under.    I don't believe that our brave men and women see that they will be  taken care of when they put their lives in harm's way to defend our  Nation, to defend our allies throughout the world.   Let me ask my colleagues a broad question: This Office of Diversity,  Equity, and Inclusion, did that save our 13 servicemembers in  Afghanistan, or did it distract from the actual mission?   I heard from my colleagues, Mr. Chair, on the other side of the aisle  that this was a way to ridicule and disrespect. I think it is  ridiculing to promote someone who does not have the qualifications  needed for a position just because of how they identify, their race.   This is what is ridiculing. This is what is disrespectful.  [[Page H4603]]    This woke agenda, this DEI, this movement that the left has created,  I see it as a way to erase women. I heard my colleague on the other  side of the aisle talk about, in the 1970s, there was a recruitment  effort to bring more women to our military, and if that were the case  today, if that were the mission today, to offer a more diverse military  and recruit more women, well, my colleagues on the other side of the  aisle would simply put men in a dress and put them in heels. Heck, I  got some red lipstick you could borrow.   That is not the answer. The answer is readiness. The answer is that  we are all equal under the law, and you do not promote someone simply  because of these qualifications.   Mr. Chair, I urge adoption of my amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise today to offer my amendment that  utilizes the Holman rule to reduce the salary of Ur Jaddou, director of  U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, to $1.   Ms. Jaddou is a radical leftist. Before joining the Biden  administration, she worked for an open borders group called DHS Watch.  While at DHS Watch, Jaddou called for stopping Border Patrol funding  and referred to CBP as President Trump's ``personal militia.''   Ms. Jaddou has also previously called for the mass release of illegal  immigrants. Someone like this should not be in a position of influence  at the Department of Homeland Security. She has no regard for the rule  of law.   Ms. Jaddou proposed and finalized the rule Procedures for Credible  Fear Screening and Consideration of Asylum, Withholding of Removal, and  CAT Protection Claims by Asylum Officers, which removed ICE attorneys  and the adversarial process from the credible fear asylum application  process. The rule violates the jurisdiction of Department of Justice  immigration judges as stated by section 103 of the Immigration and  Nationality Act and the Homeland Security Act.   Ms. Jaddou also heavily prioritizes USCIS resources to adjudicate and  issue employment authorization documents for millions of illegal  aliens, parolees, and ever-expanding populations of temporary protected  status instead of adjudicating lawful nonimmigrant and immigrant  applications. These misguided amnesty pursuits have rapidly increased  the USCIS' pending backlog to over 9 million cases.                                time  2045     Jaddou previously pushed other amnesty policies in her  role as USCIS during the Obama administration.   Specifically, she aggressively tried to expand parole in place in  order to bypass Congress and implement mass amnesty.   Jaddou has also defended the unconstitutional Deferred Action for  Childhood Arrivals program, falsely claiming this is a permissible  exercise of discretion by the Secretary of Homeland Security.   As an attorney, she should know only Congress has the authority to  authorize this type of program. With that, Obama and DHS should have  never unilaterally created this amnesty program.   Jaddou in her current role is literally enabling and supporting the  Biden border crisis. In August alone, there were 232,972 illegal  immigrants encountered at the southern border.   Customs and Border Patrol has seized 25,500 pounds of fentanyl so far  in fiscal year 2023. Of course, that is only what has been seized, not  what we know is coming into our country illegally and killing  Americans, at least 300 a day.   Biden's bureaucrats like Jaddou are literally allowing deadly  fentanyl to easily flow into our communities and kill our children.   My amendment is supported by the National Immigration Center for  Enforcement, NumbersUSA, and the American Accountability Foundation.   I urge my colleagues to support my amendment and hold Ms. Jaddou  accountable for her blatant disrespect for the law of our Nation.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I do appreciate my colleague on the other  side of the aisle and his efforts to promote border security.   He and I have had conversations about the border. I realize that he  represents a district on the border, and I appreciate his sincere  concern for what is taking place.   Unfortunately, we do have an invasion. My colleague mentioned that  much of the fentanyl that is coming into our country is being found at  the ports of entry.   We know that it is being found at the ports of entry, but  unfortunately, our Border Patrol agents are overrun, they are  overworked, and there is just too large of a surge for them to handle  everything that is happening at the border.   Certainly, we want more funding to secure the border, but we don't  want more funding for our Border Patrol agents to simply be process  agents and bring people into our country in these mass amounts that we  are seeing.   I do appreciate my colleague and his efforts to work with us to  secure the southern border, and I look forward to future conversations,  as well.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise today to offer my amendment that  utilizes the Holman Rule to reduce the salary of Under Secretary of  Homeland Security for Intelligence and Analysis, Kenneth Wainstein.   In 2020, Mr. Wainstein claimed that President Donald Trump's  leadership  [[Page H4685]]  was a threat to the rule of law and endorsed Joe Biden for President of  the United States.   I will tell you what is a threat to the rule of law: blatantly  violating Federal immigration law and intentionally facilitating a  complete and total invasion at our southern border.   I will tell you what is a threat to the rule of law: refusing to  cooperate with State and local law enforcement officials as required  under Section 287(g) of the Immigration and Nationality Act.   I will tell you, Mr. Chair, what is a threat to the rule of law:  pursuing a radical open border agenda, purposefully and willfully  circumventing every safeguard, check, and balance required by law,  allowing terrorists and deadly drugs like fentanyl to freely flow into  our great country.   This administration has presided over the largest influx of illegal  immigrants in American history. Since they took power, there have been  over 6 million illegal crossings of our southern border. That's right-- 6 million.   Under this administration's watch, illicit fentanyl has killed more  than 100,000 American citizens. Furthermore, 151 people whose names  appear on the terrorist watch list were stopped.   I applaud our brave men and women who serve as our Customs and Border  Patrol agents who were able to detain these 151 people who are on the  terrorist watch list.   They were trying to cross our southern border, an all-time record of  known terrorists on the watch list crossing into our country, beating  the previous record also held by the Biden administration in fiscal  year 2022. This is more than the encounters in all fiscal years 2017,  2018, 2019, and 2020 combined.   In August, we discovered that a smuggler with ties to ISIS was  helping migrants enter the United States from Mexico. This madness  needs to end.   This has all occurred on the Under Secretary of Homeland Security for  Intelligence and Analysis, Mr. Wainstein's, watch.   The American people deserve to have a Department of Homeland Security  committed to securing the homeland, not sitting idly by as terrorists  flock across our wide open southern border.   My amendment is supported by the National Immigration Center for  Enforcement, NumbersUSA, and the American Accountability Foundation.   I urge my colleagues to support my amendment and hold Mr. Wainstein  accountable for not doing his job and for his role in facilitating the  worst border crisis in our Nation's history.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    May I inquire as to how much time is remaining.    Mr. Chair, I would agree with my colleague on the other  side of the aisle. We do want to sit down and have a conversation.   We realize we are in divided government right now, and that is the  process that we are currently working on. We are trying to avoid doing  things as normal as they have been done since the mid-1990s here in  Washington, D.C.   We do not want to govern and fund the entire government with a  straight up and down vote ``yes'' or ``no.''   We don't want continuing resolutions or omnibus bills. We want to go  through the funding of the Federal Government bill by bill, sit down,  and work with our colleagues on the other side of the aisle.   This will be bipartisan. This will be bicameral. We do not have the  majority in the Senate. We will have to come together in conference and  hash out our differences and work with one another.   I do agree with my colleague that we are going to have to work  together in a bipartisan, bicameral way to fund the Federal Government.   I understand that there are a lot of scary numbers of people who  would be impacted by a shutdown, but that is why this week we are here,  passing four appropriations bills to fund the Federal Government, to  avoid a full government shutdown.   There may be a partial shutdown for a short amount of time, but I  believe that we can come together and alleviate that and come to a  resolution soon.   We can do our jobs. We are passing the Department of Defense bill. We  have that on the floor. We are also bringing up the Department of  Homeland Security bill, the State and foreign ops, and the ag bill. We  can fund these parts of the Federal Government.   Mr. Chair, again, I urge my colleagues to support my amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise today to offer my amendment that  utilizes the Holman Rule to reduce the salary of the U.S. Immigration  and Customs Enforcement Assistant Director, Office of Immigration  Program Evaluation, Claire Trickler-McNulty, to $1.   Ms. McNulty needs to be held accountable for her blatant disregard of  our Nation's national security. Ms. McNulty is an advocate for open  borders and is implementing policies that encourage illegal entry.  [[Page H4686]]    Ms. McNulty admitted publicly that she stayed at the Department of  Homeland Security during the Trump administration to sabotage border  enforcement.   Ms. McNulty worked for an organization known as KIND where she  provided legal services for illegal aliens to fight deportation and  stay in the country even though they broke our laws and entered America  illegally.                                time  2100    Now this open borders advocate is supposed to help protect America's  cross-border crime and illegal immigration that threaten national  security when she clearly has no interest in following the law and  doing either of these things.   The appointment of Ms. McNulty is a prime example of the Biden-Harris  administration's ignorance to the importance of securing the border.  Not only is she an open borders fanatic, but she was behind an $80  million no-bid contract that the DHS Inspector General criticized as  improper.   The Biden administration has essentially closed ICE down. They do  nothing about people entering the country illegally, that has been  shown repeatedly. Just look at the 151 terrorists on the terror watch  list that have entered America on Biden and McNulty's watch.   During Ms. McNulty's tenure at ICE, instead of protecting our borders  and enforcing our laws, ICE now is acting more like a social service  agency for illegals.   ICE is even partnering with groups that campaign for ICE to be  abolished, that give aid to illegal aliens, and that award contracts  that strictly prohibit tackling the whereabouts of illegal aliens.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support my amendment and hold Ms.  McNulty accountable for doing her job, or not, and for her role in  facilitating the worst border crisis in our Nation's history.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I would remind Members that Ms. McNulty only  stayed in the Trump administration, as she was quoted, to sabotage  border security efforts. That is not genuine. That is un-American. It  is not dutiful.   There are many things that we are doing right now to avoid a  shutdown. I certainly do not want a government shutdown. That is why my  colleagues do not want a government shutdown. That is why we are  debating these four bills and why we are debating the amendments to  these four bills.   I agree with my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, and maybe  many on my own side, that we should have done this sooner. We should  not have waited until the deadline, but here we are, and we are all in  Washington, D.C., working diligently to ensure that the debate is heard  on these bills and we have an opportunity to fund these very important  aspects of the Federal Government.   Mr. Chair, I urge adoption of my amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise today to offer my amendment that  utilizes the Holman rule to reduce the salary for the Officer for Civil  Rights and Civil Liberties, Shoba Sivaprasad Wadhia to $1.   DHS's Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties is staffed with  people that literally want to abolish the U.S. Immigration and Customs  Enforcement, an agency whose mission is to protect America from the  cross-border crime and illegal immigration that threaten national  security.   The woman that leads DHS's Office for Civil Rights and Civil  Liberties once said that illegal immigrant felons, convicted of murder  and rape, shouldn't be eligible for deportation solely because of their  crimes.   Let me repeat that. Wadhia believes that illegal immigrant felons  convicted of murder and rape should not be deported. She has also  advocated for purging the term illegal immigrant and tried to humanize  illegal immigration in order to allow mass illegal immigration.   Throughout her career, this open border bureaucrat has aggressively  pursued pro-amnesty policies and even defended illegal immigrants in  court who should have been deported.   In her current role, she is literally enabling and supporting the  Biden border crisis. Since Joe Biden took office, more than 6 million  illegal aliens have entered America. In August alone, there were  232,972 illegal aliens encountered at the southern border, and that  does not include the got-aways who were not encountered by our brave  Custom and Border Patrol agents.   Customs and Border Patrol have seized 25,500 pounds of fentanyl so  far in fiscal year 2023, a deadly drug that is literally killing our  children.   Mr. Chair, 25,500 pounds is only what was seized at the border, not  what is still flowing freely into our country. Biden's bureaucrats are  literally allowing deadly fentanyl to easily flow into our communities.   She has also been a major part of the Federal Government's obsession  with diversity, equity, and inclusion, consistently forcing woke  policies down the throats of public servants. These woke Federal  policies shouldn't be embedded in our Nation's border and national  security policies. These misguided agency initiatives need to come to  an end.   My amendment is supported by the National Immigration Center for  Enforcement, NumbersUSA, and the American Accountability Foundation. I  urge my colleagues to support my amendment and hold Shoba Wadhia  accountable for her going rogue in an administration that has ignored  the rule  [[Page H4687]]  of law and has facilitated the worst border crisis in our Nation's  history.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, legislating is beautiful. It is great to  actually be down here debating the real issues that Americans are faced  with day in and day out.   I do agree with my colleague on the other side of the aisle that we  should have been debating this bill on June 22, but here we are. It is  our responsibility to pass these appropriations bills, 12 individual  appropriations bills in total, to the Senate.   What the Senate does is up to them and their Chamber. This is our  House and it is our responsibility to do our part of our jobs. That is  exactly what we are doing tonight.   I, too, would like to see our border secured. And I look forward to  my colleague on the other side of the aisle joining us to support H.R.  2 to secure the border. I can tell he is very, very enthusiastic about  actually accomplishing something rather than just throwing money at a  problem and creating more processing agents.   I can see the sincerity and hear the sincerity in his voice that he  wants a secure Nation and secure borders, especially since he  represents a district on the southern border and encounters our brave  Border Patrol agents each and every day.   My colleague has brought up several times tonight that you cannot  have punishment without a trial. Well, this Holman rule is part of our  House rules. We are a self-governing, majority rule body. The Holman  rule is here in place to hold unelected bureaucrats accountable.   If my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have any sort of  qualm with punishment without trial, I would encourage them to visit  our January 6 prisoners in the D.C. jail.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
