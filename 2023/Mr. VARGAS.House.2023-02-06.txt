 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy of  Judy Handler.   Judy was born in Romania in 1935. After an upbringing fractured by  World War II, Judy and her family fled the postwar communist regime,  escaping through Europe to Israel. Judy's arduous childhood taught her  the power of human compassion, something her family says saved her life  more than once.   Judy then came to the United States and quickly found the love of her  life, Dr. Jerry Handler. The couple married and moved to California,  where they spent 65 years making San Diego their home.   The thing that Judy was most proud of was the loving family she built  with her husband. Having extended her heart so fully to her family and  community, it is no wonder that Judy is deeply missed.   Mr. Speaker, I send my condolences to Jerry and the family, and I  honor her courage, curiosity, and compassion. May her memory be a  blessing.                            ____________________
