 Mr. Chairman, this bill was not rushed. It  is long overdue. I recently joined our colleague and civil rights icon,  Congressman   John Lewis, on the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma,  commemorating the march and the fight for the right to vote.   We can never forget how many people have risked and lost their lives  for that right. Fifty-four years later, our election system is still  stacked against  [[Page H2394]]  many Americans. Some eligible voters are still prohibited from voting  by mail and can't make it to the polls.    Some eligible voters have still been unfairly purged from the rolls,  and some communities still do not have enough polling locations,  leading to long lines.   We need justice. We need to expand the fixes that have been proven to  work in so many of our States, and that is exactly what H.R. 1 does.   If we are for the people, not just the ones we think will vote for  us, then we should be for this bill.
