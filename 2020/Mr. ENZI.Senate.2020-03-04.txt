 Mr. President, reserving the right to object, if this  unanimous consent were passed without a vote or even debate, that would  become law. Passage of this request could infringe on the  constitutional right of my constituents and many others across the  United States. I believe firmly that would be the case and could even  result in criminal charges against law-abiding firearms owners. So I  object.
