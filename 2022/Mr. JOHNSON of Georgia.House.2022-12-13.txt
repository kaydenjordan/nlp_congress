 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a  member of my staff, Joshua Smith, who was recently diagnosed with a  rare form of cancer known as chordoma.   Classified as a rare cancer of the spine and skull, chordoma is  diagnosed in thousands of people worldwide every year, about 300 of  whom live in the United States.   In honor of Josh and others diagnosed every year, I introduced a  resolution last week to help shine a light on the need for more  research and awareness of this kind of cancer which is very rare.   Thankfully, Josh is recovering and back at work, but his illness  serves as an important reminder of the need to bolster research and  funding to combat cancers of all kinds. Fighting cancers, particularly  rare forms like chordoma, can and should bring us together,   Mr. Speaker, I ask all my colleagues for their support for this  resolution.                            ____________________
