 Mr. Chair, I rise in support of protecting women and girls  in sports, and protect them from what? Protect them from this, very  simply: Cheating. It is cheating.   This is why we love sports so much. It is because of the fairness  element of it. It is why we don't allow deflated footballs or why we  don't allow corked bats or Vaseline on a baseball. The list goes on and  on. It is why we have referees and umpires and line judges, because we  want it to be fair. That is one of the great things about sports.   If we are going to allow men into women's sports, why have any laws  or rules about doping or steroids whatsoever? Why should any sports  regulate doping or steroids if you are going to let men into women  sports? It makes no sense at all. I beg that question. Anybody have an  answer?   I don't hear an answer. I will beg this other last question for a  moment while I have a minute. We are not talking about real women  competing in women's sports; we are talking about real boys, real men  competing in women's sports. I will leave it at that.
