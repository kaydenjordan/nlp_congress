 Madam President, Washington, DC, is our Nation's Capital.  There is perhaps no city in America more capable of demonstrating the  idea of the United States as a melting pot than is the District of  Columbia. Here, you find people from every walk of life. It is the seat  of our national government, where people from across the country come  to work, seek an education, engage with history, witness what goes on  here, and take look at our Nation's monuments and historical venues  that can be found here.   Washington, DC, in short, belongs to all Americans. Tragically, a  visible increase in crime has plagued DC. It is backed by numbers, felt  by residents, and seen by millions of visitors.   Since March of last year, crime in DC is up 25 percent. Homicides are  up 30 percent, and motor vehicle theft is up 110 percent--110 percent.  [[Page S688]]    Despite being in the midst of a crime wave, the DC City Council  passed a bill that reduced criminal penalties for violent crimes,  including homicide, robbery, and carjacking.   Now, what message does that send?   It is such poor logic that Mayor Bowser opposed the bill, admitting  that ``this bill doesn't make us safer.'' She is absolutely right; it  doesn't make us safer. Yet the DC City Council chose to override her  veto and force this through to make it the law of the land, even though  it doesn't make us safer. It makes things much, much worse, and it  makes things worse in many of the same ways that DC residents are  already suffering.   When the DC City Council is to the left of Mayor Bowser, we have a  serious problem. When carjackings are up 110 percent, this shouldn't be  a partisan issue. Even President Biden telegraphed in a recent tweet:         I don't support some of the changes D.C. Council put       forward over the Mayor's objections--such as lowering       penalties for carjackings.        If the Senate votes to overturn what DC Council did--I'll       sign it.    President Biden is right. Now is not the time to get soft on crime.   This is, by the way, a good time to demonstrate that this is not or  should not be a partisan issue. How fitting is it that this bill, once  it is passed by the Senate, is expected to be the first piece of  legislation signed into law by President Biden during this Congress. It  is also fitting that the House sponsor of this bill is none other than  second-term Congressman  Andrew Clyde, a Republican and a member of the  House Freedom Caucus. So if this bill is able to unite the House  Freedom Caucus and President Biden, it is doing something right.   Now, it is not often that I find myself in the company of President  Biden and Mayor Bowser. We have already seen this play out with the  campaign to ``defund the police.'' Cities with this disposition quickly  discovered that lawlessness begets anarchy. Since the campaign began,  crime has skyrocketed, and police resignations have soared. What  started as a series of calls for justice culminated at a 25-year high  in the national crime rate. Let us not make the same mistake twice--not  here, not now. We can't afford to make such a mistake.   Voting for this resolution presents an opportunity for my Democratic  colleagues to make a distinction. Will you join us in a bipartisan  recognition that we cannot endanger the lives of DC residents by  allowing this soft-on-crime bill to go into effect, or will you stand  with the DC City Council and put politics above public safety?   I emphatically support Senator Hagerty's resolution of disapproval  because the residents and visitors of this city have a reasonable  expectation of safety. I encourage my friends across the aisle to  support this commonsense resolution and send a message that the  Democratic Party is not beholden to its fringes, particularly where, as  here, its fringes would lead to increased crime rate and additional  unnecessary suffering.
