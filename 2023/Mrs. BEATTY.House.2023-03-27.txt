 Mr. Speaker, to our Special Order Congressional Black  Caucus chairman, Congressman Jonathan Jackson, it is my honor to stand  here with you to thank you for your leadership and for all that you are  doing--to be a Black man standing, talking about the equal rights  amendment with us as members of the Congressional Black Caucus.   Mr. Speaker, it also gives me great pleasure to be here tonight as  the ninth woman to chair the Congressional Black Caucus, standing  alongside with my colleagues as we pay tribute to countless  advancements, achievements, and hard-fought victories by Black women to  advance the equal rights amendment.   Let me just say, what an honor to thank the chairwomen of tonight's  Special Order Hour, Congresswoman Cori Bush and Congresswoman Ayanna  Pressley.   You will hear tonight words like Sojourner, truth-tellers, fighters  for freedom--that is just what you are. My sister, my friend, thank you  for all that you do.   We stand here tonight on the heels of Black History Month, in the  heart of Women's History Month, and we do so at such a critical time in  our Nation's history. We stand on the shoulders of giants. Sheroes who  paved the way for the fight for civil rights and women's rights today,  for women like us in this room and countless women across the Nation.   Women like Mary Church Terrell, ``unbought and unbossed'' Shirley  Chisholm, Barbara Jordan, Flo Kennedy, Pauli Murray, Aileen Hernandez  who were instrumental in elevating the cause of women's equality in the  ERA.   Women like we have heard about already, Senator Spearman to  Lieutenant Government Stratton, to our very own Jennifer McClellan of  Virginia. Black women led the way.   It is interesting when we say: What did it get us? Whose shoulders do  we stand on?   It seems fitting for me to say today, as we bring members of Delta  Sigma Theta Sorority to the Capitol to fight for some of those same  rights as they did in 1913 when, yes, it was 22 Black women who brought  up the rear of the march for the women's suffrage march.                                time  2000    It is important for me to highlight today, on this chart, nine women  have served as leaders of the Congressional Black Caucus, making  history fighting for equal rights.   But for that, we would not have, as noted here, Vice President Kamala  Harris and Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson.   We would not have two Black women in America today who are CEOs of  Fortune 100 companies--just two.   We would not have in the Halls of this Capitol two women's statues,  Rosa Parks, brought to the Capitol by Members--us--fighting for  justice, and we would not have from the State of Florida one of their  two statues, Mary McLeod Bethune.   Nor would we have the only woman when we started, in 1971, in the  Congressional Black Caucus--no other than Shirley Chisholm.   Nor would we have Charity Edna Earley, the first Black officer in the  Women's Army Auxiliary Corps.   We have come a long way, and we could put petitions and posters  around this whole Chamber about why we came today.   Mr. Speaker, let me conclude by saying that I am joining my  colleagues to demand Congress act to finally adopt the equal rights  amendment into the United States Constitution because, as I love  saying, when women succeed, America succeeds.   The late Maya Angelou stated: ``Each time a woman stands up for  herself, without knowing it possibly, without claiming it, she stands  up for all women.''   Today, Mr. Speaker, we stand up with Congresswoman Bush and  Congresswoman Pressley.
