 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that debate  [[Page H3658]]  under clause 1(c) of rule XV on a motion to suspend the rules relating  to H.R. 7573 be extended to 1 hour.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (H.R. 7573) to direct the Architect of the Capitol to replace  the bust of Roger Brooke Taney in the Old Supreme Court Chamber of the  United States Capitol with a bust of Thurgood Marshall to be obtained  by the Joint Committee on the Library and to remove certain statues  from areas of the United States Capitol which are accessible to the  public, to remove all statues of individuals who voluntarily served the  Confederate States of America from display in the United States  Capitol, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 7573         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. REPLACEMENT OF BUST OF ROGER BROOKE TANEY WITH                     BUST OF THURGOOD MARSHALL.         (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:        (1) While sitting in the United States Capitol, the Supreme       Court issued the infamous Dred Scott v. Sandford decision on       March 6, 1857. Written by Chief Justice Roger Brooke Taney,       whose bust sits inside the entrance to the Old Supreme Court       Chamber in the United States Capitol, this opinion declared       that African Americans were not citizens of the United States       and could not sue in Federal courts. This decision further       declared that Congress did not have the authority to prohibit       slavery in the territories.        (2) Chief Justice Roger Brooke Taney's authorship of Dred       Scott v. Sandford, the effects of which would only be       overturned years later by the ratification of the 13th, 14th,       and 15th Amendments to the Constitution of the United States,       renders a bust of his likeness unsuitable for the honor of       display to the many visitors to the United States Capitol.        (3) As Frederick Douglass said of this decision in May       1857, ``This infamous decision of the Slaveholding wing of       the Supreme Court maintains that slaves are within the       contemplation of the Constitution of the United States,       property; that slaves are property in the same sense that       horses, sheep, and swine are property; that the old doctrine       that slavery is a creature of local law is false; that the       right of the slaveholder to his slave does not depend upon       the local law, but is secured wherever the Constitution of       the United States extends; that Congress has no right to       prohibit slavery anywhere; that slavery may go in safety       anywhere under the star-spangled banner; that colored persons       of African descent have no rights that white men are bound to       respect; that colored men of African descent are not and       cannot be citizens of the United States.''.        (4) While the removal of Chief Justice Roger Brooke Taney's       bust from the United States Capitol does not relieve the       Congress of the historical wrongs it committed to protect the       institution of slavery, it expresses Congress's recognition       of one of the most notorious wrongs to have ever taken place       in one of its rooms, that of Chief Justice Roger Brooke       Taney's Dred Scott v. Sandford decision.        (b) Removal of Bust of Roger Brooke Taney.--Not later than       45 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the       Joint Committee on the Library shall remove the bust of Roger       Brooke Taney in the Old Supreme Court Chamber of the United       States Capitol.        (c) Replacement With Bust of Thurgood Marshall.--        (1) Obtaining bust.--Not later than 2 years after the date       of the enactment of this Act, the Joint Committee on the       Library shall enter into an agreement to obtain a bust of       Thurgood Marshall, under such terms and conditions as the       Joint Committee considers appropriate consistent with       applicable law.        (2) Placement.--The Joint Committee on the Library shall       place the bust obtained under paragraph (1) in the location       in the Old Supreme Court Chamber of the United States Capitol       where the bust of Roger Brooke Taney was located prior to       removal by the Architect of the Capitol under subsection (b).       SEC. 2. REMOVAL OF CERTAIN STATUES AND BUST.         (a) Removal.--Not later than 45 days after the date of the       enactment of this Act, the Joint Committee on the Library       shall remove the statue of Charles Brantley Aycock, the       statue of John Caldwell Calhoun, the statue of James Paul       Clarke, and the bust of John Cabell Breckinridge from any       area of the United States Capitol which is accessible to the       public.        (b) Storage of Statues.--The Architect of the Capitol shall       keep any statue and bust removed under subsection (a) in       storage until the Architect and the State which provided the       statue or bust arrange for the return of the statue or bust       to the State.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on the measure under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I bring this legislation to the floor today on behalf of  the Committee on House Administration. I thank our chair, Congresswoman  Zoe Lofgren, for her leadership. I thank Ranking Member Rodney Davis  for his friendship and leadership on our committee. I thank Mr. Davis,  and as I said to him privately, I thank him for the spirit in which he  has approached this important but delicate issue.  [[Page H3659]]    Recognizing the issue of removing Confederate statues from the  Capitol has been simmering for years. Since I recognize that, I will  now approach the issue today with the utmost respect for those who are  opposed to the goal of the legislation. But I ask the dissenters to  consider that America has been a divided nation since its founding, and  it is past time for us to close this chapter of American history by  removing statues that depict an era that caused enormous pain to  African-American citizens.   Mr. Speaker, as you, I grew up in the rural, segregated South.  Commonplace were Confederate flags and monuments on public property,  honoring Confederate soldiers and the Confederacy. Many Southern  jurisdictions are now voluntarily removing these statues.   President Abraham Lincoln won the 1860 general election by winning 18  of 29 States. The 11 States that Lincoln failed to carry were  slaveholding States. These States were fearful that Lincoln would find  a way to end slavery and deprive slave owners of their so-called  property.   Eleven Southern States, after Lincoln was elected, immediately  seceded from the Union, forming the Confederate States of America. The  CSA elected its leadership. They printed a currency and stood up a  military.   At Fort Sumter on April 12, 1861, the Confederate States of America  took military action against the United States of America. For the  following 4 years, more than 600,000 Americans lost their lives on the  battlefield, including, I might say, African-American soldiers who  fought for the Union.   This was not a war between the States; it was a war against the  United States of America by 11 Southern States.   When the Union finally won the war, and both sides buried their dead,  4 million slaves were granted their freedom by the signing of the  Emancipation Proclamation and passage of the 13th Amendment.                                time  1415    In 1864, each State was granted the privilege to donate two statues  of deceased persons to be displayed in the Capitol that depict the  history of their State. These statues are now known as the National  Statuary Hall Collection. Approximately 10 of these statues depict men  who volunteered to fight against the United States in the Civil War.   All of these statues were donated many decades after the Civil War.  Like many other statues around the country honoring members of the CSA,  and particularly those erected in the South, these 10 statues were not  donated and installed in the Capitol until the 1900s, during the height  of Jim Crow.   Many Americans see these statues and the timing of their placement as  a means to intimidate African Americans and to perpetuate the notion of  white supremacy. We must not continue to honor these combatants by  allowing their images to be on display in the Capitol.   The bill before us today also identifies several other statues for  removal or replacement that are not part of the National Statuary Hall  Collection, including the bust of Chief Justice Roger B. Taney, who  authored the 1857 Supreme Court decision of Dred Scott v. Sandford,  which ruled that slaves could not be considered citizens and that  Congress did not have the ability to ban slavery. This opinion, Mr.  Speaker, is regarded as possibly the Supreme Court's worst decision of  all time, and the 7-2 decision was a major factor contributing to the  war.   Another bust not part of the collection is of Vice President John  Breckinridge, 1857 to 1861. In 1860, Mr. Speaker, Breckinridge ran for  President on the Southern Democratic ticket and he lost.   During the Civil War, Breckinridge served in the United States Senate  from Kentucky but became a traitor and enlisted in the Confederate  military, and he was assigned to the army of Mississippi stationed in  Jackson, Mississippi, achieving the rank of major general. He was  expelled from the Senate. Jefferson Davis then appointed him as  Secretary of War. After the war, he fled the country for several years.   So I ask my colleagues, I ask America: Does this bust deserve to  stand outside of the Senate Chamber? I would hope that your answer to  that question will be no.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to answer the summons of our time by  voting to remove all of these offensive statues from the Capitol of the  United States of America.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (Ms.  Pelosi), the Speaker of the House.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Clyburn), the Democratic whip,  the gentleman representing the Sixth Congressional District of South  Carolina, the State where the Civil War began, who is a national expert  on American history, having been a former history teacher, as I recall.                                time  1430     Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from South  Carolina an additional 1 minute.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Let me thank the gentleman from Illinois. I am just delighted that he  mentioned that his home State, the State of Illinois, was, in fact, the  home of Abraham Lincoln.   I am a student of history and love to read that portion of our  history, and I recall that many people believe that it was the  Emancipation Proclamation on January 1 of 1863 that legally ended  slavery in America. The Emancipation Proclamation, as great as it was,  was an executive order.   It was the 13th Amendment, as the gentleman mentioned, that legally  ended slavery in America; thereby freeing 4 million slaves, most of  whom lived in the South.   Mr. Speaker, you should know, and to my friend from Illinois, that it  was on January 31, 1865, a few days after Lincoln's re-election, that  this body, this body, the House of Representatives, passed the 13th  Amendment to the Constitution. It required the ratification of 27  States.   The gentleman from Illinois' home State was the first State, on  February 1, 1865 to ratify the 13th Amendment. My State of North  Carolina was the 26th State, and the State of Georgia was the final  State to ratify the 13th Amendment on December 6, 1865.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr.  Hoyer), the State which is the home of both Chief Justice Taney and the  first African American Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, the  Honorable Thurgood Marshall.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee), a passionate advocate for  underserved communities.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from California.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time each side  has remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Raskin), a member of the House Committee on  Administration, a great constitutional scholar and friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. Kennedy).   Mr. Speaker, before he speaks, the history that I have read over the  years suggests to me that, on January 31, 1865, when the 13th Amendment  was passed by this body, this Chamber, Mr. Kennedy, the gallery was  full of White abolitionist women from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts  who waved handkerchiefs and cheered for a prolonged period of time,  cheering the 13th Amendment.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Mississippi (Mr. Thompson), the chairman of the Committee on Homeland  Security, a great warrior of many years, Mr. Bennie Thompson.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), from the 18th District of  Texas, a senior member of the Committee on the Judiciary, Committee on  Homeland Security, and the author of H.R. 40, Ms. Jackson Lee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes time to the  gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Mfume), my friend, who is not only the  representative of a district in Maryland, but also the former national  president of the NAACP.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  I thank all of the speakers for their eloquent words today.   Mr. Davis, we have talked a lot about President Abraham Lincoln.  There is one thing I failed to mention, and the other speakers failed  to mention as well. And that was, before the ratification of the 13th  Amendment, Lincoln was actually assassinated on April 14, as I recall,  of 1865, and did not live to see the full ratification of the 13th  Amendment, which was the culmination of a lot of his work. So I just  wanted to put that into the Record.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased with the tone of this debate. I don't even  want to call it a debate. I would call it a discussion for the last few  minutes. I feel the bipartisanship in the air, and I thank Mr. Davis so  very much. It is appreciated.   History teaches us that there are times in our history where eras  must be closed, and we must begin a new era in this great Nation.   We need to continue to strive for a more perfect union, and today is  a good example of that.   I ask my colleagues to vote ``yea'' on this legislation. I ask for a  unanimous vote. Hopefully, we can do this by voice vote. That is my  prayer and that is my hope that we will show the world that we are  united on this issue.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
