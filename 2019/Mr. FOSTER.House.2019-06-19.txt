 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Gun Violence  Awareness Month and call upon the Senate to protect the lives of  innocent Americans by passing commonsense gun reform measures that have  already passed the House.   This past February, in my district in Aurora, Illinois, five innocent  people were killed and six police officers injured when a person who  shouldn't legally have had a gun opened fire in a workplace, trying to  kill as many people as he could. And earlier this month, we witnessed  another horrific shooting in Virginia Beach where 12 more innocent  lives were taken.   These tragedies have become too common in America. The victims are  our family members, our friends, and our neighbors.   The House has already passed legislation that would, in fact, cure a  fraction of this epidemic of gun violence, but the Senate refuses to  act.   Commonsense gun reform is supported by an overwhelming majority of  Americans, and Congress has a responsibility to protect innocent lives.  Every American deserves the right to live their lives free from the  fear of violence and without worry that their next trip to work, to  school, or their place of worship may be their last.   Thoughts and prayers are not enough. We cannot wait for the next  tragedy. The Senate must act now.                            ____________________
