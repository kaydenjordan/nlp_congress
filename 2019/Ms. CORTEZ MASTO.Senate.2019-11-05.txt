 Madam President, I come forward today to  recognize the 100th anniversary of the Nevada Farm Bureau Federation.  Founded in 1919, the Nevada Farm Bureau Federation has been a strong  voice for Nevada's farmers and ranchers. Unbeknownst to many, Nevada is  home to some of the largest agricultural operations in the Nation, and  over the past 100 years, the Nevada Farm Bureau Federation has provided  a reliable and steady source of advocacy for the agricultural community  in the Silver State.   On February 25, 1919, Assemblyman Care C. Tidd of Smith, NV,  introduced Nevada Assembly Bill 110 in the Nevada Legislature. The  purpose of the bill was to provide for cooperative agricultural and  home economics extension work in several counties in accordance with  the Smith-Lever Act and provide for the organization of county farm  bureaus. Following formation of an authorized county farm bureau, the  bill directed that bureau as the official body within county for  carrying on extension work in agriculture and home economics in  cooperation with the Cooperative Services Program and the Land-Grant  University System. The first Nevada Farm Bureau office was founded in  Lyon County.   Over the course of the past century, the Nevada Farm Bureau  Federation has evolved from its original form into a private nonprofit  organization and strong advocate for the State's farmers and ranchers,  voicing the concerns of its membership to policymakers on the local,  State and federal levels. Additionally, the Nevada Farm Bureau  Federation continues its century-old partnership with Cooperative  Extension in the Silver State.   The Nevada Farm Bureau Federation is currently made up of 11 county  farm bureau organizations representing nearly 18,000 family members. I  am pleased to recognize the Nevada Farm Bureau's 100 years of service  to Nevadans and our great State and wish the group well in continuing  its work on behalf of farmers and ranchers for many years to  come.                            ____________________
