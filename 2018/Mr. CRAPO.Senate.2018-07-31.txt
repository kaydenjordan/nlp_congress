 Mr. President, I agree with my colleague that homeowners  affected by flood disasters would benefit from greater certainty  through a longer-term reauthorization. I would agree that meaningful  reform is necessary to sustain the National Flood Insurance Program,  NFIP. As chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, it is my goal to  bring bipartisan reform to the program. Our Nation has seen some  devastating disasters involving floods and related natural disasters,  especially in the last two decades. With those disasters, the NFIP has  amassed significant debt to the US Treasury. The underlying program is  not structurally sound and too few people are protected from flood  risk. Comprehensive reforms to the program are important to improve the  program's fiscal condition, ensure more homeowners are covered against  the risk of loss from flooding, and enable the program to better serve  current policyholders.   I agree with Senator Enzi. There is still work to be done to make the  NFIP  [[Page S5506]]  more sustainable. Any long-term reauthorization must include important  bipartisan reforms. While short-term extensions are not ideal, short- term extensions afford Congress needed time to address numerous  concerns.    Yes.
