 Madam Speaker, I include in the Record the  following letter to Chairman Takano regarding H.R. 7939, the Veterans  Auto and Education Improvement Act of 2022.                                      Congress of the United States,                                        House of Representatives,                                  Washington, DC, December 21, 2022.        Chairman Takano, Our nation's servicemembers and veterans       epitomize the spirit of service to one's nation that is       embedded into the soul of our nation. The men and women who       serve in the United States Armed Forces exemplify an       unparalleled degree of bravery, selflessness, and patriotism.       One of those men is the late Sgt. Wolfgang Kyle Weninger,       affectionately known by family and friends as, ``Wolf.'' Sgt.       Weninger served our country honorably in the United States       Marine Corps and was selected to serve in the elite Marine       Forces Special Operations Command. Tragically, Wolf passed       away as the result of an accident that occurred during a       training exercise. In the words of his father, Wolf ``lived       as a Marine and died as one.''        Sgt. Weninger's memory deserves to be honored, which is why       I urge passage of the Student Veterans Emergency Relief Act       of 2022, which includes the language of my legislation, H.R.       7746, the Sgt. Wolf Kyle Weninger Veterans Education Fairness       Act of 2022. As a result of Wolf's death, his brother, who       was also serving in the Armed Forces, sought a sole       survivorship discharge in order to return home to support his       grieving family. The unintended consequence of this discharge       being granted was that, despite having served over two years       serving in the United States Armed Forces, he did not meet       the three-year requirement of continuous service to qualify       for assistance under the Post-9/11 Veterans Educational       Assistance Act.        Veterans like Sgt. Weninger's brother should not be       disadvantaged as a result of unforeseen circumstances that       compel them to leave the service and support their family       amidst a tragedy. Access to educational assistance under the       modern G.I. Bill is of paramount importance for veterans       seeking to make a successful transition into civilian life       and underscores our nation's commitment to support those who       have fought for our freedoms. This discrepancy that exists       under current law, which prevents veterans from accessing       financial assistance through the G.I. Bill solely because       they were forced to seek a sole survivorship discharge, is       fundamentally unfair.        Fortunately, H.R. 7746 fixes this problem. My legislation       provides a simple but important correction to existing law,       amending Title 38 of the United States Code to provide for       the eligibility of educational assistance under the Post-9/11       Educational Assistance Program of certain veterans who       received a sole survivorship discharge. The measure will       ensure that any servicemember who has completed 30 continuous       days of active duty service, and was then forced to leave       their position as a result of seeking a sole survivorship       discharge, remains eligible for the educational assistance       afforded under the G.I. Bill. If passed, it will permanently       rectify the existing flaw in federal law that prevents       honorable veterans who sought a sole survivorship discharge       from receiving educational assistance.        I urge you and all of my colleagues to support this       commonsense legislation, and to uphold Congress' sworn duty       to support the men and women who risk their lives so that       every American may remain free.            Sincerely,                                                    David. P Joyce,                                                Member of Congress.
