The estimated total value of these       additional items is $882 million. These additions will not       result in an increase to the total estimated MDE value of       $1.57 billion. The total estimated case value will remain       $2.81 billion.        (iv) Significance: The proposed sale will enhance the       recipient's PATRIOT missile system to improve its missile       defense capability, defend its territorial integrity, and       deter threats for regional stability.        (v) Justification: This proposed sale serves U.S. national,       economic, and security interests by supporting the       recipient's continuing efforts to modernize its armed forces       and to maintain a credible defensive capability.
