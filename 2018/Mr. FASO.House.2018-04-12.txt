 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank G.T. Thompson, my colleague  from Pennsylvania, our subcommittee chairman on the Nutrition  Subcommittee for his leadership.   G.T. Thompson deeply feels about the condition that people have who  may be living in poverty, who may be suffering from food insecurity for  themselves and their family. And I say to Chairman Thompson that it has  been a pleasure to serve for the last 15 months under his leadership on  the Nutrition Subcommittee.   The reforms that we are seeking to implement in H.R. 2 in the SNAP  program, in this 2018 farm bill, are truly intended to assist people  out of dependency and into employment.   I have heard from so many employers throughout my district in the  Catskills and Hudson Valley and in central New York that they have jobs  available, but they simply can't find qualified people to meet those  jobs and to fulfill those responsibilities.   In fact, this morning in the Budget Committee, we had the Director of  the Congressional Budget Office before us, and one of the topics that  was raised was the fact that there are very low workforce participation  rates among able-bodied people between 18 and 65 in our Nation. And  this is part of the problem that we have a workforce participation rate  nationally of approximately 63 percent.   In a number of the counties that I represent in the 19th  Congressional District in New York State, that workforce participation  rate for able-bodied, employable people between 18 and 65 hovers at 60  percent or slightly below 60 percent. There are plenty of jobs that are  there, but, unfortunately, people do not have the skills, the training,  sometimes the work ethic, and the notion of what it means to get up and  go to work every day and meet the need of that employer and customers  of that employer.    So this is a real serious issue in our country. If we are going to  deal with the looming fiscal crisis that we have for mandatory spending  programs like Social Security and Medicare, for instance, we need to  get more people in the workforce. We need to create more opportunities  to give people a hand-up, and not simply a handout.   Now, one of the things that is truly important about this SNAP reform  that Chairman Thompson and Chairman Conaway are leading the way in H.R.  2 on, in this 2018 farm bill, is that we are going to make it easier  for people who are on the SNAP program to qualify for the program  without having every nickel of any asset that they possibly have to  count against their qualification.   So, for instance, this legislation will allow a family on SNAP to  have a savings account of up to $2,000 without that counting against  the asset test. Today, that simply isn't the case. So a family that  might need money for fixing their car, or having their kids go to the  orthodontist or the dentist, or some other kind of family emergency--to  buy a washing machine, for instance--they are not even allowed under  SNAP's asset test rules to have a $2,000 savings account. That is  wrong, and it is simply an outmoded notion that we have precluded that.   The other thing that I think is very interesting in this proposal, in  this reform proposal, is that we are going to raise the asset test on  the value of an automobile from about $4,650 to $12,000. I represent a  rural part of upstate New York. My district is larger than the State of  Connecticut. Many times people have to drive 40, 50 miles one way to  get to a job.   Well, we can't expect someone who is struggling with difficult  economic circumstances for them or their family to be able to qualify  for SNAP and have an asset of a vehicle--which they need  [[Page H3200]]  desperately to get to work every day--we can't have that asset limited  to a $4,600 vehicle.                                time  1830    So this legislation which Chairman Thompson and Chairman Conaway are  spearheading would raise that vehicle asset test up to $12,000. So  these are logical, rational things. That asset test has been at $4,650  for many decades now. So these are the kinds of commonsense reforms  that are contained within this proposal that I hope that our colleagues  on the other side of the aisle will pay heed to and carefully study  because we welcome their input in this.   But we also know that the American people are demanding that we have  reform in these programs and that we encourage and we really bring the  job opportunities and the job training counseling to people who are  dependent. There are over 3 million people in the SNAP program today  who are able-bodied adults, who are capable of working, between 18 and  59, who have no children at home. We know that, in today's economy,  many, many parents and many Americans go into the workforce with minor  children at home. They are out there working. They are out there  pitching in trying to improve the lot for themselves and their  families. There is absolutely no reason why an able-bodied adult with  no children whatsoever should not be in a work program and should not  be required to participate in a State-sanctioned, State-supervised  employment counseling and training program.   So these are the things that we are trying to do: increase  opportunity, obviously reduce fraud and people who might be benefiting  from the program who might be working off the books somewhere but still  qualifying for benefits. But that is not the main impetus here. The  main impetus is: How are we going to create more opportunity for people  who need a hand-up in the economic ladder?   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Thompson so much for leading  the way on this. We had numerous hearings and listening sessions,  including one in my district in Schoharie County at SUNY Cobleskill.  The overwhelming consensus in dealing with the Food Stamp program or  SNAP program is that we need to keep it, we need to make sure that  people who are on it and who are able to work have the opportunities  and are certainly encouraged to move into the workforce.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record an article which I wrote in the  Albany Times Union which appeared on April 9, 2018, about the SNAP  reform and the need to include healthy measures for food but also  enhanced work requirements.                [From the Albany Times Union, Apr. 9, 2018]               SNAP Must Include Work, Healthy Food Mandates                            (By Rep. John Faso)         With over 42 million Americans--and over 2.8 million New       Yorkers--receiving critical nutrition assistance, it is a       self-evident fact that the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance       Program (SNAP) helps people in meaningful ways. SNAP reduces       hunger in low income households, and when it provides       benefits to families with children, it has been shown to       improve health outcomes for those children.        Like any program of this size, SNAP is not without flaws.       The program insufficiently promotes self-sufficiency; too       many recipients could be working, but are not.        There continues to be too much fraud and abuse in the       program, and the program also needs to be much more effective       in promoting proper nutrition. Congress will soon reauthorize       SNAP as part of the 2018 Farm Bill and now is the time to fix       the program.        Let's address these issues one at a time.        First, the program needs to better focus on encouraging and       helping non-working recipients find and retain employment.       While many receiving SNAP benefits do work--and others are       seniors, children or disabled, and therefore can't be       expected to work--a large group of those currently receiving       benefits are neither disabled nor employed. In 2016, there       were over 11 million non-disabled people aged 18 through 59       receiving SNAP, who aren't working.        A purpose of benefit programs such as SNAP should be to       help people gain self-sufficiency. We would be more       successful at reducing systemic hunger and poverty if states       required able-bodied adults to participate actively in       employment and training programs that put them on a path       toward stable employment.        Alternatively, if someone does not wish to participate,       they could actively self-select and unenroll from the       program. This approach was successful in increasing earnings       and reducing poverty in the wake of President Bill Clinton's       sweeping welfare reform in the 1990s, and it will work again       if applied to SNAP's current entitlement structure.        Second, fraud and the improper use of benefits is still too       rampant in the SNAP program. Only in Washington is losing       roughly $650 million per year due to fraud and failures in       program integrity considered a ``good job'' because it is a       small percentage of the total amount of taxpayer money spent.       That is still $650 million that is not being used as       intended, which is to feed families.        There must be zero tolerance when it comes to fraud and       abuse. Hiding income, failing to disclose assets, trafficking       benefits or utilizing unscrupulous food vendors are       activities we need to stop. Congress needs to allow state and       local officials who see this fraud right before their eyes to       pursue and penalize this activity.        Finally, the SNAP program is not doing enough to promote       nutrition and reduce childhood obesity. Obesity is an issue       for far too many American families and childhood obesity in       low-income families is growing. The program's title suggests       that it promotes healthy and nutritious food options but does       nothing to limit the ability to purchase products that no one       will argue are part of a healthy diet. Hundreds of millions       of dollars' worth of SNAP benefits are spent on sugary       beverages, and it's past time that Washington prohibits the       use of SNAP benefits to purchase soda. Every dollar not spent       on soda can go toward a healthier alternative. While some       will contend we are limiting choice for the poor, tax dollars       should only pay to encourage healthier choices.        At the same time, we should also fix some of the asset       tests for eligibility, such as allowing a recipient to have a       car worth over $12,000 instead of the $5,000 limit today. If       we expect someone to work, they need a reliable vehicle to       get to the job. We should also allow a recipient to have       savings up to $2,000, without affecting eligibility.        Over the next decade, SNAP benefits will total more than       $630 billion in taxpayer dollars. We must do more to ensure       that we assist able-bodied recipients in joining the job       market, while at the same time continuing to assist those for       whom nutrition assistance is a necessity.
