 Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce in the  Senate, with my colleagues Senators Young, Duckworth, Lee, Coons,  Grassley, Durbin and Paul a bipartisan resolution to repeal the 1991  and 2002 Authorizations for Use of Military Force (AUMF) against Iraq.  This legislation will formally end the authorizations for the Gulf and  Iraq wars--30 and 19 years, respectively, after these AUMFs were first  passed, reasserting Congress' vital role in not only declaring wars,  but in ending them. The repeal of these authorizations also recognizes  the strong partnership the United States now has with a sovereign,  democratic Iraq.   The United States is no longer at war with Iraq and our legal  frameworks should reflect this reality as much as our policy  frameworks, to include the Strategic Framework Agreement that Iraq and  the United States signed in November 2008, which affirms the  establishment of a long-term relationship of cooperation and  friendship, based on the principle of equality in sovereignty and the  rights and principles that are enshrined in the United Nations Charter.   Since 2014, U.S. troops have been in Iraq, alongside Iraqi forces, at  the Government of Iraq's request for assistance in combating the  Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). Current Administration  officials, including President Biden, Secretary of State Blinken,  Secretary of Defense Austin and Commander of the United States Central  Command, General McKenzie, have routinely emphasized that United States  military forces remain in Iraq at the invitation of the Government of  Iraq and in respect to its sovereignty. Recent presidential  administrations have maintained that the 2002 AUMF only serves to  ``reinforce'' any legal authority to combat ISIS provided by the 2001  AUMF and is not independently required to authorize any such  activities. As such, repealing the 1991 AUMF and the 2002 AUMF would  not affect ongoing United States military operations. It would however,  prevent the future misuse of the Gulf and Iraq War authorizations and  strengthen Congressional oversight over war powers.   It is past time to repeal both AUMFs and formally mark the end of the  Iraq War that resulted in a devastating loss of life and wounded tens  of thousands of our troops. It makes no sense that two AUMFs remain in  place against a country that is now a close partner. They serve no  operational purpose, run the risk of future abuse by the President, and  help keep our nation at permanent war.   I am proud to join this group of Senators in introducing a bill to  repeal these outdated and unnecessary authorizations. I hope we can  continue to find bipartisan compromise on these tough war power issues  to include revising and replacing the 2001 AUMF.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce in the  Senate, with my colleagues Senators Young, Duckworth, Lee, Coons,  Grassley, Durbin and Paul a bipartisan resolution to repeal the 1991  and 2002 Authorizations for Use of Military Force (AUMF) against Iraq.

The Nation's continued progress and the socioeconomic  mobility of our citizens are contingent on the education and skills of  the American workforce and its ability to adjust to and fulfill the  needs of the 21st century economy--especially in the wake of the  coronavirus pandemic. Career and technical education (CTE) programs are  vital to every student's education, providing them access to the  important knowledge, skills, and credentials needed to obtain careers  in rapidly growing, high-demand industries. Today, approximately 12.8  million students across the Nation are enrolled in CTE programs offered  by thousands of career academies, comprehensive high schools, CTE high  schools, community colleges, and CTE centers. Through applied learning,  these students obtain workplace skills and technical training that  mirror in-demand positions in the workforce.   In the next decade, millions of skilled workers will be needed to  fill infrastructure positions in the United States, including jobs  related to designing, building, and operating transportation, housing,  telecommunication, and utilities facilities. CTE programs intentionally  match skills with workforce demands, lowering the probability of high  school drop-out and increasing the likelihood of on time graduation  rates. These CTE programs will help fill the estimated 30 million U.S.  jobs available with an average annual income of $55,000 that do not  require a bachelor's degree yet necessitate some level of postsecondary  education.   Across Virginia, I hear about an increase in workforce needs from  frontline health services to manufacturing PPE to contract tracing--the  list goes on. As we see a surge in unemployment overall from the  pandemic, it is essential that we highlight the important role of CTE  in the country's ability to meet the challenges we face in economic  recovery and development, student achievement, and global  competitiveness. In 2018, Congress affirmed the importance of CTE by  passing the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st  Century Act which supports CTE programs in secondary and postsecondary  education. We also need to ensure we continue reskilling and upskilling  workers by supporting workforce development programs.   Today, with my Senate CTE Caucus co-chairs Senator Portman, Senator  Baldwin, and Senator Young and more than half of my colleagues in the  Senate, I am pleased to again introduce a bipartisan resolution to  designate February as Career and Technical Education (CTE) month. CTE  Month encourages students, parents, counselors, educators, and school  leaders to learn more about the diverse educational opportunities  offered in their communities, and recognize the valuable role of CTE in  developing a well-educated and highly skilled workforce in the United  States.   By formally recognizing CTE Month through this resolution, we hope to  bring greater awareness to improving access to high-quality career and  technical education for millions of America's students and our nation's  ongoing economic competitiveness.                            ____________________
