 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in  recognition of the life and legacy of an American hero, Louis  Zamperini.   Louis Zamperini was an Olympic runner who, while serving as an airman  during World War II, was captured and held as a prisoner of war. Many  remember Louis Zamperini as an inspirational symbol of resilience,  athleticism, and service.   The city of Torrance and the residents of our community in the 43rd  Congressional District of California are especially proud and inspired  by Louis Zamperini.   Louis Zamperini was the son of Italian immigrants. He moved to  Torrance, California, at the age of 3 and was a graduate of Torrance  High School. It was during his tenure at Torrance High School that  Zamperini's abilities in track and cross country first gained  notoriety.   Nicknamed the ``Torrance Tornado,'' Louis Zamperini set the national  high school record in the mile at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum in  1934. His record time of 4 minutes 21.2 seconds was unbroken for 20  years.   As a teenager, Zamperini qualified and competed in the 1936 Olympic  Games in Berlin, Germany, where he finished eighth in the 5,000-meter  run. After the Olympics, Zamperini earned a scholarship to the  University of Southern California, where he became one of the  university's most celebrated student athletes.   Louis Zamperini enlisted in the United States Army Air Corps and  served in World War II as a B-24 Liberator bombardier in the 372nd Bomb  Squadron.   During a rescue mission on May 27, 1943, Zamperini's plane crashed  into the sea. Zamperini spent 47 days adrift in a life raft fending off  starvation and fighting to survive. The United States military believed  he had perished in the crash and informed his parents of his death in  June 1943.   In actuality, Zamperini was captured by a Japanese patrol boat and  held as a prisoner of war. Over the next 2 years, he was regularly  beaten and starved. Louis Zamperini was finally liberated following the  Japanese surrender in September of 1945.   Zamperini became an evangelical Christian and gave inspirational  speeches across the country. He also founded the Victory Boys Camp, a  wilderness camp, to assist at-risk youth.   Louis Zamperini passed away on July 2, 2014, in Los Angeles at the  age of 97 years old. Zamperini was married for 54 years to his wife,  Cynthia, who preceded him in death. He was survived by his son, Luke,  his daughter, Cynthia Garris, and his grandson, Clay.   People across the country are familiar with Louis Zamperini's story,  which was told in the 2010 book, ``Unbroken: A World War II Story of  Survival, Resilience, and Redemption,'' by Laura Hillenbrand, which  rose to number one on The New York Times Best Seller list. In 2014,  director Angelina Jolie released a movie about Zamperini adapted from  Hillenbrand's book.   Because of his remarkable athletic abilities and heroic service to  our country, Louis Zamperini will forever be remembered as a hero and  favorite son of Torrance. That is why I am so very proud to announce  that today, in collaboration with California's senior United States  Senator, Dianne Feinstein, I have just introduced a resolution to  rename the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 1433  Marcelina Avenue in Torrance, California, as the Louis Zamperini Post  Office Building. My legislation has the bipartisan support of the  entire California delegation in the House of Representatives.   Over the Memorial Day holiday weekend, as we honor the memory of the  brave military servicemembers who have given their lives for our  country, let us all reflect on the legacy of Louis Zamperini and  countless other American heroes who have sacrificed to protect our  ideals, our democracy, and our country                            ____________________
