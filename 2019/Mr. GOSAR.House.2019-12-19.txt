 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the USMCA but also to  raise a concern about the inclusion of section 230 language of the  Communications Decency Act.   This act gives broad legal immunity to Big Tech, which, in turn, uses  it as a shield from accountability. It is important that this provision  is not--I state ``not''--included in future trade agreements.   The behavior of Big Tech has been the subject of substantial  scrutiny. Much of this scrutiny revolves around the appropriateness of  maintaining this immunity clause.   On a daily basis, new concerns are raised about section 230,  including illegal drug sales, child exploitation, terrorist  recruitment, political bias, revenge porn, deepfakes, and many more.  Section 230 has played a significant role.   When Speaker Pelosi and I agree on an issue, there is some there  there.   I encourage my colleagues to support the USMCA but again raise the  issue about section 230. Its continued merit on how it would apply to  both trade agreements and everyday application demand modification due  to its lack of accountability.
