 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to take some of my time to tell Mr. Duffy:  Just calm down. This is easy. We are all together on this. I want to  make sure he doesn't damage himself in all of the display that he is  doing today.   It is disappointing that we find ourselves on the House floor yet  again to temporarily extend the National Flood Insurance Program's  authorization.   The NFIP provides flood insurance coverage to more than 5 million  families across the country. Communities rely on NFIP for flood maps  and mitigation assistance, and small businesses rely on the NFIP to  pick up the pieces when the inevitable storm hits. Yet the long-term  stability of this critical program continues to fall victim to our  inability to agree on a number of items.   Mr. Speaker, Americans across the country are experiencing natural  disasters of an absolutely catastrophic magnitude. Just this month, the  Camp fire devastated California, amounting to the deadliest and most  destructive wildfire in California history. Current estimates are that  88 individuals have lost their lives and tens of thousands of  structures, including over 13,000 single-family homes, have been  destroyed.   2017 was an absolutely catastrophic year in terms of hurricanes. In  2017, for the first time on record, three Category 4 hurricanes made  landfall in the United States. Hurricane Maria decimated Puerto Rico.   Meanwhile, the administration's National Climate Assessment, which is  a report prepared by 13 Federal agencies and more than 3,000  scientists, recently documented the numerous impacts of our warming  climate. According to the report, climate change is costing billions of  dollars in property damage from sea level rise. High tide flooding has  increased by factors as high as 10 in some communities, and fire season  is now over 80 days longer than a couple of decades ago.   Faced with these realities, we stand here today still lacking a  credible plan to end the partisan problems that we have that has  brought the NFIP to the brink of a lapse several times already in this  Congress.    I, too, and others, are disappointed that we have missed  opportunities to responsibly help homeowners, businesses, and renters  who all need access to affordable flood insurance by taking sensible  steps to stabilize flood insurance premiums, deal with the NFIP's  [[Page H9711]]  debt, and invest in up-to-date and accurate flood maps.   Thankfully, the American people have demanded a change in Washington;  and I am sure that, if we continue to concentrate on this issue, we can  find bipartisanship and get something done.   Given the critical importance of the NFIP to our housing market, I am  pleased that we are taking this small step today of reauthorizing the  program through December 7 to at least avoid its doors from shuttering.  But our work is far from done.   I have led the effort for years to provide long-term reauthorizations  of the NFIP so that we could ensure the affordability and availability  of flood insurance. I will continue to do so in the Financial Services  Committee next Congress.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to  the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Al Green), the ranking member of the  Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations of the Financial Services  Committee and someone who has been extremely active in monitoring the  aftermath of the devastation from Hurricane Harvey.                                time  1645     Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to  the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Crist), a member of the Financial  Services Committee and long-time supporter of affordable flood  insurance coverage.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to  the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Graves), a friend from the opposite  side of the aisle who is a true expert on flood insurance issues.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to  the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), who serves on the  Judiciary Committee, the Homeland Security Committee, and the Committee  on the Budget.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve  the balance of my time    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the  balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, while I would prefer a longer term reauthorization of  the National Flood Insurance Program, I strongly support today's  extension to provide homeowners, businesses, renters, and communities  with the certainty they deserve. Let me just say that I think we are  all aware that for those people who are trying to obtain homeownership  that live in flood zones, they won't be able to do it if they cannot  get the insurance that is provided by the National Flood Insurance  Program. And just think what that is going to do to the real estate  market. So we have to do this in order to deal with the fact that this  program literally shuts down at the end of November.   And let me just say that I have been in cities and towns that have  been devastated by floods and by storms, and I want you to know the  time that I spent after Katrina, helping to get people who were  abandoned on highways, putting them in buses, and traveling down  through the various cities, was heartbreaking. I want you to know that  I went up to Baton Rouge and I was in Mississippi, and I understand the  pain and the destruction that is caused by these storms.   And I am absolutely committed, make no mistake, I remain committed to  putting partisanship aside and working with my colleagues on the  opposite side of the aisle to come together on commonsense reforms that  protect the continued affordability and availability of coverage, a  long-term reauthorization of the NFIP that ensures that affordable  flood insurance continues to be available to communities across our  country. It must be Congress' priority when we start the 116th  Congress.    And let me just say, Mr. Speaker, that despite the fact that my  colleague and chairman of the committee and I worked very hard to try  and deal with some of our concerns and even differences, we not only  both have demonstrated our commitment to long-term NFIP, and while we  did not get exactly where we wanted to go, we were able to provide  protection for those families who were in desperate need of insurance  and to continue, even though we have had to do it on a short-term  basis.   So I would like to take this moment to just thank him for the  opportunity that I have had to work with him. Now, everybody knows we  didn't always agree, but they didn't know what we were laughing about  as we sat next to each other exchanging a few jokes every now and then.  So I am going to miss him as our chairman. I don't know if this is his  last time on the floor and whether or not we are going to be able to  put flood insurance reauthorization into the continuing resolution.   If we are not, perhaps I will see him again, but I don't know. I just  wanted him to know that his presence here in the Congress of the United  States has been noted in the history of the Congress of the United  States, and whether or not he was agreeing or disagreeing, he had a  powerful voice on a powerful committee, and I am going to miss the  times that I have spent with him, good times and bad times, and I just  wish him well on his future. Thank you very much.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
