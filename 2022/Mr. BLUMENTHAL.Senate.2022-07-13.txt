 Madam President, today I rise to recognize Mr.  Adolph ``Bob'' Hirsch, a remarkable man and World War II veteran who  turns 100 on July 23, 2022.   In September 1942, at the age of 20, Mr. Hirsch enlisted in the U.S.  Coast Guard. He would go on to attain the rank of seaman first class,  serving this Nation honorably throughout World War II until 1945.  During this time, Mr. Hirsch served as a gunner's mate on the Coast  Guard Patrol Frigate Annapolis. It was aboard that vessel in the  American theater of operations that Mr. Hirsch was engaged in combat  action against hostile enemy submarine forces.   In September 1945, Mr. Hirsch was also involved in a daring rescue  while serving on the Annapolis. After the Steamship Prince George  caught fire in Ketchikan, AK, several U.S. Coast Guard vessels  responded to the incident, including the Annapolis. Mr. Hirsch was  engaged in lifesaving and port clearance operations, further  demonstrating his remarkable bravery.   Following his time in the Coast Guard, Mr. Hirsch continued his  outstanding legacy of service. He joined the New York City Police  Department and served that city honorably for over 20 years. Since  1976, Mr. Hirsch has resided in Bethlehem, CT, and we are proud he has  chosen to call our great State home.   Mr. Hirsch's tireless service will be an enduring legacy. I applaud  his many accomplishments and hope my colleagues will join me in  congratulating Mr. Bob Hirsch on this milestone of his 100th  birthday.                            ____________________
