 Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Betty Walker of Roaring  Gap, North Carolina. This remarkable and talented woman has been the  coordinator for the Alleghany Memorial Hospital Thrift Shop for 15  years.   Betty began volunteering at the Thrift Shop in 2000 and became  coordinator in 2003. During her time as coordinator, Betty has expanded  and renovated the Thrift Shop in addition to managing its volunteers.   The Alleghany Memorial Hospital Thrift Shop opened in 1991 and has  raised nearly $1 million for Alleghany Memorial Hospital. Those funds  are extremely important in this small county.   In 2011, Betty and the shop's volunteers received the Governor's  Award for Volunteer Service, which recognizes the top 20 volunteers in  North Carolina.   Betty Walker is an extremely dedicated volunteer, a role model for us  all, and a pillar in her community. Alleghany County is fortunate to  call this hardworking citizen one of its own.
