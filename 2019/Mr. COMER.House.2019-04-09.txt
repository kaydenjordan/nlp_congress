 Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 35th  anniversary of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.   For more than three decades, this organization has assisted families  in their times of greatest need and unimaginable pain, and it has  assisted law enforcement agencies with the recovery of more than  290,000 missing children.   Although the Walsh family was the victim of child abduction with a  tragic ending, their story inspired others and began a movement to  create a coordinated national response to assist families like  themselves.   The resulting organization has dutifully carried out their mission of  finding missing children, reducing child sexual exploitation, and  preventing future victimization. They achieved these goals not only by  assisting families during and after their traumatic experiences but by  providing technical assistance and resources to law enforcement and  healthcare professionals.   I am proud that two vital pieces of legislation became law during the  last Congress, the CyberTipline Modernization Act of 2018 and the  Missing Children's Assistance Act of 2018, both of which strengthened  and modernized programs essential to supporting the center's  operations.   I join with the staff, partners, and past and future beneficiaries of  the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children in celebrating  their 35th anniversary.                            ____________________
