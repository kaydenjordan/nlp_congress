 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1328, the ACCESS  BROADBAND Act. I would also like to take this time to thank my  colleague, Representative Tonko, for asking me to partner on this very  important bill. I thank him and his team for this work.   Why is this bill so important? To put it simply, people in every  State of our country, including Indiana, need better access to the  internet.   This is no surprise to us. Every time I am home, back in the Fifth  District, Hoosiers, particularly from rural areas, tell me they are  afraid of being left behind in the 21st century economy because we  continue to be more and more reliant on technology.   I have spoken to many members of the Indiana Farm Bureau who have  voiced their continued concerns with the level of connectivity in  Indiana and, as we have learned, throughout the country. They cannot  wait and hope for new technology to fix their connectivity problems  that have existed for years.   Additionally, today, more and more schools require homework to be  submitted electronically, tests are taken online, and class notes are  posted on school websites. When students can't access the internet,  they often have to travel to a library daily in order to just keep up  with their studies, or they risk falling behind in their classes.   We can't forget about the impact the internet has had on businesses  of all sizes, especially small businesses. This week is National Small  Business Week, so small businesses from across the country are meeting  with Members of Congress or their staff about the obstacles they face  as they work to grow their businesses.   Each year, these advocates highlight the need for the Federal  Government to better support their efforts. A significant part of that  equation is working to ensure better and faster access to the internet,  no matter where their business is located or no matter how large or  small it is.   When small businesses don't have broadband internet access, their  communities suffer, and they miss opportunities to create new jobs,  drive innovation, and increase our country's global competitiveness.                                time  1245    For all these reasons and more, we must do more to support our  communities in an age where internet connectivity is crucial to  success.   Indiana has recognized this critical need and has made a commitment  to invest $100 million in supporting broadband access across the State  for underserved areas. This Next Level Connections program is exactly  the kind of idea that the ACCESS BROADBAND Act will help support. By  making Federal resources easier to access, Indiana will be better able  to support its own internet access efforts.   The ACCESS BROADBAND Act is an important step toward eliminating  broadband access difficulties. This bill will require the National  Telecommunications and Information Administration to create an office  to coordinate all the various Federal efforts that support broadband  deployment and access. This office will perform outreach to communities  in every corner of our country to inform them how they can best support  internet access development. It will also require the office to  standardize applications for financial assistance or grants and work to  create a single application for all Federal broadband support programs.   This bill is about bringing the benefits of broadband communications  into the lives of our constituents. I am glad Congress is acting on a  solution to help address this problem faced not only by Hoosiers but  Americans all across the country.   I thank the gentleman from New York, Representative Tonko, once again  for allowing me to partner with him on this important legislation. I  look forward to working with him in the future on similar issues to  ensure that our country and our constituents are wired and ready to  compete.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues in the House to support this  measure, and I yield back the balance of my time.
