 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2281, which  is an important bill to help thousands of Americans who struggle with  addiction.   This bipartisan, commonsense legislation will give individuals  greater access to medication-assisted treatment, MAT, to help relieve  withdrawal symptoms.   Current law only allows providers to use this treatment once per day  unless they have a waiver to prescribe the medication, and less than 10  percent of providers have that waiver.   This is especially problematic because substance use disorder  treatment programs can take days to accept new patients, leaving many  individuals unable to gain access to immediate treatment and, instead,  leaving patients no choice but to return to the emergency room or the  provider they received MAT from the day prior or, even worse, to take  drugs again to stop their withdrawal symptoms.   Mr. Speaker, this bipartisan legislation puts the individual first  and is part of a collaborative approach to combat addiction of all  types.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues for their work on this important  legislation.
