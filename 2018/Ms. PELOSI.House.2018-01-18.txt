 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. I  commend her for her great leadership as our ranking member on the  Appropriations Committee--as we say, the almighty powerful  Appropriations Committee on which I was proud to serve with the  gentleman, Mr. Frelinghuysen, and Congresswoman Lowey.   Mr. Speaker, I am disappointed, though, that the legislation that is  brought to the floor today falls so very short of our responsibilities  to the  [[Page H533]]  American people. When it comes to considering this bill, which the  Republicans are bragging supports CHIP, it is important to review the  facts. The facts are these: the CHIP proposal that the Republicans  boast was on the floor in October, this or that, was funded by taking  money from other children's programs, and that is why it was not to be  supported by us. It is also important to remember that the CHIP  reauthorization expired September 30.                                time  1745    So here we are with our fourth continuing resolution. That means, on  September 30, we were supposed to not only reauthorize CHIP but to pass  an omnibus bill to fund the government. Republicans were not able to  make the decisions necessary to do that, so we had one extension,  another extension, another extension. This is the fourth extension.   Now, for somebody who doesn't know what a CR is, that is our  Washington lingo. It is a continuing resolution. What it says is that  the funding for the country will be continued at the same rate as it  was in the previous year regardless of the fact that other challenges  have emerged.   So, by engaging in the failure to pass an omnibus bill and engage  instead in these short-term continuing resolutions, this inadequacy  does not give certainty to our military. General Mattis has told us  that the military cannot go on these every-2-weeks, every-month CRs. We  need to know. We need to have an omnibus that recognizes the full  complement of our needs, and they are different from last year.   It does not fund the fight against opioid addiction. We have talked  about this. We have authorized language. We have put up some money. But  throughout our country, there is an opioid epidemic that needs to be  addressed with full funding for it--not just conversation or rhetoric,  but funding.   It does not address some of the crises facing our veterans, whether  it is their infrastructure, housing, whatever, or additional funding  that is needed for our veterans over and above whatever it was last  year, and this ignores that need.   It ignores the fact that we have some issues that we have to address  regarding endangered pensions in our country, which have a direct  relationship to the economic well-being of America's working families,  pensions paid into, pensions having a shortfall, to honor the  responsibility.   It doesn't protect the DREAMers. We could protect the DREAMers in all  of this, but it is missing an opportunity.   This takes us right back to the CHIP. It does not fund community  health centers that provide primary care for 27 million Americans.   So these priorities are bipartisan. Nothing I mentioned on this list  is anything that does not have bipartisan support in the Congress, that  has not been openly discussed--bipartisanship, transparency, unity-- unifying us around these issues. We did not put priorities forward that  were partisan, but those that had bipartisan--strong bipartisan-- support.   So when our colleagues come to the floor and say, ``Oh, we are doing  CHIP,'' CHIP is a wonderful initiative. It was one of the first bills  that I passed and sent to President Obama when I was Speaker of the  House. This is of high value to all of us on both sides of the aisle,  but not high enough of a value to put it in its proper context. So this  reauthorization of CHIP that they are putting here, this funding for  CHIP is not really funding.   Let me just make a distinction. We wanted 10 years for CHIP, to make  it permanent--so we don't have to go through this--and remove all  doubt, remove the uncertainty as to whether this healthcare would be  available to those children who need it. We said, 10 years, you save $6  billion; $6 billion, you save. You do 6 years, as in this bill, you  save $1 billion. Why wouldn't we want to save $6 billion?   Nonetheless, my concern is that they chose to bring a bill to the  floor that isolates CHIP away from the other essentials that are a part  of the delivery of that healthcare service to children. It does not  reauthorize community health centers which provide, as I say, vital  care to 26 million Americans. It does not extend the Medicare extenders  so necessary, especially for our seniors with home visiting care and  other initiatives.   It does not address the Medicaid DSH, disproportionate share  challenge that is across America. Ask your friends in rural America,  especially, about that. Therapy services, diabetes, and teaching health  centers for primary care doctors, all are completely out of this bill.   That is why I am so proud of the legislation introduced by  Congressman McEachin today which has the full complement. It is nothing  additional. It is how we have always proceeded with the priority of  children's health in a package that is about family health and delivery  of service.   As the President, himself, tweeted this morning: ``CHIP should be  part of a long-term solution, not a 30-day or short-term extension.''  We like it 10 years; they have it 6 years. But it shouldn't be in this  bill because this bill is sort of a half-baked facade to make it look  as if we are keeping government open.   We are keeping government debilitated by not addressing, coming to  agreement on the omnibus bill that we know that we have to do that  addresses the needs of our military, as it recognizes the security  provisions in the domestic bill that are about security, whether it is  the State Department, Veterans Affairs, homeland security, or  antiterrorism activities of the Justice Department; and also, the fact  that the strength of our country is measured in many ways: certainly,  our military, which we are very proud of, and the agencies I mentioned,  but also in the health, education, and well-being of the American  people.   So we are here. What does government do?   Government does transportation. How can you, if you are in the  Transportation Department, make commitments when you are on a short  fuse of--what is it?--2 weeks in December, now 4 weeks that they want  to go forward.   Why don't we just settle it? Grow up. Take responsibility. Get this  done for the American people.   Nobody I know wants a shutdown of government--well, maybe except for  the President, who said, ``Our country needs a good shutdown.'' He said  that in May. I think with his experience as President now, he probably  knows there is no such thing as a good shutdown. We don't want a  shutdown.   By the way, if there is one, this would be the first time there would  be a shutdown in recent history that took place when one party had the  White House, had the Senate, and had the House of Representatives, had  full responsibility for managing and for leveraging, for getting the  job done to fund our country for another year with certainty. This has  2-year provisions in what we are negotiating with the Republicans.   So, really, coming to the floor and hiding behind CHIP to hide the  shortcomings and the lack of taking responsibility for our  responsibilities to the American people is really a sad thing. That is  why Mr. McEachin's bill and our previous question, which had the full  complement to make CHIP really work, was the way to go.   Sadly, although I object to the process of one short-term continuing  resolution of last year instead of looking to the future for next  year--I disapprove of that process--the substance of this legislation  makes it totally unacceptable, and I urge a ``no'' vote.
