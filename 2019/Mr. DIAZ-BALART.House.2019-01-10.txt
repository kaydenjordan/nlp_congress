 Mr. Speaker, here is the sad truth which, by the  way, everybody knows, unfortunately: This bill, if passed, will not  reopen the Federal Government.   By the way, how do I know that? Because this bill already passed last  week. It is sitting in the Senate. It has not reopened the Federal  Government. This is another false attempt to fool the American people.   Some of the great Appropriations members of our time would be rolling  in their graves right now if they knew that the House is taking up a  Senate bill with zero input and zero amendments from any Member of the  House--not one Member of the House. So, obviously, we should reject  this flawed strategy.   But I want to thank the ranking member, Mr. Aderholt, for speaking  about some of the specifics. I want to just talk about a couple of  specifics in this bill where it falls, frankly, very, very, very, very  short. Let me talk about a couple issues that are very important to  Florida.   Citrus is a key, critical industry for Florida. This bill does not  adequately fund citrus greening research. It falls seriously short on  funding something that is so important for the survival of our farmers  and the industry in Florida.   Also, Mr. Speaker, it falls short on combating the oriental fruit  fly, another critical issue for our farmers in Florida.   We have to recall that Florida is still recovering from the  devastation caused by recent hurricanes. This bill falls short in  helping the farmers in the State of Florida.   But as I said at the beginning, Mr. Speaker, if that wasn't enough,  this is all a charade.   By the way, do you know what the sad part is, Mr. Speaker? I am going  to be proven right.   Last week, a lot of us said that about those bills that our friends  on the other side of the aisle said were going to reopen the  government. Do you know who was proven right and who was proven wrong?  We are going to be proven right again.    This is a sham. I would ask, respectfully, to defeat  this bill, which is a charade, a sham, and will not open the Federal  Government. Everybody knows that. Everybody knows that it will not  reopen the Federal Government. It doesn't have any input from the House  and falls shorts for Florida farmers and other farmers around the  country.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this bill. My objections are  numerous. Again, there are a lot of reasons why I am objecting to this  bill in this form today.   One of the things that I think is important to note, because I have  heard throughout the debate in all these bills how passing these bills  will reopen the Federal Government: Mr. Speaker, I heard that last week  on the floor of this House, on the same appropriations bills.   I want to mention that again. Last week, on this floor, Members came  up and said, if those bills pass the House, the Federal Government  would reopen.   Mr. Speaker, those bills passed the House. They didn't reopen the  Federal Government, just like these bills, which are identical to the  bills that were passed last week--identical--unfortunately, also will  not reopen the government.   Now, I have other objections as well, Mr. Speaker. This bill is,  frankly, absurd because it takes a Senate product, ignoring all--all-- of the House Members' priorities. It is jamming it through this body  without a single opportunity to amend or improve or change this bill in  any way.   Not one House Member has had one priority put in this bill because  there are no amendments allowed in this process.   Again, this ploy will not work. The Senate has no plans of taking up  this legislation. And, again, this is deja vu all over again.   I heard folks last week talk about, if the House passed those bills  last week, like we are hearing now, the government would reopen. Mr.  Speaker, those statements were not true last week, and they are not  true this week, unfortunately.   Now, not only did the bills last week not reopen the government. In  fact, everyone on this House floor knows that this bill passing,  unfortunately, will not reopen the Federal Government. Mr. Speaker, all  the members of the press up there know that passing this bill,  unfortunately, will not reopen the government.   Heck, anybody who has been paying any attention knows that this is a  sham; that, just like last week, those bills passing didn't reopen the  government, and unfortunately, passing this bill, or these  appropriations bills, in this manner will not reopen the government  either.                                time  1400    So by introducing these Senate bills without any changes to reflect  the priorities of this body and without any opportunity for amendments,  we are engaging in a sad, sad charade.   I want to take some time, opportunity to discuss the real-world  consequences of this stunt. Again, our majority is asking us, all of us  here in this Chamber, to reject all of the hard work and all of the  priorities of every House Member, Republican or Democrat.   Mr. Speaker, in our House bill, I am proud that we decided to make a  historic investment, for example, in ports: port infrastructure, the  ports, seaports, including larger seaports that are critical to our  country's commerce. In the House bill, we provided $250 million for  this program.   Well, the Senate didn't make this investment. They didn't think that  that was as high of a priority. They missed that opportunity to build  infrastructure that we need to create jobs and increase our ability to  export American goods made by Americans.   We also placed a higher priority on roads and on bridges than the  Senate did and with an emphasis on funds that go directly and  immediately to the States and the territories through the highway  formula program. The Senate didn't have that priority.   The Senate provides far less for this purpose, Mr. Speaker. Let me  tell you what that number is, far less: $1.4 billion less for that  direct spending in infrastructure, bridges, and roads that goes  straight to the States.   The Senate, instead, put a high priority on administrative accounts  and programs with, frankly, higher overhead. This bill means less  funding for your State Department of Transportations and fewer jobs  rebuilding the highways and the bridges around our country.   Mr. Speaker, we also included a provision that provided regulatory  relief to, for example, sugar and beet haulers in Idaho and in Oregon.  This narrow provision--and this is a bipartisan provision--simply made  truck length requirements uniform between those two States--common  sense.   Again, this provision has support on both sides of the aisle, and it  will help truckers and farmers in those States. But, you see, the  Democratic proposal before you does not include even that commonsense  provision, commonsense bipartisan provision.   Mr. Speaker, we also included a provision in the House bill that  allows for small increases in the allowable weight for trucks that run  on electric batteries, an innovation to help the environment. This is  another commonsense, bipartisan provision that this bill does not have,  and it was not included in the Senate mark.   This bill eliminates House and Senate report language--I want to  repeat,  [[Page H422]]  both House and Senate report language.   Now, what does that mean? That every single item we put in the report  for Members, at the request of Members from both parties, is gone, is  irrelevant in this bill.   You see, the direction that we provide in our reports every year  helps hold the bureaucracy accountable and ensure that our constituents  have a voice in their government. Mr. Speaker, that language is gone.   For example, we put directives in our report that require that the  FAA take specific action, specific action to address airport noise,  airport noise in our communities. Now, this is specifically important-- I should say especially important--to our Democratic colleagues in the  subcommittee and the committee on this floor, and we accommodated all  of their requests on this issue with new stringent requirements on the  FAA, Mr. Speaker. This bill makes those requirements null and void.   So let me now turn to housing programs. When we looked at the HUD  budget, we made sure, in the House, in the House bill, the House mark-- and, by the way, this is done in a bipartisan way. We made sure that we  scrubbed the administrative and overhead accounts and, instead, put  funds towards programs that serve our neediest, our neediest citizens.  This bill, unfortunately, falls far short on our charge to do the best  that we can with the revenue, the taxpayer money.   And, again, to make sure that the bureaucracy is held accountable,  this bill falls short. Let me give you a few examples.   In our bill last year, we included $50 million in new funding for a  program that we call mobility vouchers. These vouchers are targeted at  families with children, to enable them to move to neighborhoods with  greater economic opportunity, and this initiative has strong bipartisan  support from the authorizers and strong support from the advocates for  the poor. The Senate bill does not include any funds, zero funds, for  this program.   The House also included significantly more funding for new vouchers  for people with disabilities. This program helps families across the  country that struggle to take care of severely disabled relatives, and  it also serves, by the way, so many veterans with disabilities. We  provided $390 million for this program.   For tens of thousands of new vouchers, this bill before us, frankly,  falls short there as well, by $236 million, and adds no new vouchers.   You see, Mr. Speaker, I am proud to say that every year, when I was  chairman, I also worked to ensure that there was adequate funding for  Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS, or HOPWA. This program has  a record of saving lives, reducing disease transmissions, and  protecting communities. I am so proud of that. We provided $393 million  in our bill to ensure that there was no reduction, no cut to housing  services for this vulnerable population.   The Senate, unfortunately, again, falls severely short, $375 million.  This will result in 1,700 people losing their housing, which will put  communities at risk.   This, by the way, is a severe hit, particularly for cities likes  Miami, New York, Atlanta, San Francisco, and many others. This is an  area the Senate was counting on the House to fix, to fix their low  funding levels. But, you see, Mr. Speaker, we don't have the  opportunity because of this stunt that we are witnessing here today.    Finally, we included $150 million for Choice Neighborhoods, which is  a program that provides much-needed neighborhood rehabilitation-- revitalization grants, I should say. This has such strong bipartisan  support in the House. The Senate did not prioritize it as much as we  did, and they only provided $100 million.   So I look forward to advancing a bill that protects this, all of  these issues, and other important priorities for our House Members. I  look forward to working to do that.   But before I close, Mr. Speaker, I want to take a minute to thank  somebody who has become a personal friend, Chairman Price. I will tell  you, it has been an honor, Mr. Speaker, to work beside him for the past  4 years developing bills that truly meet the needs of our people, of  our country, of our communities. These past 2 years, I think, have been  particularly energizing as we worked on T-HUD bills that made  substantial new investments in our Nation's infrastructure.   Chairman Price and I have always been able to work together to find  common ground, to find solutions, and that is the spirit of cooperation  and good will that will get us, I am sure, to a breakthrough to end  this impasse and to reopen the government once again. So, again, I do  not have anybody in this Chamber that I am more pleased to work with  than the chairman of this subcommittee.   Now, today, on this bill, mark my words, Mr. Speaker, mark my words,  the passage of these bills in this form will not open the Federal  Government. Everyone in here knows that; just like last year, last  week, we knew that they would not open the government, and we heard on  this floor that they would.   This bill, unfortunately, will not reopen the government. It falls  short on our priorities. It does not include any of the House  priorities; so, therefore, I respectfully would urge a ``no'' vote.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as she may consume  to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Granger), a titanium Texan, the  ranking member of the full committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Idaho (Mr. Simpson), the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Energy  and Water Development and Related Agencies.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Rutherford), a former sheriff and my dear friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  [[Page H425]]  Mississippi (Mr. Palazzo), who, by the way, is not on the T-HUD  Subcommittee but who has been an amazing asset to the full committee,  but, in particular, to the T-HUD Subcommittee.                                time  1430     Mr. Speaker, if I might inquire how much time I have  left.    Mr. Speaker, having no more speakers, I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H426]]         Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to first again commend the chairman. This is an  individual who I know always works in good faith, and I look forward to  working with him again.   But, Mr. Speaker, I think it is very clear that we say what we are  doing here today. This bill that already passed last week will not  reopen government.   As a matter of fact, Mr. Speaker, let me tell you what potentially  could have reopened government. You see, I went to the Rules Committee  on Tuesday with an amendment, Mr. Speaker. The amendment was very  simple. It has very strong bipartisan support. I think it could have  been a way to reopen the government.   It basically was the Dream Act, to legalize all the Dreamers, that  has been cosponsored by every Democrat in this body last Congress,  along with also legalizing all the folks who are here under the TPS  program, and it then had the funding for border security, issues that  should not be partisan and controversial, issues that the Members  across the aisle and the leadership--let me talk about the leadership  across the aisle--said that they support.                                time  1445    I will never forget the Speaker of the House spent almost 8 hours on  this floor saying that she wanted to fight for the Dreamers. Yet, there  was a vote on Tuesday, Mr. Speaker, in the committee that she controls,  the Rules Committee, on a party-line vote, the bill that would have,  yes, funded border security--but would have legalized past the DREAM  Act, and legalized those under TPS--was voted down on a party-line  vote.   Mr. Speaker, you want to know if there is good faith to reopen this  government. That showed it right there. No, this bill will not reopen  the Federal Government, unfortunately. Like last week, this same bill  that passed didn't reopen it. Real efforts to reopen it, like that one  that I mentioned, voted down four amendments, voted down a party-line  vote.   It is time to get real about reopening the government. It is time to  get real about passing a real T-HUD bill. Let's get back to the  people's business. This is not a way to do it. This is a sham.   Again, I am grateful to the chairman because I know he is working in  good faith, but this effort is not in good faith, so we must vote it  down to get back to doing the real business of the people.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the  desk.    Yes, in its current form.    Mr. Speaker, this motion to recommit restores a  House priority that had overwhelming support when we put together the  FY 2019 T-HUD bill during the last Congress.   As I mentioned in my opening statement, our House bill last year  placed a high priority on increasing housing opportunities for people  living with disabilities. We heard from members of humanitarian groups,  nonprofits, and religious organizations, frankly, just from our  communities, on the importance of ensuring that the disabled have  humane housing options.   Our bill, therefore, last year included $390 million for this  program, to provide over 20,000 additional housing vouchers for people  with disabilities. These vouchers help some of the neediest among us  live, frankly, with dignity.   The program provides a critical lifeline to families who struggle to  care for the severely disabled. And it prevents, frankly, worst-case  scenarios where severely disabled individuals would otherwise face  homelessness.   Mr. Speaker, this motion is a reasonable, partial restoration of  funding for this program. This modest motion partially restores the  disability voucher cuts that my colleagues are offering today, and,  instead, provides an additional $71 million for this valuable program.   The motion would provide 7,200 vouchers, and would correct a  significant blemish in the Senate-originated bill that is before us  today.   Every single dollar of this funding goes directly to serve those in  need. This is an account without bureaucratic overhead. Every single  dollar goes to serve those who need it. It is a program with, again, a  strong record of accountability and of performance.   Not one dollar of this program goes to the Federal bureaucracy. These  funds directly serve the disabled and their families, often, Mr.  Speaker, through faith-based and community-  [[Page H429]]  based organizations. This program also serves a large number of  veterans, some of whom, Mr. Speaker, became disabled in service to our  country.   This motion is offset by a reduction to HUD's Information Technology  Fund, leaving the account at a very reasonable level of $209 million.  Again, this is a manageable level for HUD IT, and it is a modest  adjustment to bring dignity, relief, and help to individuals and  families with disabilities.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the motion, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
