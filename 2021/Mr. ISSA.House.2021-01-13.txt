 Madam Speaker, the last speaker said that for 4 years the  President did all these terrible, inciteful things, including anti- Semitism. I take exception with that.   But I think it is important that we embrace one thing that was said.  Yes, the President has been consistent for the last 4 years. During his  campaign, I even, while representing another candidate, said that the  President had political Tourette's; he said what was on his mind  without a filter.   I don't think that is being debated here today. We all know that is  true. What is being debated is whether, with 167 hours left until he  leaves office, he is a clear and present danger. He clearly isn't.   The President has acted substantially the same for 4 years. He has  rallied his base, and he has, in fact, called for peaceful protest, as  he did just a few days ago.   The fact is, today, we are trying to punish the President--at least  some are--for 4 years of what he did, not for what happened last week.  What happened last week was the result of anarchists who came loaded,  prepared, and with weapons.                                time  1300
