 Mr. Speaker, it is always an honor and a privilege to  have a chance to address the House. There is so much that is so  critically important going on these days, especially this week, and I  wanted the chance to address those.   I have a friend from Texas who hopes to address the House, and I  advised him I would yield him such time as he may consume. So my  friend--people say that a lot, ``my friend.'' But Randy Weber is a dear  friend, and I think he will be out at any moment.   In the meantime, I think we had an 11- to 12-hour hearing yesterday  in the Committee on the Judiciary, and I will get into that  momentarily.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Weber), my dear  friend from southeast Texas.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my friend bringing that to our  attention. That was a great tribute to a great man from a great man.   I did attend and help things out at Gilley's on a number of occasions  there in Pasadena--Pasadena, Texas, that is--not far from downtown  Houston.   I don't know. I guess I had the look that I could ride a bull because  they turned it up as high as it could go wheeling, and it was  something. I got better at it, but that was tough when they put that  thing on full speed, yanking back and forth. I just knew I wasn't going  to ride a bull in the rodeo.   Rather prophetic, too, was Mickey Gilley with one of his biggest hit  songs, ``Don't the Girls All Get Prettier at Closing Time.'' Quite an  astute observation. But we were young then.   It was interesting, hearing the colloquy exchange between  Representative Scalise and Leader Hoyer, the discussion about  inflation.   I remember vividly the years under President Gerald Ford, and he  adopted WIN and had WIN buttons, which stood for ``Whip Inflation  Now.'' The failure of the policies at that point to whip inflation,  along with Watergate, helped elect President Jimmy Carter, and things  just got worse and worse. We lost our international standing. Countries  did not respect us.   Beginning in 1978, I was stationed at Fort Benning, Georgia. As I  have said before, we weren't in combat during my 4 years on Active  Duty, but I still have deep regrets that President Carter did not  respond more appropriately when an act of war occurred in Iran, in  Tehran, when our Embassy was attacked and over 50 employees taken  prisoner.   We were put on alert. That went up at Fort Benning, and people  weren't sure who all was going to be going if a group was sent.                                time  1245    But I still believe, having lived through those days, watching every  development, that if President Carter had made clear to the Iranians,  you will either release--initially, I think they started out around  three days. The spokesman for the Ayatollah kept saying the students  attacked the embassy, the students took the hostages.   I mean, I was young, but I wasn't stupid. And it appeared pretty  clear to me that the spokesman for the Ayatollah was giving himself a  back door: The students did this. That way, if President Carter  reacted, as he should have, and said you will either release those  hostages, get them released from the students, play around with the  ridiculous thing that we are saying, if you don't get those released  within 48 to 72 hours, something like that, then we are sending as many  people as it takes to get our people back, and to stop the active war  you started.   But if it is the students, you can just take care of that quite  easily. But, again, if you don't release them, see that they are  released, we are coming. And if you harm one hair on their heads, then  we are going to take everyone associated with the Ayatollah Khomeini,  including the Ayatollah Khomeini, out. They will not exist after we  come.   I really felt if President Carter had taken that strong position,  they would have been released. He couldn't bluff; he had to be serious  about it. But if he had said he wasn't bluffing, then I really felt  like they would have been released. And nobody was dying to go to Iran  at Fort Benning, but everybody I knew was willing to go and give up  their lives, if necessary. That was part of being in the service.   But that never happened. And it took getting a new President, Ronald  Reagan, in office, before people around the world began to take the  United States seriously. But some in this body have talked before  about, Oh, no, we don't want to give the radical Islamists something to  recruit with.   Well, one of the best things they ever had to recruit with was  President Carter and his unwillingness to take a stand and make a  difference. And as a result, it is my belief that--having studied  history my whole life, majored in it in college, never stopped studying  it--that we lost thousands of American lives because we didn't have a  President in President Carter that engendered respect. And respect  carries a little element of fear. We didn't have that. And as a result,  for decades, Americans have suffered.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Mrs. Miller),  my friend.                          Democrats' Leftwing Agenda     Mr. Speaker, when Mary Miller tells you something, you  can count on her being truthful about it.   Mr. Speaker, yesterday, we had many hours of hearings in the  Judiciary Committee on a couple of bills. One of them, the Democrat  majority and leaders in the Judiciary Committee and the Democratic  Party were saying repeatedly that no one has gotten immunity from  liability like the gun manufacturers. And that was said many ways, many  different times, vilifying gun manufacturers.   What it boils down to is in the Second Amendment, it makes very  clear, in operative part, that the right of the people to keep and bear  arms shall not be infringed. Well, it has been infringed many times.  The Supreme Court has had to strike things down many times. So the  effort to eliminate the Second Amendment through the courts has not  occurred.   You can be smart and not have commonsense, but we are dealing with  some smart people here who have figured out, Okay, we have tried every  which way to get rid of the Second Amendment. If we are ever going to  get to the progressive, socialist, communist dream--whichever one of  those you want to use, it is all pretty well the same thing these  days--you are going to have to get rid of the Second Amendment.   The left knows that. And they have made some strides. They have made  some dents into the Second Amendment. But this is going to make use--if  they get it passed into law--not of warfare but of what has come to be  known as ``law fare.'' It is where you overwhelm someone or some entity  with so many lawsuits that they cannot continue. And if it is an  entity, you put them out of business, not because they are liable, but  it is because they can't handle that many lawsuits. It just undoes them  and puts them out of business.   And if you look historically where that would take us is to the  medieval-type thinking where you had this small group of elites. They  rode everywhere they went, and us peasants would walk everywhere we  went. Maybe there was a big wagon that would carry the peasants at  times. But the ruling elite--which is what you get with socialism,  progressivism--this tiny veneer of ruling elite that billionaires in  America think, mistakenly, that they will be part of if they help get  to that socialist utopia, being ignorant of the fact that every time a  Nation moves to socialist utopia, once they are there, they thank the  gazillionaires for all the money. They helped make the socialist dream  come true. And then they either kill them or send them to a gulag and  take all of their money.    So these billionaires that are pouring in money, the socialist  leaders are saying, Thank you very much; oh, we appreciate you so much.  But if they get to that socialist utopia, those billionaires that made  it possible will be dead, or wished they were, because they were in  some prison, some gulag somewhere, doing work requirements. So that is  historically what we are talking about.   But I keep coming back to that vision of what is being pursued and  what will the outcome be. Once you either eliminate the Second  Amendment or you eliminate every entity that makes guns, then the  ruling elite can get closer to their dreams of being the ones riding in  private jets, in Suburbans, up-armored; being the only ones in America  who have guns for their security forces while all the peasants, the  masses, the unwashed--all of us--would have nothing. And we would have  to kowtow and bow.   Now, I got a little taste of that the summer I was in the Soviet  Union as an exchange student back in the 1970s. And I thought it was  crazy. We were told there were eight Americans allowed in on this  program. We were told in orientation, Look, you have got to understand  in a communist society like the Soviet Union, only the elite have cars.  Everybody else takes mass transportation or walks.   In the United States, pedestrians generally have the right-of-way.  But don't think for a second we were told anywhere in the Soviet Union  that you have the right-of-way of a pedestrian, because only the ruling  elite have the cars. And it is a game to them. They will try to hit you  because they know, as the ruling elite, if it ever came to court or  there was some question about you as a pedestrian being hit, the  ultimate result would be a ruling that you should have seen the car  coming and gotten out of the way. Because these are the ruling elites  and you are the peasants. Great socialist utopia. That is where we are  headed if these kinds of bills get passed.   If you can't get rid of the Second Amendment, their strategy that we  lived through hours of yesterday, bankrupt the gun manufacturers. And  then we will be on our way. And that way, only the ruling elite will  have security forces with guns and everybody else will either walk or  take mass transportation. The ruling elite gets the private jets.   And it is okay to just have massive amounts of carbon emissions and  private helicopters, private jets, big Suburbans, like Al Gore used. I  read where he was seen having an entourage of big jets--this was long  after he was out of leadership as Vice President--but they would all be  sitting there, cooling for the Vice President--or former Vice  President. So that is the kind of thing that will continue.   The ruling elite, they get to pollute like crazy. Their yachts, their  private jets, those will continue. In fact, there will be a lot more of  them. And you see people like the Biden family--Hunter Biden that got  close to oligarchs in Russia, in Ukraine--and made money off the  Chinese Communist Party because they were in charge in China, let's  face it.   But isn't it interesting that if you look at the policies and the  things that this administration has done, who has benefited?   Yeah, they talk a lot of trash about Russia but at the same time, by  President Biden basically going to war with energy companies in the  U.S., he has so driven up the price of oil and natural gas that  Russia's been able to fund their invasion of, and war with, Ukraine.                                time  1300    We got $13 billion passed in this House. Another $40 billion. I voted  for 13; I didn't vote for the 40 because it didn't appear to me there  was enough restraint on what President Biden could do with the money.   It made big headlines in the last few weeks when the Biden  administration announced: Gee, we are going to provide $820 million to  Ukraine. Well, you have $53 billion to work with and you are trickling  out $820 million while Russia is making big advances in Ukraine? For  heaven's sake, that is one of the reasons I didn't vote for the $40  billion because I figured that the Biden administration would find  other things to do with it.   Apparently, they want to have a lot more sex change surgeries in the  military. They cost a lot of money--it doesn't cost $40 billion if you  had a sex change for everybody in the military. By the way, that does  put our military members in a category where they are not able to be  utilized for military services. Last I saw, they stayed in that  category where you couldn't deploy them until such time as a  psychiatrist could certify that they were comfortable in their new  gender. Amazing. No wonder we are losing respect around the world when  we are not spending defense money on defense, we are spending it on  social experimentation.   We see these bills coming. We see what is happening. All you have to  do is look from a historical perspective. The discussion about gasoline  is actually cheaper now than it was at the end of the Bush  administration. My gosh, we just went through TARP being passed, $700  billion--well, yeah, that is going to cause some inflation.   Along came the Obama administration--the Obama-Biden administration-- and they got another $900 billion on top of having a majority of the  $700 billion still to spend. They were throwing money at things right  and left that would help them get reelected. So I wouldn't be bragging  about a whole lot.   In fact, I have seen an article indicating that during the 8 years of  the Obama-Biden administration, the average Black household in America  during the Obama-Biden 8 years, the average Black household lost 30  percent of their  [[Page H6948]]  net worth, which really helped bring a great deal of light and emphasis  on candidate Donald Trump's question to a large Black audience:   What do you got to lose by voting for me?   What do you got to lose?   You just lost 30 percent of your net worth under the Democrats. Lo  and behold, the average gained net worth under the 4 years of President  Trump.   So people, I think, are starting to look at those kind of numbers  again, and I think it is important to do so.   Back to our hearing yesterday. They kept saying that gun  manufacturers were given immunity like nobody else in America. It was  my honor to get to illuminate that issue for those that hadn't thought  through what they were saying and didn't realize that it was not true.   First of all, a very timely topic that many of us think has long  outlived its usefulness is the massive immunity that has been given to  the pharmaceutical industry for the vaccinations that they have made  tens of billions of dollars just in a year--they have made so much  money off those.   So much so that they looked around--most people have gotten the  vaccination. I hate to see somebody have natural immunity from having  COVID because they are not as vulnerable to getting COVID again as  apparently people are that have had the vaccinations and all the  boosters.   So what do you do?   Oh, let's go after the young people under 5 years of age. These are  people that statistically, you would say, don't even have a statistical  chance of getting COVID and passing away. They were the least  vulnerable among us when it comes to COVID--and that is who they want  to give a jab to and boosters--even though we are seeing more and more  indications that immunity ends up being compromised in many people who  get the boosters. It doesn't seem to help with immunity to new strains  of COVID.   The Democrats were more than thrilled, it seems, to give them all  kinds of immunity. When I saw the huge, unfolded warnings that come  with the vaccination, I said to the pharmacist: Where are all the  warnings?   They know about a lot of things that go wrong with these. We know  about it from the VAERS reports of so many things that have gone wrong,  starting with blood clots and going from there.   He said: No. It says up there because it is emergency use  authorization, not only do they have complete immunity to any lawsuit  for damages or deaths they cause, they don't even have to warn you of  all the damages that they know can result from the vaccinations or the  boosters. They don't even have to warn you.   My friends in the Judiciary Committee yesterday--because they kept  saying, you know, nobody else gets this kind of immunity, they just  weren't aware--I know the rules, we are here in the House of  Representatives, you can't intentionally lie to anybody. That is why I  am sure they just forgot or weren't aware of all the immunities that  they provided to other entities--the pharmaceutical.   They don't even have to warn you or give you a heads-up of what is  coming potentially with the vaccination or booster. Then you got social  media. Section 230 has allowed some of the richest companies in the  world and individuals in the world to completely escape liability. They  should be made to answer in court for fraud and for so many of the  things that they have done--for censorship, for taking away people's  rights that they were told they had under the social media.   Anyway, even though I know that my Democrat friends were not talking  about section 230 immunity--there it is. Of course, they don't want to  bother that because that allows all the Democrats controlling these  massive social media giants to censor and help at election time and  help Democrats get elected.   They want to leave that immunity in place when it needs to go. We  need to just eliminate section 230. We were told, well, that was  important to have to allow them to get started. Listen, they are  started, and they are some of the most powerful companies in the  history of the world--some would say more powerful than the U.S.  Government itself because of all the information they have. It is time  to get rid of their immunity from liability. Even fraud--you can't even  sue them for fraud.    Diamond and Silk, they were telling me how they had paid in order to  have their name come up more often. Not only did it not come up more  often, an algorithm was used to send it to the bottom. That is called  fraud. They took money from them under fraudulent circumstances. They  can't even sue over that.   I am for getting rid of that immunity. I know that people knew, so  they must have just forgotten. Members of Congress have immunity from  being sued. You can come down here, you can accuse President Trump of  all kinds of crimes--colluding with Russia, when it turned out that was  not Trump, that was the Hillary Clinton campaign that was doing the  colluding with Russia.   You can accuse him of all kinds of crimes. You can call Trump guilty  of all kinds of thing, and you can't be sued for it--for things you say  and do here in the House. We have got that immunity.   Heck, President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris got the same  kind of immunity. Even though we have lost more than 100,000 Americans  in 1 year from fentanyl and drugs that have come across our southern  border illegally, if they didn't have the immunity that my Democrat  friends in the Judiciary Committee said doesn't exist, then they could  be sued for their negligence or intentional failures.   They both took an oath to uphold the Constitution. So allowing a  completely porous border--that is not upholding their oath. Over  100,000 people have died just from the illegal drugs that have been  allowed in by this administration.   If not for the immunity, President Biden could be vulnerable to  lawsuit. Even with all the money that Hunter has helped bring in, it  wouldn't be enough to pay all the judgments if it weren't for the  immunity. Maybe somebody might--if they were not immune--somebody might  try to allege that it was negligence and purely stupid to put someone  in charge as border czar who would never go to the border to even  investigate and see at the border what was going on. That would make  her vulnerable to liability as well, except for the immunity.   Those are rather important ideas to remember. Republicans didn't give  gun manufacturers some kind of exclusive immunity. They are liable. If  they are negligent--they even have strict liability. If there is a  defect in manufacturing or design, they are liable. In one case, they  paid out millions of dollars because they had advertised and targeted a  specific audience they shouldn't have.                                time  1315    They clearly have liability. That was just a lot of information that  was not accurate that was being tossed out yesterday as a reason to get  rid of all guns except, of course, mark my words, if they were ever  successful in doing that, that little veneer of ruling elite, their  security would have the guns, and we the peasants would have no guns  and no way to defend ourselves.   Of course, we are seeing the abuses of law enforcement. We have had  hearings on that before, massive abuse by law enforcement. With the  bill yesterday, they were providing an exemption from getting rid of  guns to bureaucrats in the Department of Agriculture and in the  Department of Education. Bureaucrats, these weren't even the police  force, were going to be exempt from the new laws the Democrats in the  Judiciary Committee wanted to get passed.   We said: Wait, it is probably just an oversight because you have  given an exemption for law enforcement, but you have no exemption for  military or veterans.   The chairman of the committee--a Democrat chairman--said basically  that, well, you have to keep in mind that they get PTSD, and they have  all kinds of problems. We don't want to give that kind of exemption to  carry guns to people who have been trained with them and who serve or  have served in the military.   This is just a real slap in the face to people who put their lives on  the line defending our country.   Do you want to dismiss them? Well, they have PTSD. They have all  kinds of problems.  [[Page H6949]]    It is a shame that those people who are the reason that we are  allowed to be here and talk, they put their lives on the line for us  and our freedoms, and then they just get dismissed.   Bureaucrats in the Department of Education, who may not have ever  been trained with weapons, are more important to give exemptions to  than these current military or veterans. That is a mentality that is  hard to understand.   We look at Indiana, at the shooting in the shopping mall. It is  incredible that a person with the right to carry, within 15 seconds,  the guy coming out into the mall with an automatic weapon, and this  guy, as I understand, at 40 yards and with a handgun--I mean, I had to  qualify every year with a handgun and with an M-16--at 40 yards put 8  out of 10 rounds in the shooter. That is incredible. But it sure did  end the horror at the mall.   If other shooters find out that they could have 8 out of 10 rounds  put into them if they walk out and try to do that at malls, it would  help stop a lot of people from being tempted to do something that  criminally evil in other shopping malls. It is just incredible.   We had this issue come up. I have page after page, over 50 pages, of  recent history where people with right to carry have stepped up and  saved so many lives because they were a law-abiding person, a selfless,  law-abiding person willing to put their life at risk to save others.  There is case after case, more than 50 in these documents.   It starts with information from criminal research, July 11, 2022, and  it goes on and on. Like I say, I know there are more than 50 pages.  These are heroes stepping up and putting their lives at risk knowing at  Uvalde they had hundreds of law enforcement there.   I still don't understand that. They could hear the guy shooting  children. You had a police chief while he is shooting children just  asking him sweetly to put the gun down. The door wasn't locked. They  could have gone in and taken him out at any moment.   I know hundreds of law enforcement as a former judge and former  assistant district attorney, and I don't know any who would have stood  by while children were being killed. It turns out there were people in  Uvalde who were stopped--some law enforcement--who couldn't go in and  do anything.   If a concealed carry, somebody with a constitutional carry, had been  allowed to risk their life and go in, they would have. But people were  being stopped and kept from going in. I recall an incident at our  courthouse in Tyler and seeing the film when shots started being fired  and the law enforcement starts running to the sound of the guns.   I had one incident at the courthouse. As is often the case, it was a  domestic situation, and a shooter started shooting. We had a concealed  carry permit holder who took his gun. The active shooter would have  killed a lot more people, but the concealed carry permit holder started  shooting at him. He got shot and died from his wounds. The guy had to  take off. There is no telling how many lives were saved by that  sacrificial person being willing to put himself out there in harm's  way, become a target himself, and stop the shooter.   Law-abiding people have made a difference that way.   We had a lady who took her gun out years ago and went into a  cafeteria to eat in central Texas. A gunman ended up shooting her  parents, among others. If she had been allowed to have her gun, she  would have stopped him. Then, she led the charge in the State  legislature to get concealed carry permits, and that was the basis of  the start there.   Mr. Speaker, you have to have people who have been taught that there  are some absolute rights and some absolute wrongs. C.S. Lewis became a  Christian from being, he would say, agnostic--seemed like sometimes  atheist. But he liked to cajole Christians: Yes, yes, isn't easier just  to admit there can't be a just God with so much injustice?   It finally dawned on him, the brilliant Oxford professor that he was,  how could he say that there was injustice if there were not some  absolute, universal standard somewhere of right and wrong? If that  existed, then there must be something like a God who put that in place.   The more he wrestled with that, the more he came to understand that  we all have innate in us this feeling of fairness and of justice. As he  pointed out, it would be like someone born blind at birth trying to  describe sight. How would you know that there is light or no light, Mr.  Speaker, if there weren't something universal in it?    It is the same with injustice. He realized that when there is  injustice, we would know it, and we couldn't know it if there wasn't an  absolute, universal justice and injustice. Then that eventually led him  to further inquiries and further research, and he became a Christian.   Well, Mr. Speaker, there is justice; there is injustice; and there  are gray areas we argue about. But as John Adams said--and I will say  it often because it was such a brilliant quote from one of the Founders  who was there for the constitutional debate. He said: ``Our  Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people. It is  wholly inadequate to the government of any other.''   If we are not going to teach children that thou shalt not murder,  then we can't have a Second Amendment right. We must teach children  that these things, these commandments, are universal, that you are not  to lie and you are not to envy other people, and that there are things  that are just not healthy for you and not healthy for society and for  the culture, and they are universal. They are not healthy, and they are  not good.   Honor your father and mother. Of course, fathers and mothers are  supposed to be fair with their children. But if we are not going to  teach that, if we are just going to teach that everything is relative,  that it depends on your circumstances, that it may be right for you and  wrong for somebody else, right for them and wrong for you, no, it is  all relative.   If we are not going to teach that some things are absolute, then we  cannot have the rights that are provided that our Founders said were  provided by our creator. We will have to get rid of them. We will have  to go to being what some already want, and that is a totalitarian  government. It is where it always goes. We are already breaking records  every day that we continue to live under our Constitution, but we are  no longer a religious, moral people.   People thought, historically, when we got rid of slavery, we were so  on the right track, and when Dr. King did so much to allow somebody, a  little boy like me, to be able to treat like brothers and sisters my  brothers and sisters, he did so much. Then somehow now we are  regressing where we want to have segregated dorms and segregated this  and that. I can't believe that people are wanting to regress.   But, Mr. Speaker, if you are not going to teach some of these  absolute moral truths, then we are going to have to give up our rights  that our Founders--so many of them and so many over the last 240  years--have died to make sure we had. I don't want to do that. I don't  want to give them up.   But Congress has to start using better judgment. Otherwise, it is  very clear, historically, we are moving--we have people who are wanting  us to move to that point where the rich ride private jets. In the old  days, they rode horses and carriages. In the modern day, they will have  their private jets. They will jet back and forth around the world,  telling everybody how they can't even have a wood-burning stove anymore  and that you can't fertilize your fields, so people are starving to  death.   Well, those are the peasants because the elite little ruling class  has all the food they need. They have the guns they need. The peasants  out there, for the good of the climate and for the good of the planet,  you are going to live in your refuse, and you are not going to have the  benefits that our wonderful ruling elites have.   That is where it is going. That is what progressivism is. That is  where it always goes, a totalitarian government, a little elite group.  They get to ride, and they have all the food.   Mr. Speaker, look at Sri Lanka. They have an over 90 percent grade in  ESG, and now people are starving and the government has been  overthrown.   This is where it is going. I don't want to go there. We don't have to  go there. Let's keep our rights under the Constitution.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.  [[Page H6950]]                                ____________________
