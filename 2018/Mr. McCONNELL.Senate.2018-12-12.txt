 Mr. President, the end of the year is fast  approaching. There are a number of important items left on the Senate's  agenda and little time to address them. We will clear more of the  President's well-qualified executive branch and judicial nominees from  the calendar. We will consider updated legislation supported by the  administration to address criminal justice. We need to pass an  agreement to fill the remaining gaps in appropriations, including  critical funding for securing our borders.   Fortunately, the Senate took a major step yesterday by passing the  farm bill. We got that much closer to delivering a big shot in the arm  to farmers in rural communities across our country.   Along with providing certainty to agricultural communities, I am  especially proud that the legislation will open a new door for farmers  in Kentucky and around the country to explore the full potential of  industrial hemp. This is the culmination of a lot of work by a number  of us here in Washington, but really the victory is for the growers,  processors, manufacturers, and consumers who stand to benefit from this  growing marketplace.   American hemp has a long and distinguished history. Some of this very  body's notable figures, including Thomas Jefferson and Henry Clay, are  believed to have grown it. During World War II, the Federal Government  even encouraged hemp production to support the war effort.  Unfortunately, because of hemp's illicit cousin, marijuana, the Federal  Government subsequently banned it altogether for generations.   In 2013, Kentucky agricultural leaders showed me hemp's incredible  potential for the Blue Grass State. We decided it was time to let  America's farmers show everyone what hemp could do.   First, I included experimental pilot programs for States like  Kentucky in the 2014 farm bill, and the results have been undeniable.  Hemp has quickly become a booming success. Its uses range from food and  pharmaceuticals to home insulation and automobile parts. Enthusiastic  farmers quickly applied to plant the crop in their fields,  entrepreneurs opened businesses selling hemp-based products, and  consumers got to enjoy a whole new set of goods featuring American-made  hemp. In my home State alone, farmers grew in excess of 3,200 acres of  hemp in 2017. This year, the number of acres more than doubled.  Estimates show that, once legalized, sales from hemp will soon surpass  $1 billion.   Watching this remarkable success, we knew it was time to take the  next step. I introduced legislation to finally and fully legalize hemp.  Working with agricultural leaders and law enforcement in Kentucky and  here in Washington, we built support.   As a member of the Agriculture Committee, I was proud that the  legislation was included in the Senate's version of the farm bill. I  was proud to serve personally on the conference committee to ensure  that the language stayed in place. Yesterday, the Senate passed the  conference report. The House will pass it as early as later today, and  this provision and the rest of the farm bill will be on its way to  President Trump's desk to become law.  [[Page S7456]]    What exactly will this legislation do? The farm bill we passed  yesterday both legalizes hemp as an agricultural commodity and removes  it from the controlled substances list. It gives States the opportunity  to be the primary overseers of hemp production. It also allows hemp  researchers to apply for competitive Federal grants from the U.S.  Department of Agriculture and made hemp eligible for crop insurance.   Together, these features will encourage new opportunities for  struggling farmers and their families--new products for use in  construction, healthcare, and manufacturing, and new jobs in a broad  range of fields.   I have been honored to gain many partners throughout this process.  Here in the Senate, thanks to the leading Democratic cosponsor of our  original bill, Senator Wyden, and to my Kentucky colleague, Senator  Paul. Congressman Jamie Comer has championed hemp for years and  sponsored our legislation in the House. In Kentucky, Commissioner Ryan  Quarles has been a longtime ally of this crop's bright future in our  Commonwealth.   I look forward to the House passing our farm bill soon and sending it  to President Trump for his signature. I would be happy to loan him my  hemp pen for the occasion.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on an entirely different matter, later  today the Senate will vote on an attempt by some of our Democratic  colleagues to undue a pro-privacy reform that Secretary Mnuchin and the  Treasury Department implemented just a few months ago.   As I discussed yesterday, there is neither any valid accounting  reason nor a disclosure reason why the IRS needs access to the donor  lists of the kinds of tax-exempt, nonprofit organizations in question.  The Treasury Department has said that ``the IRS simply does not need  tax returns with donor names and addresses to do its job in this  area.''   In a climate that is increasingly hostile to certain kinds of  political expression and open debate, the last thing Washington needs  to do is to chill the exercise of free speech and add to the sense of  intimidation. The Senate should take a stand for America's privacy and  the First Amendment and reject this misguided resolution.                            ____________________     Mr. President, later on, the Senate may consider a  resolution by the junior Senators from Utah and Vermont that pertains  to the situation in Yemen. In effect, these Members want to end the  limited American assistance to the Saudi-led coalition that is  supporting the U.N.-recognized government in the civil war in Yemen.   I will oppose the motion to proceed to the Sanders-Lee resolution and  would urge Members to join me in voting against it. Members on both  sides have legitimate concerns about the war in Yemen, about the U.S.  interests tangled up in this conflict, and especially about the  horrible plight of Yemeni citizens who are caught in the crossfire. And  where Saudi Arabia is concerned, I think every single Member of this  body shares grave concerns about the murder of Khashoggi and wants  accountability. We also want to preserve a 70-year partnership between  the United States and Saudi Arabia, and we want to ensure that it  continues to serve American interests and stabilizes a dangerous and  critical region.   This is the backdrop for today's debate: challenging circumstances  that require the Senate to act with prudence and precision. But the  Sanders-Lee resolution is neither precise enough nor prudent enough.   For one thing, I do not believe the resolution should be privileged  under the War Powers Act. The United States is not involved in combat.  It is not dropping ordnance. It is no longer even providing air-to-air  refueling. As I have stated previously, even if these activities  continued, it is a far cry to equate them with ``hostilities.''  Regardless, the practice has already stopped.   If the Senate wants to pick a constitutional fight with the executive  branch over war powers, I would advise my colleagues to pick a better  case.   Second, their resolution is an inappropriate vehicle. There are more  careful ways the Senate could express its concern about the conflict in  Yemen or our partnership with Saudi Arabia without taking such a blunt  instrument to the policy in this area. Indeed, this resolution would  threaten other support the United States is providing that is designed  to improve coalition targeting and limit civilian casualties.   Finally, from the Senate's perspective, considering a War Powers Act  resolution has the potential to present a lengthy, messy process when  our calendar is already packed more than full with other important  business to complete for the American people.   This resolution's shortcomings do not mean the Senate must do  nothing. There is a better option at hand. Legislation introduced by  Chairman Corker does a good job capturing bipartisan concerns about  both the war in Yemen and the behavior of our Saudi partners more  broadly without triggering an extended debate over war powers while we  hasten to finish all our other work. I have cosponsored his  legislation. It is a superior road to the outcome that most Senators  want. So I urge every Member to vote against considering the Sanders- Lee resolution later today and join me in supporting Chairman Corker's  responsible alternative.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on a completely different matter, it is  my bittersweet job this morning to pay tribute to a historic Senate  career that will conclude at the end of this Congress.   Senator Orrin Hatch has faithfully represented the people of Utah in  this body for the last 42 years. That makes him the dean of our  Republican conference and, of course, President pro tempore of the  Senate. It also makes him the longest serving Republican Senator in our  Nation's history. So Orrin's longevity alone would have guaranteed him  a place among the giants of the Senate. As he joked a couple of weeks  ago, one of the most memorable experiences from his early Senate tenure  was the confirmation process for Justice Joseph Story back in 1811.  Apparently it was quite the scene, Orrin tells us.   Seriously, though, the most impressive thing about Orrin Hatch is not  the historic length of his tenure here but how completely filled with  accomplishments that time has been.   But let's back up for a moment. It wasn't always obvious that our  friend would become a star U.S. Senator. At one point, it looked like  another kind of stardom might be more probable. And I am not just  talking about the successful law practice he set aside to run for  office. We all know about Orrin's musical talents and his contributions  to the recording industry. I am told that just a few years before  Orrin's first campaign in 1976, the lawyer and family man was  moonlighting as band manager for a groundbreaking Mormon folk group  called The Free Agency. Well, it is fortunate for all of us that this  free agent felt called to bring his talents here to Washington.    There is a famous story from that first campaign back in 1976. Think  about this. Orrin had no political experience--a stranger to running  for office. But he had this sense that public service was his mission.  Perhaps he was thinking of his beloved big brother Jesse, who gave his  life in World War II when Orrin was just 10.   He started asking around: Did his friends and family think he had a  shot at a Senate seat? Few liked his chances in the primary and even  fewer against the three-term incumbent. But the worst reaction of all  came from his beloved wife Elaine.   The story goes that when Orrin filed his papers to run, she cried for  3 straight days. I am not sure whether that was unhappiness at the  prospect of an east coast life they hadn't planned for or a fairly  accurate assessment of his chances at that point.   But Orrin beat the odds. With the help of a big endorsement from a  former California Governor named Ronald Reagan, this young,  conservative upstart pulled off the upset.   Actually, there is a little secret surrounding this endorsement. Few  people know this, but I am sorry to say that Orrin was actually the  Gipper's second choice. You see, our friend was so unknown back then  that Reagan's first telegram offered a ringing endorsement  [[Page S7457]]  of someone called ``Warren Hatch.'' Happily, the error was quickly  corrected. Orrin earned Utah's trust and found his way right here to  this Chamber.   Some of his new Senate peers thought their new colleague should lay  low and keep quiet about his principles. They had no idea what they  were in for.   This Pittsburgh-born son of a metal lather was actually ready for  action. Remember, Orrin was once an amateur boxer. So he came to the  Senate ready to brawl. In his very first term, he decided he had to  take down this far-left labor reform law that would have hurt free  enterprise and future prosperity. So he took on a couple of  heavyweights--Robert Byrd, George Meany, and the whole machinery of Big  Labor.   So this freshman became the public face and private backbone of the  opposition. It was an epic showdown. Orrin worked 18-hour days. He  taught his whole staff how to draft amendments. He gave pep talks to  his ragtag, bipartisan band of brothers--Dick Lugar, Howard Baker, and  Fritz Hollings, from across the aisle--trying to keep everyone in the  boat. And it worked. It withstood six cloture votes, breaking the  record for a single bill, and they won. American prosperity was kept  safe from a big power grab by union bosses.   It only seems fitting, decades later, that the other end of Orrin's  Senate tenure would also be marked by a major, hard-won, right-of- center accomplishment to help advance prosperity for all Americans.   Orrin has chaired three of the Senate's most distinguished and  critical committees--the HELP Committee, Judiciary, and, most recently,  Finance. In this Congress, as Finance chairman, he led the charge to  deliver once-in-a-generation tax relief to middle-class American  families and tax reform to American job creators. This meant more late  night and more painstaking negotiations. Chairman Hatch had to thread  the needle, attending carefully to his colleagues' needs and keeping  their eyes on the prize. Once again, he got it done.   So what about the decades in between these two bookmarks? First and  foremost may be Senator Hatch's special devotion to the Federal  judiciary--to its essential role in our constitutional order, to its  need for the highest quality personnel. Well, over his Senate tenure,  Orrin has participated in the confirmation of more than half of all of  the article III judges who have served in the United States of America  in our Nation's history. Let me say that again. Orrin has met with,  studied up on, questioned, or at least voted on more than half of all  of the Federal judges in American history. That includes all nine  Members of the current Supreme Court.   When he supported a particular nominee, such as Justices Thomas,  Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh, Orrin has been a leading champion of their  cause, even in the face of unfair slights and smears. Even in cases  when he has felt compelled to vote against nominees, he has treated  them and the process itself with the respect and dignity that it is  due.   The pile of Orrin's legislative victories is almost as high as that  tower of distinguished judges, and many of them are defined by one  signature thread that connects much of his proudest work, his care for  and commitment to serve the most vulnerable members of our society--the  State Children's Health Insurance Program, the Americans with  Disabilities Act, Hatch-Waxman for generic drugs, some of the earliest  work on AIDS research, and even his very recent work to designate 6-1-1  as the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.   So Orrin has led a bit of a double life here in the Senate, and I  mean that in the best possible way. He has been every bit the  principled fighter, as advertised. He has led the charge often and  hasn't flinched from the big battles, but at the very same time, there  was Orrin, constantly working quietly behind the scenes and across the  aisle to tick off victories for vulnerable Americans who could have  easily been left behind.    One perfect illustration of this was Orrin's friendship with the late  Ted Kennedy. For many of the years they spent here in the Senate, it  seemed like they managed to rank among each other's closest friends,  top collaborators, and most consistent sparring partners--all at the  same time.   But that is Orrin. He loves to give and take. He loves to discuss and  debate. His colleagues and staff can rely on him equally to sit down  and talk at length if they see an issue differently than he does. He  does not dismiss or overrule. He wants to learn, persuade, and to be  persuaded. It is no wonder that Orrin's peers are so fond of him and  his team is so loyal to him.   I am speaking especially of Ruthie Montoya, Orrin's scheduler for  more than three decades--a member of the Senate family in her own  right. But you can't help but respect Orrin because his own respect for  this institution and the dignity of every individual he meets is so  evident.   Utahns know this better than anyone. They know they can run into  their senior Senator on the sidewalk or out shopping, and he will stop  and listen carefully to their thoughts and concerns and life stories-- maybe over a Costco hot dog--and he will take it all to heart.   How could this be surprising? This distinguished Statesman grew up  modestly. His mother had her hands full raising seven children, and his  father supported the family with his work as a metal lather. The hours  were long and the work was hard, but the life lessons were invaluable.   Orrin worked his way through college and law school. When his  scholarship didn't prove quite enough to support a young family, he  worked as a janitor and attendant and still graduated with honors. That  education has carried Orrin far, but not as far as something else he  gained in college.   It was in one BYU classroom that providence did Orrin a great favor,  with an assist from alphabetical order. Because ``Hatch, Orrin'' came  after ``Hansen, Elaine,'' he found himself seated next to this pretty  young lady and struck up a conversation. That seating chart kicked off  a blessed marriage of 60-plus years and counting.   Not every young husband would have left a successful law practice on  the east coast and started over in Utah to be closer to his wife's  family. Not every wife and mother would tolerate--let alone encourage  and support--half a lifetime of public service 2,000 miles from where  they planned to call home.   That loving partnership has brought six children, 23 grandchildren,  and 24 great-grandchildren. Orrin has been known to refer to his brood  as ``the Hatchlings.''   So it is our hope that the Senate's great loss upon Orrin's  retirement will at least be this great family's loving gain.   We are sad to bid farewell to our artist-in-residence and his  platinum records, to this former all-star missionary and LDS bishop who  still practices what he preached, to this living example of the  American dream at its most extraordinary--the Pittsburgh fighter who  climbed up from working poverty and became ``The Gentleman of the  Senate,'' where he dedicated his work to strengthening that ladder for  the generations that would follow.   Orrin has been so generous to his colleagues, to this institution,  and to the State and the Nation he has served. He has given us so much.  He retires with great congratulations on a most distinguished career  and our very warmest wishes for a peaceful and happy retirement.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I believe there are problems with the  law governing the consideration of these types of resolutions. One of  biggest is the consideration of amendments. I have a series of  parliamentary inquiries that I think will help clarify the problems  with the statute.   Parliamentary inquiry: Does this statute provide any guidelines for  the consideration of amendments on this resolution?    I believe that most times the Senate uses expedited  procedures, we have either a germaneness requirement for amendments or  they cannot be amended. Can the Chair expound on what some of those are  and what that concept means in the Senate?    In the opinion of the Chair, is a statute with no end  point for consideration and no restrictions on text or amendments  consistent with the other expedited procedures which the Senate often  uses?    I agree with the Chair, and I think the Senate should  speak to this issue.    I ask for the yeas and nays.
