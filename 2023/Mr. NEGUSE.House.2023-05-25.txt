 Mr. Speaker, I rise with 80 of my Democratic colleagues  to demand that Republicans do their job, do the right thing, and pay  America's bills.   My colleagues on this side of the aisle are here to do the people's  business.   Where are Republicans? They have rushed out of town as America speeds  toward economic catastrophe. Why? It is because they know they have  forced a dangerous and false choice on the American people to either  impose draconian and cruel cuts that will hurt American families,  America's veterans, and American seniors or a devastating and  catastrophic default.   Mr. Speaker, this is an unacceptable choice. It is time for House  Republicans to get serious.   House Democrats are here united, just as we were at the beginning of  this year and just as we will be throughout this legislative Congress  to do the people's business.   It is time for Republicans to do the same.                            ____________________
