 Madam Speaker, my words are my only remedy today, in  spite of the upcoming D.C. statehood vote we expect to be successful.   The people of the District of Columbia have no vote on impeachment or  on any other matter on this floor now.   I spoke on this floor on the impeachment of President Clinton 20  years ago. Unlike the Clinton impeachment on perjury concerning an  affair with an intern, Trump's impeachment turns on sabotage of  national security to get himself reelected.   Clinton repented. Trump insists that he did nothing wrong. That is a  promise to continue his long pattern of abuse of power and obstruction  of Congress.   Impeachment is our only recourse.
