 Madam Speaker, Border Patrol agents recently made the  largest fentanyl bust in the agency's history. A suspect attempted to  cross our southern border with nearly 400 pounds of meth and enough  fentanyl to kill 57 million Americans.   Montana faces a meth epidemic that is tearing our families apart. We  must secure the border to cut off the meth supply that cartels push  through the ports of entry and across our porous borders.   Securing the border with a physical barrier enjoys bipartisan  support. More than 60 Democrats in the House and the Senate have  claimed a physical barrier should be part of the solution.   Both U.S. Senators from Montana have voted for physical barriers.  Yet, despite bipartisan support for a physical barrier, the Speaker  recently declared there is not going to be any money for a wall.   Madam Speaker, I urge Members of the border security conference  committee to listen to lawmakers from both parties and invest in  meaningful physical barriers at our southern border.                            ____________________
