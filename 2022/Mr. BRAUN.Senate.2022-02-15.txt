 Madam President, as ranking member of the Legislative  Branch Appropriations Subcommittee, I rise today in support of the  Senator from Tennessee's resolution to reopen the Capitol and the  Senate office buildings. As he said, for nearly 2 years, we have not  been operating from what I was used to for the short time I had been  here prior to that. Governors across the country finally are beginning  to do the same thing, even in places where they were almost in lockstep  with the way we were doing things here.   Today, you can only enter the Capitol Complex with an escort by a  staff member. One of the things constituents from back in Indiana  enjoyed most--the senior Senator from Indiana, Todd Young, started it  before I got here--was the Hoosier Huddle. From 9 to 10 every Tuesday,  every Wednesday, we had folks from all over our State coming into the  Capitol so we could have that conversation on issues that were  important. Now we do it by Zoom.   The rest of the country is saying: Enough is enough; we want to get  back to at least some of the ways that were in place prior to COVID.   Now, Washington lobbyists are allowed in because of their close  connections with congressional staff, but the American people don't  have that same access, and that is just wrong.   The legislative branch Agencies have continued to provide support to  Congress throughout the pandemic. It is time that Congress reopens the  Capitol to the American public, including Hoosiers from my home State.   I yield the floor.
