 Mr. Speaker, as a veteran, I rise in support of this  resolution. When this country first debated the possibility of African  Americans, women, or LGBT people serving in our military, the same  doubts, the same reports, and the same concerns were raised regarding  their service.   One of these misleading claims is that allowing transindividuals to  serve could harm our military readiness. Mr. Speaker, allowing  patriotic Americans who are willing, capable, and ready to serve their  country does not harm readiness.   I will tell you what does: diverting military personnel and billions  of dollars in military construction funding to build an unnecessary  wall to respond to a nonmilitary fabricated emergency.   I want to ask my friends who support this shameful service ban  whether they believe they have the right to deny an individual their  right to be who they are, to limit opportunities because of their  gender identity? Are these the values America was founded upon?   We as a nation are much better than this. During the repeal of Don't  Ask, Don't Tell, critics invoked fear upon America saying that it would  disrupt unit morale and readiness. Today, 9 years later, we have the  most powerful and capable military in the world.   For almost 3 years, transgender troops have been able to serve  openly. During that time, there has been no evidence of lack of  military readiness or unit cohesion. Unfortunately, in return for their  service, we are requiring they suppress their identity. This is  absolutely unacceptable and discriminatory.   I believe former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General  Dempsey responded best when he stated:   ``The service of the men and women who volunteer and who meet our  standards of service is a blessing, not a burden.''                                time  1000
