 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, a quick note about the business pending  before the Senate: leadership at the FAA, the Federal Aviation  Administration.   It has been more than 18 months since the FAA last had a Senate- confirmed leader, and in that time, we have seen an alarming number of  close calls on runways and operational challenges, including the outage  of the critical Notice to Air Missions system. Compounding these issues  is a shortage of air traffic controllers that has led to flight delays  and cancelations.   The FAA urgently needs a permanent leader to address these concurrent  challenges and guarantee the safety of travelers. Michael Whitaker is  that leader, and I am glad that the Senate is going to confirm him over  the next day or so.
