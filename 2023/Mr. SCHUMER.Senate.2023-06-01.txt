 Madam President, last night, a large majority of both  Democrats and Republicans in the House passed bipartisan legislation to  protect the U.S. economy, protect American families, and eliminate the  threat of a first-ever default.   The bill is now in the Senate where we begin the process today of  passing this legislation as soon as possible. The Senate will stay in  session until we send a bill avoiding default to President Biden's  desk. We will keep working until the job is done.   Time is a luxury the Senate does not have if we want to prevent  default. June 5 is less than 4 days away. At this point, any needless  delay or last-minute holdups would be an unnecessary and even dangerous  risk, and any change to this bill that forces us to send it back to the  House would be entirely unacceptable. It would almost guarantee  default.   So, again, the Senate will stay in session until we send a bill  avoiding default to the President's desk, and we will keep working  until the job is done.   The vast majority of Senators recognize that passing this bill is  supremely important. It is about preserving the full faith and credit  of the United States. There is no good reason--none--to bring this  process down to the wire, no good reason to bring this process down to  the wire, and that, too, is dangerous and risky.   So, today, I hope we see a genuine desire to keep this process moving  quickly. I hope we see nothing even approaching brinksmanship. The  country cannot afford that right now. Instead, I hope we see bipartisan  cooperation.   Bipartisanship is always the best way to avoid default and get this  bill over the finish line. We have said it over and over again.  Bipartisanship is what prevented default under President Trump; it is  what prevented default under President Biden; and it is what will  prevent default in this case too. Partisanship and hostage-taking,  meanwhile, were never going to win the day.   Let me say this. Last night's House vote was a resounding affirmation  of bipartisanship, which I hope bodes well for quick movement here in  the Senate. Large majorities from both sides came together to produce  last night's 314--314--``yes'' votes. Two-thirds of Republicans voted  for it, and more than two-thirds of Democrats voted for it. I thank my  House colleagues on both sides of the aisle who fulfilled their duty to  prevent a catastrophic default.   We need that same spirit of bipartisanship that governed the House  vote to continue here in the Senate this morning. I hope that very soon  we can finish the job of putting the default in our rearview mirror.  This is the best thing we can do right now for our economy and for  American families.   I am optimistic the Senate is going to get this done, but it will  take one  [[Page S1858]]  more concerted, focused, and bipartisan push to get us over the finish  line.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.    Mr. President, if you are one of the over 43 million  Americans with Federal student loan debt, today's Republican measure  attacking debt relief is a slap in the face. Even a casual examination  of today's CRA shows that is a cruel measure.   This is what Republicans are proposing: They not only want to  sabotage President Biden's student debt relief, they not only want to  put a stop to future payment pauses, Republicans actually want to ask  for payments and interest retroactively--from September to December of  last year.   That is right; if you are a student loan borrower and were told that  you didn't have to worry about payments last fall, you could be back on  the hook if Republicans get their way. This Republican bill is a  student debt bait-and-switch, penalizing borrowers by an average of  $1,500 in extra payments.   And there is another twist in the knife: If you are a first  responder, an educator, a member of the military, or any sort of  employee in the public sector, the Republican bill could jeopardize  your eligibility for the public service loan forgiveness program. We  should be in the business of helping Americans saddled with student  loan debt, not making their problems worse as this measure would do. I  will vote no.                             Vote on H.J. Res. 45    The joint resolution was ordered to a third reading and was read the  third time.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to Calendar No. 84,  H.R. 3746.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  following joint statement from Senator McConnell and me be printed in  the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                    Joint Statement From Senate Leaders         We share the concern of many of our colleagues about the       potential impact of sequestration and we will work in a       bipartisan, collaborative way to avoid this outcome.        Now that we have agreed on budget caps, we have asked       Appropriations Committee Chair Senator Murray and Vice Chair       Senator Collins to set the subcommittee caps and get the       regular order process started.        To accomplish our shared goal of preventing sequestration,       expeditious floor consideration will require cooperation from       Senators from both parties. The Leaders look forward to bills       being reported out of committee with strong bipartisan       support. The Leaders will seek and facilitate floor       consideration of these bills with the cooperation of Senators       of both parties.                          Vote on Motion to Proceed     Mr. President, I know of no further debate on the motion  to proceed.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the only  amendments in order be the following to H.R. 3746: Paul No. 107; Braun  No. 91; Marshall No. 110; Sullivan No. 125; Hawley No. 93; Kennedy No.  104; Cotton No. 106; Budd No. 134; Lee No. 98; Kaine No. 101; Kennedy  No. 102; that at 7:30 p.m., if any of these amendments have been  offered, the Senate vote on the amendments in the order listed, with 60  affirmative votes required for adoption with the exception of the Lee  amendment, Kennedy amendment No. 102, and the Kaine amendment; that  there be 2 minutes for debate, equally divided, prior to each vote and  with 6 minutes, equally divided, prior to each of the votes on the  Kennedy amendments; that following disposition of the above amendments,  the bill be considered read a third time and the Senate vote on the  passage of the bill, as amended, if amended, with 60 affirmative votes  required for passage, all without intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all votes  after the first be 10-minute votes in length.    Mr. President, I am pleased--so pleased--to announce  that both sides have just locked in an agreement that enables the  Senate to pass legislation tonight, avoiding default.   For the information of my colleagues, this is what will happen on the  floor: In a few minutes, the Senate will begin holding votes on 11  amendments--10 from the Republican side and 1 from the Democratic side.   To finish our work tonight, after the first amendment, we are  limiting each vote to 10 minutes. So I ask my colleagues to stay in  their seats or near the floor during the votes. Let's keep this process  moving quickly. After we finish voting on the amendments, we are  immediately considering final passage, and by passing this bill, we  will avoid default tonight.   America can breathe a sigh of relief--a sigh of relief--because, in  this process, we are avoiding default. From the start, avoiding default  has been our North Star. The consequences of defaulting would be  catastrophic. It  [[Page S1883]]  would almost certainly cause another recession. It would be a nightmare  for our economy and millions of American families. It would take  years--years--to recover from. But for all of the ups and downs and  twists and turns it took to get here, it is so good for this country  that both parties have come together at last to avoid default.   I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for their  cooperation. Let's finish the job and send this very important  bipartisan bill to the President's desk tonight.   Mr. President, I also want to dispel rumors and reassure our friends  across the world about the Senate's commitment and ability to respond  to emerging threats and needs.   This debt ceiling deal does nothing to limit the Senate's ability to  appropriate emergency/supplemental funds to ensure our military  capabilities are sufficient to deter China, Russia, and our other  adversaries and respond to ongoing and growing national security  threats, including Russia's ongoing war of aggression against Ukraine,  our ongoing competition with China and its growing threat to Taiwan,  Iranian threats to American interests and those of our partners in the  Middle East, or any other emerging security crisis; nor does this debt  ceiling deal limit the Senate's ability to appropriate emergency/ supplemental funds to respond to various national issues, such as  disaster relief, or combating the fentanyl crisis, or other issues of  national importance.   I know a strong bipartisan majority of Senators stands ready to  receive and process emergency funding requests from the administration.  The Senate is not about to ignore national needs nor abandon our  friends and allies who face urgent threats from America's most  dangerous adversaries.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, about an hour ago, I entered a statement  into the Record, and I would like to read it so the Members can hear  it.   I want to also dispel rumors and reassure our friends across the  world about the Senate's commitment and ability to respond to emerging  threats and needs. This debt ceiling deal does nothing to limit the  Senate's ability to appropriate emergency/supplemental funds to ensure  our military capabilities are sufficient to deter China, Russia, and  our other adversaries and respond to ongoing and growing national  security threats, including Russia's evil ongoing war of aggression  against Ukraine, our ongoing competition with China and its growing  threat to Taiwan, Iranian threats to American interests and those of  our partners in the Middle East, or any other emerging security crisis;  nor does this debt ceiling limit the Senate's ability to appropriate  emergency/supplemental funds to respond to various national issues,  such as disaster relief, combating the fentanyl crisis, or other issues  of national importance.   I know a strong bipartisan majority of Senators stands ready to  receive and process emergency funding requests from the administration.  The Senate is not about to ignore our national needs nor abandon our  friends and allies who face urgent threats from America's most  dangerous adversaries.   Mr. President, I want to remind Members, we were indulgent in the  first vote. That is over. We are doing 10-minute votes. Please stay in  your seats so we can finish this bill at a reasonable hour.    Madam President, that was 12 minutes. We are getting  down to 10. Everyone should be here. Call the vote.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Kansas.                              Amendment No. 110    (Purpose: To secure the borders of the United States, and for other  purposes.)    Ten minutes forty seconds. We have got 40 seconds to go,  and we can get it all in 10.                          Vote on Amendment No. 125    The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.    That took 9 minutes 40 seconds. Keep going.   (Applause.)   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Missouri.                               Amendment No. 93     Madam President, we are slipping a little--11 minutes.  Let's stay in our seats.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Louisiana.                              Amendment No. 104     Madam President, 10\1/2\ minutes. We are getting a  little better than last time. Let's get it down to 10. Stay here. We  are all getting to know each other now.    All right, everybody, that is our record--9:20. Let's  beat it.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah.                               Amendment No. 98     Madam President, first, I want to thank everybody for  cooperating. I think we got the most votes in the least time.   Second, and more importantly, we are about to vote on something so  important to the country, and so many of us on both sides of the aisle  will know that if we do this, we will not default. That is very, very  important.   Thank you for your cooperation.   The next vote is Tuesday at 5:30 p.m.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the bill is  considered read a third time.   The bill was ordered to a third reading and was read the third time.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The bill having been read the third time,  the question is, Shall the bill pass?    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  mandatory quorum calls for the cloture motions filed today, June 1, be  waived.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session and be in a period of morning business,  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.
