 Mr. Speaker, today is a profoundly important day.  It is the day that we passed the American Dream and Promise Act.   So many have fought for so long to reform America's immigration  system, and I commend the activists and grassroots organizers who made  this happen, the families and young people who shared their stories to  press this moment into fruition.   I also want to highlight the tactics that are used to ensure that we  do not pursue immigration reform. Labeling communities as gang members,  criminals, drug dealers, and bad parents, we have seen this playbook  before. It was the playbook that was used to pass the 1994 crime bill,  mass incarceration, the War on Drugs, to target a community, to make  sure to dehumanize them into increased enforcement.   We have to make sure that we recognize immigrants as among the  greatest potential of innovation and profound sources of potential in  our country.                            ____________________
