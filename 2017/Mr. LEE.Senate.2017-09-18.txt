 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so  ordered.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the nomination  of Makan Delrahim as the Assistant Attorney General for the Antitrust  Division of the U.S. Department of Justice.   Mr. Delrahim is someone I have known for over 15 years. He is  eminently qualified, and I have no doubt that he will make an  outstanding Assistant Attorney General.   Mr. Delrahim has a long and distinguished career within the antitrust  world. His service in this area includes service as senior staffer for  the Senate Judiciary Committee of the Antitrust Modernization  Commission and previously at the U.S. Department of Justice.   I could go on and on regarding Mr. Delrahim's accomplishments,  regarding his character and his aptitude as a lawyer, generally, and as  an antitrust lawyer, in particular. But instead of taking my word for  it, allow me to read just a little bit of the wide-ranging support Mr.  Delrahim's nomination has from both sides of the aisle. People within  the Senate and outside the Senate on both sides of the aisle have been  supportive of this nomination.   A bipartisan group of former Assistant Attorneys General for the  Antitrust Division at the Department of Justice--including AAGs for  Antitrust under President Obama, President Clinton, and President  Carter--submitted a letter expressing strong support for Mr. Delrahim's  nomination. They explained that ``Mr. Delrahim has the experience,  intelligence, judgment, and leadership skills necessary to serve as an  excellent Assistant Attorney General.''   Similarly, a bipartisan group of former Commissioners of the  Antitrust Modernization Commission, a group of well-respected, seasoned  anti-trust officials, submitted a letter supporting Mr. Delrahim's  nomination. The letter said that Delrahim will ``serve with high  distinction and be an outstanding Assistant Attorney General for  antitrust.'' The authors of this letter also ``strongly urge[d] the  Committee to look favorably upon his nomination, with the hope that the  Senate can confirm him as soon as possible.''   Because Mr. Delrahim is so well respected, his nomination is one that  has enjoyed broad bipartisan support, including broad bipartisan  support within the Senate Judiciary Committee, on which I serve. He was  voted out of the committee by a vote of 19 to 1. That is not all that  common these days. Ranking Member Feinstein went out of her way to  explain that Mr. Delrahim ``will fully and fairly enforce our antitrust  laws.''   Despite this strong bipartisan support, Mr. Delrahim's nomination has  languished on the floor. In fact, the wait to confirm Makan Delrahim is  the longest for someone appointed to this  [[Page S5777]]  position in 40 years. Not since the Carter administration has a new  administration been forced to wait this long to fill the vacancy at the  Antitrust Division. President Carter's wait was largely due to the fact  that he took more than twice as long to nominate an Assistant Attorney  General for the Antitrust Division than did President Trump.   Apparently, some Democrats are still so eager to resist that they are  unwilling to allow us to confirm a nominee who many of them support.  This is unacceptable. Democrats understand that antitrust is essential  to ensuring that consumers receive the benefits of a competitive  economy: lower prices, more innovation, and more choice. You see, when  you have competition, good things happen. When you have competition, it  inevitably brings down prices, and it inevitably results in higher  quality.   In fact, last month some Democrats reiterated the importance of a  strong antitrust enforcement to our economy, and they did so by  releasing their Better Deal plan. The Democrats' plan describes the  effects that anticompetitive mergers can have, such as harming  consumers, customers, and suppliers.   Senator Klobuchar, along with several Democratic colleagues, followed  up on this plan by proposing legislation to enact some of these  policies into law. Although I don't agree with all of their proposed  solutions, I do agree with my colleagues from across the aisle that  antitrust enforcement should be a priority.   The best way to ensure that antitrust laws are being properly  prioritized is to make sure our antitrust agencies are fully staffed  and have leaders in place--leaders who have the requisite expertise and  ability; leaders who have broad bipartisan support from sitting  Senators, practitioners, and former agency leaders who know the  position and the exacting demands required by the position; leaders who  fit the description of Makan Delrahim.   Given his broad support, his impeccable qualifications, and the  importance of this position, there is no good reason to delay this  confirmation--quite to the contrary. This is a position that is neither  Republican nor Democratic. It is a position that is neither liberal nor  conservative. This position is there to advance bipartisan issues that  affect every American. And Makan Delrahim in this position at a  critical time in our Nation's history, at a critical time for antitrust  law--it is especially important that we have him in place.   Antitrust law is an area in which the United States has excelled  above and beyond what its peer nations have been able to achieve. We  developed this area of the law, and we did so with an eye toward  protecting consumers and competition itself rather than protecting  individual competitors. We have to lead, and the best way we can start  is by confirming Makan Delrahim. So I call upon the Senate to confirm  Makan Delrahim as Assistant Attorney General for the Antitrust Division  of the U.S. Department of Justice.   The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.
