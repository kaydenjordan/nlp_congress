 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to participate in the HRC  Foundation Welcoming Schools Jazz and Friends Day of School and  Community Readings.   Each year, this day is meant to inspire caring community members to  join together to affirm the rights of trans and non-binary youth and  show support for LGBTQ children and youth to have safe, affirming, and  welcoming schools and communities.   To take part in this year's readings, I am proud to stand on the  floor of the U.S. House of Representatives to read from ``When Aidan  Became a Brother,'' by author Kyle Lukoff:         When Aidan was born, everyone thought he was a girl. His       parents gave him a pretty name. His room looked like a girl's       room. And he wore clothes that other girls liked wearing.        But as Aidan got bigger, he hated the sound of his name. He       felt like his room belonged to someone else. And he always       ripped or stained his clothes accidentally-on-purpose.        Everyone thought he was just a different kind of girl.        Some girls had rooms full of science experiments and bug       collections.        Lots of girls didn't wear dresses.        But Aidan didn't feel like any kind of girl. He was really       another kind of boy.        It was hard to tell his parents what he knew about himself,       but it was even harder not to.        It took everyone some time to adjust, and they learned a       lot from other families with transgender kids like him.        Aidan explored different ways of being a boy. He tried out       lots of names until one stuck. They changed his bedroom into       a place where he belonged. He also took much better care of       his new clothes.        Then one day, Mom and Dad had something to tell him.        ``I'm going to have a baby,'' Mom announced.        ``A baby,'' Aidan said? ``Does that mean I get to be the       big brother?''        ``Of course,'' said Dad, ruffling his hair.        Aidan thought that being a big brother was an important job       for a boy like him. He wanted to make sure this baby would       feel understood right away.        The baby needed clothes, so Aidan and his mom went       shopping. There were so many choices! Would the baby like       seahorses or penguins better?        ``Are you having a boy or girl?'' asked a lady.        Aidan didn't like it when people asked if he was a boy or a       girl, and he hoped the baby couldn't hear yet. He was glad       when Mom just smiled and said, ``I'm having a baby.''        The baby's room needed to be painted, so Aidan and his dad       went to the hardware store. Dad chose a gallon of sky-blue       paint, and Aidan added a puffy-cloud white.        ``Are you excited for your new brother or sister?'' asked       the paint guy?        ``I'm excited to be a big brother,'' Aidan said.        The paint guy looked confused. Aidan could tell that he       wanted to ask a different question, and he was glad to have       his dad there.        The big rollers were fun to paint with. ``This room feels       just like being outside,'' Aidan exclaimed. He had always       felt trapped in his bedroom before they fixed it, but his new       sibling wouldn't have to feel that way.        ``You're right,'' said Dad. ``Let's make some shapes in the       clouds.''        Every baby needs a name. Aidan loved getting to choose his       own, but he remembered that it had been hard for his parents       to let go of the name they gave him. He looked for names that       could fit this new person no matter who they grew up to be.        Babies needed someone to read to them, so Aidan practiced       and practiced and practiced.        Dad wanted to teach Aidan how to change diapers. ``Um,       maybe later,'' said Aidan. He decided that picking flowers       for his mom was more important.        Two weeks before the baby's due date, Aidan started to       worry. Maybe he should have picked different clothes. The       blue walls might be too bright. He wished he could ask the       baby which name they liked best.        Mom came to tuck him in. ``Are you feeling okay, sweetie?''       she asked.        Aidan put his hands over where he thought the baby's ears       would be. ``Do you think the baby will be happy with       everything?'' he whispered. ``I don't want them to feel like       I did when I was little, but what if I get everything wrong?       What if I don't how to be a good big brother?''        Mom hugged him tight. ``When you were born, we didn't know       you were going to be our son. We made some mistakes, but you       helped us fix them. And you taught us how important it is to       love someone for exactly who they are. This baby is so lucky       to have you, and so are we.''        The next morning, Aidan found the boxes of his old baby       pictures. He looked so different back then! It hadn't been       easy, but he liked the boy he was growing into.        Maybe everything wouldn't be perfect for this baby. Maybe       he would have to fix mistakes he didn't even know he was       making. And maybe that was okay.        Aidan knew how to love someone, and that was the most       important part of being a brother.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to offer my support to the  Equality Act, a groundbreaking piece of legislation that will grant  equal protection under the law to our LGBTQ friends, family, neighbors,  as well as to me and my family.   As the first openly lesbian wife and mother in Congress and the first  LGBTQ Member of Congress from the great State of Minnesota, I know this  legislation is the culmination of a lifetime of work for so many.   My wife, Cheryl, and I have built a beautiful life together raising  four sons who we dearly love. We are fortunate to live in Minnesota, in  a State where many of the Equality Act's protections have already been  enshrined into law.   Right now, there are States across this country where it would be  entirely legal for Cheryl and I to be discriminated against--based on  our love and commitment to one another--in housing, employment, access  to credit, or any other number of areas essential to just living our  lives.                                time  1430    Now, some of my colleagues seem to believe this legislation somehow  could harm our non-LGBTQ women and girls, but that couldn't be further  from the truth.   The Equality Act does not undermine the achievements or aspirations  of non-LGBTQ. In fact, by amending the Civil Rights Act to prohibit  discrimination on the basis of sex in a broad area of life, we are  fighting to ensure that all women are treated equally in all aspects of  their lives.   The Equality Act is critical because when LGBTQ people have equality  under the law, we all benefit and all of our communities are stronger.   Mr. Speaker, as a teenage girl growing up in rural America, I never  could have imagined I would finally see this legislation come to the  House floor, much less as a Member of this body to see it passed. This  legislation is necessary, it is long overdue, and I urge my colleagues  to support it.
