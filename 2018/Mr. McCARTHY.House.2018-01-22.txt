 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to the order of the House of  today, I call up the bill (H.R. 195) to amend title 44, United States  Code, to restrict the distribution of free printed copies of the  Federal Register to Members of Congress and other officers and  employees of the United States, and for other purposes, with the Senate  amendment to the House amendment to the Senate amendment thereto, and  ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I have a motion at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 4 minutes.   Mr. Speaker, for 3 days, the Nation has watched as tens of thousands  of Federal employees were forced to stay home; as our men and women in  uniform went without pay; as opioid treatment centers got cut off; and  as parents faced the harrowing prospect that their children would lose  their health insurance.   The American people never wanted this to happen. Republicans in  Congress did not want this to happen. We did everything in our power to  make sure this didn't happen.   The House passed a clean bill. A bipartisan majority in the Senate  voted to pass that clean bill, but Senate Democrats shut it down.   We were told this was about immigration, but Republicans already said  we would sit at the table. We already were at the table every single  day before this shutdown, negotiating in good faith. Despite this  political drama, I remain eager to get back to the table and put this  all behind us.   So I must ask: What was gained here at the expense of the American  people? What was gained at the expense of our Nation's reputation as a  great and deliberative Republic?   Every policy in the House's original bill, the Senate passed today.  Every single policy is the same. If the Senate had passed this same  bill on Friday, all this disgraceful political theater would have never  happened.   Now, as it always should have been, our government will open, our  troops will be paid, and our children will have health insurance.   But that is not enough. We cannot continue to repeat the same  mistakes again. As my father used to tell me, it is not your mistakes  that define you; it is what you learned from them.   So let's commit to each other and to the American public that we will  not continue to fund our government through these short-term CRs. Let's  commit that we will pass through both Houses every appropriations bill  with full funding for our troops, full funding for our defense, and  full funding for every service our government owes to its people.   We all know this shutdown was an embarrassment. It didn't need to  happen. It should have never happened, and it will not happen again.   That, Mr. Speaker, is the government that the people want, the  government that the people need, and the government that the American  people deserve.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Wisconsin (Mr. Ryan), the Speaker of the House.   (Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin asked and was given permission to revise and  extend his remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to take from the  Speaker's table the concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 33) providing  for a correction in the enrollment of H.R. 195, and ask for its  immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the concurrent resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   On Monday, the House will meet at noon for morning hour and 2 p.m.  for legislative business. Votes will be postponed until 6:30 p.m. On  Tuesday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for morning hour and noon for  legislative business. The House will recess no later than 5 p.m. and  reconvene at approximately 8:35 p.m. for a joint session of Congress to  receive the President's State of the Union Address. Members are  requested to be on the floor and seated no later than 8:20 p.m. On  Wednesday, votes are no longer expected in the House.   Mr. Speaker, the House will consider a number of suspensions next  week, a complete list of which will be announced by close of business  this Friday.   In addition, the House will, once again, take up legislation to fund  the Department of Defense for its fiscal year. This bill will be fully  consistent with the National Defense Authorization Act, which passed  the House and Senate last year on a bipartisan basis and was signed  into law by President Trump.   Mr. Speaker, this House has shown that we stand ready to rebuild  America's military and give our men and women in uniform the resources  they need.   I will now encourage our Senate colleagues to do the same.                                time  1815     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I can't agree with him more. This body has passed all 12  appropriation bills. We do need a budget agreement. And we make  progress; once we get that budget agreement, I firmly believe we can  fund the rest of this year and  [[Page H622]]  next year going forward in what we actually need to get our jobs done.   The gentleman is correct, we have met numerous times. I thought they  have been very productive meetings dealing with DACA. We have narrowed  the scope to four areas.   I am excited to have the government back open. It also means we can  be back at the table to solve this problem. I know we have a short time  period. We have got a week left after the CR that we just passed, but I  believe, working together, we can get this done.
