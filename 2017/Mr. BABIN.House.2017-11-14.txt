 Mr. Speaker, this past Sunday was the International Day of  the Bible, and this week we are celebrating the National Bible Week  across the United States.   It is very fitting that we take time today on the floor of the  People's House to draw our nation's attention to the Bible. In his book  [[Page H9253]]  Reading the Bible with the Founding Fathers, Dr. Daniel Dreisbach  reminds us of the influential role the Bible served in the lives,  thoughts and ideas of our nation's Founding Fathers.   The Bible was the most accessible book to our Founding Fathers and  gave them insights on human nature, civic virtue, political authority,  and the rights and duties of citizens that informed them as they  formulated established the structures of government.   On a more personal level, I believe that the Bible is not simply an  inspirational book or a comforting book--although it is that. But, I  believe the Bible to be the holy word of God. It tells us the story of  God's love for us. It is a story of redemption for those who would put  their faith and trust in Christ alone.   John 3:16 tells us that ``God so loved the world that he gave his  only begotten son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish,  but have everlasting life.''   For me, as a follower of Jesus Christ, this is not only comforting  and inspiring but it is True and the Bible is a guide for my life.   Each day--and the older I get--I am reminded of the comforting Truth  in Job Chapter 19. Written centuries before the birth, crucifixion and  resurrection of Jesus, we were told of our redeemer. The one who would  save us.       For I know that my Redeemer lives,      And He shall stand at last on the earth;      And after my skin is destroyed, this I know,      That in my flesh I shall see God,      Whom I shall see for myself,      And my eyes shall behold, and not another.      How my heart yearns within me!        Job 19:25-27    This promise reminds me of the Lord's love for me--no matter what the  circumstances of life.   Maybe it's been a while since you poured over the pages of the Bible.  Maybe it's been collecting dust on a shelf. Take it down and read once  again the truthful and comforting words of God preserved for us and  given to us as a gift.   I thank my colleagues for reserving this time for me to join you in  sharing what the Bible means to me and hundreds of millions of others  across the world.                            ____________________
