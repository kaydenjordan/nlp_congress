 Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Mexican Fiesta  as it celebrates 45 years of bringing the culture and taste of Mexico  to Milwaukee, WI. Mexican Fiesta offers Wisconsin's Hispanic community  the opportunity to preserve its cultural identity and celebrate its  colorful traditions. I am so pleased to honor this Wisconsin  organization and to commemorate this significant milestone.   What began in 1973 as a Mexican Independence Day street festival on  Milwaukee's south side has now become one of the region's largest  festivals honoring Hispanic heritage. The festival grew so rapidly that  it was moved to the mammoth Henry Maier Festival Park just 4 short  years after its founding, where it has been held since 1977. Today,  nearly 85,000 people attend this wonderful event every year, which  contributes an estimated $8.5 million to Milwaukee's annual economy.   Mexican Fiesta honors Hispanic culture and showcases the beauty of  Mexico's rich history, art, music, and food, but it is more than just a  cultural celebration. The festival also provides an important gateway  to a college education for young Hispanics. Mexican Fiesta has  heightened the significance of its celebration by serving as the main  fundraiser for the Wisconsin Hispanic Scholarship Foundation, Inc., and  by highlighting the scholarship recipients during the festivities. In  addition to its scholarships, the foundation also works to improve the  standard of living in the Hispanic community, train its leaders, and  preserve and honor Hispanic traditions. The foundation has awarded more  than $1.3 million in scholarships and nearly $500,000 in grants to  nonprofit organizations since it was founded in 1987.   Wisconsin's Hispanic population increased by 95 percent from 2000 to  2015, growing to nearly 7 percent of the State's population. This was  the most rapid rise among any major ethnic group in the State. While  many Hispanic Wisconsinites reside in the southeastern corner of the  State, it is important that we embrace Hispanic culture throughout the  great State of Wisconsin. Mexican Fiesta serves as an important  reminder of the social and economic benefits of a diverse community in  Wisconsin and throughout our Nation.   We in Wisconsin owe a debt of gratitude to the organizers of Mexican  Fiesta for sharing the vibrant traditions and respected values of their  Hispanic heritage. That they take this time-honored celebration one  step further by investing in the future success of the next generation  makes this festival all the more meaningful. I am honored to recognize  the 45th anniversary of Mexican Fiesta and look forward to many more  successful fiestas in the years to come.                            ____________________
