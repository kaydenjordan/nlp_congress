 Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support  of H. Res. 296, which is an important resolution affirming the United  States record on the Armenian genocide that the House overwhelmingly  passed on Tuesday. This historic resolution makes clear that our Nation  unequivocally recognizes the Armenian genocide and encourages education  and understanding of these tragic events.   Madam Speaker, the Armenian genocide, the first genocide in the 20th  century, took place from 1915 to 1923. During this tragedy in history,  1.5 million Armenians were killed--men, women, and children.   I was privileged to visit Armenia earlier this year and talk to many  Armenians about this tragic history. We must remember and acknowledge  the lives that were taken and the pain that was inflicted. We can  neither forget the atrocities that took place then, or other examples  of ethnic cleansing, nor allow them to continue.   Madam Speaker, I am pleased that the body passed this critical  resolution on Tuesday for constituents in my district, across the  Nation, and the world.                            ____________________
