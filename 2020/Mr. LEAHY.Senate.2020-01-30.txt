 Mr. Chief Justice, I ask to send a question to the desk on  behalf of myself and Senator Blumenthal to the House managers.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, Senator.   The question for the House managers from Senator Leahy and Senator  Blumenthal:         The President's counsel claimed, ``If a president does       something which he believes will help him get elected in the       public interest that cannot be the kind of quid pro quo that       results in impeachment.'' He added a  [[Page S713]]       hypothetical, ``'I think I'm the greatest president there       ever was and if I'm not elected, the national interest will       suffer greatly.' That cannot be an impeachable offense.''       Under this view, there is no remedy to prevent a president       from conditioning foreign security assistance, in violation       of the Impoundment Control Act, on the recipient's       willingness to do the president a political favor. If the       Senate fails to reject this theory, what would stop a       president from withholding disaster aid funding from a U.S.       city until that mayor endorses him? What would stop the       president from withholding nearly any part of the $4.7       trillion annual federal budget subject to his personal       political benefit?    Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. Mr. Chief Justice, distinguished Members of the  Senate, I thank the Senators for that very important question.   Certainly, what we have alleged in this case is that the President  solicited a personal political benefit in exchange for an official act,  solicited dirt on a political opponent in exchange for the release of  $391 million in military aid, and solicited dirt in exchange for a  White House meeting. And if this Senate were to say that is acceptable,  then, precisely as was outlined in that question could take place all  across America in the context of the next election and any election-- grants allocated to cities or towns or municipalities across the  country, where the President could say: You are not going to get that  money, Mr. Mayor, Mrs. County Executive, Mrs. Town Supervisor, unless  you endorse me for reelection. The President could say that to any  Governor of our 50 States.   That is unacceptable. That cannot be allowed to happen in our  democratic Republic.   Now, by my count, as of this afternoon, the Framers of the  Constitution and the Founders of our great Republic had been quoted  either directly or mentioned by name 123 times: Alexander Hamilton, 48  times; James Madison, 35 times; George Washington, 24 times; John  Adams, 8 times; Thomas Jefferson and Ben Franklin, pulling up the rear,  4 times.   It seems to me that Ben Franklin and Thomas Jefferson need a little  bit more love, and so let me try to do my part.   Thomas Jefferson once observed that ``tyranny is defined as that  which is legal for the government but illegal for the citizenry.''  ``Legal for the government but illegal for the citizenry''--that is  what we confront right now.   President Trump corruptly abused his power. He targeted an American  citizen, pressured a foreign government to try to cheat in the upcoming  election, and the President's counsel would have you believe that is OK  because he is the President of the United States.   But our fellow citizens cannot cheat the Workers' Compensation Board  by claiming a fake injury and escape accountability. Our fellow  citizens cannot cheat the stock market by engaging in insider trading  and then escape accountability. Our fellow citizens cannot cheat the  college admissions process in order to get their child into an elite  university and then escape accountability.   Why should the President of the United States be allowed to cheat in  the upcoming election and escape accountability?   Tyranny is defined as that which is legal for the government and  illegal for the citizenry.   The President's counsel has suggested that President Trump can do  anything--anything that he wants--and escape accountability. President  Trump can solicit foreign interference in the upcoming election and  escape accountability. He can cheat and escape accountability. He can  engage in a coverup and escape accountability. He can corruptly abuse  his power, escape accountability; elevate his personal political  interest, subordinate America's national security interest, and escape  accountability.   That is the Fifth Avenue standard of Presidential accountability: I  can do anything I want. I can shoot someone on Fifth Avenue, and it  doesn't matter.   No. Lawlessness matters. Abuse of power matters. Corruption matters.  The Constitution matters.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, Mr. Manager.   The Senator from Louisiana.
