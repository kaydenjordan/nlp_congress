 Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding.   I rise in support of this legislation to protect jobs, support small  businesses, and save lives.   It is good that we agree on this funding, but Americans need more,  much more.   As of this morning, 26 million Americans have lost their jobs, in  some States as many as one-third of their workforce.   Workers need our help in a way that doesn't stop or expire. Congress  will have to do more to save small businesses both in funding, in  making changes, and exercising oversight to ensure that it goes to  small businesses.   State and local governments desperately need our help. The idea that  we would tell States and localities to bear the brunt and then let them  go bankrupt, and lay off medical workers, police, firefighters, and  teachers is despicable, and we must reject it.   Letting State and local governments flounder would dangerously weaken  the response ahead of the virus' second expected wave.   The American people deserve and need to be able to participate in  their democracy safely, without having to risk their lives, and  Congress should support State efforts to set up voting by mail.   Finally, postal workers are risking their lives every day to deliver  our mail. They deserve our support, and the Federal Government needs to  keep their agency from going bankrupt.   Only Congress can achieve these things, and we cannot delay. The need  in this country is urgent, and the American people are depending on us.                                time  1245
