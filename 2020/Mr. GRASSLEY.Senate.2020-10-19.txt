 Madam President, I ask to speak for 1 minute in morning  business, please.    Last week, news broke about Hunter Biden's questionable  financial dealings. That information, allegedly from Hunter Biden's  laptop, appears to show that Vice President Biden may have been more  aware of his son's financial dealings with foreign despots and  criminals than he admitted to the American people. That information was  quickly censored by big tech companies.   Just today, DNI Director Ratcliffe said that Hunter Biden's laptop  issue is not part of a Russian disinformation campaign.   The Steele dossier is fake news, but I don't recall reporters and Big  Tech censoring the false reporting about President Trump and the Steele  dossier. Instead, the liberal media did just the opposite. They became  superspreaders of false reporting across the world.   What happened last week is election interference and anti- conservative bias, and Facebook and Twitter are guilty. Democrats and  liberals in the press can't have veto authority over information just  because it makes their nominee look bad. They can't have a double  standard. Vice President Biden owes the American people answers.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1  minute as in morning business.    Mr. President, fellow Iowan Dan Gable is one of the  greatest athletes and coaches in American history. President Trump has  selected Dan to receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom--the highest  civilian honor. I sent a letter to the White House after hearing about  grassroots support in Iowa for this award.   Dan Gable is a household name for every Iowa sports fan. As a  wrestler at Iowa State University, Dan won two collegiate  championships--a world championship and an Olympic Gold Medal. His  overall high school and college records are 181 victories, 1 defeat.  That one defeat came in the finals of the NCAA tournament of his senior  year. In his coaching career at the University of Iowa, he led to 15  national team championships out of the 21 years that he coached.   As a coach at the University of Iowa, Dan developed All Americans,  national champions, Big Ten champions, and Olympians. Dan is the  paragon of the American dream in his achieving success through  community, courage, hard work, and determination.   I congratulate Dan on this outstanding achievement   I yield the floor.
