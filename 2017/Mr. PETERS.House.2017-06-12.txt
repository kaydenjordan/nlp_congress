 Mr. Speaker, hydropower is one of the few carbon-free  energy sources that provides a steady baseload of electricity.  Producing more electricity from hydropower helps us meet our clean  energy goals and reduce harmful emissions that pollute our air and  water.   This bill, the Hydropower Permit Extension Act, would cut red tape  for hydropower construction permits and incentivize greater investment  in this energy source.   The act gives already approved hydropower projects an extra year on  their initial permit and allows FERC to grant a 4-year extension to  projects that are delayed from breaking ground during their initial  permit.   And as the gentlewoman from Colorado (Ms. DeGette) said, right now  this takes an act of Congress to extend construction permits for  hydropower projects, even though they have gone through a rigorous  environmental regulatory process.   Moving forward, the ultimate solution to unlocking hydropower is to  streamline the regulatory process. It is my hope that we can continue  to have bipartisan, productive conversations like these on how to get  hydropower projects moving, how to get them approved more quickly,  while still meeting high environmental standards.   I want to thank Chairman Walden and Ranking Member Pallone, Chairman  Upton and Ranking Member Rush, for working with me and the committee to  advance this bill through the committee and to the floor.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill.
