 Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute. Upon such notification,  the Congress has 30 calendar days during which the sale may be  reviewed. The provision stipulates that, in the Senate, the  notification of proposed sales shall be sent to the chairman of the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee.   In keeping with the committee's intention to see that relevant  information is available to the full Senate, I ask unanimous consent to  have printed in the Record the notifications which have been received.  If the cover letter references a classified annex, then such annex is  available to all Senators in the office of the Foreign Relations  Committee, room SD-423.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:   [[Page S5448]]                                                     Defense Security                                              Cooperation Agency,                                                      Arlington, VA.

The principal contractor involved in this program is       Raytheon Missile Systems (RMS) of McKinney, Texas. There are       no known offset agreements proposed in connection with this       potential sale.        Implementation of this proposed sale will involve multiple       trips to Bahrain involving up to ten (10) U.S. Government and       contractor representatives over a period of less than 16       weeks in total.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.                            Transmittal No. 18-15       Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to           Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act                             Annex Item No. vii         (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:        1. This sale will involve the release of sensitive       technology to Bahrain. The Improved Target Acquisition System       (ITAS) is designed to fire all existing versions of the TOW       missile and consists of a Target Acquisition Subsystem (TAS),       a Fire Control Subsystem (FCS), a Li-Ion Battery Box (LBB), a       modified Traversing Unit (TU) plus the standard launch tube       and tripod. The ITAS provides for the integration of both the       direct view optics and a second generation Standard Advanced       Dewar Assembly (SADA) II thermal sensor into a single       housing; direct view optics that provide viewing the target       scene in daylight and non-obscured conditions; introduction       of both passive and active eye safe laser-ranging;       development of embedded training and training sustainment;       automatic bore sight which allows the gunner to align the       night vision system with the direct view optics; insertion of       advanced Built-in Test/Built-in Test Equipment (BIT/BITE)       which provides fault detection and recognition and go/no go       status for the gunner; and an Aided Target Tracker (ATT) that       provides the capability to process infrared imagery into       recognizable contour features used to assist the gunner's aim       point.
