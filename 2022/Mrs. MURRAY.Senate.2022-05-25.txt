 I ask for the yeas and nays.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  following Senators be permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes each  prior to the scheduled votes: Murray, Wyden, and Brown.    Madam President, I come to the floor today to support  the nomination of Lisa Gomez as the Assistant Secretary for the  Department  [[Page S2694]]  of Labor's Employee Benefit Security Administration, or EBSA.   EBSA has the massive task of helping retirees recover the benefits  they are entitled to and forcing protections for people who get their  healthcare coverage through their job, and overseeing millions of  retirement plans, health plans, and other welfare benefit plans.   We need a strong leader at EBSA who will protect families' savings  and futures and make sure people get the benefits they deserve under  Federal law.   We need someone like Lisa Gomez. Ms. Gomez is a highly respected  professional in the field of employee benefits law, who has represented  a wide range of health plans, retirement plans, and more. And I am  confident as Assistant Secretary she will fight to hold employers  accountable to the law, ensure workers get the benefits they are owed,  and protect families' financial security, and I strongly urge all of my  colleagues to join me in voting to confirm her.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print the  following letter in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:           U.S. Senate, Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and             Pensions,                                      Washington, DC, May 25, 2022.      To the Secretary of the Senate:        PN1938, the nomination of Kalpana Kotagal, of Ohio, to be a       Member of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, having       been referred to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor,       and Pensions, the Committee, with a quorum present, has voted       on the nomination as follows--        On the question of reporting the nomination without       recommendation, 11 ayes to 11 noes.        In accordance with section 3, paragraph (1)(A) of S. Res.       27 of the 117th Congress, I hereby give notice that the       Committee has not reported the nomination because of a tie       vote, and ask that this notice be printed in the Record       pursuant to the resolution.                                                      Patty Murray,      Chair.                            ____________________
