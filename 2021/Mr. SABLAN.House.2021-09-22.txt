 Mr. Speaker, my amendment No. 363, which is included in  En Bloc 3, ensures the 1,700 small businesses in my district can access  financing through the Small Business Administration's micro loan  program.   The program is targeted specially to help women, low-income, veteran,  and minority entrepreneurs.   The Marianas is the only place in the U.S. not included in the  program, which provides loans, typically not offered by banks, of up to  $50,000.   My bipartisan amendment would correct that by ensuring access to  microloans on the same basis as their counterparts across the nation.   I thank Representatives Garbarino, Kahele, and Radewagen for their  cosponsorship of the amendment.   I ask my colleagues to support En Bloc 3.
