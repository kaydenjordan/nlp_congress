 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me the  time.   Let us not mince words about what happened last week. It was a  violent attempt to interrupt our democratic process. It was a targeted  blow at the most essential process that makes us a democracy. It was  directly and specifically incited by the President of the United  States.   For years, we have been asked to turn a blind eye to the criminality,  corruption, and blatant disregard to the rule of law by the tyrant  President we have in the White House. We, as a nation, can no longer  look away.   The President not only incited an insurrection against our government  but has, in word and deed, led a rebellion.   We cannot simply move past this or turn the page. For us to be able  to survive as a functioning democracy, there has to be accountability.   We must impeach and remove this President from office immediately so  that he cannot be a threat to our democracy.   I stand ready to fulfill my oath of office. I challenge my colleagues  on the other side of the aisle to do the same.
