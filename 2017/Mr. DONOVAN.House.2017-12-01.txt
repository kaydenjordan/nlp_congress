 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge the 70th  anniversary of the National Urban Security Technology Laboratory, also  known as NUSTL.   Located in New York City, NUSTL has been a critical asset in  protecting our homeland since 1947. It began as a lab to measure  radioactive fallout. Now as part of the Department of Homeland  Security's Science and Technology Directorate, it has been transformed  into a one-of-a-kind testing and evaluation laboratory for the first  responder community.   I have had the opportunity to visit NUSTL and saw firsthand the  impressive work being done on a daily basis. It is constantly  developing and testing new tools that ensure the brave women and men on  our front lines can protect our homeland, and it is critical they have  the resources needed to continue their innovative work.   I thank the dedicated women and men of NUSTL for their services.  Congratulations on this important anniversary. I look forward to  continuing to celebrate your remarkable accomplishments for years to  come.                            ____________________
