 Madam Speaker, tonight starts the latest development in  this political circus otherwise known as the Select Committee to  Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol. In  prime time.   Instead of working to combat issues facing Americans, such as  skyrocketing inflation, decreases in real wages, gas prices barreling  towards $7 a gallon or $8--if you are a lucky Californian--or the  invasion of our southern border, House Democrats are continuing their  witch hunt against former President Trump, who seems to still be living  rent-free inside their heads.   This time, in a certain boost to their own vanity, the committee has  hired former ABC News president, James Goldston, to produce it.   They aren't interested in the truth. They aren't interested in  justice; not even the intel that was available ahead of the possible  Capitol break-in that they knew about.   The committee is putting on a spectacle, a Hollywood produced, prime- time television soap opera to distract viewers from the real policy- made disasters.    How out of touch are they with the American people? Do you think the  young mother desperately trying to find formula for her newborn cares  about this hearing?   Do you think the farmer who can't plant this year due to the water  shortage, the water being taken away, or the trucker who can't use his  equipment because diesel is over $7 or $8 cares about this hearing?   Even liberal San Francisco recalled their radical DA because he  stopped caring about the people and opened up the city to a crime wave  they haven't seen in decades.   People want answers and change, and it isn't about this January 6  deal.                            ____________________
