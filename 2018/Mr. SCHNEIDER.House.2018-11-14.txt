 Mr. Speaker, time and time again, President Trump has  sought to undermine the independence of the Justice Department and its  investigation into the Russian election interference led by Special  Counsel Robert Mueller. The President's recent decision to fire  Attorney General Jeff Sessions is just the most recent example.   The President's effort to put the Mueller investigation under the  supervision of an acting attorney general, Matthew Whitaker, with his  long and vocal history of bias against this very investigation, is  simply unacceptable.   The Mueller team must be allowed to finish its work without  interference. This is more than just knowing what happened in 2016. It  is imperative that we learn from the past to protect our Nation from  future threats.   I urge the acting attorney general to do the right thing: recuse  himself and return supervision of the investigation to Deputy Attorney  General Rod Rosenstein.   I ask my colleagues in Congress to exercise our responsibility in  upholding the rule of law and pass legislation that would protect the  special counsel from a politically motivated firing. I await the  findings of the special counsel and will follow the facts wherever they  lead.                            ____________________
