 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to raise safety concerns that  remain unaddressed in H.R. 3617, the Marijuana Reinvestment and  Expungement Act--known as the MORE Act. I believe there are serious  safety concerns to be addressed prior to this chamber advancing this  legislation.   According to recent data, the safety impacts of cannabis legalization  for adult recreational use should not be ignored.   A 2020 AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety study analyzed the impacts  of legal adult recreational use of cannabis in Washington state. The  AAA study concluded that the proportion of fatal-crash-involved drivers  who were THC-positive approximately doubled from the level observed  before the law went into effect.   Moreover, a series of studies conducted by the Insurance Institute  for Highway Safety (IIHS) found that crash rates increased in some of  my neighboring states and others after they legalized marijuana.  California, Colorado, Nevada, and Oregon, specifically, were the  subjects of the IIHS evaluation.   Marijuana use impacts the psycho-motor skills of the people who use  it, often resulting in slowed responses. As seen by these earlier data,  this impacts how we drive, overall safety on our roadways, and may have  other safety impacts as we relax the laws around cannabis. I have  serious safety concerns, and I would like to see these issues addressed  more directly before I can consider supporting such legislation. To  this end, I am developing my own legislation to look at this issue in  workplaces to ensure safe, impairment free operations, and I look  forward to working with my colleagues to see it enacted.
