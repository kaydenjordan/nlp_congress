 Mr. President, today I rise to recognize the  40th anniversary of the Food Bank of Northern Nevada and the important  place this institution occupies in our great State. The Food Bank of  Northern Nevada serves the northern Nevada region through a network of  over 150 organizations dedicated to helping families in need. In their  40 years, they have grown from a small pantry serving their community,  to a large regional leader in the fight against food insecurity. In  2022, the Food Bank of Northern Nevada provided over 19 million meals.   The Food Bank of Northern Nevada is a proud member of the Feeding  America network, which includes more than 200 food banks nationwide.  Their collaborative and innovative solutions to addressing food  insecurity in northern Nevada are vital to the health of communities  across our State. The Food Bank delivers tens of millions of nutritious  meals to families annually. Every month, they serve over 140,000  [[Page S5744]]  people through their support of an extensive network of community  pantries, soup kitchens, emergency shelters, and specialized programs  for children and seniors. As we see record-setting numbers of families  in need of food assistance, the Food Bank continues to play a vital  role in serving our great State.   Food insecurity affects our entire community. Food insecure children  can struggle to achieve their potential in school, and seniors are too  often faced with having to choose between medical care and putting food  on the table. Among the Food Bank of Northern Nevada's clients, 58  percent are over age 50, and another 37 percent are under age 18. We  recognize the Food Bank of Northern Nevada for continuing to innovate  with their prescription pantry program, connecting families with  Federal nutrition programs like SNAP and bringing healthy fruits and  vegetables to families and seniors in the neighborhoods where they  live. The Food Bank of Northern Nevada could not tackle the important  task of working to end hunger without the support of countless  Nevadans. Volunteers are at the heart of the organization from those  who donate and sort food at the distribution center, to the many  businesses and individuals whose donations ensure there is always food  available to those who need it.   I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating the Food Bank of  Northern Nevada for 40 years of tireless commitment to serving the most  vulnerable members of our community and helping working families live  healthy lives. I know the Food Bank of Northern Nevada will continue to  advocate for families and deliver nutritious food to many throughout  northern Nevada.                            ____________________
