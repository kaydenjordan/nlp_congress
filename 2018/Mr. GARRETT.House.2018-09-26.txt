 Somewhere, Mr. Speaker, someone is watching what is  going on in this Chamber. Even now, probably in a Nation of 320-plus  million, many someones are watching, and most of them don't have a clue  who I am, and that is okay. But the fact that most of them don't have a  clue who the lady pictured to my left, your right, is, is not okay.   On April 23, 1951, in Prince Edward County, Virginia, at the R.R.  Moton High School, a 16-year-old student named Barbara Rose Johns  strode onto a stage and implored her peers at this all-African American  high school to assert their God-given rights of equality.   I am honored today by the presence of Ms. Johns' sister, Joan Johns,  in the gallery. She is tickled when she speaks to me, which tickles me,  because I am tickled when I speak to her. I told her earlier today, Mr.  Speaker, that I was in love with her sister. It is interesting, because  she is sitting with my wife.                                time  2000    The reason that I say that is that I love America, and as a member of  the State house, I had the honor of carrying legislation that made  April 23 Barbara Johns Day in Virginia. The reason is that Barbara  Johns' story is a story that every American should know.   Someone had the temerity to tell me, as I worked towards creating  Barbara Johns Day, ``That is Black history.'' Mr. Speaker, it is not  Black history or White history. It is American history. And America is  not Black or White or brown. America is an idea.   So when the Founders drafted the preamble to the Constitution and  called for us to form a more perfect Union, the presence of the word  ``more'' implied a perpetual duty. And the revolution that cast off an  oppressive government from across an ocean against Great Britain is one  that I would argue was perpetual, and that another hero of mine named  Thomas Jefferson was a slave owner, certainly an imperfect man, who  articulated near perfect ideas.   Fast-forward to April 23, 1951. Barbara Johns, with a clean and clear  and bright mind, influenced by her teachers and her Uncle Vernon Johns,  understood that rights are not given by government but by something  bigger, and understood that the duty of a citizen and a free nation was  to assert their God-given rights. So the idea of something as  draconianly oppressive as separate but equal was intolerable.   That day, she implored her students to walk out of Moton High School  and the tar paper shacks and the leaking roofs and to demand equality  not of outcomes, but of opportunity, because that is what America is  supposed to be--without regard to gender, without regard to race,  without regard to faith.   Now, what that manifested itself in was a court case, Davis v. Prince  Edward County. That court case was amalgamated into another case of  which I hope that people have heard, Brown v. Board of Education. The  difference between that case and every other case was that those were  initiated by lawyers, and this case was initiated by a 16-year-old girl  who understood that the promise of liberty was not just to one group or  another, that the American Revolution was perpetual, and that God had  given her rights just like everyone else to be asserted as a citizen in  a free society.   The fact that people watching don't know who I am is fine by me, but  the fact that our students don't understand that America is supposed to  be not Black or White or brown, but an idea wherein all people are  created equal with an opportunity to succeed based on their work and  their merit, that is not okay.   As a result, Mr. Speaker, we filed H.R. 5561, the Barbara Johns  Congressional Gold Medal Act. Her efforts, without lauding herself,  without patting herself on the back--indeed, going forth from this date  and living a humble life as a wife and a librarian, as she aspired to-- are the embodiment of the nameless faces of millions who sacrificed so  that we can live in a country that seeks to employ an idea that is the  greatest idea known to the history of free people.   The civil rights movement is not a Black history story. It is not a  White history story. It is an American history story. We are not a  Black nation or a White nation. We are a nation built on an idea, and  our students and our posterity need to understand that what makes us  great is that this right fought for by people like this lady isn't  universal.   So, Mr. Speaker, I hope that if the President is watching, he will  file a Presidential Medal of Freedom; I hope that if Members or staff  are watching, they will sign on to the Barbara Johns Congressional Gold  Medal Act; and I hope that if students are watching, they will go to  school tomorrow and tell their peers this is a country where people  stood up so that we all have a chance to be that which we dream to be,  because that is who Barbara Rose Johns was, and it is an American  history story worth telling.
