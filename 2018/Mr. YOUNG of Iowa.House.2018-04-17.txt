 Mr. Speaker, I thank both of my colleagues from  Texas for their support of this measure.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my bipartisan bill, H.R.  2905, the Justice for Victims of IRS Scams and Identity Theft Act of  2018.   Scams and identity theft are increasingly complex and growing  problems. Americans lose billions of dollars to criminals--my colleague  called them con artists; that is what they are--executing identity  theft and fraud each year. Many in the Third District of Iowa have  spoken to me about their fear of having their identity, bank or credit  card numbers, and other personal information stolen.   Mr. Speaker, imagine getting a call from your bank or credit card  company explaining your information has been stolen. Or imagine having  a Federal agent knock on your door because someone stole your name,  Social Security number, or banking information.                                time  1300    This reality can turn a family's world upside down. Millions of  Americans have gotten that call, and many have lost everything because  of identity theft.  [[Page H3358]]    The Justice for Victims of IRS Scams and Identity Theft Act of 2018  requires the Attorney General and Treasury Secretary to create and  submit reports to Congress about identity theft and fraud across the  United States.   In 2016, the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration,  Russell George, said Americans submit up to 14,000 complaints about IRS  impersonation scams every week. He also said IRS impersonation scams  were ``the largest, most pervasive impersonation scam in the history of  the agency.'' This is serious. These scams are indiscriminate and can  impact any person at any time.   The report submitted to Congress by the Attorney General as a result  of my bill--this bipartisan bill--will contain the number of defendants  referred to the Department of Justice for identity theft and fraud, a  map of the United States which shows where cases were referred from,  and the rate of conviction for cases prosecuted.   This bill also recommends the Attorney General provide information on  how to improve collaboration with other Federal agencies and discuss  trends in identity theft and fraud cases. The Department of Justice  should suggest what we can do to deter criminals and prevent identity  theft from happening.   The report from the Treasury Secretary will contain what efforts the  Secretary has undertaken in the prosecution of IRS impersonation cases  and recommendations for resources needed to assist victims of these  crimes.   As founder of the Bipartisan Task Force to Combat Identity Theft and  Fraud, I have compiled helpful resources to ensure all Iowans and  Americans have the tools and resources they need to stay informed and  protected from these scams. I know my colleagues do this, as well, for  their constituents.   The reports from the Attorney General and Treasury Secretary will  help Americans protect themselves and give Members of Congress the  tools we need to better protect our bosses: our constituents.   Mr. Speaker, fighting these criminals starts with knowing what is out  there and being as prepared as possible, which is why I encourage my  colleagues to join me in support of this bipartisan bill.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call on my colleagues  in Congress to extend the biodiesel and renewable diesel tax incentives  through the end of this year.   For many years, biodiesel producers, blenders, and marketers have  endured inconsistent Federal tax treatment, while being asked to wait  for a much-needed thoughtful and comprehensive look at energy tax  policy. We just celebrated the end of an old, outdated, and out-of- touch Tax Code, and it is time to deal with the last pieces of  uncertainty.   Biodiesel provides important environmental and economic benefits  across the country, helps us reduce our reliance on foreign energy  sources, and is a reliable source of American-made energy. Production  has long been stymied by the on-again, off-again policy Congress has  been implementing, and we must provide certainty to the markets and to  all the producers, blenders, and marketers whose livelihood depends on  biodiesel.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me and extend the biodiesel  and renewable diesel tax incentives to the end of this year, and work  with me and others, in a bipartisan way, to find a more permanent  solution to this system of irresponsible stopgap tax extensions.                            ____________________
