 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, 2 years ago, the Senate Democratic  leader stood on the steps of the Supreme Court and threatened two  Justices by name. ``You will pay the price,'' he shouted. ``You won't  know what hit you.'' A month ago, after the precedent-breaking leak of  a draft opinion, top Democrats intensified the reckless talk. Hillary  Clinton said the Court was poised to ``kill and subjugate women.''  Leader Schumer and Speaker Pelosi said the Court would be ``ripp[ing]  up the Constitution.'' Some of the most powerful people in the country  pushing total hysteria over the possibility that Justices may--may-- overturn a decision that even Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said was  badly reasoned.   Far-left activists publicized Justices' private addresses and  encouraged angry people to flock to their homes. President Biden and  his White House were asked to condemn these intimidation tactics, and  they refused. I wrote to Attorney General Garland about a month ago,  asking why he wasn't enforcing the laws on the books already against  judicial intimidation.   Look, everybody saw where this climate might lead. So, yesterday  morning, U.S. marshals arrested a deranged person who traveled to  Washington from California in order to assassinate a Supreme Court  Justice at his house. He has reportedly been charged with attempted  murder. The FBI says the would-be assassin was armed and equipped for a  break-in. He told authorities that he was trying to think about how to  give his life a purpose. Apparently, it was only when he came across  the Justice's address posted online that it occurred to him to attempt  a murder-suicide. He explained that his problem with this Justice was  ideological, citing abortion and the Second Amendment.   While this would-be assassin was making his plan and traveling across  [[Page S2877]]  the country, House Democrats have spent weeks--weeks--blocking  bipartisan legislation to strengthen security for the Justices and  their families.   This bipartisan bill passed the Senate unanimously in early May.  Chairman Durbin is a strong supporter. But inexplicably--inexplicably-- this urgent and uncontroversial bill has been sitting on Speaker  Pelosi's desk ever since. The same House Democrats whose irresponsible  rhetoric has contributed to this dangerous climate are themselves  blocking added security for the Justices and their spouses and their  children. Even last night--last night--even after this arrest was  made, even after a leftwing group published an ominous social media  post concerning a school that a Justice's children attend, when Leader  McCarthy asked consent to pass the uncontroversial bill, House  Democrats objected to it.    Meanwhile, the Biden Department of Justice, under Attorney General  Garland, continues to flatly ignore section 1507 of the Criminal Code,  which would appear to make it a Federal crime to protest at the homes  of Federal judges to influence them over a pending case. That is the  law right now.   So this has been a shameful and disturbing two-step from Washington  Democrats. First they use reckless rhetoric that helps fuel the  dangerous climate, and then they refuse to do their jobs and address  the problem. The same far left that has spent years trying to  improperly pressure the Court is now aiding and abetting this illegal  intimidation campaign through total inaction.   So why won't President Biden call on his supporters to leave the  Justices alone?   President Biden, call on your supporters to leave the Justices alone.   Why won't the Attorney General of the United States enforce existing  law? Why won't the Speaker stop blocking a bipartisan security bill  that passed the Senate unanimously?   So it is hard to avoid concluding that perhaps some Democrats may  want this dangerous climate hanging over the Justices' heads as they  finish up this term--a disgraceful--disgraceful--dereliction of duty.  This is antithetical to the rule of law. The Speaker of the House and  the Attorney General must honor their oaths to the Constitution and do  their jobs.   I understand Democrats want to stage a big spectacle this week about  what they claim is their opposition to political violence, but in  reality, they are going out of their way to block concrete steps to  prevent political violence.                                Foreign Policy    Madam President, now on an entirely separate matter, 1 year ago  yesterday, the Biden administration announced its withdrawal from  Afghanistan had reached a halfway point.   Analysis after analysis has confirmed what was clear to many of us in  real time: The President's shoddy plans for a reckless pullout were  doomed to disaster from the start.   Back in February, an Army investigation found that in the run-up to  President Biden's botched retreat, his senior national security and  diplomatic advisers were ``not seriously planning for an evacuation''  and not paying attention to ``what was happening on the ground.'' That  is an Army investigation of the withdrawal.   Last month, the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan  Reconstruction blasted the administration's bad judgment before  Congress. He explained that removing U.S. military and contractor  support to our Afghan partners was ``the single most important factor''  in the collapse--the collapse--of Afghanistan's resistance to the  Taliban.   It is not just that this giant policy failure should have been  foreseeable to the Biden administration; it was, in fact, foreseen.  Experts spent months warning that the President's policies would create  chaos. I spent months saying the very same thing.   Now many of the worst predictions about the aftermath are coming true  before our eyes. Our country and our partners are facing needlessly  heightened risk from terrorists because of how the Biden administration  botched Afghanistan. Yet the administration is still in denial.   In a letter to Congress just yesterday, the Commander in Chief  claimed the United States ``remains postured to address threats'' to  both our homeland and our interests ``that may arise from inside  Afghanistan.'' But the reality is that Pentagon leaders have been clear  about the dramatic ways the withdrawal has limited our ability to  identify, to target, and to strike terrorists in Afghanistan.   The former commander of U.S. Central Command says that forcing U.S.  air assets to travel longer distances to reach Afghan airspace means  severely limiting the time they can spend actually performing  counterterrorism missions--just as we predicted.   A brandnew report from the lead inspector general for our ongoing  counterterrorism operations further confirms that the Biden  administration's mistakes have put us way, way behind the  curve. Without human intelligence or bases in the country, the United  States is already suffering from less insight into emerging terror  threats. Our sources are drying up just as we predicted.    We haven't conducted a single strike against a military target in  Afghanistan since the last military personnel left Kabul, and that  isn't because there aren't any terrorists there. As the IG report  confirms, it is because of ``logistical challenges and limited  intelligence.''   The Taliban-Haqqani government in Kabul is not just a state sponsor  of terrorism, it is literally a government made up of terrorists and  kidnappers with deep ties to Al Qaeda.   Even as the Biden team continues to pretend that over-the-horizon  operations are not inadequate in Afghanistan, they are implicitly  acknowledging that same insufficiency in other theaters. Last month,  President Biden redeployed U.S. troops to Somalia, reestablishing a  limited but real presence intended to help local partners prevent their  country from becoming a terrorist haven. So President Biden's own  actions in Somalia give rise to the false claims in Afghanistan. In  point of fact, the longest term vision about counterterrorism this  White House has managed to lay out is their obsession--obsession--with  someday shutting down the Guantanamo Bay detention center entirely.   I have yet to hear any coherent plans for what the Biden  administration intends to do with the dangerous killers currently held  there. Will they continue to rely on third countries to detain  terrorists? That is the strategy that made possible the Taliban's  massive jailbreak of thousands of hardened terrorists from Bagram after  this administration fled Afghanistan.   Does the administration intend to send terrorists to Syria to be held  indefinitely by a nongovernmental entity like the Syrian Defense  Forces? In that case, how long is the Biden administration prepared to  remain in Syria to make sure that ISIS, Hezbollah, or the Assad regime  can't facilitate another giant jailbreak?   The American people and our coalition partners deserve a clear,  coherent counterterrorism strategy that leaves our homeland safer and  our partnerships stronger.   The Biden administration is providing, unfortunately, exactly the  opposite.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
