 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the hard work of  the Alzheimer's Association.   This month, over 1,000 men and women will come together in Washington  for the annual Alzheimer's Impact Movement Advocacy Forum. These  advocates, like so many of us, have faced the pain of Alzheimer's,  either through a friend, a loved one, or their own experience. By  sharing their stories, we can raise awareness and, hopefully, implement  policies that improve the lives of those suffering from this disease.   One of these policies, Mr. Speaker, is the Improving HOPE for  Alzheimer's Act. I encourage my colleagues to join me as a cosponsor of  the bill, which will provide Medicare outreach and reporting on  Alzheimer's care.   Mr. Speaker, I commend the Alzheimer's Association and the many  advocates who will be in Washington this month for sharing their  stories, especially Kanada Yazbek, a constituent of Minnesota's Sixth  Congressional District.   Not only does she have family members who have been diagnosed with  the disease, Kanada has Alzheimer's. Everywhere and anywhere people  will listen, Kanada spreads the word about Alzheimer's and its impact  on families and the urgent need to find a cure.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join us in standing up to stop  this devastating disease.                     Teaching Financial Literacy for Life     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend the McKinley Area  Learning Center in Waite Park, Minnesota, for their participation in  the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association's annual  Capitol Hill Challenge.   This challenge, which matches teachers and students with Members of  Congress, gives teams of three to five middle or high school students a  hypothetical $100,000 portfolio of stocks, mutual funds, bonds, and  liquid assets. The 10 teams with the best performing portfolios win a  trip to Washington.   The challenge highlights essential financial literacy, like  investing. The students also work together to manage this portfolio  and, in the process, learn the value of teamwork.   Good luck to the McKinley Area Learning Center students participating  in the Capitol Hill Challenge. We look forward to hearing more about  your progress, and good luck in the competition.                  Recognizing Next Generation of Astronomers     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Minnesota's  National Space Grant College and Fellowship Program.   The Minnesota program distributes funds to sponsor student  fellowships and scholarships related to space research, education, and  public service. These grants can accelerate the diversity of the STEM  field for future generations by supporting women and other students  from underrepresented groups.   Mr. Speaker, I want to particularly highlight the work of St. Cloud  State University, which is working with the Leech Lake Tribal College  to develop Native American knowledge of astronomy and model rocketry in  the community and workshops for teachers across our State.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the universities and colleges across Minnesota  that are contributing to the program, and I thank all the students  whose work today will advance our future in space.             Congratulating Mary Degiovanni, Champion for Sartell     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mary Degiovanni,  who announced in January that she is retiring in July after 16 years of  working for the city of Sartell.   After serving as city administrator in Annandale, Mary joined the  city of Sartell as finance director in 2004. Since 2013, she has served  as a strong and capable city administrator.   In her tenure, Mary has overseen rapid growth in Sartell, with  projects from updating facilities at Watab Park and Lake Francis Park,  to building a new community center and public safety facility.   As a community leader, Mary has helped build a Sartell that is ready  to welcome new generations of citizens. Rapid expansions in the area,  including into industries like medical technology, presented challenges  that Mary overcame.   Congratulations on your retirement, Mary. We are grateful for your  service.                                time  1015            Congratulating the Champion Andover Girls Hockey Team     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to applaud the Andover High  School Huskies women's hockey team, who won the class AA State  championship just a couple of weeks ago. The Huskies' win is the first  Minnesota State high school league championship in the history of  Andover.   In the championship game at the Xcel Energy Center in Saint Paul,  Andover upset the highly favored Edina High School Hornets by a score  of 5-3. The Huskies' championship is all the more sweet considering the  favored Hornets had won three straight State championships.   Congratulations to Coach Melissa Volk and the Huskies on making  history for Andover.                            ____________________
