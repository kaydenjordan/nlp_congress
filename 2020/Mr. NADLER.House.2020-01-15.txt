 Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 767, I send  to the desk the resolution (H. Res. 798) appointing and authorizing  managers for the impeachment trial of Donald John Trump, President of  the United States, and ask for its immediate consideration.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        January 15, 2020, on page H252, the following appeared:  Madam  Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 767, I send to the desk the  resolution (H. Res. 798) appointing and authorizing managers for  the impeachment trial of Donald John Trump, President of the  United States,    ========================= END NOTE =========================       Madam Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes.   Madam Speaker, the resolution before us today appoints managers to  prosecute the Senate impeachment trial of President Trump.   This trial is necessary because President Trump gravely abused the  power of his office when he strong-armed a foreign government to  announce investigations into his domestic political rival. He betrayed  our country when he used powers of his office, including withholding  vital U.S. military assistance, to pressure that government to help him  win reelection.   He invited foreign interference into our elections again. He  jeopardized our national security. He did all of this for his personal  political gain.   And then he violated the Constitution by stonewalling Congress'  efforts to investigate, ordering an absolute blockade of evidence.  Despite that, the House was able to uncover powerful evidence that  demonstrates, beyond a doubt, the President's betrayal and violations  of the Constitution.   But we still have not heard the whole truth because the President has  refused to allow a single document to be turned over to the House in  response to our impeachment subpoenas, and he  [[Page H253]]  has prevented us from hearing key witnesses as well. This is  unprecedented.   Our Speaker has led our fight to a fair trial in the Senate. Above  all, a fair trial must include additional documents and all relevant  witnesses.   The American people have common sense. They know that any trial that  does not allow witnesses is not a trial; it is a coverup.   The Speaker's insistence on this point has gotten results. Just  yesterday, we received critical new evidence from the President's  former associate, Lev Parnas, that further proves Mr. Trump's scheme to  pressure Ukraine to go after his personal political opponents.   New witness testimony has become available as well, including John  Bolton's announcement that he would honor a Senate subpoena.   Under today's resolution, the managers also have broad authority to  submit to the Senate any additional evidence the House may acquire on  its own, and we will do so.   The Senate is on trial. We will see whether they conduct a fair trial  and allow the witnesses or conduct a coverup. Today's resolution is the  next step in this serious and solemn constitutional process. I urge my  colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the resolution, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Schiff), the distinguished chairman of the Intelligence  Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute.   Madam Speaker, two points.   First, my colleagues in the minority would rather talk about anything  than try to defend what President Trump actually did, because they  can't.   There is overwhelming evidence that the President pressured the  Ukrainian Government to interfere in our election on his behalf then he  covered it up. These are high crimes and misdemeanors, and we will  prove that in the Senate.   Second, our minority colleagues don't like our ongoing fight for a  fair trial because it got results. New documents and additional  witnesses have emerged that unmistakably point to the President's  guilt, and we have exposed the efforts of some in the Senate majority  to put on a sham trial.   The American people understand that a trial without evidence, without  witnesses is no trial at all but a coverup, and that will not stand. We  must protect the Constitution and the integrity of our elections. That  is what this is about. We must remove this President to protect our  country.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I am ready to close.    Madam Speaker, I have one more speaker, and she will  close.    Madam Speaker, again, no defense.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Pelosi), the Speaker of the House.    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.  [[Page H257]]         Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that Members have  5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks on H. Res. 798.
