 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize September as  Hawaiian History Month in my home State of Hawaii. It is a time of  celebration, recognition, and reflection.   Throughout this month, we honor individuals who have made a  significant impact on the lives of Native Hawaiians everywhere.   Today, we recognize Edith Ke'kuhikuhiipu'uoneonaali'iokohala Kenao  Kanaka'ole, a revered Native Hawaiian dancer, chanter, teacher, kuma  hula and founder of Halau o Kekuhi.   Edith was one of only five women in the country honored this year in  the 2023 American Women Quarters Program.   ``Grant us knowledge.'' ``E ho mai ka'ike,'' is inscribed on the  commemorative coin for Edith Kanaka'ole. It is a reminder of her  lasting legacy and a guiding principle for Hawaiians. That is, to look  to those who came before us so that we may find success in the present  and prosperity in our future.                            ____________________
