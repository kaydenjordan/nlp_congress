 Madam Speaker, I rise today to encourage  Members to support passage of S. 619, a bill that requires the Director  of National Intelligence to declassify information related to the  origin of COVID-19.   The need for transparency regarding the origin of this pandemic  cannot be overstated, especially as the world continues to grapple with  its effects.   I thank Chairman Turner for his leadership on this issue, and I thank  the Senate Intelligence Committee for their diligent work.   As you all know, the COVID-19 pandemic and the government's chaotic  response have had a devastating impact on our Nation and the world. It  has caused loss of life, disrupted our economy, and fundamentally  changed our way of life.   We owe it to the American people to inform them where this virus  originated and how. Republican Members charged with oversight have  always been champions of transparency and accountability. By supporting  this bill, we are showing the American people that we take this  responsibility seriously. Republicans are keeping their promise to do  everything within our power to get the truth and hold those responsible  accountable.   To date, the source of the virus remains unclear, and there are  strong indications that it may have originated from a laboratory in  Wuhan, China.   The American people deserve answers. They deserve to know the truth  about the origin of this pandemic. Without transparency, the public  will turn to malign actors for information, further undermining our  citizens' trust in the government and its intelligence agencies.   As we know, trust is a vital component of any successful democracy.  When citizens do not trust their government, it destabilizes society  and strains the fabric that binds our communities together.   The intelligence community has a responsibility to provide the  American people with accurate information that can help them make  informed decisions. By declassifying the information on COVID-19, the  DNI can help restore the public's trust in our intelligence community.   Madam Speaker, I urge support for passage of S. 619. It is our duty  to the American people to do everything within our power to get to the  truth, and this bill is an important step in that direction.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the  incredible achievement and sacrifice of four remarkable women. Carmen  Bird, Shay Hartley, Kristen Gregor, and Mary Schramko completed the  Norwegian Foot March on March 4, 2023. They did so in honor of Hunter  Ritter, a veteran who tragically committed suicide.   These four women have shown remarkable courage, determination, and  selflessness in carrying out this grueling march.   They each carried $500 worth of quarters, which equates to 25 pounds  of weight, to donate to Biloxi High School Junior ROTC. In doing so,  they also supported our veterans' 22 suicides a day movement as  supporters.   Their physical and emotional sacrifices represent the struggles that  our veterans face every day. The march was first held in 1915 as a test  of endurance for soldiers in the Norwegian Army.   Carmen, Shay, Kristen, and Mary completed this march and demonstrated  their solidarity with the brave men and women who serve our country.  They have shown that they are willing to go the extra mile--or this  case, for over 18 miles--to support those who have given so much in  defense of our freedom.   Mr. Speaker, I ask that we please recognize the epidemic that is  causing suicides in our veterans and other young people, and let's  please do something to fix it.                            ____________________
