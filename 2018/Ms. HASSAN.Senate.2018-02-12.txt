 Mr. President, in my home State of New Hampshire and in  communities across the Nation, there is no greater public health and  safety challenge than the fentanyl, heroin, and opioid crisis.   Everywhere I go, I hear stories by people affected by this crisis. I  hear inspiring stories from those in recovery who are tirelessly  working to stay healthy and rebuild their lives, and I hear tragic  stories from siblings, parents, and friends who have experienced the  unimaginable pain of losing a loved one.   The courage of people willing to share their stories is key to  breaking down the stigma of addiction and pushing for solutions. This  month, I saw reports that mothers in New Hampshire and in our  neighboring State of Massachusetts are doing just that. These mothers  have all lost their children to overdoses, but through their grief,  they are fighting to ensure that other parents are spared from what  they have endured. They are writing letters to the White House that are  set to arrive on Valentine's Day--all enclosed with photos of the  children they have lost. Their message is that more must be done to end  this epidemic and that more funding must be allocated to help those  struggling.    Their initiative is putting faces to this crisis and showing the  White House that these lives lost are more than just numbers. One of  the mothers said: ``We have broken hearts, so we want the President to  see that.''   We can never thank the families who have lost loved ones enough for  speaking out and for working tirelessly and courageously to try to  prevent others from suffering as they have. We owe it to them to listen  to their stories. But more importantly, we owe it to them to take  stronger action.   I am encouraged by recent work in Congress to provide a significant  increase in funding to combat this crisis. Over the past months, I have  been pushing for more support for treatment, recovery, prevention, and  law enforcement efforts.  [[Page S888]]    The bipartisan agreement that passed last week included billions of  dollars in additional resources--an important next step in  strengthening our response. This is welcome news for States across the  Nation grappling with the challenges of this epidemic, and it will be  critical that these new Federal dollars are prioritized for States like  New Hampshire that have been the hardest hit. I will continue working  to ensure that happens, but even with this additional funding, we know  that it will ultimately take a far greater investment to turn the tide  of this horrible epidemic. Communities, law enforcement, and those  struggling need our continued support and action, and Members of both  parties must continue to work together in order to make progress.   Thank you.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I also rise today to announce the next  Granite Stater of the Month, a young woman who is well known among  people in the New Hampshire State House and across the Granite State.   Cassandra Levesque, an 18-year-old from Barrington, is an advocate at  the forefront of an important fight: outlawing the practice of child  marriage in New Hampshire and across the country.   Last year, after learning that child brides face a higher likelihood  of domestic violence and divorce and a lower chance of professional  success, Cassandra set out to close the legal loopholes that allow  children as young as 13 to wed in New Hampshire. As she took on this  fight, she heard stories of women in her community who had been abused  by their spouses after being married as minors. Cassandra bravely  shared the story of her own grandmother and great-grandmother, both of  whom were married as young teenagers and were subsequently abused by  their husbands.   With encouragement and support from her Girl Scout community and with  the help of a State representative, Cassandra got a bill introduced in  the legislature that would have closed the loopholes that would allow  childhood marriages to occur. She testified during a hearing on the  bill, closely followed debate on the bill in the full house of  representatives, and spoke out in the media to explain why the  legislation was so important.   While the bill ultimately failed by a close margin, Cassandra has  continued to speak out and raise awareness, and just last month, the  legislative efforts to end child marriage began anew.   Cassandra exemplifies New Hampshire's strong tradition of civic  engagement, especially by women, and she has inspired other young  people to become active in their communities too. Cassandra launched a  program in libraries around the State that helps kids learn about  issues they are passionate about and gives them the tools they need to  become advocates.   In New Hampshire, we roll up our sleeves and work together to address  injustices and solve problems in our communities, and Cassandra is a  perfect example of that spirit.   I am deeply grateful for Cassandra's hard work, and I will continue  to follow her efforts closely. I look forward to the day when we can  say that thanks to people like Cassandra, child marriage is a thing of  the past in New Hampshire.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
