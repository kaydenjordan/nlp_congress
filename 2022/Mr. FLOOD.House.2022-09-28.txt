 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor one of America's first  radio stations, WJAG-AM, licensed to Norfolk, Nebraska. It is  celebrating 100 years this year.   In 1922, radio pioneer Gene Huse established WJAG as one of the first  radio stations west of the Mississippi River.   The station became and remains an important part of everyday life for  Nebraskans. Gene Huse realized that most people did not own a radio, so  he printed instructions in his local newspaper on how to build one.  Many more went to the movie theater or the fire station to hear play- by-play of the World Series, dance to music, and receive agricultural  news.   Today, his grandson, Bill Huse, continues the tradition of service.  WJAG has been owned by the same family since its start in 1922. The  station is an American original.   On behalf of the First District of Nebraska, I congratulate WJAG on  100 years of service and wish those at the station another 100 years of  success.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise to support the SBIR and STTR Extension  Act of 2022.   I thank Chair Velazquez and Ranking Member Luetkemeyer for their work  in a bipartisan fashion. I also thank Senators Ernst and Cardin for  what they have done for this legislation. I am pleased that this bill  has been brought to the floor in an expedited fashion.   The Small Business Innovation Research and Small Business Technology  Transfer Extension Act is an important piece of legislation, and the  changes this bill brings to these programs are urgently needed.   For those who are not familiar, the Small Business Innovation  Research program was created in 1982. The program was intended to spur  American innovation and harness ingenuity by increasing small business  engagement in federally funded research and development.   More recently, however, the Chinese Government has been manipulating  this program. A report from the Department of Defense in April 2021  revealed some of the tactics China has used to this end.   The DOD revealed instances where companies were created, received  SBIR grants, and then the founders mysteriously dissolved the company.  Upon further investigation, it became clear that these companies were  either recruited to China or were formed with the intent of returning  to China from the start.   Either way, the result was the same: The American taxpayers funded  projects that were stolen by the Chinese Government. This was simply an  unacceptable status quo.   This bill fixes those problems. It implements strong safeguards  against the influence of China or other foreign actors, and it creates  new reporting requirements for these programs that will ensure taxpayer  dollars are properly used.   This bill also brings the SBIR back to its original purpose: to spur  innovation and unlock the ingenuity of American small businesses.   With these changes to the program, we can make sure the SBIR and STTR  are stronger and more accessible for entrepreneurs in Nebraska and  across the country.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote.
