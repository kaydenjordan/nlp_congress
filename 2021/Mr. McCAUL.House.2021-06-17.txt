 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I want to thank my good friend, Chairman Meeks. We  work well together. When we disagree, we do it civilly, and I think  that is the way this body should operate. But I do disagree on this  one.   I have said many times before that war should not be on autopilot. I  do think this is an outdated AUMF, and I do believe that Congress needs  to reclaim its war powers under Article I of the Constitution.   I also share the desire to repeal the 2002 AUMF, as well as the 2001  AUMF, but that must be part of a serious process to provide clear,  updated authorities against the terrorists who still plot to kill  Americans at home and abroad. I still hope to work toward that end with  my respected friend, Chairman Meeks, but a repeal and replacement  should be simultaneous.   It is confusing to me that we are jamming through a standalone repeal  without basic due diligence; without consulting the State Department,  the Defense Department, or the intelligence community; without  consulting the Government of Iraq and our coalition partners and  allies.   In the 3 months since I made that complaint at our markup, the  majority still has not scheduled a single briefing. This, in my  judgment, is not a serious legislative process for the most serious  issues that we face, and that is war and peace.   This feels like yet another political effort to undo one of President  Trump's boldest counterterrorism successes: using the 2002 AUMF to  remove Qasem Soleimani from the battlefield.    Soleimani was Iran's mastermind of terror for decades. He was  responsible for the death of more than 600 Americans and wounded  thousands more. He orchestrated the attack on our Baghdad Embassy. He  plotted to assassinate the Saudi Ambassador on American soil here in  D.C. He oversaw Iran's support for Assad, who killed hundreds of  thousands in Syria. In short, America and the world are much safer with  Qasem Soleimani gone.   While the 2002 AUMF was largely about Saddam Hussein, it also clearly  [[Page H2900]]  addressed the terrorist threats in and emanating from Iraq. All prior  administrations, Republican and Democrat, have used it for that  purpose.   Today, the biggest threat in Iraq is not Saddam Hussein. We can all  recognize that. But it is the Iran-sponsored terrorist groups attacking  our diplomats, our soldiers, our embassy, and our citizens. They cannot  be targeted using the 2001 AUMF because they are not associated with  the forces of al-Qaida, the Taliban, or ISIS, but they can be targeted  using the 2002 AUMF, as the prior administration did to take out  Soleimani, consistent with longstanding practice.   Last year, the Trump administration ``strongly opposed'' repeal,  saying it would ``terminate a critical legal authority'' and undermine  our defense ``against ongoing threats from Iran and Iranian-sponsored  proxies.''   The Biden administration now claims that it does not need the 2002  AUMF for current operations because it has Article II authority to use  force without congressional authorization.   Is that what we are going to do now, is yield to the President's  Article II authority without any congressional authorization?   Madam Speaker, that is precisely what this repeal does. It takes our  authority, our Article I authorities, away. We are repealing our  Article I authority and yielding it to the President of the United  States.   Telling the President to rely solely on Article II, in my judgment,  is a big step backward from the war powers reform and reasserting  Congress' Article I powers.   It is also inconsistent with the War Powers Resolution. That law says  that the President's Article II powers are limited to responding to an  attack on the territory or Armed Forces of the United States. It does  not cover American civilians in a foreign country, such as our  contractors, our diplomats, and our embassy, who are under attack, as I  speak, in Iraq.   We should not encourage any President to go it alone without Article  I congressional authorization.   Finally, today's vote is not happening in a vacuum. This rushed,  standalone repeal, without any consultation with the Department of  Defense, the Secretary of State, or the intelligence community, as Mr.  Mast has consistently talked about, sends a dangerous message of  disengagement that could destabilize Iraq, embolden Iran, which it  will, and strengthen al-Qaida and ISIS in the region.   We would avoid such dangers by taking up a repeal and a replacement  simultaneously. I think both sides of the aisle agree, we need to  update this AUMF, and we need to reform it to the modern-day threats in  the region. Saddam Hussein is no longer the threat.   Real AUMF reform requires Congress and the administration to work  together. The chairman has committed to doing this, and I appreciate  and trust him. We work well together, but we have to do this, to work  together with the administration to replace this aging AUMF with  updated authorities needed to keep Americans safe from today's  terrorist threats, an updated AUMF that reflects the modern-day threats  in the region.   Again, I look forward to working together with Chairman Meeks and our  colleagues on this if we are going to be serious about war powers  reform. But this bill is not it. This bill is not responsible. We are  not doing this the right way. If we are going to repeal it, let's  update the AUMF to modern-day needs and reform it.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  0930     Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I would just like to comment that to me it is very interesting, the  timing of the gentlewoman from California's repeal. It happened after  President Trump had an air strike to take out Soleimani in Iraq, at  exactly the same time. He had authority to do so under the 2002 AUMF  and Article II under the Constitution.   What is interesting about now, the other side of the aisle was upset  when President Biden struck the Shia proxies in Syria, and that is when  we saw this bill resurrect itself again in this Congress. Very  interesting timing.   What I object to is that now we are abdicating our responsibility by  giving the President Article II authorities alone without any  authorization of use of military force from the Congress. They talk a  lot about Article I on the other side, but aren't we abdicating our  Article I responsibility?   I am all for updating this thing, but to completely do away with it  and just give this President Article II authorities to do whatever he  wants without any congressional review, in my judgment, is a wrong step  forward.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Let me just clarify again. This bill was filed last Congress after  President Trump took out the mastermind of terror for two decades in  the Middle East, Qasem Soleimani, to challenge his authority to take  out one of the biggest  [[Page H2903]]  threats to the region and to our American soldiers, 600 of whom were  killed and thousands wounded.   That is the genesis for this legislation, and I think that is  important to note. If we do away with this without replacing it, we  abdicate our Article I authorities in an absolute manner to the  executive branch under Article II.   I think that it is important for anyone watching this debate to  understand what we are doing here today.   Madam Speaker, with that, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Kinzinger).    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Mast), a combat veteran, a distinguished servicemember,  and a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Mast).    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Calvert), a member of the Appropriations Committee.    Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, just a brief comment, once again, that repealing this  Authorization for Use of Military Force, which has been used in the  past to take out Soleimani and other very bad actors, and not replacing  it does not uphold our Article I responsibilities.   Mr. Speaker, in fact, what we are doing is ceding our authority under  the Constitution to the executive branch and saying: Oh, Article II,  the President has unlimited discretion under Article II to do whatever  the hell he wants to do.   That is not what this Congress should be doing. We need to replace  this with an updated AUMF that reflects the threats in the region, the  current threats, which are Iran and the proxies of Iran that have hit  our embassy, have killed our soldiers, and are attacking our diplomats  in the region.                                time  1015     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Just a point of clarification to the chairman. I am not talking about a  declaration of war against Iran. What we are talking about is what is  the current threat in Iraq. Today, it is proxies, the Shia proxies of  Iran in Iraq.   The reason why President Biden hit them in Syria, it is the  authorities that President Trump used to take out Soleimani in Iraq,  not in Iran. Soleimani, ``The Butcher'', the mastermind of terror for  two decades, killing 600 American soldiers and wounding thousands more.   I am all for updating this thing, but to replace this and throw it  out with not anything to protect our men and women who are in Iraq  today, including the diplomats, is highly irresponsible, it is  reckless, and it is dangerous.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Alabama (Mr. Rogers), the lead Republican on the House Armed Services  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I agree with the gentleman. We need to exercise our  Article I constitutional responsibilities and update this outdated  AUMF. That is precisely what we are arguing today. We are not saying  that we should replace this, but we shouldn't repeal without an updated  AUMF that reflects the modern-day threats.   As I close later, I will talk about the chairman and I working on  that effort. That is what this body should be doing, because otherwise,  if we repeal this, we are again ceding our Article I responsibilities  to the executive, and just giving him unlimited Article II powers.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I think I laid out our arguments, and I think it is  irresponsible to repeal this authority, which still is used to protect  our embassy diplomats and soldiers in Iraq against the Shia proxies of  Iran.   I am committed to work with the chairman to update this outdated  AUMF. And I think if there is any agreement in this Chamber, and also  on both sides of the aisle, it is that we need to modernize it to the  modern-day threats.   And as I read from the President's Statement of Administration  Policy, the President says: I am committed to working with the Congress  to ensure that outdated authorizations for the use of military force  are replaced with a framework appropriate to ensure that we can  continue to protect Americans from terrorist threats.   I agree with the President of the United States, and I think the  chairman does as well. We have to do this, and it is not going to be  easy, but it is time to update this outdated AUMF.   I would prefer to have repealed and replaced it with our updated  AUMF. But as Brian Mast, a heroic veteran who lost his legs in battle,  said, We cannot just repeal this and talk about updating when we  haven't even talked to the Department of Defense, the Secretary of  State, and the intelligence community about what is the modern-day  threat, and what we need to do in Congress to exercise our Article I  responsibilities that we have a responsibility to do, and not just cede  everything to the executive branch under Article II.   The argument is made, well, this could be done under Article II.  Well, that is probably true. But are we not abdicating our  responsibility and ceding it to the executive branch by doing this? I  would argue that we are.   Mr. Speaker, I want to close with the motion to recommit.   If we adopt the motion to recommit, we will instruct the Committee on  Foreign Affairs to consider my amendment to H.R. 256. It responds to  the serious escalation by Hamas against Israel that we saw in May.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the motion to recommit.    Mr. Speaker, Hamas launched over 4,000 rockets at our  closest allies in the Middle East. This was a stark reminder of the  dangerous threats that Israel faces from Hamas, Hezbollah, Iran, and  other terrorist organizations.   For this reason, our MTR makes sure that the United States can  quickly react to Israel's security needs in the event of future  attacks.   If enacted, this language would establish contingency plans to  provide Israel with defense articles such as munitions, ISR technology,  aircraft, and related services. It would also create a waiver to  expedite arms transfers if Israel is under threat of military attack.   This language passed the House last Congress with broad bipartisan  support, and I encourage all of my colleagues to support it today.   I fear that the 2002 AUMF repeal we are considering today without a  replacement may embolden our adversaries, especially Iran--the largest  state sponsor of terror in the world--and its proxies by signaling that  we are retreating from the Middle East.   Our MTR is intended to send a strong message that this is absolutely  false. It will also send a message that passage will demonstrate our  ironclad support for Israel and all our allies in the region.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the motion to recommit  today, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.   The Clerk will report the motion to recommit.   The Clerk read as follows:         Mr. McCaul moves to recommit the bill, H.R. 256, to the       Committee on Foreign Affairs.    The material previously referred to by Mr. McCaul is as follows:         At the end of the bill, add the following:       SEC. 2. STATEMENT OF POLICY.         It is the policy of the United States to provide assistance       to the Government of Israel in order to help enable Israel to       defend itself by itself and develop long-term capacity,       primarily through the acquisition of advanced capabilities       that are available from the United States.       SEC. 3. CONTINGENCY PLANS TO PROVIDE ISRAEL WITH NECESSARY                     DEFENSE ARTICLES AND SERVICES.         The President shall establish and update as appropriate       contingency plans to provide Israel with defense articles and       defense services that are determined by the President to be       necessary for the defense of Israel.       SEC. 4. WAIVER FOR EXISTING OR IMMINENT MILITARY THREAT TO                     ISRAEL.         Section 38 of the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2778)       is amended by adding at the end the following:        ``(l) Waiver for Existing or Imminent Military Threat to       Israel.--        ``(1) In general.--Upon receiving information that Israel       is under an existing or imminent threat of military attack,       the President may waive the requirements of this Act and       direct the immediate transfer to Israel of such defense       articles or defense services the President determines to be       necessary to assist Israel in its defense against such       threat. Amounts obligated or expended to carry out this       paragraph shall not be subject to any limitation in law, or       provision of any bilateral agreement, relating to the amount       of United States assistance authorized to be made available       to Israel.        ``(2) Notification required.--As soon as practicable after       a transfer of defense articles or defense services pursuant       to the authority provided by paragraph (1), the President       shall provide a notification in writing to Congress of the       details of such transfer, consistent with the requirements of       section 36 of this Act.''.     Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
