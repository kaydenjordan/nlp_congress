 Mr. President, I was Governor of Florida from  January 2011 through January 2019, and we had a variety of disasters.  We had four major hurricanes; we had wildfires; we had flooding--a  variety of things.   What you find out in that role as Governor is you find out the  importance of the Federal Government. FEMA is very important to  disaster relief.   Disaster relief is partially borne by whomever is impacted, a family  or a business. Partially, it is impacted by the city or county,  partially by the State, and partially by the Federal Government.   My experience with FEMA is they are hard-working individuals that  work hard to try to be a good partner with our States.   Last September, about 12 months ago, we had a horrible hurricane in  our State, Hurricane Ian. We lost over 150 people. We had unbelievable  damage. FEMA has been a partner in that hurricane relief.   Just recently--about 3 weeks ago, 4 weeks ago--we had another  hurricane, Idalia, and again FEMA came down and is a partner in that  hurricane relief.   I met with President Biden 3 weeks ago when he came down to tour the  damage, and I talked to him about the importance of getting FEMA fully  funded.   There is a Federal Disaster Relief Fund that is part of FEMA that  pays for things like debris pickup, helps individuals who have lost  their homes, helps our small businesses--a variety of things like that.   Right now, this thing is getting low on funds. I checked on September  11. It is down to $2.5 billion. And they project, by the end of this  month, it will be down to $550 million. What they also told me is that  there is a community in every State in this country that is getting  impacted by the FEMA Disaster Relief Fund.   So I have been trying, for months, to get a vote on a bill which is  pretty commonsense. No. 1, it will put funds into FEMA so they can  provide help for all these communities in every State. No. 2, the next  thing it does is helps our farmers.   Our farmers in Florida have been waiting for almost 12 months for  relief from the Department of Agriculture. Historically, what the  Department of Agriculture did, especially when I was Governor, was they  would provide a block grant to the State, to our farmers, so the money  could get out to our farmers quicker.   For whatever reason, Secretary Vilsack, the Secretary of Ag, has  decided now that he has to have separate legislation from Congress that  gives him specific authority that he can do a block grant.   It has never happened before. But for whatever reason, he believes it  has to happen now. That is in this bill.   The Army of Corps of Engineers is a key partner in beach  renourishment in any State that has been impacted. I know our Presiding  Officer had wildfires, and I am sure their beaches have had some  impact. So it would also help our Army Corps of Engineers, help with  beach renourishment, and also help our military installations after a  disaster.   So mine is a commonsense bill. It impacts some community in every  State in the country. So what I am asking for is a stand-alone vote on  my bill. It is called the Federal Disaster Responsibility Act. I hope  every Senator here will unanimously agree that we should do this.   Mr. President, as in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent  that the Committee on Finance be discharged  [[Page S4643]]  from further consideration of S. 2721 and the Senate proceed to its  immediate consideration; I further ask that the Scott-Rubio substitute  amendment at the desk be considered and agreed to; that the bill, as  amended, be considered read a third time and the Senate vote on passing  the bill, as amended, with a 60-vote affirmative threshold required for  passage of the bill; finally, if passed, the motion to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I appreciate my colleague's  concern about some of these other issues. I think we ought to have a  discussion about those and see if we can get something done. But right  now, the Disaster Relief Fund is going to be down to the $550 million  by the end of this month. There is a community in every State--and this  fund only covers where it fits within the parameters where FEMA says  that the Federal Government is responsible for a portion of it. But  this would help a community in every State in the country. So I hope,  at some point, we can get this passed. There is a community in every  State in this country that is getting impacted by this.    Mr. President, today I rise today to  recognize Robert L. Ward for his many years of service to the State of  Florida and its business community. After 26 years serving as a trusted  adviser to the Governor's office and legislature, Mr. Ward was chosen  in 2016 to be the seventh president and chief executive officer of the  Florida Council of 100, Inc. Since 1961, the Council of 100 has worked  closely with the governors of the great State of Florida, and on the  occasion of Mr. Ward's retirement, I commend his dedication to ensuring  the economic prosperity of all Floridians.   During my time as governor, Mr. Ward supported my efforts to drive  job creation in the State. He facilitated the creation of a long-term  strategic plan for PreK-12 education in Florida emphasizing high  standards, rigorous assessments, strong accountability, and the  instructional benefits of career and technical education and work-based  learning, two key components of our State's educational success.  Additionally, Mr. Ward led a project recommending ways to increase  research and development by Florida's universities and an initiative  outlining a comprehensive economic competitiveness strategy for our  State.   Subsequently, Mr. Ward continued to shape workforce policy by serving  as the chairman of Florida's Talent Development Council, which ensures  that our State's educational programs are meeting the needs of business  and industry, and authoring editorials celebrating Florida's thriving  business climate and talent pipeline, while Mr. Ward was also a staunch  advocate for government fiscal responsibility.   I applaud Mr. Ward for his tenure with the Florida Council of 100 and  his long-time dedication to helping Floridians in all the capacities in  which he has served. I am pleased to recognize Robert L. Ward in the  U.S. Congress.                            ____________________
