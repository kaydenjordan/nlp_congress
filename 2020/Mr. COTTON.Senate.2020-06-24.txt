 Mr. President, the ``World Famous Highly Respected''  555th Fighter Squadron, commonly known as the Triple Nickel, recently  completed the Department of Defense's first real-world combat Dynamic  Force Employment DFE to United States Central Command. In plain  English, the Triple Nickel executed an unplanned departure to the  Middle East last fall to combat Iranian aggression against the United  States and our allies in the region.   During its historic deployment, the squadron flew more than 7,000  hours supporting operations in the Arabian Gulf, Afghanistan, Iraq, and  Syria. Demonstrating the rapid, agile, and lethal characteristics of  airpower, the Nickel executed defensive counter-air missions in Syria-- routinely intercepting and monitoring Russian, Syrian, and Iranian  aircraft operating near U.S. and partnered ground forces. It also  provided close air support to troops battling the Taliban in  Afghanistan, as well as ISIS in Iraq and Syria.   The Nickel returned home in December as Iran's aggression began to  wane but deployed a second time only days later when tensions rapidly  escalated following the U.S. strike against Qasem Soleimani. The  squadron subsequently executed force protection missions in Iraq during  and after Iran's missile attacks against U.S. forces. The Triple Nickel  then deployed to a second expeditionary operating location. U.S. F-16s  had not conducted combat missions from this location since 2003. From  there, the squadron was able to immediately respond to the rocket  attacks on Camp Taji, Iraq, by Iranian-backed Shia militia groups and  execute retaliatory strikes.   The squadron returned to Avianio Air Base, Italy, in late April as  the Air Force's first major combat unit to redeploy during the China  virus pandemic. Throughout their deployment, the men and women of the  555th Expeditionary Fighter Squadron and Maintenance Unit performed  exceptionally under tense combat pressures executing a new and highly  mobile deployment construct during a pandemic. The Triple Nickel  represents the best America has to offer, and I congratulate them on a  job well done. ``Once Green!''                            ____________________
