 Mr. President, I rise today to honor and recognize Dr.  Josh Davis, of Wichita, KS.   Dr. Davis is an emergency room physician at Ascension Via Christi St.  Francis Hospital in Wichita. Like many of us, Josh was deeply disturbed  by the widespread human suffering caused by Russia's bloody invasion of  Ukraine. What makes him different than most, however, was his resolve  to be a part of the solution. After seeing the images of Ukrainian  refugees fleeing their homes, Josh knew he needed to help. On April 14,  he boarded a plane to war-torn Ukraine, not knowing where he would be  going or what he would be doing. All he knew was that he was going to  help those in need.   While in Ukraine, Josh helped transport medical supplies and  patients, while also providing refugee children with much needed  medical treatment. He also brought two suitcases full of gauze,  bandages, rubber gloves, and other much-needed medical supplies with  him. While in Ukraine, he saw firsthand the destruction and suffering  that war brings. The biggest lesson learned for Josh was that this  widespread suffering cannot be stopped by the actions of a few, but  that change will only come from the actions of many. He has already  begun to make plans to return to Ukraine in order to provide further  medical support and relief.   I would like to thank Josh for all that he has done. He has been an  exemplary representative for the great State of Kansas, and the United  States of America. His service to others makes us all proud. I now ask  my colleagues to join me in honoring Dr. Josh Davis for his  selflessness and service to those in need, as well as in wishing him  the best of luck in the future.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to honor and recognize Ryan  Pfeifer of Topeka, KS.   Ryan was presented with a $25,000 Milken Educator Award at a recent  Washburn Rural High School assembly. This award has an outstanding  reputation in the teaching world. To some, it is known as the ``Oscars  of Teaching.'' This award celebrates teachers' work with students and  shines a light on their future work as educators. In addition to the  financial award, he was given mentorship and support, along with an  all-expenses-paid trip to a forum where other recipients come together.   The Milken Educator Award looks to honor unrecognized teachers. It  has teams of administrators and State education departments vetting out  finalists for the award. Teachers are unaware they are nominated, so  when Pfeifer was called down to the gym floor to receive the award, he  was thrilled. Ryan has a way with his students. Students describe him  as relatable and dedicated, which is a great reputation to hold. He  even gave up his regular planning and advising period to provide  additional support for students. I truly believe that he deserved this  award. He has helped so many students live up to their potential. A  previous award winner, Brad Nicks, said ``He's always stood out as one  of those exceptional educators, somebody that builds really important  relationships with students.'' I ask my colleagues to join me in  recognizing the wonderful impact Mr. Pfeifer has had on his students  and to honor him for this great accomplishment.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to honor and recognize the  100th anniversary of the El Dorado Band.   The purpose of the El Dorado Municipal Band is to provide musical  entertainment in the summer for the city of El Dorado and to provide  the opportunity for musicians from high school age and above to  perform. The band began as the El Dorado Boys Band in the early 1920s,  and is one of the oldest municipal bands in Kansas. The band's first  public home was a traditional round band shell at Gordy Park in the  [[Page S2380]]  heart of El Dorado. Its current home is a permanent band shell at  Forest Park, located at Ninth and Taylor. This outdoor brick and  concrete performance space was constructed in 1939 through the Works  Progress Administration, WPA.   The El Dorado Municipal Band celebrates 100 years of continuous  performances with the 2022 summer concert season. Despite wars, natural  disasters, pandemics, and other obstacles, the band continues to bring  the young and old together, both on stage and in the audience. The band  partners with veterans' organizations to celebrate Flag Day. It also  holds old-fashioned ice cream socials and bake sales that help fund  music scholarships to deserving youth at Butler Community College. The  2022 performance season will kick off with a director's concert,  bringing back all of the surviving directors that have stood before the  Municipal Band. It will also feature the world public premiere of ``El  Dorado Fanfare,'' a music composition by Ed Huckeby commissioned to  celebrate 100 years of music. In addition to local performances each  Thursday, the Municipal Band has been invited to perform for the Kansas  Bandmaster's Association as a featured ensemble.   I am honored to be from El Dorado and associated with this great  band. I remember hearing the band play and have always enjoyed the time  shared with my family listening to their music. I ask my colleagues to  join me in recognizing this wonderful municipal band and congratulate  them in celebrating 100 years of music.                            ____________________
