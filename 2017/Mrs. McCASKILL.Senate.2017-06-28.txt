 Mr. President, I have to say that there are a lot of  things my friend from Wyoming could have said in his objection, but to  lecture us about bringing out a bill that people have not had a chance  to read or study is rather rich at this moment in our legislative  journey on healthcare. I do not know if he thought that through before  he said it, but I can assure you  [[Page S3823]]  that when it came out of his mouth, all of us on this side were saying:  You have got to be kidding me. Really? It was just a little much.   I know we are all talking around the obvious, and that is that we  need to fix the healthcare system in America so that people do not have  to go into their pockets as often, so that insurance is reliable, and  so that the markets are more stable. We are going to have a lot of  opportunity, I hope, to come together and do just that. I hope my  friend from Wyoming and my other friends on the other side of the aisle  will be part of that.                      Unanimous Consent Request--S. 1201    We have a very simple solution to the bare counties, and I hope  people will think this through before they just object. I am going to  have 25 bare counties, mostly as a result of the sabotaging of the  exchanges by this administration. People in those counties are looking  to me for an answer, and I do not blame them for being worried. How can  we solve that problem today? S. 1201, the Health Care Options for All  Act, which I have introduced, will solve that problem today.   All we have to do is say to anyone who is in a county in America--and  I know my colleague from Ohio, Senator Brown, has some counties, and I  know my colleague from Indiana has some counties--if you do not have an  insurer in your county, you can come with your subsidy and buy  insurance from the same places our staffs buy it and most Members of  Congress buy it. Those are national plans. They are in every State in  the Union because Members of Congress have staff members in every State  in the Union. There is no need to attract more plans. There is no need  to do anything complicated. You just take the subsidies that you are  entitled to and you buy insurance at the same place Congress buys it.   We can do that today. If we do not do it today, do you know what we  are saying to the people who live in Ohio and Indiana and Missouri? We  are saying that we are entitled to something better than they have and  that they should not be allowed to buy what we can buy. Now, that takes  some nerve. If we are not willing to take this simple, basic step,  people in these counties should be angry and take up pitchforks-- metaphorically, of course.   The national plans that are out there that my staff uses that are in  Springfield, Cape Girardeau, Columbia--and I am sure my colleagues  could talk about their staffs using these plans all over the country--I  would like to make those available to regular folks in my State who  want to be able to lay their heads on their pillows tonight and not  worry about whether they are going to have insurance next year.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on Finance  be discharged from further consideration of S. 1201, the Health Care  Options for All Act; that the Senate proceed to its immediate  consideration; that the bill be considered read a third time and  passed; and that the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid  upon the table with no intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?    Mr. President, the next time I will know, when he is  giving a speech, before he objects, to start then.   I am pretty sure that his staff in Wyoming is not coming up to  Washington to buy their insurance. I am pretty sure that all of our  staffs--I am pretty sure the Presiding Officer's staff, those who work  for him in Utah--are not coming to Washington to buy their insurance. I  am pretty sure Senator Manchin's staff and Senator Patty Murray's staff  and all of our staffs who live all over this great country are not  coming to Washington to buy their insurance. They are getting good  health insurance plans.   I just think it takes incredible nerve to lecture me about people in  Missouri having no insurance while the Senator from Wyoming is  objecting to letting them get the same insurance he has. Really? That  is what this has come to, this partisan exercise?   We don't have to fix this permanently this way, but we could do it  just temporarily to give people peace of mind until we figure out the  right way forward. But how dare Members of this Chamber tell people in  my State they are not entitled to buy what we have, when they have no  other options at this moment.   Let's move forward together and fix it--all of it. But to get a  lecture that people in my State don't deserve what my staff has or what  Senator Barrasso's staff has--no wonder people are upset with  Washington.   I yield the floor.
