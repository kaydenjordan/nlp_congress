 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, Representative Case, for  yielding to me so that I may speak on the merits of all Japanese  Americans who served during World War II, a recognition the United  States Postal Service captured with the recent issuance of its 2021 Go  for Broke Japanese American soldiers of World War II commemorative  stamp.   Go for Broke, the motto of the brave 442nd Regimental Combat Team,  which means give it your all, speaks to the spirit of courage, of  patriotism and sacrifice, as well as their fight for equality for all  people.   The 442nd, almost entirely composed of second-generation Japanese  Americans, or Nisei, was the most-decorated unit for its size and  length of service in the history of the United States. Eighty years  ago, these brave Americans were filled with dreams, aspirations, and  hope, only to be faced with harsh discrimination and assaults on their  character and loyalty to America.   The Go for Broke Japanese American soldiers of World War II stamps  are forever stamps and symbolize these men and women's undying devotion  to their country.
