 Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to recognize Geraldine Pena of  La Feria, Texas, as she celebrates her centennial birthday today. She  was born on April 1, 1919, in Tucson, Arizona.   Geraldine, affectionately called Gerry, dropped out of high school to  support her single mother and four younger siblings. After marrying her  husband, Ralph, the couple relocated to his hometown of La Feria.  There, she devoted her time to raising six children.   As her children grew older, Mrs. Pena was able to become more  actively involved in the community, always lending a hand when  possible. She was also an active member of the American Legion  Auxiliary Post 409, and her involvement included local, State, and  national conventions in Texas and Hawaii.   She is the proud grandmother of 13 grandchildren and 13 great- grandchildren, with more expected in the coming years.   I am pleased to honor Geraldine Pena for her legacy of unselfishness  and generosity. Her devotion to her family and community is admirable,  and I hope her 100th birthday celebration is filled with love and  happiness. She is joined by family traveling from California, Illinois,  Arizona, and across Texas.   I ask my colleagues to join me in wishing Geraldine Pena a happy  birthday and wishing her good health and prosperity.                            ____________________
