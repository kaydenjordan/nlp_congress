 Mr. President, I rise today in celebration of the 100th  anniversary of the White Mountain National Forest.   In 1911, Congress passed the Weeks Act, which authorized the Federal  Government to purchase forest lands at the head of navigable streams to  protect the health of our waterways. This landmark legislation paved  the way for President Woodrow Wilson's Executive order in 1918, a  century ago this year, which formally established the White Mountain  National Forest in New Hampshire and Maine. Today, these public lands  cover nearly 800,000 acres of woodland and attract millions of visitors  each year who camp, hike, ski, and explore some of the most  breathtaking natural beauty in New England. In fact, the region  attracts more guests than both Yellowstone and Yosemite National Parks.   If you were to visit the forest today and take in the lush, healthy  woodland, it may surprise you that the environmental and economic  success of this region was once in serious jeopardy. At the beginning  of the 20th century, 80 percent of the White Mountain region had been  depleted of its trees. Then-Governor Chester Jordan of New Hampshire  said that the single greatest challenge facing the Granite State's  future was excessive and unrestrained timber cutting. In his words,  ``Our forests are fast becoming despoiled, their scenic beauties marred  and destroyed, the public health endangered'' and the State's  agriculture, tourism, and even lumber industry threatened with ruin.  Without action, he warned, New Hampshire's forests were headed toward  extinction.   In 1901, the year Governor Jordan issued his warning, Granite Staters  began a remarkable effort to save our woodlands, efforts that continue  to this day and have helped create a rich  [[Page S5691]]  and vibrant forest ecology. Organizations like the Society for the  Protection of New Hampshire Forests, the Appalachian Mountain Club, and  the Society of American Foresters have worked for over a century to  protect our woodlands and foster appreciation for the natural world.  Through their tireless work, the commitment of Granite Staters, and the  efforts of local, State, and Federal governments, New Hampshire is now  the second most heavily forested State in the U.S. The White Mountain  National Forest, one of the greatest successes of the State's  conservation efforts, has become a major part of the Granite State  economy, supporting a $9 billion statewide tourism and outdoor  recreation industry and nearly 80,000 jobs--proof that environmental  and economic success can go hand-in-hand.   This year also marks the 50th anniversary of the National Trails  System Act. This important legislation, signed into law by President  Lyndon Johnson, established a national network of public trails that  expanded access to outdoor recreation across the United States,  including nearly 350 miles of public trails in the White Mountain  National Forest.   As we celebrate the National Trails System Act and the White Mountain  National Forest, we must also look toward the future--toward the next  100 years--and ask ourselves what we can do to advance this legacy of  stewardship.   In Congress, we must reauthorize the Land and Water Conservation  Fund, which has enhanced recreational access to the White Mountain  National Forest and helped New Hampshire to protect parcels of the  Umbagog National Wildlife Refuge, the Silvio O. Conte National Wildlife  Refuge, and the Appalachian Trail. We must also advance environmental  and economic policies that conserve our public lands, protect our clean  air and water, and support local economies. We each must take time to  appreciate the natural wonder of our public lands and renew our efforts  to preserve these precious areas for generations to come.   I stand with and congratulate the supporters of the White Mountain  National Forest on 100 years. Thank you.                            ____________________
