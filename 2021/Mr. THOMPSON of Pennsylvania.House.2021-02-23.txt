 Madam Speaker, I rise today to give a  big thank-you to Penn State students for their commitment to an  incredible cause.   Each year, students spend countless hours raising awareness and money  in the fight against pediatric cancer. Every February, these efforts  culminate in a 46-hour dance marathon known as THON.   THON provides financial and emotional support to thousands of  families across the Commonwealth who have a child battling pediatric  cancer.   THON is normally a celebration of thousands in the Bryce Jordan  Center on campus--an opportunity for children with cancer to focus on  simply being a kid even just for the weekend.   Sadly, the pandemic forced this proud tradition online this year.  However, despite a global pandemic, students still managed to raise  $10.6 million this year.   Since 1973, Penn State students have raised more than $180 million.  Those figures, combined with nearly 17,000 student volunteers, makes  Penn State THON the largest student-run philanthropic effort in the  world.   I am proud of the Penn State students who are so committed to this  cause, and I am even more proud of the children and families who keep  fighting.                            ____________________
