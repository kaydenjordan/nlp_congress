 Madam Speaker, congratulations to our chair,  Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro, for her hard work.   Madam Speaker, a day after passing the historic commission with  robust bipartisan help, we are here now to support this emergency  security funding bill. The attacks on January 6 exposed the dire state  of our Capitol's security infrastructure.   As a member of the Legislative Branch Appropriations Subcommittee, I  have been alarmed to learn of just how outdated our security  infrastructure really is, and how we had let it deteriorate for far too  long.   The funding package that we are about to pass today will change that.  It will allocate $2 billion in investment, including updating cameras  on Capitol grounds, purchasing new protective equipment, increasing the  number of frequency of security sweeps, et cetera.   I called for many of these changes and improvements back on January 6  and January 7. I am glad to be here to support this.   Madam Speaker, I rise to support this bill.
