 Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of  sections 1005 and 1006 of the American Rescue Plan Act.   These sections provide loan forgiveness and other critical assistance  to Black farmers and to other farmers who are members of racial or  ethnic groups that have for many decades suffered discrimination by the  U.S. Department of Agriculture.   According to USDA data, in 1920 in the United States there were  nearly 1 million Black farmers, and they represented nearly 15 percent  of all farmers in our country. Today, as a direct result of a brutal  legacy of discrimination by a Federal agency, there are less than  50,000 Black farmers left and they represent less than 2 percent of all  farmers in our country.   It is estimated that during the past century, Black farmers have lost  between 15 and 20 million acres of land and the hundreds of billions of  dollars of generational wealth that land represented.   The cause of the loss of so much Black-owned farmland and the loss of  so many Black farmers is not a mystery. Federal court decisions, the  U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, and the USDA itself have all told us  that a primary cause of that loss was long standing, pervasive  discrimination by the USDA.   In his opinion in Pigford v. Glickman, Federal District Court Judge  Paul Friedman stated clearly that USDA and their county commissioners  discriminated against Black farmers when they denied, delayed, or  otherwise frustrated the applications of those Black farmers for farm  loans and other credit and benefit programs and that USDA and the  county commissioners bear much of the responsibility for the dramatic  decline in Black farms and Black-owned farmland.   Judge Friedman wrote his decision in 1999, but the systemic  discrimination by USDA against Black farmers and other farmers of color  by USDA was well documented beginning many decades earlier.   A 1965 report by the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights found that  Federal, State, and local officials discriminated against Black farmers  in agricultural programs and that this discrimination actively  contributed to the decline in the Black ownership of farmland.   In 1968, a follow-up report from the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights  found that Black farmers continued to face discrimination when seeking  farm loans and other forms of assistance.   In 1970, the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights again found that  discrimination continued in USDA program administration. The 1970  report stated that only 2 out of more than 4,100 USDA county committee  members in the South were Black farmers, even though there were 58  counties in the South where Black farmers comprised a majority of the  farm operator population.   In 1982, the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights issued another report  entitled ``The Decline of Black Farming in America'' which found that  the prevailing practice at the USDA was to follow local patterns of  racial segregation and discrimination when providing assistance and  that longstanding discrimination in USDA programs contributed to the  decline in farms operated by African-American farmers.   In 1997, the USDA formed a Civil Rights Action Team to hold  nationwide listening sessions to hear from socially disadvantaged and  minority farmers. A report published after the listening sessions  documented Black, Hispanic, Asian-American, and indigenous farmers who  told story after story of USDA hurting minority farmers more than  helping them. This 1997 report acknowledged that discrimination in USDA  program delivery continued to exist to a large degree unabated and  recommended 92 changes to address racial bias at the USDA.   In 1998, the USDA National Commission on Small Farms further  described and documented the longstanding discrimination of USDA  towards socially disadvantaged farmers. USDA stated that  ``discrimination has been a contributing factor in the decline of Black  farmers over the last several decades.'' The Commission's report also  notes the ``history of under-allocation of resources to institutions  that have served minority farmers.''   During the period between 1997 and 2000, Black farmers, Native  American farmers, and Latino/Latina farmers filed lawsuits alleging  USDA discriminated against them on the basis of race in processing  their farm program applications and that USDA failed to investigate  their complaints of discrimination. But settlements resulting from  these lawsuits did not provide the relief necessary for these farmers  of color to participate fully in the American agricultural economy.   On March 2, 2021, a group of full-time professors who work in  agricultural, food law, and related subjects wrote in a letter to  Majority Leader Schumer and Minority Leader McConnell that these court  settlements were severely flawed because of the adversarial nature of  the settlement process and because they attempted to define the problem  in terms of discrete incidents of individualized discrimination without  correcting the systemic problems that led to that discrimination. These  professors noted that while some farmers received a payment, many  remained indebted to the USDA, and the system itself remained broken.   Mr. President, I would ask unanimous consent to have this letter  printed in the Record following my remarks.   In 2001, we then have a report by the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights  documenting the continued discriminatory lending practices against  minority farmers. The Commission found that Black farmers waited four  times longer than White farmers for USDA farm loans. The Commission  recommended that USDA resolve the backlog of civil rights complaints  and document and alleviate discriminatory lending practices.   However, USDA continued to struggle with resolving its backlog of  civil rights complaints. In 2008, the Government Accountability Office,  or GAO, reported that USDA's difficulties in resolving discrimination  complaints persisted and that the USDA had not achieved its goal of  preventing future backlogs of discrimination complaints.   In 2019, a GAO report observed that socially disadvantaged farmers  and ranchers had proportionately less agricultural credit than non- socially disadvantaged farmers and ranchers. This report found that  farmers and ranchers of color continued to face more difficulties in  obtaining farm loans and highlighted the historic, systemic  discrimination against such farmers.   So now let's look at where we are today.   USDA spends billions of dollars each year to provide much needed  support to American farmers. The Market Facilitation Program and  Coronavirus Food Assistance Program are recent USDA programs designed  to bolster the farm economy. In both programs the majority of funds  went to nonminority farmers.   For example, the Environmental Working Group reported that  nonminority farmers received nearly 97 percent of the $9.2 billion  provided by the USDA's Coronavirus Food Assistance Program.  Additionally, the Farm Bill Law Enterprise reported that 99 percent of  market facilitation payments went to nonminority farmers.   Just last week the USDA stated ``there is a lot more that needs to be  done and accomplished at USDA to make programming equitable and to root  out decades of systemic discrimination that disproportionately affects  Black, Hispanic, Indigenous and other farmers of color.''   Early this week Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack recognized the  residual harm that decades of discrimination have caused to farmers of  color when he stated: ``Here's the challenge: We're not only dealing  with the specific issues of discrimination, but we're dealing with the  cumulative effect of that discrimination over a period of time.''   And what is the cumulative effect of that discrimination over time?  The cumulative effect of all the past systemic racism and  discrimination is that Black farmers and other farmers of color were in  a far more precarious financial situation before the COVID-19 pandemic  hit us, and so many of them have simply not been able to weather the  storm.  [[Page S1266]]    Approximately 13 percent of borrowers with FSA direct loans are  currently delinquent on their loans and could lose their farms to  foreclosure. But for Black farmers, 35 percent of those with FSA direct  loans are in default and could soon lose their farms. And it is not  only Black farmers--approximately 24 percent of the FSA direct loans to  Hispanic, Asian-American, and Indigenous farmers are currently in  default. What this means is that we are facing yet another wave of  foreclosures and potential land loss by farmers of color. But the debt  forgiveness and other assistance in the bill we are considering today  can prevent this and can begin to turn the page on this shameful  history of discrimination by the Federal Government.   I want to close by giving you one specific example of the  discrimination I have been talking about.   Eddie and Dorothy Wise were residents of Whitakers, NC. A retired  Green Beret, Mr. Wise's dream was to own a pig farm, and so in 1991,  Mr. Wise purchased land and started to raise swine. But then came the  discriminatory actions by USDA: failure to handle his loan applications  in a timely manner, denial of loan applications, change of interest  rates and escalation of monthly notes, and other misdeeds.   In 1997, a loan for improvements to the property was approved, but  the receipt of the funds was delayed for 7 months, and his 400 pigs  froze to death, destroying his operation. Later, he discovered that his  original plan had been approved at the State level but that his loan  officer never told him.   In the early morning hours of January 20, 2016, at least 14 Federal  marshals descended with guns drawn on Eddie's farm and forcibly  escorted him and his wife, who was still in bed and suffering from a  debilitating medical condition, out of their home and off their  property. Forcibly evicted from their home and their land and forced to  live in a cheap motel, Dorothy Wise died shortly thereafter. The 106- acre farm was sold to an adjacent White farmer for the miniscule price  of $260,000, and Eddie Wise had lost the one thing that he had always  wanted--to own a pig farm.   This story is just one example of the discrimination that literally  destroyed the lives of hundreds of thousands of Black farmers and their  families over the last century.   Today we have the opportunity to take a step towards justice for  those families.   I urge all of my colleagues to support sections 1005 and 1006 of the  bill before the Senate today.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                      March 2, 2021.      Re Support for Socially Disadvantaged Farmers.       Hon. Charles Schumer,      Senate Majority Leader,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.      Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Senate Minority Leader      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      House Majority Leader,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      House Minority Leader,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Leader Schumer, Minority Leader McConnell, Speaker       Pelosi, and Minority Leader McCarthy: We write in support of       efforts to level the playing field for socially disadvantaged       American farmers as set forth in Sec. Sec. 1005 and 1006 of       the House-passed American Rescue Plan. If enacted, these       sections will help to correct past injustices and create new       opportunities to build the diverse, resilient food system       that we all want and need.        American agriculture's history began with slavery and the       forced removal of tribes from their land. It continued with       myriad abuses, including Jim Crow laws, the prohibition of       minority land ownership, property laws that facilitated Black       land loss, and deceptive practices to entice Hmong farmers to       incur huge debts to build chicken houses. Each of these       predatory practices were instituted or allowed by U.S. law.       At every turn, government policies have either intentionally       or inadvertently served to advantage white farmers, creating       the category of farmers recognized by Congress and the USDA       for decades as ``socially disadvantaged.''        Cultural traditions in farming in America, long       romanticized in disregard of their discriminatory       consequences, have further contributed to inequities. Farming       is built on relationships: handshake contracts, neighbors       helping neighbors, conversations at the local coffee shop.       These relationships work well if you are a member of the       group; if you are not, they serve as a persistent barrier to       success. According to the 2017 Census of Agriculture, of the       3.4 million farmers in the United States, 3.2 million, 95.4%       are white. Only approximately 1.7% are American Indian or       Alaskan Native; 1.3% are Black; and .6% are Asian. For most       of these farmers, their farms are smaller, their sales are       smaller, and each year they fall further behind.        The USDA should have served as the equalizer, supporting       all farmers and assisting those in need. But most often it       has not. It has instead reflected and perpetuated       institutional racism since its inception. The problems       experienced by the farmers it has disadvantaged have been       repeatedly documented in government reports and       investigations and in writings by scholars, journalists, and       others. While some tell of the decades-long pattern of       discrimination, recent reports, including a GAO Report       released just last week, confirm that the barriers still       exist today, expressly affirming that socially disadvantaged       farmers still have less access to credit than other       agricultural businesses. Fair Lending, Access and Retirement       Security, Government Accountability Office (2021) (finding       racial and income disparities in access to financial       services, availability of credit, and the ability to       accumulate wealth).        Congressionally enacted farm programs have perpetuated and       exacerbated the problem by distorting the farm economy.       Federal farm programs reward the largest farms the most,       providing staggering sums of money to large landowners who       produce the program-favored crops. Not only are the vast       majority of these large landowners white, the program-favored       crops are not those most often produced by socially       disadvantaged farmers. These government payments distort       credit, land, input costs, and markets by favoring white       farmers to the disadvantage of others, most of whom are small       or beginning farmers.        The cumulative effect of decades of unequal treatment by       the USDA coupled with farm programs that favor large       landowners continues to negatively impact the economic       condition of beginning farmers and small fanning operations,       creating an extra burden for socially disadvantaged farmers.       Today, disadvantaged farmers generally have less access to       credit than white farmers, less accumulated wealth, and       smaller farming operations.        Congress and the USDA acknowledged this racial       discrimination and attempted to resolve it through the       settlement of two landmark lawsuits--Pigford and Keepseagle.       But this approach was severely flawed. These settlements       attempted to define the problem in terms of discreet       incidents of individualized discrimination without correcting       the systemic problems that led to that discrimination. The       adversarial nature of the settlement process served to       further divide. While some farmers received a payment, many       remained indebted to the government, and the system itself       remained broken. Providing debt relief to disadvantaged       farmers, will help to correct the longstanding past       injustice, wiping the slate clean for USDA to start over.       Reforming the system will provide the necessary financial and       educational infrastructure to finally give these farmers an       opportunity to compete on an even playing field.        We depend on our food system, and farming is at the heart       of that system. Natural disasters and the COVID pandemic have       revealed significant systemic problems, and climate change       has and will produce additional challenges. We need strong       regional food systems to build the resilience that is       necessary for our very survival. We need diversity reflected       in that network. We bemoan the aging of our nation's farmers       and the high barriers to entry for beginning and would-be       beginning farmers. The vast majority of American farmers are       white men over the age of 50. We need to open farming to its       full potential by offering new opportunities for diverse       farmers, thus benefiting from their help in creating a       resilient regional food system that is always able to meet       our food security needs.
