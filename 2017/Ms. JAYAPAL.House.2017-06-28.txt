 Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding.    Mr. Chair, I rise today to express my strong opposition to H.R. 1215.  First of all, my home State of Washington is one of those States where  our Supreme Court has ruled and said that caps are not constitutional.  So this bill is an intrusion of our States' rights.   This bill also clearly puts the interests of big corporations over  everyday people and sends a signal to medical and health providers that  they can act irresponsibly, perhaps to make more money, and get away  with it.   Let me give you a very real example of what happens when hospitals  put profit over people. The neurology program at Swedish Medical  Center-Cherry Hill in Seattle is under investigation for negligent care  arising out of a program designed to incentivize neuroscience doctors  to take on heavy caseloads of complicated cases that lead to serious  errors and even death.   One of the patients was Talia Goldenberg, a talented and vibrant  young woman. Talia went in for a cervical spinal fusion with a  neurosurgeon who had been embroiled in numerous investigations. And as  a result of gross medical malpractice, Talia died.   According to a Seattle Times investigation, numerous problems  surfaced around her care--or lack thereof--and attention to the surgery  and medical complications that arose from it.   When Talia went in for her surgery, she was filled with hope. In  thinking about the life that she might have after surgery, she wrote  this: So who am I? I am an artist, a dreamer. I am a stationary biker.  I am a woman, a girl, a person. I am a skier. I am an aspiring pole  vaulter. I am a reluctant, yet faithful, believer of the power of lucky  underwear. I am someone with a voice.   Talia died. She is one of the many tragic instances of people losing  their lives to medical malpractice, and, even in my own office, two of  my staffers have lost three of their grandparents due to medical  malpractice. We have to make sure that we have consequences when we  entrust our healthcare to someone, and there are grave errors.   For the sake of Talia and so many others like her who have dreams  that are violated by preventable errors, we must defeat this bill.   A ``no'' vote is a vote for the American people.                                time  1500
