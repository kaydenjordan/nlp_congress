 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  acknowledge the work of a student at Penn State DuBois.   Alec Baker, a native of Clarion, Pennsylvania, is a student in the  wildlife technology degree program at Penn State DuBois. He was  recently awarded an Erickson Discovery Grant from Penn State's Office  of Undergraduate Education for an independent research project.   Alec's area of study focused on black bears and the impact the bears  have on agriculture and farmers in Pennsylvania, particularly, the  Commonwealth's corn crop. Alec conducted the project this summer for  the Pennsylvania Game Commission and gathered information in the field  through October. He is processing his findings this fall.   Alec has conducted his research primarily using Clarion County as his  study area. He has obtained nuisance bear reports for crop damage from  the area dating back to the year 2000. He plans to chart trends in the  data through these years and monitor sites for continued activity using  cameras.   In total, 219 students applied to receive an Erickson Discovery Grant  this year, and Alec was one of 83 students from all Penn State  locations and campuses who received a grant. The Erickson Discovery  Grant allows students to immerse themselves in original research under  the direct supervision of a faculty member in order to obtain hands-on  experience in their chosen field.   Alec has just completed his sophomore year in the wildlife technology  associate degree program and will go on to earn a bachelor's degree in  wildlife and fishery science.   Mr. Speaker, I applaud Alec Baker for undertaking this important area  of study. I have no doubt that his research will help farmers in the  Commonwealth of Pennsylvania better protect their crops from bear- related damage. Pennsylvania has one of the largest populations of  black bears in North America, and thanks to studies like Alec's, the  Commonwealth will be better able to understand how bears influence  agriculture and how farmers can implement better management tactics to  protect their crops.   I congratulate Alec for his achievement and all those who received  the Erickson Discovery Award, and I look forward to the results.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule  I, I demand a vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the  Journal.

As vice chair of the House Agriculture Committee and chairman of the  Nutrition Subcommittee, I know firsthand the importance of good  management practices to keep this essential resource healthy.   This year's theme is ``caring for the planet starts from the  ground.'' Globally, 815 million people are food insecure and 2 billion  people are nutritionally insecure, but we can mitigate this through  soil health.   Mr. Speaker, 95 percent of our food comes from soil. Soil is a finite  resource, and on a human scale, it is nonrenewable. However, despite  the essential role that soil plays in human livelihood, there is a  worldwide increase in the degradation of soil resources due to  inappropriate management practices, population pressure driving  unsustainable intensification, and inadequate governance over this  essential resource.   World Soil Day 2017 aims to raise awareness of the importance of  sustaining healthy ecosystems and human well-being by addressing the  increasing challenges in soil management. Today we encourage people  around the world to engage in proactively improving soil health.   Happy World Soil Day.                            ____________________
