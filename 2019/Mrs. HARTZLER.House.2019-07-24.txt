 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Boys &  Girls Club 2019 Missouri State Youth of the Year, Ms. Jazzmine Jones.   Jazzmine is a member of the Boys & Girls Clubs of West Central  Missouri's Cole Camp Site, where she serves as a junior staff member.  In her position, she helps run programs and mentors the younger club  kids.   Earlier this year, Jazzmine was named the Missouri State Youth of the  Year at a 2-day event in Jefferson City, Missouri, marking the first  time a student from the Boys & Girls Club of West Central Missouri was  awarded this title.   Last week, on July 18, Jazzmine represented Missouri at the Boys &  Girls Clubs of America Midwest Regional Youth of the Year competition.  She made Missouri proud with her speech highlighting the importance of  a healthy lifestyle, education, and the impact of one's actions.   I am so thankful to have such a talented young individual in  Missouri's Fourth Congressional District working hard to be the best  person that she can be and sharing her knowledge with younger kids as a  mentor.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in commending Jazzmine  for her hard work and dedication in using her actions to inspire  others. I also want to wish her well in her future endeavors as she  begins her freshman year at the University of Missouri.   Go, Tigers.                            Fayette Optimist Club     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Optimist  Club of Fayette, Missouri. This club, founded on December 13, 1968,  celebrates its 50th anniversary this year. For half a century, they  have helped to support youth, and cultivate an overall stronger  community in Fayette.   The Optimist Club relies on their dedicated volunteers to raise funds  and complete projects that impact the lives of kids in their community.   The Optimists promote youth involvement in Fayette by hosting a  summer recreation program, a youth appreciation banquet, and a fishing  derby every year, as well as numerous other activities that promote  local programming for young people throughout the community.   It is organizations like the Optimist Club that create the backbone  of our small towns and help preserve their treasured culture.   Mr. Speaker, please join me in congratulating the Optimist Club of  Fayette, Missouri, for their hard work and dedication to the youth of  the community for the last 50 years.                         CoMo Fire Chief Randy White     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Columbia,  Missouri, Fire Chief Randy White on his retirement.   Since joining the department in 1998 as a firefighter, Chief White  has dedicated his life to the safety of mid-Missouri families. He has  saved countless lives and led his department to new heights.   During his time as fire chief, Randy's department became one of only  258 in the world to achieve accreditation through the Commission on  Fire Accreditation International. His hard work and leadership have  been a blessing to the Columbia Fire Department and a true role model  for other departments to follow.   I join with many Missourians, families, and friends to wish Chief  White a fulfilling retirement. I hope Randy enjoys the days he has  worked so hard to earn and wish him continued health and happiness in  this new phase of life.                            ____________________
