 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  when the House adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 9 a.m. tomorrow.    Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution  538, I call up the bill (H.R. 3823) to amend title 49, United States  Code, to extend authorizations for the airport improvement program, to  amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to extend the funding and  expenditure authority of the Airport and Airway Trust Fund, to provide  disaster tax relief, and for other purposes, and ask for its immediate  consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend  their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill currently  under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, Hurricane Irma's direct hit to the lower and middle Keys  was devastating to my district. Many lost everything to the storm's  130-mile-an-hour winds and significant storm surge. Some lost their  lives.   But fortunately, the Keys' recovery is well underway, and the  resiliency and generosity of Conchs and other south Florida residents  have been on display before, during, and after the storm.   While facing the prospects of receiving the full force of the storm,  Key West police and fire departments decided to remain on the ground,  risking their personal safety. They wanted to be there for their  neighbors when the storm had passed.   Navy personnel, under the leadership of Captain Bobby Baker, who  sacrifice for our country every day, once again answered the call to  serve and stayed behind to ensure they would be there to get the  runways open and ready to receive aid. Coast Guard Captain Jeff Janszen  also stayed to make sure the Port of Key West could open.   Two days after the storm had passed, I visited with both of these  leaders. They were working tirelessly to stand up their bases and had  not yet checked on the interior of their own homes.   Monroe County Sheriff Rick Ramsay rode out the storm at the Marathon  shelter because he felt it was his responsibility to be there to  protect his community. Officials from local municipalities from the  city of Key West  [[Page H7560]]  to Ocean Reef have been working around the clock with their teams to  get utilities up and running, roads cleared, and government offices  operational.   I am grateful to our first responders and all the public officials  and employees who have been working hard to serve the people of the  Florida Keys.   I also want to thank my office's Florida Keys director, Nicole  Rapanos, who has dedicated long hours to assist our constituents and  our neighbors in the Keys so that they can get the resources they need.  I am grateful for her dedication to her neighbors and proud to have her  on my staff.   Community organizations are also playing an instrumental role in the  Keys' recovery. Nonprofit groups like Star of the Sea Outreach, Rotary  Club of Key West, and the Florida Keys Outreach Coalition, just to name  a few, have been volunteering their time, coordinating donations, and  serving direct relief to the community.   Private companies and small businesses have also stepped up to help.  Robert Spottswood, whose family owns the Marriott Beachside, opened up  the hotel to first responders, Navy personnel, and others who chose to  ride out the storm.   Baby's Coffee, which was left with its own damage from the storm, was  providing their entire stock to residents of Key West, along with hot  meals and coffee.   Ikon Builders and UDT have brought supplies to the food banks and  donation distribution centers. The Marathon EOC, which has been  operating 24/7 and where approximately one-third of employees had lost  their homes, these people continued working to help in recovery and  rebuilding, and the list goes on.   On the individual level, people have gone above and beyond to show  their true Conch spirit. They have shared their own supplies and taken  time to go help neighbors. The outpouring of support from local heroes  in the Florida Keys has been so extraordinary, I could be here all day  telling the stories of thousands upon thousands of acts of kindness.  This powerful sense of community and humanity is one of the many  reasons I am proud to represent these local heroes.   Mr. Speaker, clearly the Keys' recovery is well underway. Tourism  will be opening up again next week, nearly 3 weeks earlier than  anticipated. I have no doubt continued recovery efforts will make the  Florida Keys an even greater one-of-its-kind paradise Americans from  across the country and people from all over the world have come to  love.   But the truth is, the Keys' tourism-based economy has been stalled,  and perhaps the greatest devastation is the financial strain on  individuals, families, and small entrepreneurs. Many of those facing  hardship are themselves working to assist their fellow survivors,  putting their personal interests aside. This community is doing its  part to help their own, Mr. Speaker.   Now it is time for Congress to do our part to help our fellow  Americans in my district and in similar communities throughout my home  State of Florida, in Texas, Louisiana, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin  Islands.   When we debated this bill on Monday, I told my colleagues about how  the tax credit for wages would allow small business owners like Owen, a  crab and lobster fisherman whose traps were destroyed in the storm, to  claim a tax credit for 40 percent of employee wages, up to $6,000 per  employee, helping him get his team back to work as soon as possible.   This legislation would also allow up to 415,000 hurricane survivors  in Miami-Dade and nearly 7,500 in Monroe County keep more of their  paycheck by referring to earned income from the immediately preceding  year for purposes of determining the earned income tax credit.    We are also making it easier for taxpayers to deduct more of the  costs from the extensive property damage these storms left behind and  allowing anyone struggling with initial recovery efforts to have  immediate access to their retirement savings without penalty.   Lastly, this legislation will encourage more American businesses and  individuals to continue generously supporting qualified hurricane  relief organizations by lifting caps on charitable giving to these  groups.   Mr. Speaker, hardworking Americans in Texas, Florida, Louisiana, the  U.S. Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico need Congress to act. On Monday,  this bill was derailed by political games, posturing, and name calling.  I hope that will not be the case today because my constituents and  those in other communities like my district don't have time to wait.  This tax relief package deserves bipartisan support from my colleagues.   I want to thank Chairman Brady and the Ways and Means Committee staff  for allowing me to shape this legislation for the benefit of south  Florida residents, especially those in Monroe County who were hardest  hit by Hurricane Irma. I want to thank Chairman Sessions and the Rules  Committee for making in order my amendment that will provide additional  benefits that are critical for our fellow Americans in Puerto Rico and  the people of the U.S. Virgin Islands. In the aftermath of Hurricane  Maria, they are facing a terribly difficult uphill battle to rebuild  their communities. I stand in complete solidarity with my friends  Stacey Plaskett of the U.S. Virgin Islands and Jenniffer Gonzalez-Colon  of Puerto Rico, and will work to get them everything they need to  rebuild their communities. I hope for their sake we can finally get  this done today.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Brady), the distinguished chairman of the  Ways and Means Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Shuster), the chairman of the House  Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Washington (Mrs. McMorris Rodgers), the distinguished  chairman of the House Republican Conference.   Mrs. McMORRIS RODGERS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding and for his tremendous leadership on this important  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Disaster Tax Relief and Airport  and Airway Extension Act of 2017. It also includes a 3-month extension  for the Special Diabetes Program for Indians. This is an important  program for many of the Tribes that I represent in my district.   It is also a 3-month extension of the Teaching Health Center Graduate  Medical Education program that is set to expire at the end of this  week.   It is estimated that we could have a national doctor shortage of  23,000 by 2025, and when you look at the rural areas like mine in  eastern Washington, it is especially stark. We know primary care saves  lives, and that is why it is so important to include these provisions  in the long-term reauthorization of the THCGME program.   This program specially trains residents in some of the larger  shortage areas; and when you compare it to the traditional Medicare  program, the Teaching Health Center residents are 3\1/2\ times more  likely to practice primary care, twice as likely to work in rural  areas, and 2\1/2\ times more likely to work in the underserved areas.   It is a part of the solution in solving our primary care crisis, but  it must be funded. That is why it is so important to continue this  funding and this legislation. Without the funding, the program will  unravel. The centers could be forced to ramp down. Residents could be  terminated, and some centers may be shut down and their programs  eliminated altogether.   I encourage my colleagues to recognize the importance of this program  and encourage them to continue working with me on a long-term solution  that ensures the future success of this vital program.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Norman).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Mr. Speaker, I truly deplore the way some colleagues have decided to  politicize such a sensitive, urgent, and important issue.   There are people in my community who are suffering, who lost their  homes, yet they are still working hard to help their neighbors rebuild.  For them to find out that this institution would oppose a measure to  help them because some colleagues think it is just not good enough-- now, you heard them. They recognize there is a lot of good in this  package, but it is not enough.    I am the Representative of the district that was hit the hardest by  Hurricane Irma. Chairman Brady was here. He has been working hard back  home to help his community recover while managing his responsibilities  here as chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. He is calling for  passage of this legislation that he sponsored.   Also putting their names on this legislation, Jenniffer Gonzalez- Colon, the Resident Commissioner elected by Puerto Ricans on the island  to this Chamber, she has added her name to this legislation.   Also, Stacey Plaskett, a member of the minority who represents the  Virgin Islands, she has added her name to the amendment we filed to  make this legislation even stronger.   So the Members representing the districts that were hit the hardest,  where people are suffering--and the gentlewoman from New York is  absolutely correct; the suffering in Puerto Rico cannot be compared to  anything else that we are seeing here on the mainland--their  representatives want to see this legislation pass, but some of our  colleagues say it is just not good enough. So because this is not good  enough for them, people should get nothing.   We wonder. We wonder why so many Americans don't trust this  institution, why so many Americans are frustrated with the politics in  this country: because if it isn't perfect, if it isn't exactly what I  want, then I am against it.                                time  1815    Now, fortunately, not all of the Members of the minority agree with  this. When we first had this vote on Monday, 26 Democrats voted in  favor of the legislation. And I thank them--not just for me, but on  behalf of all of my constituents, the people of the Florida Keys, south  Florida, and, of course, the people of Texas, Louisiana, Puerto Rico,  and U.S. Virgin Islands. I thank my Democratic colleagues and all of my  Republican colleagues that supported this package. I invite more  Members from both parties to support this package today because this is  not the time to play political games.   Now, I understand some people here are frustrated about what may have  happened in the past. I wasn't here, and I belong to a new generation  of Members of this institution. Quite frankly, I think none of us on  either side is interested in relitigating the old fights and the old  debates. We want to see the solutions for today and tomorrow.   The people of Florida--Monroe County, the Florida Keys, and Miami- Dade--the people of Texas, Louisiana, U.S. Virgin Islands, and Puerto  Rico, they need us now. They need this solution now.   Can we do more later?   Absolutely. Everyone knows that this Chamber and the other will soon  consider additional funding for FEMA--much-needed funding. I will  support a robust package for FEMA because the agency is strained and it  is working hard to help people all over this country and out in the  Atlantic.   But to say that this is not good enough, so instead we will do  nothing is just unacceptable.   I urge my colleagues to reconsider because I think it is important  that we send a message of national unity to help those who are hurting.  If we can do more in the future, we will and we should.   So, Mr. Speaker, in closing, I would just thank all of my colleagues  that understand how urgent this situation is, how much pain and  suffering are being experienced in these communities, and I ask them  respectfully to please support this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
