 Madam Speaker, it is with great admiration that I rise  today to congratulate Mia Neal of Gary, Indiana, and celebrate her  noteworthy achievement of winning an Oscar in the 93rd Academy Awards  for best makeup and hairstyling.   Mia Neal attended Horace Mann High School in Gary, Indiana, and after  graduating in 1997, Mia's interest in hairstyling and makeup blossomed  as she attended Merrillville Beauty College and Columbia College in  Chicago.   I would note that Mia's family has been actively involved in  northwest Indiana's community, as her mother, Dena Holland Neal, was  pastor of Peace United Church in Merrillville; and her grandfather,  James Holland, taught at Roosevelt High School for more than 15 years  and served as Gary's first deputy mayor from 1976 to 1988.   Madam Speaker, I ask you and my distinguished colleagues to join me  in recognizing Mia Neal on her historic Oscar award and again  congratulate her for this outstanding accomplishment.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman Takano for yielding me the  time.   Madam Speaker, I rise today to express my support for H.R. 239, the  Equal Access to Contraception for Veterans Act of 2021. I first commend  my colleague on the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs, Congresswoman  [[Page H3096]]  Brownley, for her leadership and perseverance to see that this  critically important legislation is passed by the House.   It is not acceptable that today women veterans do not have access to  the same contraception coverage all Americans currently have available  through the Affordable Care Act or private insurance, and all Active  Duty servicemembers have through the Department of Defense.   Women veterans are the fastest growing group of veterans enrolling in  the Department of Veterans' Affairs healthcare system, and it is time  that our policies for women veterans show them the support, respect,  and fairness that they deserve.   Madam Speaker, I thank my chairman, again, for the time, and I urge  my colleagues to support this legislation.
