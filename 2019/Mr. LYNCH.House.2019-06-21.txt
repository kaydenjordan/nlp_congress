 Madam Chair, I rise in support of the en bloc which  includes my amendment providing an additional $1 million to the medical  services account, to be directed towards public-private partnerships to  help address veteran suicide prevention; PTSD and TBI treatment; and  substance use disorders.   Madam Chair, taking care of our veterans means taking care of both  their physical and mental well-being. Tragically, we are losing  veterans at a rate of around 20 a day to suicide, many of whom are also  dealing with PTSD, traumatic brain injuries, and/or substance use  disorder.   While the VA is doing tremendous work to reach out to our veterans,  the need is still great so we must use every tool available to help  them. Through this public-private partnership program the VA will work  with research universities, teaching hospitals and other community  entities to reach more of our veterans so they can get the help and  care they need.   I thank the committee for including my amendment in the en bloc and  would urge my colleagues to support it and the underlying bill.
