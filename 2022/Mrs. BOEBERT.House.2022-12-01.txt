 Madam Speaker, the American people have spoken. They  have fired you and have chosen to end the Democrats' one-party rule  throughout our government.   The days of this Chamber being treated as Pelosi's house instead of  the people's House are over. The American people will once again be  allowed into this Chamber to see their Representatives at work.   Republicans made a lot of promises on the campaign trail. It is time  we make good on those promises.   We must defund the 87,000 IRS agents that the Democrats hired;  increase domestic energy production; get to the bottom of Hunter  Biden's corruption and, of course, the big guy, who is at least  compromised by 10 percent; reinstate the service men and women who were  shamefully discharged because they refused to take the COVID vaccine;  reduce government spending and curb inflation; secure the southern  border, at which there is a complete invasion; and reduce the flow of  China's fentanyl into our communities.   Republicans across America ran on these policies. God help us if we  fail to deliver on them.
