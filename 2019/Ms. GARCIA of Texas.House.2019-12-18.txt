 Madam Speaker, I didn't come to Congress to  impeach the President--even when he separated babies from their parents  at the border, even when he took money from our troops to build his  wall.   No, I didn't call for impeachment because I am here to make a  difference in the lives of my constituents. Yet, here we are in the  middle of a constitutional crisis.   As a former judge, I took my responsibility seriously to weigh the  evidence and determine if the President's actions were impeachable.  Unfortunately, the evidence in the Intelligence and Judiciary reports  leaves us with no choice but to impeach the President.   So I stand on my oath that I have sworn to the Constitution and to  the American people, and, today, I urge my colleagues to stand by their  oaths, too.   The Framers of the Constitution included impeachment as a safeguard  against a corrupt President whose misconduct could destroy the very  foundations of our country.   Donald J. Trump abused his power when he obstructed Congress and  ordered government officials not to appear before us.   Donald J. Trump corrupted our election when he asked a foreign  government to interfere for his personal and political gain.   Today, sadly, I ask my colleagues: Will you put your party over our  country, or will you help save our democracy and vote ``yes'' on the  Articles of Impeachment before you? I urge you to vote ``yes.''
