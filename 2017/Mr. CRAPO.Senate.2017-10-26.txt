 Madam President, today, together with my colleague  Senator Jim Risch, I wish to recognize the service of MG Gary L. Sayler  as he retires from leading the Idaho National Guard this month.   With more than 40 years of his distinguished 45-year military career  dedicated to the Idaho National Guard, Major General Sayler has served  Idaho in a variety of leadership capacities, including 7 years as  Idaho's adjutant general. Under Major General Sayler's direction as  commander, the 124th Fighter Wing played vital roles in numerous  overseas missions, including Operation Provide Comfort in 1994,  Operation Allied Force in 1999, and Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2003 and  2004. He subsequently served as assistant adjutant general from 2004 to  2010 before being appointed as adjutant general for the Idaho National  Guard in 2010, during the fighter wing's ongoing missions in the Middle  East in Operation Iraqi Freedom, Operation Enduring Freedom, Operation  Inherent Resolve, and Operation Freedom's Sentinel. The 124th Fighter  Wing has received numerous accolades under his steady guidance. These  include the prestigious Spaatz Trophy in 2016 and again in 2017; the  Governor's Outstanding Unit Award; and the U.S. Air Force Outstanding  Unit Award.   Major General Sayler has built on his extensive experience to lead  with practical knowledge. His educational background includes a  bachelor of science in history and education at North Dakota State  University in 1971 and later courses at the Air Command and Staff  College, Weapons School, and Air War College. Major General Sayler  began his first assignment in the U.S. Air Force in Thailand, flying  combat missions in Southeast Asia before joining the Idaho Air National  Guard in 1977 as a weapons systems officer for the 124th Tactical  Reconnaissance Group. With a master navigator rating, he has extensive  experience flying multiple aircrafts and has logged more than 4,100  flight hours. These include 392 combat hours that also account for his  combat missions flying the F4-G over Iraq during Operations Southern  Watch and Provide Comfort. His promotions and list of major awards and  decorations that he has earned for his outstanding service are  extensive and include the Legion of Merit, the Meritorious Service  Medal, and the Air Medal with silver oakleaf cluster.   Based on these accomplishments, Major General Sayler has provided  reasoned and experienced council as we have worked together to address  the needs of the Idaho National Guard, including protecting and  advancing the flying mission at Gowen Field as an exemplary force  within the National Guard for generations to come. While visionary in  his goals for the Idaho National Guard, a hallmark of Major General  Sayler's leadership has been his high regard for the servicemembers he  leads and their families. In addition to the attention and support he  has devoted to Idaho guardsmen and their families, Major General Sayler  has also been instrumental in forging enduring relationships with the  local communities and Native Tribes undergirding Gowen Field. These  bonds will likely propel the Idaho National Guard and Idaho communities  forward for years to come.  [[Page S6847]]    We congratulate Major General Sayler on a distinguished and exemplary  career serving our Nation and leading the Idaho National Guard. Idaho  has benefited greatly from his steady, astute leadership. We wish him  and his family the very best and thank him for his dedicated service to  Idaho and our Nation.                            ____________________     Madam President, today I wish to honor Norm  Steadman for his longtime, dedicated service as mayor of Weippe, ID.   Weippe was incorporated in 1964, but its roots go much further back.  The Weippe Prairie is known to have been inhabited by the Nez Perce  Indians. The city notes that it was not far from the present townsite  in 1805 that Lewis and Clark had their first encounter with the Nez  Perce Indians. This beautiful and strong community is nestled among  many recreation opportunities, including historic trails, fishing,  hunting, skiing, snowmobiling, and all-terrain vehicle resources.   Over the years, the community has seen its share of booms and busts.  It has been touched by the fur trade, gold rush, the Homestead Act, and  the logging industry. The town's current population of approximately  400 faces many of the challenges experienced by rural western towns  with an enduring commitment to their community.   Serving as mayor for a remarkable nearly 50 years following his  initial appointment to the position in 1968, Mayor Steadman has led  through considerable growing pains with a steady hand and commitment to  his community that befit his name. A deep desire to help others and a  sense of responsibility to lead his community are clear characteristics  of Mayor Steadman's. His decades of leadership and working to overcome  challenges with limited resources are commendable. Thank you, Mayor  Steadman, for your nearly 50 years of dedicated service. You are truly  leading by example by continuously stepping up to assist.                            ____________________
