 Mr. President, in 1961, when I was deciding where to  attend law school, I was looking for an institution where I could not  only learn about the law in the abstract, but also how it is applied,  interpreted, and written. I was immediately drawn to the Georgetown  University Law Center, given that is steps from the U.S. Capitol and  Supreme Court. The education that I received in my years at Georgetown  Law helped me to understand that the way in which the law is written  directly impacts the lives and livelihoods of millions of people,  affirmed the importance of working to uphold and improve the law, and  guided me toward a career in public service.   And I am not the only person in the Senate who had this experience at  Georgetown Law. Senators Hirono, Durbin, Van Hollen, and Sullivan all  count themselves as alumni. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer was my  classmate. Graduates of Georgetown Law also work in offices across the  Capitol, including my own, using their legal education to help serve  constituents, drive measureable change in our communities, and better  our legal system.   For many Americans, the events of the past few years have brought  into focus the importance of preserving our Nation's institutions and  the collective work that must be done to ensure that they work better  for all Americans. As a result, thousands more Americans have flocked  to law school in recent application cycles. With its location in  Washington, DC, and its wealth of courses, incredible practitioners and  faculty, and innovative research centers, Georgetown Law has been well- positioned to take advantage of the heightened interest in the legal  field.   For the 2021-2022 academic year, Georgetown University Law Center  received a record 14,052 applications, an increase of 41 percent of the  previous year. This incredible achievement demonstrates Georgetown  Law's strength as a leader in the field of legal education.  Congratulations to Georgetown University Law Center for this  exceptional record. I have full confidence that Georgetown Law will  continue to shape future leaders for years to come, preparing them to  address the myriad challenges our society faces and to fight for  justice for every person and every community.   Dean William Treanor does a superb job of leadership, and we often  speak of the inspiring path of the law center over so many decades.   Georgetown University Law Center was featured in an article in the  Washington Post late last year. I ask unanimous consent that the  article titled, ``The country's most popular law school got an  unexpected jolt'' be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                 [From the Washington Post, Nov. 13, 2021]        The Country's Most Popular Law School Got an Unexpected Jolt                            (By Valerie Strauss)         Year in and year out, the Georgetown University Law Center       in D.C. gets more applications than any other law school in       the country (and yes, that includes law schools at Harvard       and Yale and Stanford). But what happened for the 2021-22       academic year was historic.        Collectively, U.S. law schools this year saw an increase of       at least 12 percent in applicants for classes that started       this fall and a 26 percent jump in applications--the largest       in nearly 20 years, according to the nonprofit Law School       Admission Council.        At Georgetown University Law Center, the increase was so       high that is shocked Georgetown law officials, who have       become accustomed to being the country's most popular law       school. The school saw a 41 percent increase in applicants--      for a total of 14,052. Of all law school applicants       nationwide, 1 in 5 applied to Georgetown. It is the largest       law school in the country with some 2,000 students in juris       doctor degree (JD) programs, with Harvard second at some       1,750 JD students.        The rise in law school applications across the country--      which left some law schools overenrolled this fall--was a       result of several factors, said Susan Krinsky, executive vice       president for operations and chief of staff at the Law School       Admission Council. ``I don't like to call it a perfect storm,       but it was,'' she said.        Fallout from the coronavirus pandemic played a big role,       with economic uncertainty that traditionally fuels       applications to professional schools, she said. Many young       people lost their jobs and decided to give law school a       chance. But a continuation of what is called ``the Trump       bump'' was a factor too, she said.        Law school applications began to rise after the 2016       presidential election, with President Donald Trump's Muslim       ban and immigration policies helping to fuel the increase,       she said. What happened in 2020--including the police killing       of George Floyd and the racial justice movement that arose       from it--spurred more applicants, she said, as did the death       of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the       confirmation of a controversial successor.        ``There was a generalized increase in interest about what       lawyers do--or can do,'' she said.        A 2020 survey by Kaplan Test Prep of more than 100 U.S. law       schools found that 84 percent of admissions officers (and 87       percent in a 2018 survey) believed that the political climate       was a ``significant'' factor in the rise in applicants for       that year--and that continued in the 2020-21 applications       cycle.        Why, though, did Georgetown University Law Center have such       a huge rise in applicants?        ``I think it's a combination of things,'' said William M.       Treanor, dean and executive vice president of Georgetown Law.       ``Washington, D.C., is a huge lure. It offers you things you       can't get anywhere else. And we have internships with       lawmakers and policymakers and faculty engaged directly in       the issues of the day.''        Georgetown has a night school, joint degree and advanced       degree programs, an Office of Public Interest and Community       Service and it specializes in some of the hottest legal       subjects--including environmental, health and international       law. Its Human Rights Institute is a draw for students--and       it attracts some big legal names. Now on the faculty, for       example, is Doug Emhoff, the country's first second       gentleman (he is married to Vice President Harris), a       leading intellectual property and business litigator and       expert on entertainment and media law.        Treanor said the political climate was an important factor       in the surge of applications at Georgetown. He said he became       interested in the law when he was in high school during a       similarly contentious time in American political life--the       Watergate era of the early 1970s. President Richard Nixon was       forced to resign after his administration was caught breaking       the law.        ``That was a period in which people were drawn to law       school and the thought that law matters and the fight for       justice can  [[Page S518]]       have real consequences,'' he said. ``This has been a moment       where we saw something similar, in politics, the divisions in       society, the need for racial justice.''        It's what cemented Kamal Rattray's decision to apply. The       Bronx high school teacher said he had long wanted to become a       lawyer, but he applied after his father, who had a green       card, was deported to Jamaica by the Trump administration for       reasons he still doesn't understand. Rattray's immigrant       students feared the same thing could happen to their       families, he said.        ``All the deportations, without due process, that the Trump       administration took full advantage of while further       disenfranchising communities of color inspired me to go to       law school,'' he said. ``I think we need more lawyers of       color in order to hold accountable people with ideologies       akin to the Trump administration's.''        Rattray had four law schools to choose from--but Georgetown       was a no-brainer, he said. ``I really felt like there was       consistent outreach from Georgetown while I was in the       application process. I also liked that the school has a Black       Law Students Association, and there seems like there is a lot       of camaraderie.''        The school's numbers are also attractive to applicants.       Georgetown ranks in the top 10 on the Princeton Review's       ranking of law schools for best classroom experience, and it       has one of the lowest student-to-faculty ratios in the       country. Ninety to 95 percent of students graduate in three       years, and more than 95 percent of its students pass the bar       exam on their first attempt. Ninety percent of students who       graduated in 2020 (the latest year for which there is data)       were employed by the time they received their degree, and       Georgetown Law is tied for highest median starting salary       among graduates working in private practice as associates.        Law school is expensive--and that's true at Georgetown as       well. For 2021-22, the cost of attending full-time is close       to $100,000, the school's website says, with $69,280 going to       tuition. Seventy-eight percent of this year's entering       Georgetown Law class received scholarship aid of some sort.        The outreach to applicants is led by Andrew Cornblatt, the       law school's veteran dean of admissions. Cornblatt makes it a       point to stay connected to students who come to campus, and       is often stopped on campus by students who just want to say       hi.        ``Most people think of assembling a law school class as       putting a puzzle together,'' Cornblatt said. ``For me it's       more like creating an orchestra with lots of different       instruments, not just violins. I am always struck by how many       talented, interesting, well-qualified applicants we receive       from all over the world.''        Working at home during the pandemic, he spent hours each       day interviewing 2,700 applicants in small groups. Zoom       allowed him to visit 50 states, 37 countries and six       continents.        ``We are looking for applicants who really want to do this       and while we are happy to welcome college seniors, we also       put great emphasis on work and life experience,'' Cornblatt       said. ``Opera singers, veterans, class presidents, Fulbright       scholars, football players, Hill staffers, people working in       nonprofits fully committed to public service.        For fall 2021, Georgetown enrolled 561 students from 45       states and 17 foreign countries, an acceptance rate of 12.9       percent--down from 21 percent a year ago. It was also the       most diverse first-year class--with 40 percent identifying as       people of color, as compared with 32 percent the previous       year. Of the 561, 110 are Opportunity Scholars, which awards       scholarships to students with the most significant financial       need and high academic credentials. Women constitute 54       percent of the class.        Cornblatt played a key role in persuading Kathie Duperval,       24, to attend Georgetown. She was in the final stretch of       applying to law school during the 2020 presidential election       after a tough year navigating the pandemic and, she said,       Georgetown's outreach sold her.        ``Specifically, Dean Andy made a tremendous effort to form       connections with many students during the interview       process,'' she said. ``Though virtual, he made sure to       connect with us, and he even went out of his way to send       personalized videos to admitted students on a weekly basis.''        For Elena Bacon, 22, the social justice movement that       emerged from Floyd's murder changed her legal path. Once       seeing herself as a corporate lawyer, she said she now plans       to pursue a career in international human rights law so she       can advocate for those being denied fundamental freedoms.       Georgetown was always at the top of her list, she said,       ``because of the number of opportunities it offers for       experiential learning, its distinguished Human Rights       Institute, and its location in Washington, DC.''        Now, Cornblatt--a graduate of Harvard University and Boston       College law school--is engrossed in leading his 31st       admissions season as dean.                            ____________________
