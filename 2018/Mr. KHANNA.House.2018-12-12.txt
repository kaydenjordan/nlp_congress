 Mr. Speaker, Americans around this country are wondering:  What does a farm bill have to do with the war in Yemen? And the answer  is absolutely nothing.   You wonder why people are frustrated with Congress, why they think  Congress lacks common sense. It is because no one understands why you  would have a vote on a farm bill and you would tie it to a vote on war  and peace in Yemen.   The only reason the leadership is doing this is because they know  that there are dozens of Republicans who will stand with Democrats to  stop the killing in Yemen.   How do they know this? Because Senate Republicans are voting to stop  the killing in Yemen.   I came to Congress because of my grandfather, who inspired me. He  spent 4 years in jail in Gandhi's independence movement. I came to  Congress to say that America should always stand for human rights.   I urge my Republican colleagues to look at the pictures in The New  York Times and Huffington Post: 5-year-old kids, 7-year-old kids  starving to death, a Yemeni child dying every 10 minutes.   They tell us to wait until January. That would mean thousands more  Yemeni kids dead.   I don't think this is a partisan issue. This is an American issue.  Let's stop the killing in Yemen. Let's end the famine. Let's have a  vote in this House so we can stop the civil war in Yemen and save  lives.
