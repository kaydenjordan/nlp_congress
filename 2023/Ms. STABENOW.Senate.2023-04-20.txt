 Mr. President, first of all, I have to also lend my  voice in congratulations to Senator Patty Murray. We are so proud of  her and look to her for her leadership. It is an honor to serve with  her in the leadership in the Senate, but she is just an extraordinary  Member. And 10,000 votes--that is a lot of votes, and we should all  continue to be very grateful for her leadership. So congratulations.   Mr. President, this amendment is one that, in spirit--I mean, I agree  with the need. Senator Sullivan and I have talked about the fact that I  think he identified something that is very important for small rural  communities. It is, however, duplicative of work we already do through  rural development in USDA.   The USDA has Community Facilities Programs. They provide grants and  loans and loan guarantees for essential community services in rural  areas of 20,000 residents or less, including public safety.    Communities have used this for firetrucks, fire department  construction, and fire equipment that Senator Sullivan has talked  eloquently about. Last year, it was nearly $100 million in assistance  to rural fire departments.   So I told Senator Sullivan that we will have, in the next number of  months, the farm bill reauthorization on the floor. I want to work very  much with him on how we might be able to more focus or strengthen this  program that already exists. The farm bill is coming up. I believe that  is the place for us to address what is a very important issue.   So I would urge my colleagues to channel their support to rural first  responders into supporting this particular program in the upcoming farm  bill reauthorization.
