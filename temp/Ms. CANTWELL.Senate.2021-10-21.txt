 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up  to 2 minutes.    Mr. President, I come to the floor to support the  nomination of Tana Lin to serve as judge for the U.S. District Court  for the Western District of Washington.   If confirmed, Lin would be the first Asian American appointed as a  Federal judge in the State of Washington. Western Washington has one of  the largest Asian-American populations in the country, so it is very  important that we have her voice on the Federal bench to show the  diversity of our country.   As an Asian-American woman, the barriers Ms. Lin faced have inspired  her to fight for equal justice access to promote diversity within the  legal field, and she has had a passion for public service for a long  time. She started her legal career as a public defender and served as a  mentor to economically disadvantaged youth and mothers interested in  pursuing law for many years.   So she is extremely well qualified and supported by many, including  the National Asian Pacific American Bar Association, the National Asian  Pacific American Women's Forum, the National Legal Aid & Defender  Association, and many others; and I urge my colleagues to support her.    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.
