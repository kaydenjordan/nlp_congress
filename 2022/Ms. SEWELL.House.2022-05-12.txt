 Mr. Speaker, I proudly rise today to join the city of  Selma, Alabama, in celebrating May 14, 2022, as Dr. Bernard LaFayette  Jr. Day, honoring the extraordinary contributions of civil rights  leader, activist, and advocate of nonviolence Reverend Dr. Bernard  LaFayette, Jr.   Dr. LaFayette made his mark in history as a civil rights organizer,  minister, educator, and lecturer whose contributions to the civil  rights movement have garnered him national recognition as a leading  authority on the strategy of nonviolent social change.   As a student advocate in the 1960s, he played a leading role in the  early organizing of the Selma voting rights movement. Dr. LaFayette was  an active participant in the sit-in campaign and the Nashville student  movement, and he worked closely throughout the 1960s with groups such  as the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, SNCC, the Southern  Christian Leadership Conference, SCLC, and the American Friends Service  Committee.   Dr. LaFayette began his activism as a student at American Baptist  Theological Seminary in Nashville, Tennessee, where he was taught by  teacher and SCLC mentor James Lawson the techniques of nonviolence.   Dr. LaFayette learned alongside fellow students John Lewis, James  Bevel, and Diane Nash before participating in the Nashville student  lunch counter sit-ins in the 1960s.   From there, his passion for civil rights continued to blossom,  leading him to become one of the cofounders of SNCC, the Student  Nonviolent Coordinating Committee.   As a director of SNCC's Alabama voter registration project in 1962,  Dr. LaFayette relocated to my hometown of Selma, Alabama, where he  worked with the Dallas County Voters League to open voter registration  clinics throughout the city of Selma.   Gaining a reputation as a fiery organizer and passionate proponent of  nonviolence, Dr. LaFayette expanded his work from Alabama to Chicago,  working with the American Friends Service Committee, Dr. Martin Luther  King, and the SCLC's Chicago campaign.   He later became an ordained Baptist minister and served as president  of his alma mater, the American Baptist Theological Seminary.   Dr. LaFayette is recognized as one of the leading proponents of  nonviolent direct action in the world. He has taught and preached the  philosophy of nonviolence in many colleges and universities across the  globe.   He was the recipient of numerous honorary degrees, including from  Mount Holyoke College, the University of Rhode Island, and Antioch  College's Coretta Scott King Center for Cultural and Intellectual  Freedom.   Dr. LaFayette has written several books about his experience in the  civil rights movement and books covering his views and thoughts on  nonviolence. These books include ``The Leaders Manual: A Structured  Guide and Introduction to Kingian Nonviolence,'' ``The Briefing  Booklet: An Orientation to the Kingian Nonviolence Conflict  Reconciliation Program,'' and most recently, ``In Peace and Freedom: My  Journey in Selma.''   For over 50 years, Dr. LaFayette has remained dedicated to equality  and justice for all, lecturing at various universities and traveling  internationally to train the next generation on how to achieve social  change using the philosophy of Dr. King and nonviolence.
