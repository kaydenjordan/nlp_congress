 Mr. Speaker, in Uvalde, Texas, children were killed in an  elementary school. This is one of 128--128--mass shootings in America  over the last 40 years.   It is time to act. This is not perfect legislation. But if we can  save one, two, three or more lives, then it is our responsibility to  pass this legislation. Our communities are depending on us.
