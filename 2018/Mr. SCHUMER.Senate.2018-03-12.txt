 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Now, Madam President, after the deadly shooting at  Stoneman Douglas High School, the American people are wondering if  Congress can do something meaningful to curb the epidemic of gun  violence--an epidemic that has gone on far too long and taken the lives  of far too many.   For years, Democrats have proposed commonsense gun safety policies to  ensure that dangerous people can't get their hands on dangerous  weapons. Recently, Democrats have reiterated our support for several  specific measures, including universal background checks, protection  orders, and a debate on banning assault weapons.   Americans of all political stripes support a debate on these  policies, and yet the majority leader, who has given gun safety no time  on the floor of the Senate, has also given us no indication we might  consider the issue anytime soon. He is sweeping it under the rug. The  NRA is powerful around here.   At the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, President Trump failed to  show the conviction and steady leadership required to make progress on  this issue. After indicating support for a host of reasonable gun  safety measures a few weeks ago and in front of the TV cameras he  invited in, yesterday President Trump released a list of administration  policies which represent a 180-degree reversal. What President Trump  said at the public meeting and what he proposed yesterday are  opposites.   After signaling, for instance, he would be for raising the age of  purchase of assault weapons from 18 to 21--a modest measure--President  Trump backed off saying he would leave it to the States and the courts  to decide. That is a copout, and we know that. After indicating support  for universal background checks, President Trump makes no mention of  closing the dangerous gun show loophole or internet sales loophole.  There is no mention of anti-domestic violence legislation, no mention  of assault weapons or support for significant changes to protection  orders. The President's plan consists only of small-bore, NRA-approved  policies, including the absurd proposal to send more guns into  classrooms by arming teachers.   In the wake of so many American tragedies, the Trump proposal on gun  safety is utterly insufficient as a response. Even if you discarded the  idea of arming teachers and took the Fix NICS proposal and the changes  to mental health in President Trump's proposal, that wouldn't be close  to enough to address the issue of gun violence. The Nation is clamoring  for significant, meaningful progress on gun safety, but President  Trump's proposal is just a baby step, when America needs to take a  giant leap.   The administration's proposal makes it perfectly clear that President  Trump has an obeisance to the NRA. Even when President Trump  momentarily departs the NRA script, he quickly gets reeled back in. If  President Trump, his staff, and some of our Republican friends are  wondering why his ratings are so low, it is because he does this all  the time. At the meeting, he publicly challenged conservative  Republican Senator Toomey. He said: Oh, I guess you are afraid of the  NRA.   Well, Toomey is not afraid of the NRA. He has taken them on. It is  President Trump who is afraid of the NRA. He is afraid to do anything  that doesn't meet their approval. We all know what this Fix NICS bill  is about. It is tiny, but it is OK with the NRA, so my good friend from  Texas is happy to come to the floor and talk about it. When is he going  to come to the floor and say something we really need that the NRA  doesn't support? We are all waiting, not just for him but for our  Republican colleagues. We all know the game going on here--make it seem  like you want to do something but don't offend the NRA, which is way to  the extreme when you look at where Americans are at on this issue.   After watching the same sequence of events take place on guns, on  immigration, no one should be surprised when President Trump initially  talks about bipartisanship but ends up caving to hard-right special  interests. No one should be surprised that the Republican leadership in  the Senate, when it comes to guns, does the same exact thing. In this  case, the gun lobby is the hard-right special interest.   President Trump's behavior on the most sensitive political issues is  turning into a predictable Kabuki theater, where he invites the cameras  in, talks the good talk but then refuses to walk the walk. It shows  great weakness in this President, and if he doesn't have the guts to  move forward, he shouldn't invite the cameras in and act like he  [[Page S1619]]  does. Now, that may give him a temporary little high, but it is not  what the American people want. It is not leadership and, in my judgment  at least, that is why the President is down so much in the polls no  matter what he does. That is why even a race in the southwestern corner  of Pennsylvania, in a district he won by 20 points, is a nail-biter.   I hope the President will change, I hope he will become a leader, and  I hope he will stop just focusing on the show but actually get things  done. So far, the American people, not just us, are disappointed.   Now, Democrats in the Senate are going to keep fighting to go much  further than the President's proposal. We are going to fight to pass  universal background checks, to actually get Federal legislation on  protection orders, and to start debating banning assault weapons. This  is the conversation the country needs to have. We will keep pushing our  Senate colleagues and President Trump to do something real, not just  something they think they can talk about that the NRA rubberstamps  approval of.                            ____________________     Madam President, on a different subject--Russia. Despite  heaps of evidence Russia interfered in our election, President Trump  has hardly lifted a finger to punish Russia or safeguard future  elections. This is a dereliction of duty.   Over the last few weeks, the Senate has heard testimony from the  DNI--the Director of National Intelligence--and the head of the U.S.  Cyber Command. Neither had been directed by the administration to  counter Russia's continued efforts to undermine our democracy. A report  in the New York Times last week documented how President Trump's State  Department ``has yet to spend any of the $120 million it has allocated  since late 2016 to counter foreign efforts to meddle in elections or  sow distrust in democracy.'' Still, the Trump administration has not  fully implemented the sanctions Congress passed to punish Putin.   Meanwhile, Russia-linked bots continue to sow division and inflame  political tensions on social media. Multiple officials from the  intelligence community have warned that Russia will try to interfere in  our elections again. We have done nothing to harden our election  security in anticipation of the midterms.   Our democracy is under attack, and the President of the United States  seems unwilling to punch back or even harden our defenses. It is as if  an enemy naval flotilla were headed to our shores, and we didn't put up  any defense. That is exactly what is happening. It is a new world. It  is not a flotilla of a navy or planes buzzing along our coasts, but it  is these cyber attacks and social media attacks on our election system,  but they are every much as vital to America as our physical defense.  Yet we hear nothing, nothing, nothing out of the White House.   You only have to look to our ally, the United Kingdom, for an example  of how a nation should respond to the threat from Russia. Just today,  Prime Minister Theresa May went to the House of Commons to expose a  likely Russian attack against two people in her country using a nerve  agent. She demanded a response from President Putin and promised  appropriate countermeasures if he refuses or the answer is  insufficient.   Prime Minister May's quick and decisive action is exactly what is  missing from President Trump when it comes to cyber security in our  elections.   President Trump still has an opportunity. Over the weekend, President  Putin rather ridiculously blamed Ukrainians, Jews, or other minorities  for the attack on our election in 2016--another attempt, of course, at  misdirection and distraction. In reality, Special Counsel Mueller's  investigation has charged 13 Russian nationals with subverting the 2016  elections--not Ukrainians, not Tatars, not Jews but 13 Russian  nationals.   Today Leader Pelosi and I, alongside Senator Feinstein and  Congressman Nadler, sent President Trump a letter urging him to use all  available resources to extradite the 13 Russian nationals named in the  special counsel's investigation to stand trial here in the United  States. Ensuring these Russian nationals stand trial in the United  States would be a clear signal to those who seek to meddle with our  elections that their actions are not without consequences. This is  imperative to deter Russia and any other nation in the future from  attacking our democracy. This is another test of President Trump's  leadership and another test he is failing miserably.   If President Trump really cared about our country, he would expand  every resource in his possession to bring justice to these foreign  actors who meddled with our country's most sacred democratic process-- the one enshrined by the Founding Fathers, embraced and even worshiped  by Americans over the centuries with good reason.   Now there is meddling in this sacred process and President Trump does  nothing? Why are we not hearing anything from those on the other side  of the aisle about that? You can be sure that if it were another  President--particularly a Democratic one--we would hear howls, but this  is not about Democrats or Republicans. This is about our democracy, and  Americans inevitably ask the question, Why is President Trump so afraid  to do anything about Putin?   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
