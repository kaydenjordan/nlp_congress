 Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate  the Atlanta Braves for advancing to the World Series for the first time  since 1999.   In a season plagued by injuries, what the Braves have accomplished is  nothing short of remarkable. On August 1, the Braves had a losing  record, and things were looking grim. Through much adversity, the  Braves relied on some unlikely stars to shine in the postseason during  the month of Joctober.   What this team has achieved is nothing short of special, and we hope  to continue shocking the world.   After caving to the lies of the Democrats, Major League Baseball  moved the All-Star game out of Atlanta, depriving the community of  hundreds of millions of dollars. Well, you may be able to move the All- Star game, but you can't move the World Series, and Truist Park is  going to be electric.   In addition to the players, I would also like to congratulate manager  Brian Snitker and the rest of the coaching staff for the tremendous job  they did in assembling and guiding this team to the 2021 World Series.  Go Braves.                            ____________________
