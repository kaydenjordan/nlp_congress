 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  any extraneous material on the subject of this Special Order.    Madam Speaker, I rise as a member of the Congressional  Black Caucus to speak to this body about the issues that are important  to Americans, everyday Americans.   The Congressional Black Caucus is the conscience of the Congress, and  we feel that it is our responsibility in our Special Order Hours to  address those issues and concerns that are of most importance to the  people of America. We represent 70 million Americans in our caucus, 55  Members strong, and we are using this time to address this Congress on  the issues of agriculture and the Black community.   Agriculture and the Black community, it is more than just SNAP for  us.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the distinguished gentleman from Georgia  (Mr.   David Scott).    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for that  enlightening information that he has shared with us. We know that the  years of experience and seniority that the gentleman has gained on the  Agriculture Committee have given him not only a passion, but a real  understanding of the issues that are important, not only to Americans  who utilize SNAP, but to those farmers and those in our agricultural  community who are supportive of the things that we are trying to push  forward and that this administration is, in fact, trying to impede.    Madam Speaker, I think of all the money that America  spends on foreign aid, foreign food programs; and the fact that we, as  Americans, are squabbling over feeding our own, of providing nutrition  and assistance to those families, to veterans, to our elders, to our  children who need these programs, it is astounding that we even have to  have this conversation.    Madam Speaker, as you can see, I am here alongside my  colleagues of the Congressional Black Caucus in strong opposition to  the administration's proposal to severely restrict broad-based  categorical eligibility, or cat-el.   This rule would kick millions of people struggling with hunger from  the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, most commonly known as  SNAP, as well as approximately 250,000 children from preschool meals;  250,000 children who rely on this program to provide them with lunch,  with breakfast, allowing them to be able to utilize their skills in  school, allowing them to be able to learn on a daily basis.   Many of these children, we know, without this program are unable to  eat, are unable to be able to stay awake in school because of the  hunger that is within them, right here in this country. And so we are  fighting to make sure that those children are not removed; that those  millions of Americans are not removed from this program.   SNAP provides nutrition benefits to supplement the food budget of  needy families so they can purchase healthy food and move toward self- sufficiency; providing food assistance that averages just $1.40 per  person per meal, $1.40 per meal.   SNAP is a modest benefit, with nearly half of the participants  running out of benefits before the end of the month. If anything,  policymakers should be debating how much to increase this supplemental  benefit, given that there is no room for cuts.   What's more, Trump's tax law gave more in tax breaks to the top 1  percent than SNAP costs in its entirety. And if the Trump  administration is looking for strategies to achieve savings in SNAP,  while actually helping workers, it need look no further than raising  the Federal minimum wage. Raising the Federal minimum wage to $12, not  even the $15 proposed in the Raise the Wage Act, would save $53 billion  over the next 10 years, nearly four times as much as the proposed rule,  by ensuring that workers earn more so that they are better able to  afford food, instead of punishing labor market struggles with hunger.   The Trump administration's proposed rule would recalculate how we  measure poverty, a move that would more than likely result in reducing  the eligibility criteria for individuals and removing people off  certain Federal programs that are meant to assist poor and low-income  families.   Recently, the Trump administration proposed a rule that would  recalculate how we measure poverty, a move that would more than likely  result in reducing the eligibility criteria for individuals and  removing people off certain Federal programs that are meant to assist  poor and low-income families.   The proposed rule would change how the Census measures poverty in a  manner that will artificially drive down the number of people counted  as officially poor. Because eligibility for a range of basic supports  is calculated based on the poverty threshold, each year, as costs go  up, many working people with low pay would gradually be stripped of  SNAP, WIC, Medicaid, parts of Medicare, Head Start, school lunch, legal  services, even tax credits under the Affordable Care Act.   In my own district, due to Hurricanes Irma and Maria, the Virgin  Islands Department of Human Services Division of Family Assistance  executed Disaster SNAP, D-SNAP, and regular SNAP simultaneously. The  Virgin Islands provided this Disaster SNAP to approximately 30,000  households, and SNAP to approximately 29,000 households.   There are approximately now 22,000 people on SNAP in the Virgin  Islands, where we have a 33 percent child poverty rate.   As a member of the House Agriculture Committee, and a conferee on the  2018 farm bill, I am proud of the work we did on that bill. This  proposal flies in the face of everything we worked on to build a  bipartisan bill, a bipartisan consensus around the process of SNAP, and  the funding, and the support we recognize that American families need.   House Democrats and our colleagues in the Senate expressly rejected  changes to cat-el; the end result was the most overwhelmingly  bipartisan farm bill in history. This is only an attempt by an  ideological White House at an end-run around congressional intent. The  White House is trying to take away the authority of this body, and we  will not stand by and allow that to happen.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Payne),  who has worked extensively on this issue, as well as poverty issues and  issues on how to increase healthcare benefits to American families. I  yield to the gentleman to speak about those issues.                                time  1945     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for the great  information, the statistics, the science that is there that explains to  us what happens when SNAP is denied to young people, as well as his  heartfelt words about where our Nation is going when we are unable to  feed our own.   I have some remarks from another Member of the Congressional Black  Caucus, Congresswoman Marcia Fudge, who is the chairperson of the  Subcommittee on Nutrition, Oversight, and Department Operations of the  Agriculture Committee.    Madam Speaker, over 40 States and territories use broad-based  categorical eligibility, or BBCE, to streamline the administration of  SNAP and provide critical assistance to households receiving benefits  and services through the Temporary Assistance to Needy Families block  grant.   BBCE is proven to help millions of working poor families move toward  financial security by easing the benefits cliff as their earnings  increase.   On July 24, 2019, USDA published a proposed rule to restrict the use  of BBCE and eliminate SNAP benefits for an estimated 3.1 million  Americans. This includes children, working families, military veterans,  disabled individuals, and our seniors.   Most shameful is the proposal's impact on hungry school-age children.  By USDA's own estimates, the new policy would take away direct access  to free school meals for at least 500,000 schoolchildren. Nearly half a  million children would be left to go hungry during the school day,  shifting the burden to strapped school districts.   In her State of Ohio, according to the Robert Wood Johnson  Foundation, over 61,000 SNAP households would lose their benefits. USDA  reports that, in 2017, the prevalence of food insecurity among those in  Ohio was higher than the national average. 13.7 percent of Ohioans were  food insecure in 2017 compared to 12.3 percent nationally.   Even USDA admits the proposed changes to SNAP would make food  insecurity worse and make it hard for millions of Americans to get by.  Most notably, it would remove the current flexibility for States and  territories to use BBCE to tailor SNAP to best meet the food needs of  their own populations.   Republicans love to talk about States' rights when it suits them, but  when it comes to the flexibility of States to meet the needs of food- insecure populations, then they want something very different.   As the economy continues to leave working families and our most  vulnerable behind, programs like SNAP are needed more than ever.   Congress already debated these issues. We came together and rejected  this policy in both the 2014 and 2018 farm bills with a record  bipartisan vote.   This proposed rule is shameful, cruel, and contrary to the will of  Congress. This unilateral action by the administration only complicates  legitimate bipartisan efforts to make programs like SNAP more effective  and efficient for millions of people who rely on it to put food on the  table.   I thank Congresswoman Fudge for her remarks, and she will include the  remainder of her remarks in the Record.   I would note that on May 22, 2019, I sent my own Governor of the  Virgin Islands a letter reminding him of the need for us to speak out  on the proposed rule that would recalculate how we measure poverty, a  move that would make it more than likely to result in reducing the  eligibility criteria for individuals and removing people off certain  Federal programs that are meant to assist poor and low-income families.  I include that letter in the Record.

Governor Albert Bryan Jr.,      Christiansted, VI.        Governor Bryan: Recently, the Trump Administration proposed       a rule that would recalculate how we measure poverty, a move       that would more than likely result in reducing the       eligibility criteria for individuals and removing people off       certain federal programs that are meant to assist poor and       low-income families.        The proposed rule would change how the Census measures       poverty in a manner that that will artificially drive down       the number of people counted as officially poor. Because       eligibility for a range of basic supports is calculated based       on the poverty threshold, each year as costs go up, many       working people with low pay would gradually be stripped of       SNAP (formerly food stamps), WIC, Medicaid, parts of       Medicare, Head Start, school lunch, legal services, and even       tax credits under the Affordable Care Act.        Due to Hurricanes Irma and Maria, the Virgin Islands       Department of Human Services Division of Family Assistance       executed both Disaster SNAP--D-SNAP--and regular SNAP       simultaneously. The Virgin Islands provided D-SNAP to       approximately 30,000 households and SNAP to approximately       29,000 households territory-wide. As a result, members of the       community were able to purchase desperately needed food.       There are now approximately 22,000 people on SNAP in the       Virgin Islands.        This is an important a vital program for Virgin Islanders.       There is a 45-day window to comment on the proposal and the       deadline is June 21, 2019. I am requesting that the       Government of the Virgin Islands submit its comment on the       effect this rule will have on the residents of the Territory.            Sincerely,                                                Stacey E. Plaskett,                                                Member of Congress.     I include in the Record letters from AARP, as well as  the United States Conference of Mayors, that have written in during the  comment period to speak out against and in opposition to the proposed  rule changes by this administration.                                                            AARP,                                     Washington, September 23, 2019.      Re FNS-2018-0037, Revision of Categorical Eligibility in the           Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).       Program Design Branch,      Program Development Division, Food and Nutrition Service,           USDA, Alexandria, VA.        AARP, on behalf of its nearly 38 million members and all       older Americans nationwide, welcomes the opportunity to       submit comments on the U.S. Department of Agriculture's       (USDA) proposed rule to revise categorical eligibility in the       Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Ensuring       that older Americans experiencing food-related hardship have       access to nutrition assistance is a priority for AARP. SNAP       provides critical food assistance for millions of people,       including 8.7 million households with at least one adult age       50 or older.   AARP believes the proposed revision to categorical eligibility in SNAP    will harm low income seniors and recommends that the Administration                           withdraw its proposal.         We are deeply concerned that the Administration's proposal       would harm older Americans' health and financial security.       The proposed rule undermines the intent of SNAP to alleviate       hunger and food insecurity among low-income households.       Additionally, in an attempt to restrict eligibility for SNAP,       the proposed changes would make low-income households more       financially vulnerable and more likely to rely on public       benefit programs. According to USDA's regulatory impact       analysis, the proposed rule may ``negatively impact food       security and reduce savings rates among those individuals who       do not meet the income and resource eligibility requirements       for SNAP or the substantial and ongoing requirements for       expanded categorical eligibility.'' Similar efforts to limit       broad-based categorical eligibility (BBCE) in the House-      passed version of the 2018 Farm Bill were ultimately rejected       on a bipartisan basis.        USDA estimates that the proposed regulation would eliminate       SNAP eligibility for 3.1 million people, disproportionately       impacting households with one or more elderly individual(s).       Households with elderly members represent more than one-third       of the 1.7 million households the Administration estimates       would lose SNAP eligibility; meanwhile, those households make       up only 24 percent of current program participants. The       eligibility cut would affect 13 percent of households with       seniors, 7 percent of households with children, and 9 percent       of households overall. Since the cuts would       disproportionately harm elderly individuals, USDA determined       that there is a potential for ``civil rights impacts,'' which       is alarming to AARP.    SNAP is critical to the food security and health of millions of older                                 Americans.         SNAP is the primary source of nutrition assistance for many       people who are struggling to put food on the table. While the       program provides a modest benefit ($125 a month on average       for households with members age 60 or older), it helps       recipients meet their basic food needs. SNAP is an especially       important program for older Americans because many face       challenges to employment, live on fixed incomes, live alone,       and have limited financial resources to spend on necessities       like food, housing, and essential medicine.        Unfortunately, food insecurity among older Americans is       already all too common. An estimated 5.5 million Americans       age 60 and older were food insecure in 2017. Households with       grandchildren are nearly three times as likely to be food       insecure. The proposed rule would lead to even greater food       insecurity among older Americans.        Older adults who are food insecure are at increased risk       for many negative health outcomes. They are over twice as       likely to report being in fair or poor health relative to       older adults who are food-secure. Compared to food-secure       older adults, they are also 53 percent more likely to report       a heart attack, 52 percent more likely to develop asthma, 40       percent more likely to have congestive heart failure, 22       percent more likely to face limitations of Activities of       Daily Living, and 60 percent more likely to experience       depression.        Food insecurity among older adults also results in       significant costs to the American public, particularly       through increased expenditures on health care. Experts widely       agree that nutrition is one of the most important factors       influencing our health. SNAP participation has been linked to       reduced hospital and nursing home admissions among older       adults. Research examining older adults who were dually       eligible for Medicare and Medicaid in Maryland found that       SNAP participants were 23 percent less likely to enter a       nursing home and those dually enrolled were 4 percent less       likely to be hospitalized in the year after receiving SNAP in       comparison to nonparticipants. Enrolling the millions of       seniors eligible but not enrolled in SNAP could result in       billions of dollars in health care savings.    BBCE allows low-income households to save for emergencies and become                              self-sufficient.         The law governing SNAP, determined by Congress, sets the       income limit and asset limit for the program, and offers       important options provided to state administrators. For more       than 20 years, states have had the flexibility to lift the       asset tests under SNAP allowing families to purchase       groceries without having to spend down their limited savings.       This allows them to maintain a cushion that can help them       weather future financial emergencies caused by unexpected       health emergencies, natural disasters, or an unforeseen job       loss. A basic level of savings can prevent severe hardship as       a result of a financial shock and can ultimately reduce the       likelihood that a household will need public benefits like       SNAP.        Currently, 23 states and jurisdictions using BBCE have no       asset limit for SNAP. Under the proposed rule, states would       lose this flexibility, and SNAP applicants would be held to       the restrictive federal asset limits. Asset tests disqualify       families and individuals from food assistance if they have       managed to save as little as $2,250--or $3,500 for households       with elderly or disabled members--who may struggle with       replenishing any assets they spend down. This would       discourage low-income households from accumulating small but       meaningful assets, jeopardizing their financial security and       making it more likely that they will need to turn to SNAP or       other public assistance programs for support. A recent study       found that BBCE increases the likelihood that a SNAP       recipient has at least $500 in a bank account by 8 percent.       By allowing SNAP recipients to build a reasonable level of       preventive savings under BBCE, households are more likely to       set aside some money and become more self-sufficient.    The proposed rule would increase administrative burden for states and                                households.         The rule would significantly limit states' flexibility and       make eligibility for SNAP benefits more restrictive for       people in 39 states, Washington D.C., Guam and the Virgin       Islands. According to USDA, BBCE reduces administrative       burdens for State agencies and households and particularly       benefits working households. Under the proposed rule, 17.2       million households that remain eligible for SNAP, as well as       new SNAP applicants, would face additional burdens associated       with the application process. Research has demonstrated that       policies that add burdens to SNAP participation contribute to       a decline in program participation. Instead of increasing       burdens on SNAP applicants, we call for changes that would       make enrollment in SNAP easier and as seamless as possible.       Application forms, procedures, and program notices should be       shortened, simplified, and integrated with other government       benefit programs. BBCE currently helps reduce the complexity       of the SNAP application process and helps to improve state       administration while lowering administrative costs.        Despite the benefits of SNAP, older adult participation       rates in SNAP are the lowest of any age group. In FY 2017, 84       percent of all eligible individuals were enrolled in SNAP.       However, only 48 percent of eligible elderly individuals were       enrolled in the program, including just 29 percent of elderly       individuals living with other people. A number of factors       already keep eligible older Americans from receiving       benefits, including the complicated and time-consuming       application and enrollment processes. Processes that make       enrollment and reporting easier and help overcome  [[Page H7896]]       the barriers that keep older Americans from accessing the       food assistance they need are important for reducing food       insecurity among older adults.                                  Conclusion         We are committed to reducing hunger and food insecurity       among older Americans and therefore urge the Administration       to withdraw its proposal. SNAP provides important nutritional       support, promotes healthy aging, and is associated with       reduced health care costs. The BBCE policy in particular also       helps people save and improve their financial wellbeing.       Instead of reducing eligibility for the program while       increasing administrative burdens, we should be working to       further strengthen SNAP and improve participation in the       program, particularly among eligible older adults who       underutilize the program more than any other age group.

Ms. Jessica Shahin,      Associate Administrator, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance           Program, Program Design Branch, Program Development           Division, Food and Nutrition Service, USDA, Alexandria,           VA.        Dear Associate Administrator Shahin: On behalf of the US       Conference of Mayors (USCM), we are writing to express our       strong opposition to the proposed revision of ``broad based       categorical eligibility'' in USDA's Supplemental Nutrition       Assistance Program (SNAP) published in the Federal Register       on July 23, 2019. As noted in the proposal's regulatory       analysis, this far reaching executive action will escalate       food insecurity and hunger for an estimated 3.1 million       individuals--including children, seniors, and people with       disabilities in our states, regions and cities nationwide.       Furthermore, this proposal will put children's health and       development at risk by removing their access to healthy       school meals; and harm our economy by reducing the amount of       SNAP dollars available to spur regional and local economic       activity.        As Mayors, we serve as the CEOs of the nation's cities; and       remain most concerned about any proposal that will reduce       improvements to the health of our residents, weaken nutrition       programs, deteriorate advances to healthy food access, and       spur declines in local and regional economies. USCM has       supported and adopted policies over many years to eliminate       hunger, combat food insecurity and improve health disparities       to build a stronger society for all residents in our       communities. Equally, we have vigorously opposed the proposed       revision of broad based categorical eligibility of USDA's       Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and rejected this       proposal most recently throughout deliberation of the Farm       Bill in 2018.        SNAP remains one of our nations' key resources in the fight       against hunger and is particularly important to vulnerable       populations in our cities. For instance, 80 percent of SNAP       households include a child, an elderly person, or a person       with disabilities; and 85 percent of all SNAP benefits go to       such households. Furthermore, SNAP is not only a critical       resource in the fight against hunger and food insecurity, but       also lifts people out of poverty. Per the 2017 Supplemental       Poverty Measure Report, SNAP lifted 3.4 million people--      including 1.5 million children out of poverty in 2017. So, we       stand united and reject any proposal to restrict eligibility       to vulnerable adults, children, seniors, and people with       disabilities in our cities.        Research has found that receipt of SNAP in early childhood       improved high school graduation rates, adult earnings, and       adult health. Mayors recognize that solving child hunger and       poverty is critically important to also creating a future       where all children thrive. Regular access to healthy and       affordable meals is one of the strongest predictors of       improved school performance, better health, and sound       childhood development.        Lastly, the proposed rule will harm local and regional       economies, as it is well documented that the economic gains       from public benefits are even greater than the volume of       direct assistance due to a ``multiplier'' effect. USDA has       estimated that during times of economic downturn, every       additional $5 dollars in SNAP benefits generates up to $9       dollars of economic activity, and every $1 billion increase       in SNAP benefits results in 8,900 full-time equivalent jobs.        Executive action should not be used to hurt individuals,       families and communities; and we urge you to abandon this       proposal. Our nation cannot remain globally competitive if       our children do not have enough to eat; if our citizens do       not have access to affordable health care; if housing and       other basic needs are priced out of reach; and if adults who       are willing and able to work cannot find jobs that will help       them support their families.

Madam Speaker, may I ask how much time I have  remaining.    Madam Speaker, President Trump's latest attempt to  slash SNAP would be harmful to Americans across the country, but  certain communities face particular risks. Six of the groups that  Trump's proposed rules would hit hardest include rural communities,  Black and Latinx America, people with disabilities, people with  criminal records who are trying to move on, those in the LGBTQ  community, and women.   Given that 76 percent of rural adults report that good jobs are  scarce in their areas, rural communities will be among the hardest hit  by Trump's proposed rule, as it would tie States' hands and remove the  flexibility they need to help residents of high-unemployment areas put  food on the table.   Indeed, while urban areas experienced a net gain of 3.6 million jobs  from 2007 to 2015, rural areas lost 400,000 jobs during that time,  meaning  [[Page H7897]]  that many rural areas have struggled to recover from the Great  Recession.                                time  2000    Additionally, Black and Hispanic households are especially likely to  be food insecure and thus disproportionately rely on SNAP to help them  meet basic needs, accounting for about 30 percent, and nearly 20  percent of SNAP benefits in 2016, respectively.   This is due in large part to the systematic barriers that African  Americans and Latinx Americans face to building wealth, purchasing  homes, accessing education, and escaping poverty.   Poverty rates in these communities are more than double those of  White Americans, and the Black unemployment rate is still more than  twice that of White workers, despite what is spoken of in the White  House. In 2016, Black Americans' median wealth was only $13,460,  compared with $142,000 for White Americans.   People with disabilities:   The proposed rule purports to apply only to ``able-bodied adults  without dependents.'' What does that mean? Many of the more than 11  million people with disabilities who receive SNAP assistance could lose  that assistance under the rule, as people who face limited work  capacity due to disability or poor health are regularly misclassified  as able-bodied for the purposes of SNAP.   In fact, based on analysis by the Center on Budget and Policy  Priorities, the author estimates that 12 percent of SNAP recipients  ages 18 to 59 have at least one physical, functional, or work  limitation but are not counted as disabled under SNAP.   People with criminal records:   The proposed rule particularly harms people who come into contact  with the criminal justice system. Nearly nine in ten employers use  criminal background checks in hiring. This means that even an old,  minor criminal record can serve as a life sentence to poverty and  joblessness. As a result, the unemployment rate among formerly  incarcerated individuals is approximately 27 percent. What is more, one  study shows that 60 percent of formerly incarcerated individuals remain  unemployed 1 year following their release.   By helping people put food on the table while they get back on their  feet, SNAP is a powerful tool for supporting reentry and preventing  recidivism. In fact, one study shows that when formerly incarcerated  people are subjected to harsher SNAP requirements, compounded by the  substantial barriers they already face, recidivism rates increase.   Taking SNAP away from workers as they struggle to rebuild their lives  and reenter the labor market would thus directly undercut the  bipartisan gains that the President and Congress say they support in  the FIRST STEP Act.   The LGBTQ people:   Trump's proposed rule would also be particularly burdensome for the  LGBTQ community. According to a 2017 nationally representative CAP  survey, LGBTQ people are more than twice as likely as non-LGBTQ people  to receive SNAP benefits, with 26 percent of LGBTQ women and 18 percent  of men reporting that they or their families received SNAP.   The disproportionate receipt of benefits is just one reason that this  rule would be particularly burdensome for the LGBTQ community. The rule  would especially harm workers because they are especially likely to  face labor market barriers that make it more difficult for them to find  employment.   Women:   Women make up two-thirds of the low-wage workforce, making them  especially likely to face the unstable schedules that would be punished  by the Trump proposal's punitive time limits.   In addition to the challenges of low-wage work, women are  disproportionately likely to be caregivers, including caring for people  who may not be considered dependents under Trump's proposed SNAP rule.  For example, women are literally 1.4 times more likely than men to  provide unpaid care and help to people who live outside of their home.   While women struggle to manage the challenges of unstable low-wage  work and caregiving, they are also more likely to face workplace  discrimination than men. For example, nearly 36 percent of women who  filed sexual harassment charges from 2012 to 2016 claimed that they  faced retaliation as a result, such as their employers forcing them out  of their jobs or reducing their hours. Therefore, women who face  discrimination may be more likely to be subject to the proposed rule.   African Americans on average have the lowest household incomes among  all racial/ethnic groups except Native Americans. The poverty rate for  African Americans is almost two times greater than the general U.S.  population. These are, in fact, issues that we all face and should be  aware of.   SNAP is a powerful anti-poverty program for all people. In a typical  month in 2017, SNAP helped about 13 million African Americans put  sufficient food on the table. Its benefits lifted about 2.1 million  African Americans, including 1 million children, above the poverty line  in 2015. SNAP also kept 1.2 million African Americans out of deep  poverty--above half of the poverty line--that year.   Approximately $20 billion in SNAP benefits, about 30 percent of the  total, went to African American households in fiscal year 2016.   On average, African American households that participate in SNAP  receive $260 in SNAP each month, just $260.   A typical participating African American family of three has an  average monthly income of $940, or 56 percent of the poverty line. When  their $390 SNAP benefit, the average for a family of three, is added to  their cash income, total monthly income rises by 29 percent, to $1,330.   But this is just an example of what this administration is doing.  One, going against what this Congress has already proposed and agreed  to, bipartisan support, getting something across the line, bringing it  to the President's desk, he signs it, and then through the  administration, agencies, or executive order, attempting to slash at  the authority of this body, of this first branch of government, who in  fact, makes laws.    I know that firsthand, as that is exactly what is happening right now  in the Virgin Islands with the disaster relief funding that this body  came up with.   We recall that this body decided that it was, in fact, going to give  the territories money for disaster relief, and now we are facing FEMA  guidance delays on new resiliency and rebuilding provisions.   Additionally, FEMA denying local administration of FEMA permanent  housing reconstruction programs; FEMA not willing to advance funding  for major recovery projects, taking too long to improve major  worksheets; HUD delaying releasing CDBG recovery funding and  segregating it from the rest of the country; action plan for unmet  needs was approved on March 1, but still no grant agreement 6 months  later, 2 years after the hurricanes; FEMA administrations denying cost  share waivers on FEMA aid, which was given to the Katrina area; refusal  to exercise clear statutory authority to do this for the Virgin  Islands.   This is what this administration appears to be doing: allowing  Congress to come up with bipartisan legislation, whether it be SNAP,  assistance to farmers, food programs, disaster relief, having  bipartisan support in both chambers, getting it across the line,  signing it and then undercutting it, undermining this body, undermining  the democratic process that is in place. We must do something about it.   In January of 1865, when Union General William T. Sherman issued an  order to allocate 40 acres to each freedman, the Black ministers who  lobbied for the policy envisioned vibrant, self-governed Black agrarian  communities dotting the southern countryside. Unfortunately, President  Andrew Johnson's revocation of this order later that year and the  institution of the Jim Crow regime after reconstruction left rural  Black Americans to build their farming communities from scratch.   It wouldn't be the first time the U.S. Government worked to undermine  Black farmers, and it certainly wasn't the last. We are seeing that  even today.   Yet, even in the face of broken promises, not to mention the violence  and discrimination aimed at Black farmers and Black Americans by White  landowners and lenders, those farms secured a foothold in American  agriculture.   At the height of Black farming in 1920, Black farmers operated  925,710 farms, about one-seventh of all farm  [[Page H7898]]  operations in the United States. Today, going from one-seventh, as of  2012, Black farmers make up less than 2 percent of all farmers.   In the Virgin Islands, we recognize this. The U.S. Department of  Agriculture has a long and well-documented history of discrimination  against Black farmers. The unequal administration of government farm  support programs, crucial to protecting farmers from an inherently  risky enterprise, has had a profound impact on rural communities of  color.   We have got to stay on this administration to make sure that all  Americans have a fair shot, not only at food and food security through  SNAP, but also to ensure that those farmers, American farmers,  particularly minority farmers, have a fair shot at being part of that  food production.   We know that in the Virgin Islands, our farmers farm very small  acreages of land, but we are hoping and looking for the support of the  USDA to live up to their example and the ideal that they are there to  support farmers, not to undermine them; they are there to support not  just the commodities, but to those specialty crop workers, those  smaller farmers who are providing food and sustenance to Americans here  in this country.   We know that fresh food is the best food for our children as part of  the school lunch program, and we must expand support for the farm-to- the-schoolroom programs, those programs that allow local farmers to be  the ones to provide the food for those school programs that are in  place, and not allow the administration to undercut any part of the  process.   We know that the Congressional Black Caucus will be vigilant at  ensuring that this administration does not cross the line, and we will  be vigilant at bringing to the American people the message that this  Congress will not sit back and allow any administration, Democrat,  Republican, anybody, to shirk their responsibility to the American  people.   As the conscience of the Congress, that is our charge, and we will  continue to do that work.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 8 o'clock and 12 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Wednesday, September 25, 2019, at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
