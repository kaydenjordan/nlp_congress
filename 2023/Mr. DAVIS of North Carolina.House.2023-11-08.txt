 Mr. Speaker, as we prepare for Veterans  Day and as it is Military Family Appreciation Month, I wish to  highlight work taking place at East Carolina University.   ECU has unveiled a new Military and Veterans Resource Center, a  beacon of support for our active military, veterans, and their  families, those who have served our Nation with unwavering dedication.   This resource center is more than just bricks and mortar. It embodies  our commitment to honor and assist those who have sacrificed so much  for our Nation.   The resource center offers many amenities, including study and  wellness rooms, academic workshops, and peer advising.   The East Carolina University Military and Veterans Resource Center  will help our servicemembers, veterans, and their families create a  brighter future in eastern North Carolina.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do  now adjourn.
