 Mr. President, the work that reporters do as members of a  free and independent press is vital to our country and to our  communities.   It is why, last week, in an unprecedented action, nearly 300  newspapers all over the country--a dozen or so in my State--came  together to stand up for the free press and defend the First Amendment.  There were 300 newspapers that wrote editorials--all independently  written, of course, with all different takes on this--to advocate for a  free press and to defend the First Amendment.   The Chagrin Valley Times, which is not far from where I live in  Northeast Ohio, wrote:         We are indeed your lens into your community. We are not       your enemy.    Clearly, this was a takeoff on the President's comments that the  media are the enemies of the people.   The Athens NEWS, from Southeast Ohio, wrote: ``Good reporting often  succeeds in righting wrongs and making things better for people.''   The Akron Beacon Journal, one of the great newspapers in this State,  wrote:         Power . . . belongs to the people. The press thus received       extraordinary protection because of its capacity to inform       readers and check the powerful.    It is shameful that journalists have to defend their First Amendment  rights, our First Amendment rights, our Nation's First Amendment rights  just so they can do their jobs. As these community papers show us,  nothing could be further from the truth. That is why I want to  highlight yet another story by an Ohio paper, informing the public,  that has been reported by a journalist who serves her community.   CityBeat Cincinnati describes itself as having been ``a voice in  Greater Cincinnati for nearly a quarter of a century now, publishing a  print edition weekly, and producing regular content throughout the week  online to try to help keep you informed of what is happening in your  city.''   A great example of that content was in a story last week that was  reported by Maija Zummo on the Black Family Reunion that took place in  Cincinnati and its celebrating its 30th year. The event was founded in  1989 by the iconic Dr. Dorothy Height, who served as President of the  National Council of Negro Women for more than 50 years.   As Ms. Zummo reported, the festival brings together community groups,  performers, and small businesses to ``celebrate the values and  strengths of the black family.'' Ms. Zummo's reporting informed  Cincinnati readers about the events they could attend that weekend,  including a parade, festival, church service, and other community  activities.   That kind of reporting is what journalists do every day, every week,  every month across Ohio and around the country. They serve their  readers, their viewers, and their communities. They deserve our  respect. They don't deserve a President who calls reporters,  journalists, and all kinds of people in this business the enemies of  the people. Again, reporters serve their viewers, their readers, and  their communities. They serve all of us. They deserve our respect.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
