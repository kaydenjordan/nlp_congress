 Mr. Speaker, I listened to my colleagues talking about the  politicization of how we deal with Federal employees. The fact is, the  bureaucracy has never been more politicized than it is today.   This bill is the Federal bureaucrat protection act. That is what this  is. Let's be a hundred percent clear. This is about leftists in this  body wanting to protect the entrenched leftists in the bureaucracy,  undermining the will of the American people every single day. That is  what it is about.   We don't want to allow the people who are running the agencies to go  in and fire people who are either not doing their job, completely  violating their ethics at the desk, or, frankly, are going right  against the law or the will of the American people.             Look no further than the Department of Homeland Security, which is  turning a blind eye to our border. Look no further than an FBI that is  targeting parents for daring to challenge school boards. That is what  your Federal bureaucracy is doing.   All of these charges being levied, saying, oh, this is about hate,  going after Federal employees--I am a former Federal prosecutor and  worked with the Department of Justice. My father worked in the Federal  Government for 20 years right here. But I know why the  [[Page H7854]]  gentleman, my friend, Mr. Beyer, was here: Because the richest counties  in America are right here in Fairfax, Loudoun County, Montgomery  County, feeding right off of the back of the beast that is the Federal  Government, the bureaucrats that are stepping over the will of the  American people.   If we dare put forward legislation, like I have, to say that those  bureaucrats should be able to be fired at will--for example, how about  the HUD employee caught using his work email for private business  deals, the postal employee arrested for bringing cocaine into the  workplace, and the EPA employee who spent years viewing pornography for  2 to 6 hours a workday?   The fact is, only 25 percent of Federal supervisors felt they could  successfully remove an employee, while 78 percent reported that  previous efforts to remove an employee had no effect. Only 3 percent of  whistleblower complaints are substantiated. Mr. Speaker, 175 of 16,000  discrimination complaints were substantiated in 2019.   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle want to preserve an  entrenched bureaucracy to step over the will of the people so that this  town can decide the well-being of the American people. That is what it  is about.   It is about power. It is about the entrenchment of power among  bureaucrats. My colleagues know it, and that is why they are trying to  advance this legislation.
