 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 8124, the Criminal Judicial  Administration Act of 2020.   This bill strengthens existing laws about transportation and  subsistence for indigent criminal defendants. It does this when they  are brought to court proceedings.   H.R. 8124 allows a magistrate judge to decide post-judgment motions  in a misdemeanor case where the magistrate judge was the judge who  handled the underlying misdemeanor case.  [[Page H5143]]  This bill will also improve the efficiency of our court systems by  allowing our courts to manage caseloads in a more efficient and  economic manner.   I thank the bipartisan effort of my colleagues, the sponsors of this  legislation, Representatives Jeffries and Roby.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I just want to say that, once again,  I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 8124, the Criminal  Judicial Administration Act of 2020, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.  [[Page H5148]]    Mr. Speaker, the bipartisan Protecting the Health and Wellness of  Babies and Pregnant Women in Custody Act will improve care and outcomes  for pregnant women in prison as well as for their children.   I was proud to introduce this important legislation with  Representatives Bass, Lesko, and Clark. I just want to say that  Chairwoman Bass was incredible to work with. In particular, we did one  virtual meeting, which consisted of tear-jerking stories that really  addressed the need for change in this area.   Mr. Speaker, women are the fastest growing population in Federal  prisons, yet the system was designed with just men in mind.   In 2018, Congress and President Trump took action to address these  inequities with the FIRST STEP Act. H.R. 7718 will build upon that  critical work by addressing the unique healthcare needs of incarcerated  women who are pregnant, as well as those of their babies, which will  ensure positive outcomes for their families.   H.R. 7718 establishes minimum standards of care for pregnant women,  unborn children, and newborns in Federal custody. Further, the bill  limits the use of restraints and restrictive housing for pregnant women  and postpartum prisoners.   By providing incarcerated women with access to pregnancy-related  healthcare and services, we can ensure better outcomes for mothers and  babies.   Again, I want to thank Chairwoman Bass, Representative Lesko, and  Representative Clark for working with me on this important piece of  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the House to support this important legislation,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I, again, want to urge my colleagues  to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 7718, the Protecting the Health and Wellness of  Babies and Pregnant Women in Custody Act.   Again, I reiterate that it was an absolute honor to work with  Chairwoman Bass on this important piece of legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1415     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 8225, the Fight Notario Fraud Act of 2020,  addresses a problem that already has a remedy in current law.   The U.S. Department of Justice and State and local officials fight  against fraud every day, including fraud related to immigration laws.  In addition, the Executive Office for Immigration Review maintains a  Fraud and Abuse Prevention Program as a centralized place for anyone to  make complaints about issues of fraud, immigration scams, and the  unauthorized practice of immigration law.   These existing efforts to fight immigration fraud are working. For  example, in San Antonio, Texas, the DOJ charged Eric Jon Alva and his  wife, Jessica Rivas Alva, in a scheme to defraud undocumented  immigrants by falsely claiming to work on behalf of two San Antonio  attorneys. Although they pled guilty and were sentenced to 6 months in  Federal prison, they could have been sentenced up to 5 years, and that  is 5 years under current law.   By contrast, the bill before us today would impose only a 1-year  sentence for similar crimes. In rare circumstances, the defendant may  receive a 3-year sentence.   So the Democrats' response to a problem in the immigrant community is  apparently to go soft on crime and reduce the penalties for immigration  fraud. That doesn't make sense.   We also should not be in the business of complicating the immigration  system, but this bill does just that.   This bill prohibits the unauthorized practice of law specific to  immigration, but the unauthorized practice of law, no matter the type,  is already illegal.   Additionally, by dedicating prosecutors specifically to notario fraud  and creating burdensome requirements for prosecuting this fraud, H.R.  8225 could leave other types of immigration crimes understaffed and  unaddressed.   Mr. Speaker, I truly appreciate the sentiment behind this bill, I  truly do, but if we are going to create a new category of immigration  fraud, we should make it as strong as existing law and work to  simplify, not to complicate, the current system. Immigrants following  the legal system deserve as much.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers at this  time, and I am prepared to close. I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I have concerns that H.R. 8225 will only further  complicate the immigration system and hurt rather than help the very  people it is meant to protect. So with immigrants in mind, I have  concerns with this bill as written.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 2330, the Empowering Olympic,  Paralympic, and Amateur Athletes Act of 2020.   In 2016, we were shaken by the revelations of abuse that permeated  USA Gymnastics and the Olympic community. While the blame for this  abuse falls squarely at the feet of the predator, USA Gymnastics and  the U.S. Olympic & Paralympic Committee also failed the victims.   In 2017, the U.S. Olympic Committee created the U.S. Center for  SafeSport. SafeSport is an independent organization entrusted with  responding to reports of abuse and misconduct within the Olympic  Committee.   S. 2330 supports the work that SafeSport is doing and helps address  the shortcomings in the committee that allowed the abuse to occur. One  of the most important reforms in this bill is a requirement that  athletes serve on the governing bodies that oversee their sports,  ensuring that athletes finally get a seat at the table.   I thank Senator Moran and the other Senators who investigated these  issues and developed these important reforms.   I urge my colleagues to support this important piece of legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I yield back the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am glad that today the House is considering the  Promoting Alzheimer's Awareness to Prevent Elder Abuse Act, which I  introduced with fellow Judiciary Committee member Representative Ted  Deutch.   Elder abuse, which includes financial fraud, physical abuse, and  neglect affects at least 10 percent of senior citizens each year.  Seniors living with Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia are  especially vulnerable to elder abuse.   It is estimated that up to 50 percent of these individuals fall prey  to fraud, exploitation, and other harm. Often seniors suffering from  these conditions have a harder time communicating with first responders  and other professionals, which, in turn, makes it harder to provide  help.   H.R. 6813 will help Americans struggling with Alzheimer's and  dementia by equipping first responders and caregivers with essential  tools to prevent and respond to incidents of elder abuse. Specifically,  this legislation directs the Department of Justice to develop best  practices for assisting professionals, including law enforcement,  emergency personnel, and medical professionals who encounter and  support people living with Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia.    I continue to hear from seniors in southwestern Pennsylvania about  the strain COVID-19 has placed on their lives and the prevalence of  virus-related scams. I hope this bill will alleviate some of those  burdens.   Again, I thank my colleague, Representative Ted Deutch, for working  with me to help stop elder abuse and to protect our Nation's seniors. I  urge my colleagues to support this legislation.   I reserve the balance of my time, Mr. Speaker.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, in closing, I just wanted to again  reiterate what an honor it was to work with my friend and colleague,  Representative Ted Deutch, on this important piece of legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I once again urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R.  6813, and I yield back the balance of my time.
