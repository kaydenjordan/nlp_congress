 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, on Monday, the House will meet at noon for morning-hour  and 2 p.m. for legislative business. Votes will be postponed until 6:30  p.m.   On Tuesday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for morning-hour and noon  for legislative business. Last votes of the week are expected during  the evening hours on Tuesday.   Mr. Speaker, the House will consider a number of suspensions next  week, a complete list of which will be announced by close of business  today.   Mr. Speaker, the House will also continue our work under the  Congressional Review Act to undo onerous Obama administration  regulations through three more joint resolutions. The first, sponsored  by Representative Brett Guthrie, will stop a rule that significantly  expands the Federal Government's involvement in teacher education.                                time  1045    Without our action this could result in fewer teachers serving some  of our  [[Page H959]]  Nation's most vulnerable children, and it could make it harder for  schools to recruit the best teachers. That is the exact opposite of  what Americans want for their children.   The second, sponsored by Representative Todd Rokita, would address  how the accountability provisions of the Every Student Succeeds Act are  being implemented. This bipartisan law empowered States to hold schools  accountable, but somehow, when the regulation came out, there was an  expanded Federal role. This was not what Congress intended nor what is  best for our students.   And the third, Mr. Speaker, sponsored by Representative Liz Cheney,  addresses how the Department of the Interior regulates resource  management plans. These plans guide how BLM manages all Federal lands.  But the rule only addresses how BLM must deal with the public, as well  as State and tribal governments. We are rightfully concerned that there  is no process or procedure for local governments in these new rules.   Finally, my friend may notice that a familiar face is not sitting  next to me today, but Ben Howard is up in the gallery today. After  serving 8 years on Capitol Hill, the last 6 in my office, our friend  Ben has left the job. He is now working in the White House Office of  Legislative Affairs.   Ben was one of the first people we hired when I was elected majority  whip. It was here that most people around the Hill got to know Ben  through his always witty floor updates and always constant Penn State  football commentary. When I was elected majority leader, I asked Ben to  be the floor director, a position in which he has served well for the  past 2-plus years.   My friend would be happy to know that Ben is from Maryland. He was  born and raised and currently resides in Olney with his wife, Amy, and  their two young sons, John and Daniel.   So on behalf of myself, our entire team, and the entire Republican  Conference, I want to thank Ben for his years of service and for his  hard work, and wish him many years of happiness.    I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I am not sure if, in the beginning of your question, you want us to  speed up or slow down, but I thank the gentleman for the question.    I heard your question. Your question asked it both  ways.    Regardless of who won the election, the simple fact is ObamaCare is a  failure. Regardless of who won the election, we would both be sitting  here today having the same conversation about what we would replace it  with.   Let's just simply talk about the facts.   There were 23 co-ops created in ObamaCare. They were given $2  billion. As of today, 18 of them have failed. There are roughly a  little more than 3,000 counties in America; 1,022 of those counties,  roughly one-third, now only have one insurance company. Five States  only have one insurance company, thanks to ObamaCare.   All of America knows the old quotes: if you like your health plan,  you can keep it--we know that is no longer true--or if you like your  doctor, you can keep it--that is no longer true.   When the President said that our premiums would go down by $2,500,  now we know that is not true. So, yes, we would have this discussion  regardless of who won this election. ObamaCare has failed.   So, yes, we are going to work together, just as, after the last  election, I put a letter out to every Governor, Republican or Democrat,  every insurance commissioner, Republican or Democrat, to provide us  with their ideas. We welcome every idea on the other side of the aisle,  too, because we will do this differently. We welcome your ideas as  well.   If you noticed in the Energy and Commerce Committee, they have the  hearing schedule. We will begin, and it will be an open process. We  welcome your participation because we want a system that works, we do  not want a system that has failed, and I believe we have the ideas to  make it work correctly.    I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Since ObamaCare has passed and now that we know what was in it, you  would know that there are 1,400 pages in there that give a great deal,  amount of power to the Secretary of Health and Human Services.  Unfortunately, today, that Secretary has not been confirmed.   That Secretary has not been confirmed simply because of politics. It  is not on my side of the aisle. It is on the Democrats' side of the  aisle over in the Senate.                                time  1100    Do you know how far they have gone? How much do they really want to  work on health care when you actually said it needed to be reformed?  They wouldn't even show up in committee. So how much do they really  care about Americans? They don't even show up in committee to ask the  questions. They wanted to run and hide. So how much do they really want  to work?   If we want to go quote by quote, when we go back to what President  Obama said when the premiums were going to lower by $2,500, what do we  say to Arizona when they went up 116 percent or to Tennessee by 63  percent and then three-quarters of Tennessee counties only have one  provider or to Minnesota by 59 percent or to Oklahoma by 59 percent or  to Alabama, 58, or to Pennsylvania, 53, or to Nebraska, 51?   Can we stop this rhetoric, and can we now get to work? Because I will  tell you this: next month is when we begin because I am hopeful that we  will no longer put up with the political games on the Senate side and  that we will confirm the new Secretary because you have to have a  Secretary in place if you want to reform ObamaCare, because you gave so  much power to the Secretary. We all know that. So let's work together  on behalf of the American people and end this pain.   I will tell you this: the unfortunate reality, in today's system, is  that coverage does not always mean care. The deductibles are so high  that many people don't even go to their doctors. I can tell you that in  States, prior to ObamaCare, their high-risk pools were cheaper then for  their care than now in just buying ObamaCare. We all know it is a  failure. So let's stop playing the political games, and let's put the  people before politics, and let's put a system in that works. Our door  is open, and the committee is open for all ideas. Let's work together  to solve it.    Yes, you do.    I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I listened to the Speaker when he took office, too, and he also said  ``regular order.'' In the schedule for next week, it is not on the  list.   The executive order signed by the President, really, as you know, is  based on legislation that passed this House with overwhelming  bipartisan support. It was following the attacks over the past 2 years.  It was the SAFE Act that passed this House 289-137, and the Visa Waiver  Program Improvement and Terrorist Travel Prevention Act that passed by  407-19. I will point out that these two bills received veto-proof  majorities, and President Obama signed the visa waiver bill into law.   President Trump's actions are temporary pauses and reassess our  vetting procedures to keep our country safe. While there was,  certainly, some confusion with how this was implemented over the  weekend, the Secretary of Homeland Security is effectively addressing  key issues to ensure legal permanent residents who are returning to our  country are allowed entry unless our security services have a  compelling reason to suggest otherwise. America remains a place of  refuge for those seeking peace, freedom, and opportunity across the  world.   Now, my friend knows, because we have been in meetings this week,  that our rhetoric matters. Other people listen to what we say. In these  types of situations, especially with a new administration, I have  always told my children: at any time in a situation, let's take a deep  breath; let's not lose our heads. Especially with a brand new  administration, I try to give them the benefit of the doubt. They don't  have their Cabinet there yet. Let's let them get their footing. It is  not a ban--it is a pause. It is based upon two pieces of legislation  that passed this House.   You love to quote people; so if I may:   ``House Democrats and House Republicans have no greater priority than  keeping Americans safe. This is neither a partisan issue nor is it a  partisan difference. Many Americans are frustrated with the pace of  progress against ISIS in Iraq and Syria. I want to see the  administration and Congress working together to protect our Nation. The  reforms in this bill are an excellent start.   ``This legislation will make it easier for law enforcement to vet  those visitors who are coming from Visa Waiver countries, such as in  Europe, to ensure that we are not admitting those who have traveled to  places like Iraq and Syria and link up with ISIS.''   That was said by you.    So you know the importance.   What I would say to the gentleman is: let's work with this  administration.   As we sat in our meeting this week with leaders of other countries, I  thought their advice to us was good advice: let's not say what this is  not, because we may get political points with one another, but it puts  them in harm's way, and they know what the truth of this is.   I think you and I agree on a lot of different things, and we are  cordial with one another when we disagree, and I think this is an area  in which sometimes we may disagree, but sometimes we have shown we  could agree.                                time  1115    I know you want to keep America safe, and I know we want to keep  America safe.   I also know it is a brand new administration. I also know that when I  go down to that White House--you have been there with me--there is not  a lot of staff there. I know there are going to be a few hiccups along  the way. I am going to work with them. I am going to help them, and I  want you to help us help them as well.    My kids don't tweet.    Mr. Speaker, President Obama said that he was rooting  for President Trump's success.   I would also give the advice, let's not root against him. He still  doesn't have his own Cabinet. When I watched and listened to what some  on the other side of their own leadership say about some there, I could  see where the rhetoric continues to rise. I think we should put that  down. The election is over, and now is the time to govern.   There are big problems out there. We can score as many political  points as we want back and forth, but there are challenges. You and I  have worked together on so many issues out here, from opioids, from the  visa waiver so many different times. And we have disagreed others  times.   I think it would behoove us and the American public that we can show  the leadership to do that, and I look forward to working with you on  these issues.    Mr. Speaker, it is good to have these colloquies back.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the  House adjourns today, it adjourn to meet on Monday, February 6, 2017,  when it shall convene at noon for morning-hour debate and 2 p.m. for  legislative business.
