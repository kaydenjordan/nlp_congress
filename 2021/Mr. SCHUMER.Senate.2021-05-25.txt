 Mr. President, before I begin on the prepared remarks I  have, I note that, this morning, Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Republican  Congresswoman from Georgia, once again, compared preparations taken  against COVID to the Holocaust. These are sickening, reprehensible  comments, and she should stop this vile language immediately.                            ____________________     Mr. President, a year ago today, on another front  equally important, George Floyd was murdered in broad daylight by a  police officer sworn to protect and serve. Our country was forever  changed by the stomach-churning video of Derek Chauvin killing Mr.  Floyd.   It sparked a summer of protest unlike any we have seen in American  history. Around the world, the name of George Floyd was chanted in  Rome, Paris, and London, Amsterdam, Berlin, and Mexico City. As  recently as this weekend, professional soccer players in the British  Premier League knelt before the game in support of the global movement  against racism touched off by George Floyd.   This was not only a fight for justice for one man and his family,  whom I have had the privilege to meet with, but a fight against the  discrimination that Black men and women suffer at the hands of state  power not just here in America but around the globe. It is a fight that  continues today.   Here in the Senate, we will continue that fight when we vote to  confirm the first woman--the first Black woman--to ever lead the  Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, which was created in 1957  as the civil rights movement began to uphold the constitutional rights  of all Americans but particularly the most vulnerable. When it comes to  justice in policing, the criminal justice system, and at the ballot  box, the Civil Rights Division is often the tip of the spear:  conducting investigations of police departments with patterns or  practices of constitutional violations and defending the fundamental  voting rights of every American citizen.   So, in a way, as we continue to pursue strong policing reform  legislation, it is appropriate that we confirm Kristen Clarke--a proven  civil rights leader--to the position of Assistant Attorney General,  where she can continue the fight against bigotry in many ways. It is  appropriate we do it today.   Though my Republican colleagues have tried to twist her words to make  her sound like some radical, Ms. Clarke is, in reality, a hugely  accomplished civil rights attorney who has earned the respect of all  sides. Much like her future colleague at the Justice Department, Vanita  Gupta, Kristen Clarke has been endorsed by a wide range of law  enforcement groups. The truth is, Ms. Clarke will make an exceptional  leader of the Civil Rights Division.   So, again, in a very significant way, as we continue to pursue strong  policing reform legislation, the fight for racial justice by confirming  Kristen Clarke on the anniversary of George Floyd's murder is  particularly poignant and appropriate.   Of course, Congress must also pursue strong legislation to end racial  bias in  [[Page S3386]]  law enforcement. Senators Booker and Scott, as well as Representative  Bass and others, have been working diligently behind the scenes to  fashion such a bill on a bipartisan basis. That important work must  continue as we strive to ensure George Floyd's tragic death will not be  in vain.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on another matter, the Senate continues  to work on the U.S. Innovation and Competition legislation that will  lay the foundation for the next century of American economic  leadership.   I have spoken a lot about the substance of this bill. So, this  morning, I want to reinforce how bipartisan and inclusive this bill is.  It is the product of at least a half a dozen Senate committees, meaning  that nearly every single Member of the Senate has had fingerprints on  this bill in one way or another.   The two pieces of legislation that form the core of the bill--the  Endless Frontier Act and the Strategic Competition Act--passed out of  committee on overwhelmingly bipartisan votes: 24 to 4 in the Commerce  Committee and 21 to 1 in the Foreign Relations Committee. That kind of  bipartisanship--almost unanimous support in multiple Senate  committees--is rare when it comes to major legislation. It goes to show  just how bipartisan this issue is and this legislation is as,  literally, dozens of bipartisan amendments were added to the bill  before it ever reached the floor.   Here on the floor, we are going to continue working through a series  of amendments from both sides. With such a depth of cooperation and  consensus between our two parties, there will be no reason we can't  wrap up this bill this week and achieve a strong result for our  country. Leader McConnell should be welcoming this bipartisanship as we  move forward on the bill.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on a final matter, later today, a group  of Senators will come to the floor to highlight an important issue: DC  statehood.   The District of Columbia has more residents than in Vermont and  Wyoming and has nearly the same number as Delaware, Alaska, and several  other States. They have the same obligations of citizenship. DC  residents pay Federal taxes. They can be summoned for juries. They have  served in every war since the Revolution, but they are all denied real  representation here in Congress.   DC statehood is an idea whose time has come. So I want to thank  Senator Carper for organizing a group of Senators to shine a spotlight  on this issue today.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all votes  after the first be 10 minutes in length, and we are going to try to  stick to it as best we can. So please, Members, we are trying to  finish. We have six votes. We are trying to get them done.    Let's hear it for Rand Paul for passing an amendment  unanimously.                   Amendment No. 1507 to Amendment No. 1502     Madam President, in a moment, I will file cloture on  both  [[Page S3416]]  the substitute amendment of the competition bill and on the motion to  proceed to the House-passed legislation to create an independent  commission to investigate and report on the attack of January 6,  setting up a potential vote this week.   On the competition bill, this legislation is the product of at least  half a dozen Senate committees, working for months--months--in a  bipartisan way. That means that every single Member of the Senate has  had their fingerprints on it in one manner or another.   The Senate has been making great progress so far this week. To borrow  an expression that might appeal to my colleague and partner from  Indiana, Senator Young, we are approaching the final straightaway of  the race. We have completed a very efficient series of votes on six  amendments this afternoon, five of which were sponsored by Republicans.  That is in addition to four amendment votes we have already held and  literally dozens--dozens--of bipartisan amendments that were added to  the bill before it even reached the floor.   This is regular order in action. Members on both sides have clamored  that we bring bills to the floor, debate them, and ask for amendments.  That is what is happening here. This is a bipartisan bill that came out  of committees with overwhelming votes--21 to 1 in Foreign Relations and  22 to 4 in Commerce, with a lot of bipartisan input in both committees  and throughout--and now we are debating it on the floor.   I believe the depth of bipartisanship on this bill reveals two  things: one, just how much of a hunger there is on both sides of the  aisle to tackle the issue of American leadership in the 21st century.  It also shows a hunger to work in a bipartisan way, and we hope that  our colleagues will understand that as we seek now to invoke cloture on  the bill after we do several more amendments.   With the finish line in sight, we need to continue working together  to see this bill through. As I said, we will consider a few more  amendments tomorrow and Thursday, including a managers' amendment,  before final passage. If both sides continue to work in good faith to  schedule amendment votes, which has been the hallmark so far, there is  no reason we can't finish the competition bill by the end of the week.  And we will look for a signal from our Republican friends that, when we  cooperate, we will move forward and not move to block or delay  unnecessarily.   Now, of this bill, again, I cannot say how important it is to the  future of America. Investing in science and innovation has been a  hallmark of why this country has led the world in economic growth, in  good-paying jobs, in creating a brighter, sunnier, happier America. Our  failure to invest could lead to a real decline--a cloudiness over  America and its future. We have to move forward, and that is why this  bill has gotten such great support. This is not a minor bill. Just  because there is not partisan fighting doesn't mean it is not one of  the most important bills we have passed in a very long time, and we  will look back in history and say that this was a moment when America  got a grip back on itself and moved forward after several years of  languishing, at best.                             January 6 Commission    I am also going to move to file cloture on the motion to proceed to  the House-passed legislation to create an independent commission to  investigate and report on the attack of January 6, setting up a  potential vote this week. We all know the commission is an urgent,  necessary idea to safeguard our democracy. What happened on January 6  was a travesty--a travesty. It risked America in ways we haven't seen  in decades, maybe even in our history altogether.   In the wake of January 6, unfortunately, too many Republicans in both  Chambers have been trying to rewrite history and sweep the despicable  attack on our democracy under the rug. If people believe the Big Lie-- if they believe that this election was not on the level, spread by the  Big Lie of Donald Trump and his legions in the press--our democracy  erodes. At the core of this democracy is the belief that we vote; the  process is fair; and then whoever is fairly elected we respect as our  leader. That has not happened for the first time in a long time.   I so respect our two Republican colleagues on the other side of the  aisle who say they will vote for this proposal. I hope many more will.  We have to get it passed. Each Member of the Senate is going to have to  stand up and decide: Are you on the side of truth and accountability or  are you on the side of Donald Trump and the Big Lie?   We cannot let this lie fester. We must get at the truth. We must  restore faith in this grand, wonderful, beautiful, evolving  experiment--the greatest democracy that has ever been seen on Earth. We  can't let that go away. By sweeping all of this under the rug and by  having so many people believe the lies, we could see the Sun begin to  set on America. I hope that doesn't happen. I pray that doesn't happen.  I don't believe it will happen because I believe we will rise to the  occasion and get at the truth.                              Order of Business    Madam President, now I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate  resumes consideration of S. 1260 on Wednesday, May 26, the following  amendments be called up and reported by number: Durbin, 2014; Kennedy,  1710; Sullivan, 1911; further, that at 12 noon tomorrow, Wednesday, May  26, the Senate vote in relation to the Sullivan amendment and at 2:30  in relation to the Durbin and Kennedy amendments, with no amendments in  order to these amendments prior to a vote in relation to the amendment,  with 60 affirmative votes required for the adoption, with the exception  of the Sullivan amendment, and 2 minutes of debate equally divided  prior to each vote.

There being no objection, the Senate, at 8:22 p.m., adjourned until  Wednesday, May 26, 2021, at 10:30 a.m.                            ____________________
