 Mr. Speaker, the resilience of Nevadans,  brave and caring, is in sharp contrast to the murdering of innocent  victims we just witnessed.   Our hearts go out to the families of the victims throughout our  country who were only interested in a peaceful and joyful evening.   One of those was Jennifer Irvine, a young San Diego lawyer who was  killed in the attack. Let's also recognize the heroes, like Tyler  Winston, a San Diegan who saved dozens of victims at the concert by  driving a makeshift ambulance and taking people to the hospital. Every  single life lost to gun violence should elicit sorrow and action.   Mr. Speaker, then why is it so hard for us to talk about this? Why  can't we come together in a bipartisan, bicameral way? Where is the  concern?   We have had too many moments of silence in this Chamber for mass  shootings.   Why are we not moved when people are dying in our districts daily?   The American people send condolences and they deserve action.                            ____________________
