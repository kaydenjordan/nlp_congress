 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  National Clean Energy Week, September 23 through September 27.   Clean energy throughout our world is critical in fighting climate  change and making our world greener and more efficient.   Currently, only a small portion of our total energy consumption in  the U.S. comes from clean energy, and we are going to need more  innovation and a booming economy to continue raising the statistics for  clean energy.   In this regard, Georgia has largely been leading the way. Over the  past 5 years, we have been one of the top ten States in solar power,  all without State tax credits or mandates. 175,000 homes are powered by  solar, an increase of 13-fold over the last 5 years.   I am proud of the State of Georgia's work and hope the rest of the  Nation will follow our lead. However, while we boost our clean energy,  we cannot forget the importance of a consistent, reliable energy  supply, as well as the importance of energy independence to our  homeland security.   While I personally subscribe to an all-of-the-above energy strategy,  I encourage all of my colleagues during this National Clean Energy Week  to honestly discuss these issues in a bipartisan fashion.                            ____________________
