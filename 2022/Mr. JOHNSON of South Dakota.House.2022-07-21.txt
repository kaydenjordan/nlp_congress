 Mr. Speaker, 175 native languages are  spoken in this country today, and they are threatened. Without  preservation efforts, by the year 2050 there will be fewer than 20  spoken.   Now, for best fluency, you really should start language education by  the age of 10. And luckily, that is what Pine Ridge's, Thunder Valley  CDC, and the rural grant initiative are doing. They are using dollars  from the Esther Martinez Native Languages Program, which we have  funded, to teach Lakota to the youngest students. It is incredibly  powerful.   Mr. Speaker, language is the lifeblood of culture, and I am so proud  that these two programs are working hard in South Dakota to preserve  language and culture.                            ____________________
