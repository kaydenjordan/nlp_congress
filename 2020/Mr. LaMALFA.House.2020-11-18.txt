 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the life and  legacy of former Redding Police Department Chief of Police Bob  Blankenship after his passing late last month at the age of 73.   Chief Blankenship started his career at the Redding Police Department  in 1972. After being promoted through the Redding PD ranks, he became  chief of police in 1988. He retired after 30 years of service in 2002.   Chief Blankenship served on the State of California Peace Officer  Standards and Training Commission and was president of the California  Police Chiefs Association.   He was instrumental in developing statewide policies for police  response to domestic violence incidents, and he brought the first  Neighborhood Policing Unit to the area.  [[Page H5927]]    Bob was a genuine public servant who cared about the well-being and  safety of all his Redding residents.   I send my sincerest condolences to his family and all of his  colleagues he served with so many years.                            ____________________
