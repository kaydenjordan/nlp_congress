 Mr. Speaker, the President should not be able to commit  the U.S. recklessly and flagrantly to war. That is the reason there are  constitutionally mandated checks and balances. The President escalated  hostilities with Iran and did not demonstrate any imminent threat nor  strategy as to why.   He clearly did not make our country safer. Quite the opposite. It is  not a sign of strength as some of my colleagues suggest. It was an  unchecked sign of more disarray and lack of strategic thinking.   We have seen what happens when we don't have a plan for what comes  next when we take out a bad actor without thinking through long-term  consequences.   We have lost too much blood and tears and treasure to ever allow that  to happen again. I support, and implore my colleagues to support, this  resolution for the sake and the state of future generations. I love  this country. This is the greatest country in the world because we have  checks and balances.
