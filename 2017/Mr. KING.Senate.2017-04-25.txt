 Mr. President, each year high school student- athletes from across the country compete for their State championship  title. The journey of a championship team is not merely a story of  glory or success, but rather an aggregation of hard work,  sportsmanship, and persistence. Today I wish to extend recognition to a  team in Maine whose perseverance and teamwork have made them a force to  be reckoned with each season. I am proud to highlight the achievements  of the Lewiston High School Blue Devils competition cheerleading team  who, on the path to their third consecutive Class A State title for the  sixth time in the last seven seasons, have demonstrated a remarkable  level of drive, ambition, and pride towards achieving success.   Lewiston High School's nationally recognized and distinguished  competition cheer program has a long history of talent and teamwork  symbolic of the pride felt for the Blue Devils throughout the  community. As the eighth consecutive Class A North/East Regional  Champions, the cheer team has experienced few losses in recent years,  but the program and student-athletes see each challenging loss as an  opportunity to work harder and be stronger. The Blue Devils fulfilled  that promise and more this past season. After a loss in the Kennebec  Valley Athletic Conference, KVAC, the team responded with an impressive  display of discipline and grit when they exceeded expectations and won  the State title with a score of 95--representative of a nearly seamless  routine.   The Lewiston cheer program is much more than a team of exceptional  student-athletes. These talented and aspiring young people have  contributed to a cheer dynasty that inspires young athletes and is  recognized as a premier program throughout the State. The pride felt  for the program, team members, peers, and the Lewiston community at  large shows the level of dedication and ambition that has led to so  many impressive successes.   I wish to join the city of Lewiston and the entire Maine community in  congratulating the Lewiston High School competition cheering team for  their well-earned recognition. The program has built a legacy of  success, instilling core values of hard work, perseverance, and  sportsmanship and imbues all that is significant about participation  and competition in sport at any level. For this and so much more, the  Blue Devils competition cheer team are true champions.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I wish to honor the work of  Tyler Frank and his award-winning company Garbage to Garden--a curbside  composting service that was founded in Portland, ME. In August 2012,  Tyler Frank was living in Portland and wanted to start a compost pile,  but didn't have the space in his urban surroundings. He and his  roommates wondered why they couldn't put compost out on the curb like  they do with their trash and recycling, and with that, Garbage to  Garden was born. Tyler set up a table on Congress Street during a First  Friday Artwalk, and by the end of the day, 17 Portland residents had  signed on to his curbside composting service. Today one in seven  Portland households participates in Garbage to Garden. Tyler and his  partners have expanded their service to eight other Maine communities  and three communities in Massachusetts.   Tyler was able to create a unique and effective composting company,  and with more than 8,000 households, schools, restaurants, and  businesses using their services, they are the most successful curbside  composting company in the country. Tyler has created a sustainable and  local experience. Food scraps are composted by Benson Farms in Gorham,  and all food waste can be incorporated into Garbage to Garden's  compost, due to the high-heat process they use. Garbage to Garden also  collects used cooking oil, and Maine Standard Biofuels turns it into  biofuel and soap, which is then used to wash the composting buckets.  Using clean composting buckets is a key part of Garbage to Garden's  process, eliminating the ``ick factor'' that turns many people off from  composting. Garbage to Garden even offers free service to those who  volunteer for the company or for one of their partner organizations.  Every day, Garbage to Garden diverts 20 tons of food scraps from  landfills, and over a 3-year period, the average household will divert  1 ton of food waste from landfills.   Garbage to Garden is a shining example of what can happen when you  have a little determination, a great idea, and passion to make a  difference. Tyler is an excellent example of a hard-working Mainer who  is making a difference in our State and beyond. I look forward to  following the company's continued growth and remarkable service to  Maine communities. Thank you, Tyler, for all you have already done for  the greater Portland community and our great State of Maine. We are  lucky to have people like you working to better our  communities.                            ____________________
