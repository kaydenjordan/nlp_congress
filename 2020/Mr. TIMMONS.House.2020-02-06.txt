 Mr. Chair, I rise today in strong opposition to the PRO  Act.   Our economy is booming. The unemployment rate is at a record low. The  PRO Act would interfere with this historic progress by adding more  Federal regulations on the very businesses that have been responsible  for this growth.   Employers and businesses could face more than $47 billion in new  annual costs if this bill becomes law. This bill would force employees  to take a public vote on whether they would want to be a part of a  union, a rule that the House Democrats do not even follow themselves.   Democrats even held up the USMCA vote to guarantee the right to a  secret ballot, yet they are depriving the American worker of that same  protection in the PRO Act. Over half of the States in this country have  passed their own right-to-work laws, including my home State of South  Carolina.   The PRO Act would effectively invalidate those laws by forcing  workers to pay union dues in order to keep their jobs. This is a gross  overreach of the Federal Government and something we need less of not  more of throughout this country.   The PRO Act is yet another example of Democratic partisanship and a  flagrant power grab and is, as many other things we have done this  year, not going to get a hearing in the Senate. I urge my colleagues to  vote ``no.''
