 Mr. Speaker, you have heard all of the facts about what  is happening in the Treasury Department. I do not understand, for the  life of me, why there is any elected official who would support  delisting these companies and Deripaska.   We are dealing with the enemy. We are in an investigation. Deripaska  is a criminal. He is closely aligned with Putin. We know everything  about him, and we know that he would benefit from this delisting.   He would retain 45 percent of the shares or the ownership in these  companies. Of course, he will use that to basically pay off the debts  to the bank that he owes.   I don't know why we have Republicans who don't understand this. Where  are they? Why are they not down here defending what they are going to  do with their vote? Why are they not down here explaining why somehow  they are not putting this democracy first?    This is not the first sanction that they are going to try to delist.  Oh, they are coming with another in a few days. It has to do with  Jamaica, and I know all about that. And they are going to keep coming.   We should be implementing sanctions. This is about the invasion and  the attack on Crimea. This is about all of the other atrocities that  have occurred and have been implemented by Putin and the oligarchs of  Russia.   We need to stand up, and we need to say that, yes, we are going to  have sanctions. They are going to be implemented. We are going to make  sure that we don't align ourselves with the people who are undermining  this democracy.   They have hacked into our DNC. They have hacked into our State  electoral systems. And here we have people who are willing to say that  is okay; that is all right; let them continue to do what they do.   The Republicans who did not vote on the Senate side need to be called  out. This is serious business, and I want the Republicans to face up to  it. Don't hide. Come on down here and defend your views.
