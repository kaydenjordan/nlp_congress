 Mr. Speaker, I rise to salute the early educators and  childcare workers who have sacrificed so much for our children and  their parents across the Nation throughout this pandemic.   As a working mom, I know how critical they are to our families and to  our economy. The fact is, had our childcare workers not done their  part, many other essential workers like our nurses, firefighters,  police officers, postal workers, food service and sanitation employees,  and grocery workers could not have done theirs.   The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated what we have known to be true  all along, that our childcare workforce is essential. That is why I was  proud to cast my vote yesterday for the Child Care Is Essential Act.  The House advanced bold legislation to ensure that our childcare  workforce has the support it needs to operate childcare centers safely.   I would like to commend my colleagues, Representatives Rosa DeLauro,   Bobby Scott, and Katherine Clark, for their leadership on this critical  issue.   The fact is, even before the pandemic, enrolling an infant or toddler  in a quality childcare program could be enormously expensive. Frankly,  there was inadequate support to make those programs fit in the  household budgets for many families.  [[Page H3988]]    The GAO found that, on average, just 1 out of every 10 children who  are eligible for Federal childcare subsidies actually received them.  Moreover, 1 in 10 parents have reported being demoted, transferred, or  fired due to childcare problems.   Overall, inadequate childcare costs our economy nearly $60 billion,  annually. Meanwhile, we are leaving money on the table. For every  dollar invested in quality early childhood programs, we get a $7 return  on our investment.   As challenging as it has been over the years for parents to find  affordable childcare, COVID has massively compounded the problem. It  has demanded even more of our childcare workforce, while stretching  budgets to the absolute limit.   In the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, some childcare centers have had  to turn parents away in order to make the necessary public health  accommodations, such as reducing class size. A childcare center in the  city of Lawrence went from serving 715 children pre-COVID to 360, a  nearly 50 percent reduction. What is more, 97 percent of the households  with children in that program were eligible for subsidies.   What is a parent to do when they can't afford to miss work but also  has no childcare support?   It is long past time for America to assist them by investing in  reliable, affordable, high-quality childcare.   Each day we hear praise for our essential workers, and they deserve  every word of it. They have been keeping us safe for months while  risking their own lives. It is obvious that thank-yous will no longer  cut it. The least we can do is guarantee that they aren't left  penniless due to the cost of childcare.   If we are going to show our commitment to workers and to families,  the Child Care Is Essential Act should advance through the upper  Chamber without delay.                            ____________________
