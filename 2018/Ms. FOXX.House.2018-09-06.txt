 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Texas, Mr.  Arrington, for leading this Special Order and yielding me some time.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to share the story of a young American  entrepreneur, Eli Herman, who lives with his parents, Teresa and  Ritchie Herman, on their farm in Alexander County.   I met Eli and his parents at the Alexander County Draft Horse Pulling  Contest recently, where he opened the contest by riding into the arena  with his ponies and the American flag.   It was clear from the beginning of our meeting that Eli is not a  typical 11-year old boy. This young man truly embodies the American  entrepreneurial spirit and exudes patriotism.   At his young age, Eli has big dreams and the self-motivation he needs  to accomplish them. Starting at a very young age, Eli raised his own  calves and was able to earn some money from that endeavor. He made the  decision to use that money to purchase ponies and a wagon.   Now Eli owns 11 ponies, which he shows. He participates in events to  promote American values, and will be participating in the North  Carolina State Fair in October, where I know he will be a big hit.   Eli's long-term dream is, one day, to follow in the footsteps of his  hero, Randy Derrer, the driver of the Wells Fargo stagecoach. He has my  best wishes to achieve that dream, and it is my good fortune to have  met him and his parents and know that they are among the many wonderful  people in the Fifth District of North Carolina that it is my privilege  to represent.
