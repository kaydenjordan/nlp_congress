 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of USMCA.   This trade agreement is a win for Minnesota's family farmers and  small business owners. It protects American workers and creates  certainty and new opportunity moving forward with our largest trading  partners.   I have walked on farms across my district with the families who feed,  clothe, and fuel this country. One thing is clear: Years of tough  prices, severe weather, and trade issues have taken their toll. They  need this trade agreement now.   I am proud to have worked to eliminate the handouts to Big Pharma  from the original draft. My commitment is to work with this  administration when it benefits our community and stand up to them when  it doesn't.   This is a good deal for American farmers, workers, and businesses. I  urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this important trade agreement.    Mr. Speaker, today I congratulate my son Jonas, who  graduates tomorrow from North Dakota State University's College of  Agriculture and Applied Science.   When Jonas was in high school, he took postsecondary education  classes at Inver Hills Community College, allowing him to graduate with  a degree in natural resources management from NDSU in 3\1/2\ years.   I have four sons, and Jonas has always been the peacekeeper. He got  into less--well, actually, no trouble that I know of in high school,  and he is such a loyal friend that he went to college with his three  best friends.   Of course, I didn't want Jonas to leave Minnesota for college, but he  decided that Minnesota just wasn't cold enough for him, so he moved to  Fargo. Now that he is done tomorrow, I couldn't be happier to welcome  him back home to Minnesota.   Congratulations, Jonas.                            ____________________
