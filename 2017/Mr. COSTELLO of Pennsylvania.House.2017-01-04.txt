 Mr. Speaker, it is important the  Federal Government convey to taxpayers how it is spending their hard- earned money. That is why I rise in support of H.R. 71, the Taxpayers  Right-To-Know Act.   For Federal programs authorized to spend over $1 million, this  bipartisan bill would make more information available and accessible  online so that taxpayers may see where their money is being spent and  how the program is performing. For each Federal program meeting these  requirements, the government would need to make public several key  pieces of information that are of interest to many of my constituents,  including funding levels for the program, Federal laws that authorize  the program, regulations related to the program, the results of  performance reviews that measure the program's effectiveness, and any  overlap of the program with another Federal program.   Simply put, this bill would help alleviate waste and prevent taxpayer  dollars from being spent on unnecessary, ineffective, or duplicative  programs.   I thank Congressman Tim Walberg and Congressman Jim Cooper for their  continued leadership on this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, this bill did pass the House without any objection in  the last session, and I would, once again, urge my colleagues to  support this commonsense bill.  [[Page H65]]
