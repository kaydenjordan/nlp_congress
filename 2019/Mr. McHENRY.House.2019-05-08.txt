 Mr. Speaker, I stand to recognize the long career and  service of Clinton Columbus Jones, the dean of the Republican Financial  Services Committee staff. Clinton has been on the Hill for over 23  years, and he is leaving to join the Federal Housing Finance Agency.   A native of both Kansas and my home State of North Carolina, Clinton  first came to Capitol Hill in 1993, after earning an urban planning  degree and then a law degree from the University of North Carolina at  Chapel Hill.   While I don't agree with his choice of university, he is a fine and  upstanding human being who has had a fantastic career on the Hill. He  has served under seven different full committee chairmen on the  Financial Services Committee, eight Republican Housing Subcommittee  chairmen or ranking members, and has helped draft some of the most  important housing and insurance bills of this generation, including the  Quality Housing and Work Responsibility Act of 1998, the Housing  Opportunity Through Modernization Act of 2016, and the Biggert-Waters  Flood Insurance Reform and Modernization Act of 2012.   In addition to his work on the Hill, Clinton has taught prelaw at  Howard University for over 20 years and is a single father to a  wonderful 15-year-old son and great student, Clinton Beamon Jones IV.   We hate to see him go, but we thank him for his service, not just to  this institution, but to the American people. We cherish his friendship  and the knowledge he has imparted.   With that, I ask my colleagues to give a moment of recognition to  Clinton Jones.                            ____________________
