 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues from Wisconsin and  Arizona. It is an honor to stand here as fellow marines in support of  this bill today.   Today is a big day. It is a milestone in a journey that we started  over a year ago. We are taking a major legislative step in the  direction of creating a memorial honoring those who have served on  Active Duty during the global war on terrorism.   For many, like my colleagues, this bill is personal. None of us will  forget where we were on September 11, 2001, and we all continue to live  with the aftermath of that tragic day in American history.   It is important to note that the tragic events of 9/11 and the war on  terror to follow did not leave us isolated and afraid as a nation.  Rather, in true American fashion, they inspired an entire generation to  come together and serve.   So many young men and women selflessly answered the call to serve  their country in the wake of that tragedy, and I would like to share  just one story with you about someone from my district who would be on  this memorial.   Captain Jennifer Harris lived in the town of Swampscott. She was a  graduate of the United States Naval Academy, and, sadly, became the  first Massachusetts woman killed in the Iraq war.   Jennifer was the epitome of leadership and sacrifice. On flying  missions, she had the call sign ``The Dove.'' She would often be called  to evacuate our wounded soldiers and marines from the battlefield.   Captain Harris' final mission was to transport blood supplies. She  willingly volunteered for it even though she was only just days away  from returning home. In fact, she was initially told:         No. You are too close to leaving. Don't go.    But she said:         I want to fly one more time.    Her superiors reluctantly agreed. Captain Harris died on February 7,  along with six other crew members after insurgents shot down her  helicopter.   In her twenties, with a bright future ahead of her, Captain Harris  was on her third tour of duty in Iraq.   I can't help but think today of my grandfather, a World War II  veteran. He never got to see the WWII Memorial in his lifetime. He was  never afforded the opportunity to have some place to take his family to  reflect on his time in the service or remember his colleagues who did  not have the opportunity to come home.   Let's not let that history repeat itself. The men and women who have  given their all in the war on terror should be afforded a place on the  National Mall where their loved ones can pay respects and honor their  sacrifice.   Passage of this bill is an important first step in seeing this  memorial built in our lifetime.   Let's get this done for Captain Jennifer Harris and the thousands of  others like her who have made the ultimate sacrifice for our country.   Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Rothfus).
