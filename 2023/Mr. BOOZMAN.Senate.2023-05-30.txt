 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and  celebrate Arkansas Game and Fish Commission Chairman Bobby Martin, who  has dedicated years of service to the preservation and conservation of  our natural resources.   In 2016, Governor Asa Hutchinson appointed Bobby to the Arkansas Game  and Fish Commission, and since then, he has exemplified the very  essence of public service, devoting himself to the noble cause of  conservation. From a young age, Bobby enjoyed outdoor recreation. He  became an avid outdoorsman from his first years duck hunting with his  father near Wynne, which helped him become a lifelong, passionate  conservationist with deep knowledge and appreciation for the natural  resources throughout our State.   During his tenure at the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission, his hard  [[Page S1786]]  work and vision have paved the way for significant advancements in the  protection and management of our State's rich wildlife and natural  habitats. Under his guidance and vision, the commission has flourished,  becoming a beacon of excellence and innovation in the field of  conservation.   Bobby has been a leader in State and national conservation work,  including helping Congress pass the landmark America's Conservation  Enhancement Act to safeguard wildlife and ecosystems. He was  instrumental in building the coalitions critical to advancing this  legislation and protecting our natural resources for future generations  to enjoy. He also helped develop the concept and plans for a highly  successful shooting sports complex in Jacksonville.   His contributions have also been invaluable in communicating the  Arkansas Game and Fish Commission's priorities so our congressional  delegation could support its efforts with Federal Agencies. He has  illustrated and led through example the importance of building  consensus and working together for a common goal. His commitment to  environmental education and outreach programs has fostered a sense of  stewardship among Arkansans of all ages through initiatives such as  promoting shooting sports in schools.   I am so pleased that Bobby has used his leadership skills for public  service. He is acknowledged as one of the most influential people in  the retail community and has used those skills to think outside the box  regarding the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission, making sure the agency  evolves and keeps pace with an ever-changing public demand. Bobby has  demonstrated that ability in the business world and the conservation  community has benefited immensely as he has used his deep knowledge,  passion, and experience on its behalf.   He demonstrates what it means to go above and beyond in his role. His  time as chairman is esteemed across The Natural State for his tireless  work to preserve Arkansas's beautiful natural scenery and wildlife. As  we recognize Bobby's years of service and dedication to conservation  and celebrate his vision protect and enhance our beautiful State for  future generations, I thank him for his dedication and service to  Arkansas and wish him the best for years to come.                            ____________________
