 Mr. President, today Tennesseans are mourning  the loss of one of our most faithful public servants. On March 20,  Williamson County District Attorney General Kim Helper passed away  after a brief illness, leaving behind a legacy that prioritized family,  community, and the pursuit of justice.   Before she died, Kim dedicated her life to the practice of law. She  worked for the Volunteer State for 25 years, rising through the ranks  at the State attorney general's office before her 2008 appointment to  the position of district attorney general for the 21st Judicial  District. The people of Tennessee were so pleased with the work she was  doing that they elected her to the post three times, most recently last  year.   When she wasn't doing her part to keep her community safe, Kim spent  time improving it alongside the other members of St. Paul's Episcopal  Church, Lodge No. 41 of the Fraternal Order of Police, the Keep  Tennessee  [[Page S996]]  Beautiful Advisory Board, the Williamson County Republican Career  Women, the Leadership Franklin Alumni Association, the Tennessee Bar  Association, and Beta Sigma Phi Sorority. One can only imagine the  heroic effort it took to work through all the obligations on her  calendar, but that was the way Kim liked it. She will be dearly missed  by all those who benefited from her knowledge and expertise; but in  addition to being a model leader, Kim was also an excellent teacher. I  look forward to seeing the young professionals she mentored fill the  considerable space she has left behind. If they are anything like Kim,  we can expect them to do the job with gusto.   On behalf of all Tennesseans, I offer condolences to Kim's husband  Gerry, her daughters Abby and Renee, and her many friends and ask my  colleagues to pray that the memory of this happiest of warriors will  serve as a source of comfort for all who loved her.                            ____________________
