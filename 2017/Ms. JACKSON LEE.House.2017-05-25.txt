 Mr. Chair, I thank the distinguished ranking member  for yielding.   I thank the chairman of this committee and the manager of this bill,  and, particularly, I want to express my appreciation to the bipartisan  co-sponsors of this legislation--the gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs.  Brooks), the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Frankel)--for coming  together around a concept of continuing to work to protect our  children; and where we can find bipartisanship, that is really very  special as relates to the message to the American people.   The Protecting Young Victims from Sexual Abuse Act requires that  personnel and employees of national governing bodies recognized by the  U.S. Olympic Committee report suspected incidents of child abuse,  including sexual abuse, to law enforcement. The importance of this is  to cease, end, stop, never have it again for those victims--never  report or hold it for years and years--who are impacted psychologically  and impacted for the rest of their life. Really, that is what has been  happening in years past.   This bill is intended to protect young athletes who, with great  expectation and excitement and challenge and wonderment and aspirations  for the Olympics, in their early years, desire to serve their Nation;  because when they put their bodies through this rigorous engagement in  sport day after day, week after week, month after month, hour after  hour, minute after minute, second after second, and deny themselves  other extracurricular activities, they do it for the passion of the  sport, for their recognition of excellence, but also to go to the  Olympics and make their Nation proud.                                time  0945    And so what we have put them through with respect to not protecting  them against sexual assaults severely undermines, again, and  irreparably harms them. With H.R. 1973, we have an opportunity to  ensure that that never happens again.   The need for this legislation is best illustrated by the ongoing  scandal of  [[Page H4578]]  widespread abuse and exploitation of young gymnasts over the course of  20 years within USA Gymnastics--a prominent governing body of the U.S.  Olympic Committee--in particular, by a physician starting back in 1997  who engaged in such activities.   Allegations against him were not reported to law enforcement until  recently; and following the first public complaint against him in 2015,  more than 100 women filed complaints accusing him of sexual abuse, and  he now faces more than 20 criminal charges in Federal and State courts.   Again, this legislation is to turn the light on those who have  quietly abused these young men and women and, as well, done it with  impunity because no vehicle was provided for these young people to be  able to ensure that they would not be assaulted again.   The integrity that we bring to this process with this legislation,  the comfort that we give to families and parents when they entrust  their children to those who are coaches, doctors, leaders of teams,  sponsors of teams is vitally important. And the protections of this  bill, of reporting and ensuring that the light continues to stay on and  the darkness never comes for that young athlete who seeks that golden  platform or that first place or second place or third place, or even to  participate, that they can do it with the affirmation that the Nation  believes in their protection and their security and that they should  never, never, never face this alone.   I rise to support the legislation, H.R. 1973, and I ask my colleagues  to support this legislation.    Mr. Chair, I am pleased to join the gentleman from  Louisiana and the ranking member from Michigan in support of this  amendment. I think it has an underlying premise that we should all  celebrate and attempt to ensure that it is in place.   I, too, agree that I look forward to reconciling the House and Senate  bill, but the amendment specifically addresses the provisions in the  bill concerning one-on-one interactions between young athletes and the  adults who they work with; and I believe the clear understanding that  we all hope can be implemented is that we don't have one-on-one  interactions without overall supervision or other kids or other adult  participants so that we do not create an atmosphere where a child can  be intimidated or abused.   Under the proposed change, national governing bodies will be required  to institute and enforce reasonable procedures designed to avoid one- on-one interactions between young athletes and their coaches,  instructors, and doctors that cannot be observed or interrupted by  another adult.   First of all, we know that the expanse of sports is expanding. There  are so many new sports, so many new opportunities for adults, many  committed and dedicated adults, but the real issue is: Let's protect  the children.   Mr. Chair, I rise to support the Goodlatte amendment.                                time  1000     I thank the gentleman from Louisiana for his  courtesies. I want to enthusiastically congratulate and thank the  gentlemen and gentlewoman from Arizona for responding to their  constituents and answering a question positively about protecting our  young people.   I spoke earlier today about what happens with young people and their  aspirations when they engage in sports. They want to win, but they also  want to, if you will, to impress adults and to show that they can do  the very best that they can do.   So I want to congratulate them for this amendment that advances the  purposes and goals of protecting young victims from sexual abuse by  requiring the national governing bodies to include resources and  information regarding sexual assault and having sexual assault hotlines  and other victim support services on their websites.   With this new technology, it will be at their fingertips. They don't  have to, in essence, expose themselves. They can get this information  and readily access the very people that will help them.   So I want to congratulate the manager, Mr. Conyers, and, of course,  the chairman of the committee and the proponents of the underlying  bill. I want to congratulate Mr. O'Halleran. His efforts here are to be  commended, and I thank him for this insightful amendment to the  legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the opponents and proponents of  this legislation because they have said much the same thing.   H.R. 1761 is a bill that stands against everything we stand against.  It is for protecting against child exploitation, and we all agree with  that. We agree, as well, that the bill has existing mandatory minimums  and the attempt of the proponent of this bill to ensure that the  decision that occurred in Palomino would not occur again.   Some clarification has occurred, and that is that the bill, or the  law, now, with H.R. 1761 explicitly prohibits the creation of a visual  depiction or live transmission of a minor engaged in sexually explicit  conduct. That is, of course, a meritorious and unanimously supported  position. The mandatory minimums continue and also are added to, now, a  number of other offenses. As have been indicated, those offenses can be  upwards of 20 years, and they can be for a variety of offenses added  under this bill.   So the bill is well intended, and the initial prohibition could draw  support in a bipartisan manner, but the continued adding of offenses to  mandatory minimums rather than language that would have left the  sentencing to the discretion of the Federal court--which, by the way,  many Federal judges have come to this Congress and to the Committee on  the Judiciary to ask for and indicate the value of discretion as  relates to their sentencing. This is not a death penalty case, so,  clearly, the discretion of the court and the wisdom of the court could  be utilized for the appropriate new offenses and the appropriate  sentencing.   So while the bill is well intended, it is overbroad in scope and will  punish the very people it indicates it is designed to protect: our  children. H.R. 1761 would expand and modify the meaning of sexual  exploitation of children, thereby granting new offenses that may be  prosecuted under section 2251 of the Federal criminal code, which  generally prohibits the production of child pornography.   As indicated, it works to fix the Fourth Circuit decision in  Palomino, which reversed the defendant's conviction because the  decision was that there was no proof of intent. The structure of the  statute, however, would significantly be modified by H.R. 1761,  separating section 2251(a) into five enumerated offenses, codified as  2251(a)(1) through (5). Based on the language in this bill, to  criminalize the knowing consent of the visual depiction or live  transmission of a minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct, a  teenager sexting another teenager could be swept up under the statutory  power of this new measure.   Research shows that 91 percent of teenagers, tweens, have access to  the internet and/or a smartphone. Hence, given the rampant advancement  in technology and, consequently, its usage among this demographic, we  must exercise prudence when introducing legislation that is seemingly  ignorant of the growing trend of communication among teenagers.   H.R. 1761 ignores the life-altering impact it would have on our  juveniles who engage in otherwise stupid and immature behaviors and, in  most cases, consensually explicit sexual conduct if we begin to  criminalize such conduct. While this bill seeks to protect minors--and  I congratulate the proponent for that intent--in the same vein, it  drastically alters the penalty for minors who may face mandatory  minimums in sentencing, and, therefore, it is flawed in its design and  intended purpose.   Let me be very clear: Legislators have very good intentions, but we  cannot stand on the floor and guarantee how it will be interpreted. We  cannot guarantee that one teenager will not be caught up in this new  legislation. Court interpretation, prosecutors' interpretation, all  that will be subjected to mandatory minimums, which is in the  underlying bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to consider these  concerns.   I heard the gentleman speak of his effort to ensure that the internet  provider would have to show intent or have intentionally engaged.   Again, the interpretation of these bills are subject to  interpretation, and the clearer we can be here on the floor of the  House, the more we can be appropriate in its application.   My point is, in concluding, I hope we will ultimately have  legislation that comes back to the floor of the House that we all may  be able to join in and that the elements that do not impact and protect  our teenagers will be eliminated and we can be assured that internet  providers are protected as well.     Madam Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Speaker, I associate myself with the words of  the ranking member, Mr. Conyers.   I look forward to strengthening these laws and, as well, working on  legislation to continue to protect our children, our innocent children,  from sexual abuse, sexual assault, and the devastation that it has on  their lives.   So I rise to continue that theme and to indicate, as I said earlier,  that some of the clarifications in the underlying bill are important,  and important to clarify, and important to provide prohibitions that  will be clear in possible further court interpretations. But I maintain  that we cannot predict the court interpretations, and the better and  clearer that we are to protect our children, I believe, is a route that  we should take.   The bill would add new classes of offenses. But section 2251 does not  provide for Romeo and Juliet exceptions; i.e., the penalties apply even  when conduct is consensual and when the victim and offender are close  in age. For example, a 19-year-old and a 17-year-old who videotaped  themselves engaged in a sexual act, then emailed the video to their own  email accounts, the 19-year-old would be subject to mandatory minimums.  That is the basis of the amendment, the Jackson Lee amendment.   The Jackson Lee amendment is a Romeo and Juliet exception. The  amendment is a reasonable approach to treatment of adolescent behavior  that should not be left to prosecutors. The pervasiveness of personal  technology, such as cell phones and tablets, have given rise to teenage  sexting. Research has shown that teenage sexting is widespread, even  among middle school-age youth.   Under section 2251, teenagers prosecuted for talking and sending  messages, and then taking and sending messages, would be subject to  mandatory prison sentences of at least 15 years and sex offender  registration.   In light of the recent troubling statements by Attorney General  Sessions, Congress should provide an alternative to existing mandatory  penalties in sexting cases, particularly with juveniles. We cannot say  that a juvenile will not be prosecuted federally. They could be, under  this particular statute.   So this is a carve-out, a Romeo and Juliet carve-out, to ensure that  it does not happen, to protect against the possibility of it happening.   A study conducted by Drexel University found that more than half of  the undergraduate students who took part in an online survey said they  had sexted when they were teenagers, and 30 percent said that they  included photos in that message, meaning that they had sent sexual  texts.   Therefore, I ask that my colleagues come together and support the  Jackson Lee amendment for a Romeo and Juliet carve-out.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, let me quickly say that I respect the  [[Page H4588]]  gentleman, but I take great issue in calling a Member's amendment, or  the analysis of that amendment, ridiculous, because it is not  ridiculous. It is an extremely reasonable amendment. And unless he has  some powers that I am not aware of, no one can predict when a  prosecutor will determine that they will prosecute. We cannot. We pass  criminal justice laws every day and cannot predict.    Whether or not it is based upon the Sessions memo, which as far as  anyone who can read knows that we are going back to a stricter  enforcement of everything criminal against everyone. That is clear.   The Jackson Lee amendment recognizes that not all sex offenses are  the same. And currently, section 2251 is a one-size-fits-all sentencing  scheme. It fits all, even a 19-year-old.   The Jackson Lee amendment would provide a better alternative.  Punishment will be available involving offenses. When defendants are no  more than 19 years old, they would have other alternatives. The judge  would have discretion. That is simply what we are asking for.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record an article entitled, ``Keep  Mandatory Minimums Out of the Juvenile Justice System.'' This bill does  not do that; and I also include an article entitled, ``Teenage Sexting  is Not Child Porn.''                              [June 16, 2014]     OP-ED: Keep Mandatory Minimums Out of the Juvenile Justice System                             (By Lizzie Buchen)         Across the country, mandatory minimum sentences are falling       out of favor. From Sen. Rand Paul to Attorney General Eric       Holder, people from both ends of the political spectrum are       blaming these harsh and punitive sentences for driving our       skyrocketing incarceration rates and exacerbating racial       disparities in the criminal justice system. But in this era       of smart sentencing reform--particularly toward young       people--a disturbing piece of legislation is coasting through       the California legislature, threatening to wrench the state       in the opposite direction. Senate Bill 838, authored by state       Sen. Jim Beall (D-Santa Clara), would break new ground by       establishing the first mandatory minimum sentences in the       state's juvenile justice system.        The juvenile justice system was founded on the       understanding that young people who commit offenses are often       struggling in situations outside of their control, are highly       amenable to rehabilitation and have the potential to lead       productive and law-abiding lives. Mandatory minimum sentences       automatic sentences of incarceration or confinement, meted       out regardless of the facts of the case are completely at       odds with these foundational principles. They are determined       not by the youth's past circumstances or potential life       ahead, but by what he or she has done. The only result is       punishment, a sharp contrast to the rehabilitative ideals of       the juvenile justice system.        Mandatory minimum sentences are completely incompatible       with how juvenile court works. When a youth has committed an       offense, juvenile court judges tailor sanctions to best meet       a youth's unique needs for rehabilitation by weighing a       comprehensive set of factors, including the severity of the       crime, the statement of the victims, and the circumstances of       the youth's life--including mental health issues and       experience with abuse, homelessness and extreme poverty. The       judge then chooses from a wide range of community-based and       residential options, allowing him or her to tailor the       sanction to best treat the youth and protect the community.       In line with this focus on rehabilitation, the sentences are       indeterminate, with terms based on the youth's progress.        Proponents of mandatory minimum sentences, including       supporters of California's youth mandatory minimum bill,       claim that these sentences deter crime. But the evidence       tells us this is a dubious notion at best. Although this bill       would introduce the first mandatory minimum sentences in       California's juvenile justice system, such sentences have       been in place in the adult system for decades--and are widely       recognized as failures. A large and growing body of research       has found that mandatory minimum sentences have come at       enormous social, financial and human costs, with little       benefit to public safety. There is no evidence that these       sentences have a significant deterrent effect. If anything,       these harsh punishments are counterproductive, putting the       public at risk by disrupting families, impoverishing       communities of human capital, making it more difficult for       people to return to law-abiding society and diverting       precious public resources away from social services and       toward costly incarceration.                                   ____                   [From the New York Times, Apr. 4, 2016]                     Teenage Sexting Is Not Child Porn                          (By Amy Adele Hasinoff)         Teenagers who sext are in a precarious legal position.       Though in most states teenagers who are close in age can       legally have consensual sex, if they create and share       sexually explicit images of themselves, they are technically       producing, distributing or possessing child pornography. The       laws that cover this situation, passed decades ago, were       meant to apply to adults who exploited children and require       those convicted under them to register as sex offenders.        Though most prosecutors do not use these laws against       consensual teenage sexters, some do. The University of New       Hampshire's Crimes Against Children Research Center estimates       that 7 percent of people arrested on suspicion of child       pornography production in 2009 were teenagers who shared       images with peers consensually.        Almost two dozen states, including New York, Illinois and       Florida, have tried to solve the legal problems that surround       sexting with new legislation, and others, like Colorado, are       considering new sexting laws. These reforms typically give       prosecutors the discretion to choose between child-      pornography felony charges or lesser penalties like       misdemeanor charges or a mandatory educational program.        These new laws may seem like a measured solution to the       problem of charging teenage sexters with child pornography       felonies. However, once they have the option of lesser       penalties, prosecutors are more likely to press charges--not       only against teenagers who distribute private images without       permission, but also against those who sext consensually.        Given the extensive research that shows that young people       who are nonwhite, low income, gay or transgender are       disproportionately prosecuted for many crimes, there is good       reason to suspect that laws that criminalize teenage sexting       are being unfairly applied as well. As legislators have tried       to cope with the legal fallout, they have also opened up more       types of images to scrutiny: While child pornography laws       apply only to sexually explicit images, many new sexting laws       criminalize all nude images of teenagers, including photos of       topless teenage girls.        A better solution would be to bring child pornography laws       in line with statutory rape laws by exempting teenagers who       are close in age and who consensually create, share or       receive sexual images. Vermont tried to enact major reform to       its child pornography laws in 2009, but abandoned the effort       after a national backlash and settled instead on a new       misdemeanor law.        In February, New Mexico passed a limited version of child       pornography reform, which shields teenagers who receive a       sexual image from a peer from facing child-pornography       possession charges. Teenagers who create or share sexual       images can still be convicted of child pornography production       or distribution.        Both existing child pornography laws and new sexting-      specific laws criminalize a common behavior among teenagers.       Studies have shown that roughly one-third of 16- and 17-year-      olds share suggestive images on their cellphones. Among young       adults, rates are above 50 percent. In the past, partners       wrote love letters, sent suggestive Polaroids and had phone       sex. Today, for better or worse, this kind of interpersonal       sexual communication also occurs in a digital format. And       it's not just young people: An article in an AARP magazine       describes sexting as ``fun, easy and usually harmless.''        Like any sexual act, consensual sexting is somewhat risky       and requires trust, but it is not inherently harmful as long       as partners respect each other's privacy and are attentive to       consent. Studies have found that around 3 percent of       Americans report that someone has distributed private sexual       images without their permission, and around 10 percent of       sexters report negative consequences. The risk of       distribution is significantly higher among those who were       coerced into sexting.        The victim of a sexual privacy violation can be traumatized       and humiliated, and is often blamed for his or her       victimization. Unfortunately, the criminalization of sexting       worsens this problem because teenagers know that if they       report the incident they may be punished at school and       possibly charged with the same offense as the perpetrator. In       most jurisdictions, distributing a sexual image of a teenager       is illegal, regardless of whether one is consensually sending       a nude selfie to a partner or maliciously distributing a       private photo of another person without permission.        Though some people believe that prohibiting sexting       discourages the practice and protects teenagers from harm,       research on abstinence-only sex education demonstrates that       those policies actually increase unwanted pregnancies and       sexually transmitted infections. Abstinence-only messages       about sexting are likely to be counterproductive as well.        What parents and educators need to do instead is help young       people learn how to navigate sexual risk and trust. Whether       or not it is criminalized, we cannot prevent sexting, just as       we cannot prevent teenagers from having sex. What we need to       focus on is preventing acts of sexual violation, like the       distribution of a private image without permission,       pressuring a partner to sext or sending a sexual image to an       unwilling recipient. Though not all teenagers are sexting,       those who are (and those who will when they are older) need       to learn how to practice safer sexting, which means that it       always has to be consensual.        As State Senator George Munoz, a prominent supporter of the       amendment that established New Mexico's new sexting regime,       told  [[Page H4589]]       The Guardian, ``Our laws have to change with technology.'' To       keep up with those changes, the first step is to       decriminalize consensual sexting by creating exceptions in       child pornography laws for teenagers who are close in age.        Once we do this, we can concentrate on developing better       ways to deal with the new digital forms of harm.     Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support the  Jackson Lee amendment.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak about my amendment to H.R. 1761,  ``Protecting Against Child Exploitation Act.''   As Ranking Member of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, I  offer this amendment to help make H.R. 1761 a better bill to achieve  its intended purpose.   Though troubled by any sexually explicit activity that may exploit  and otherwise, harm our children, I believe that H.R. 1761, the  ``Protecting Against Child Exploitation Act,'' is deadly and  counterproductive to ensuring protection of our youth population in our  new technology era.   This bill will exacerbate overwhelming concerns with the unfair and  unjust mandatory minimum sentencing that contributes to the over- criminalization of juveniles and mass incarceration generally.   Simply put, this bill will add to the already tragic realities of  many juveniles. Rather than proceeding with the caution befitting an  expansion of the mandatory sentencing penalty, H.R. 1761 is being  rushed to the House Floor, without a single hearing and without the  opportunity to consider amendments directly relevant to whether our  system of criminalizing juveniles for sexting is fair, just, and sound  policy.   Though presented as a proposal to protect children, H.R. 1761  excessively penalizes juveniles and creates life altering criminal  charges when engaged in `sexting'.   Rather, it raises new constitutional concerns; and it does not  address documented and systemic unfairness and racial disparity in the  imposition of mandatory sentencing and its overbroad sweep of  criminalizing juveniles.   My amendment fixes that problem. It creates an alternative punishment  (not more than one year of imprisonment) under section 2251 for  teenagers who participate in ``sexting'' and might otherwise be subject  to mandatory minimum sentences of at least 15 years in prison.   The Jackson Lee is a thoughtful, narrowly-drawn provision that  provides judges with a sensible sentencing option for teenagers no more  than 19 years old who participate in sexting that may be applied in the  judges' discretion, in appropriate cases.   The Jackson Lee amendment is a reasonable approach to treatment of  adolescent behavior that should not be left to prosecutors. The  pervasiveness of personal technology, such as cellphones and tablets,  has given rise to teenage ``sexting.'' Research has shown that teenage  sexting is widespread, even among middle school-aged youth. Under  section 2251, teenagers prosecuted for taking and sending such messages  would be subject to mandatory prison sentences of at least 15 years and  sex offender registration. In light of the recent troubling statements  made by Attorney General Sessions, Congress should provide an  alternative to existing mandatory minimum penalties in ``sexting''  cases.   A study conducted by Drexel University found that more than half of  the undergraduate students who took part in an online survey said that  they sexted when they were teenagers. Thirty percent said they included  photos in their messages and 61 percent did not know that sending nude  photos via text could be considered child pornography. Another online  survey published in 2008 found that almost 40 percent of teenagers  between ages 13 and 19 had sent ``sext'' messages, almost 50 percent  had received a sext message, and 20 percent posted nude or semi-nude  content online.   The Jackson Lee amendment recognizes that not all sex offenses are  the same. Currently, section 2251 employs a one-size-fits-all  sentencing scheme. Under section 2251, a 19 year-old, who engages in  ``sexting'' (sending or receiving a sexually explicit photo or video of  a minor) with a willing, 17 year-old girlfriend or boyfriend, would be  subject to the same mandatory minimum sentence as a 50 year-old man,  who engages in the same conduct with a 17 year-old.   The Jackson Lee amendment would provide a better alternative. The  alternative punishment would be available in prosecutions involving  offenses under section 2251(a)(2) or 2251(a)(3), when the defendant is  no more than 19 years old, the difference in age between the defendant  and victim is no more than four years, and the sexually explicit  conduct depicted in the photo or video was consensual. Judges would not  be required to sentence teenagers pursuant to the alternative  punishment.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Conyers).    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to go home and join my  community in honoring the fallen as we come together and say thank you.  But as I go home, as well, I will be visiting with so many constituents  who will be asking the question: Why?   This week in the Budget Committee, a very callous statement by the  OMB Director about diabetes victims or individuals who have that  disease who are sitting on their couch and eating nonnutritious food,  because the budget that the President has offered wants to take 23  million people off of healthcare, take $880 billion away from seniors  who are in nursing homes who need Medicaid, and shutting down the Meals  on Wheels. That is inhumane and cruel.   At the same time, they will be asking me about the ridiculous, if you  will, actions of the President firing the FBI Director because he was  involved in the Russian investigation, asking the National Security  Agency Director to block or to avoid talking about Russian collusion,  and the National Intelligence Director asking him to cover up such  things.   I believe now it is time for an impeachment inquiry that goes along  with the other investigations, along with the U.S. commission, along  with the legislation on the special prosecutor because a special  counsel can be fired. Our constituents are asking for the truth, and we  need to give the truth.
