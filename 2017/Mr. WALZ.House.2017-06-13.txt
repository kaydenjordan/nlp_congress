 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I would like to associate myself with the chairman's remarks,  especially the thanks of all the people involved in this. I think, Mr.  Speaker, this is the third time we have come to this body this  Congress, as the chairman and the ranking member of the VA Committee,  as fellow veterans, as friends and American citizens, on issues of  utmost importance to our veterans. We do have a constituency. We do  have a special interest group that we look out for: America's veterans.   Those 18 groups, plus millions of Americans across this country,  their collective voices through their organizations, through the  Disabled American Veterans, through The American Legion, articulate  every Congress in front of us what their top priorities are. This year,  they came in front of us and said the three things that Congress needs  to get done, needs to get right, and needs to get moving as soon as  possible in this 2-year period that we have is: appeals reform, choice  extension of care in the community, and an accountability bill.   Well, I am proud to say this is the third of those three. The other  two have moved here in a bipartisan manner.   In the climate that we are in, and the uncertainty that the American  public is feeling--quite honestly, probably the frustration they feel  with this body--I think it is important to note that none of those  things were easy lifts, none of them were locked in, and many of them  contained things that were pretty ideologically polarizing.   Chairman Roe, through his leadership and with the professional staff,  was able to navigate to get to that point that the top priority and  focus was care for veterans--making sure that care is delivered in a  timely manner; making sure those delivering the care are the best  possible; and, as the chairman said, if they are doing their job, they  are afforded their constitutional rights and appeals. If they are not,  I agree with the chairman, they should be removed as quickly as  possible. They should certainly not be rewarded for that. That  strengthens the VA. That strengthens those good employees.   Again, keep this in mind: This is the second largest agency in the  Federal Government. It has a $190 billion budget. It has 350,000-plus  employees. It is an issue that unites us and that Americans are  passionate about.   So we stand before you today with an issue that is unified, as  Americans, as accountability. Certainly, the examples that Chairman Roe  mentioned, no one is going to defend those. I am pleased because I  think the chairman clearly understands that every time one of those  issues goes unaddressed in a timely manner, it hurts the morale of the  entire agency and erodes trust in the system by Americans.    Those veterans who use the VA system know they are getting quality  care. On any given day, tens of thousands of appointments and  procedures are being carried out in the most professional manner. All  of that is undermined if a bad employee is allowed to not live up to  those standards.   So I am pleased to say that I am in full support of this piece of  legislation. The way this was done is the way we are taught in school  how it is supposed to work. We debate, we send something there, we  don't agree, then we let the Senate do that. We all work together to  get something. We bring back that little, I am just a bill sitting on  Capitol Hill. Now it is back over here. It is not perfect in everyone's  mind, but it is certainly perfect in terms of how legislation is done  and reaching those goals. Everyone compromised.   I think the chairman needs to be singled out on this. I thank him for  commenting about Chairman Miller. We had Mike Michaud on our side work  on that, too. Others have been here and done it, but we needed someone  to get it over the line.   The three pieces I mentioned--appeals, choice, and accountability-- are certainly things that were on everybody's mind. All three are going  to pass through this House.   Just a couple of notes on this. This does maintain due process  protections for employees, and I support that. I hope we can come  together and pass the compromise piece.   The bill promotes accountability by giving the VA the tools it needs  to hold bad employees accountable, while maintaining those  constitutional-mandated workplace rights.   At this point, I would say that Secretary Shulkin has earned the  trust of, certainly, this committee, certainly of the veterans service  organizations, and I would say, if you don't know, the American people.  He has asked for some of these things. I take that very seriously. If  he says this will add to accountability, if he says this will make his  job better in delivering care for veterans, that weighs heavily.   He asked us for these things. He asked and was part of making that.  We should be grateful that he is willing to work with Congress.   It also requires VA to evaluate supervisors based on their protection  of whistleblowers. This commonsense provision aligns the incentives for  supervisors to protect whistleblowers when they shed light on dangerous  situations and problematic employees at the agency.   I want to be clear: we don't support collective bargaining rights  just because it is a union issue that we think should be there, those  of us who ideologically believe workplace protections allow for a  larger voice and protect good employees who are pointing out bad  behavior from being arbitrarily fired without a collective will to  fight back.   One person in a manager's office with no support or no legal right is  a very dangerous situation. One employee being backed by workplace  guarantees and their union collectively bargained rights helps make us  stronger.   The bill requires the VA to improve its training regarding  whistleblower disclosures. This is a really key piece. We want to  ensure there are no excuses for employees at the VA to not know how to  handle protected disclosures. Proper training will be a key to ensure  all employees and not just supervisors understand the importance.   No matter what this bill does, it would be hard to support if it  didn't do the things the chairman said. It does protect those  constitutional rights. It maintains all existing due process  protections in current law by ensuring there is notice and an  opportunity to respond before an employee is fired.   The bill even improves the appeals process by requiring the VA to  provide an employee with the complete evidence file when they are  fired, thereby empowering them to appeal sooner. If someone is  wrongfully accused of wrongdoing, now they are going to see and have  the entire file. We are just asking that they do it sooner.   If someone commits one of the acts that the chairman talked about, it  is indefensible for it to take 6 months or a year to have it  adjudicated. We certainly want them to have a fair due process, but,  again, if we are waiting to get that done, that is holding a position  for someone else that could be serving veterans. It also keeps an  employee under the cloud of not getting it done and moving on. If they  are innocent, we want to move it on as quickly  [[Page H4892]]  as possible. We do not jeopardize or change any of their appeal process  to come back.   Now is the time to bring real, long-lasting constitutional  accountability measures to the Department of Veterans Affairs. I would  hope we could come together to pass this. Again, the entire goal of all  of the people involved with this was to improve the care for this  Nation's veterans, ensuring people's rights to be heard, and a fair due  process if they are accused of something, but with the intention that  if you are not serving our veterans in the manner that you should, then  there are other places you should work. This ensures that those tools  are there.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Takano), my good friend and the vice ranking member of  the full Committee on Veterans' Affairs.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Takano), my good friend and the vice ranking member of  the full Committee on Veterans' Affairs.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Brownley), the ranking member of the Subcommittee on  Health.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Peters), a friend of all of our veterans and a member  of the Veterans' Affairs Committee.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have remaining.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Rodney Davis of Illinois). The gentleman  from Minnesota has 15\1/2\ minutes remaining, and the gentleman from  Tennessee has 14 minutes remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I am certainly  willing to yield some of my time to the gentleman from Tennessee if  there are other speakers who would like to speak on this if the  gentleman's time runs short. If I could save myself 3 minutes for my  closing, I would certainly be  [[Page H4894]]  willing to do that. I am not certain what the parliamentary procedure  is to do so.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1515     Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, you heard it from a wide range of folks here on the  floor. This is the way Congress is supposed to work and this is what is  expected of us. This is what my constituents in southern Minnesota  expect, and this is what the gentleman from Tennessee's or the  gentleman from Florida's constituents expect: look at a problem, assess  it, come up with some different solutions, and debate those out.   I want to be clear, as I said earlier, these are tough issues. There  was debate--heated debate. We may even have raised our voices a few  times doing  [[Page H4896]]  this, but that is the way the world's greatest democracy is supposed to  function.   Again, three of the most pressing issues, three of the top priorities  of this Nation's veterans, all addressed in the first 6 six months of  this Congress, all addressed to the satisfaction of a wide, bipartisan  VSO community that is grateful for it.   I think, in trying to find these challenges and understanding them,  people are trying to get at the heart of this. I do think there are  great frustrations, and I have said, totally indefensible of the  examples given.   But when we had this debate before, there were some examples of bad  managers inadvertently firing people who were pointing out things that  the manager was doing; and the due process considerations got that  person their job back, and we got rid of the manager.   I think that when we first started debating this, I made the case  that this could be a right-to-work bill in disguise. This bill is not  that. This bill, as the chairman said, was not the intention. The  intention was accountability. The intention of the bill was to  streamline the process while protecting those due process rights.   I am grateful that the chairman, as always, kept his word. He  followed through and he negotiated that.   The thing that I would say before closing here, Mr. Speaker, is that  I agree with the majority leader. I think the combination of many  things that we are doing possesses the potential to see real reforms  moving in the right direction. Something that I think hasn't been  mentioned here--that the Secretary did with consultation with the  chairman, myself, and others--was that he took the action of  streamlining the medical record procedure between the DOD, and the VA  added to that.   There is transformational, generational-type change happening at the  VA, but none of this will matter. And the majority leader said he  expects to see that. We must ensure that it happens. We must ensure the  accountability, we must monitor, we must ask that it is happening, and  we must come back at this again. If there is a glitch that was  unintended, let's come back at it again in this same manner of reaching  an outcome.   This is a positive day, Mr. Speaker. I would hope that those folks  paying attention to this and watching--certainly the veterans, but  everyone--know that Congress can work together; Congress can take on  pressing issues; Congress can come up with bipartisan solutions; and  Congress can agree that the thing that defines us most is not  Republican or Democrat--it is U.S. citizen, it is veteran, and it is  care for them.   Today I am proud to get this through here. Let's send it on to the  President, and let's all celebrate the Administration signing this into  law and moving forward.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
