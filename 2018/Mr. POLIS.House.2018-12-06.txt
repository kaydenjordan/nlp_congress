 Mr. Speaker, it has been the honor of my life to have  served 10 years in this body, and I want to take this occasion to thank  the amazing and talented staff that has worked both in our  congressional office here in Washington as well as in Ft. Collins and  Boulder and in Adams and Summit Counties.   I want to thank all of the interns who have lent their services over  the last decade, on behalf of the people of the Second Congressional  District, hopefully providing them with a great experience that  furthers their interest in public affairs.   And, of course, I want to thank my colleagues on both sides of the  aisle. The men and women I have come to know and have worked with in  the last decade have been some of the most important relationships of  my life. I truly believe that there is no problem so large that the  deliberative and thoughtful minds in this body can't rise to the  occasion and solve all the pressing issues.   It has been sad to see that, all too often, things stand in the way  of that progress, whether it is partisanship, yes, but not only  partisanship, the role of the special interests, and the increasingly  divided electorate that we have nationally.  [[Page H9766]]    But I know that the men and women of this body and in the next  Congress, the 116th Congress, will hopefully come together to solve a  lot of the pressing issues that affect our country and the world.   Whether it is making sure that kids grow up with a good education,  that families have access to affordable healthcare, or protecting our  environment for ourselves and future generations, I know that the men  and women in this body will be able to rise to that occasion.   It truly has been an amazing honor to have worked with so many  terrific people from all over this country, authentically representing  their constituents and their districts.   I look forward to taking this decade of service to our Nation with me  throughout the rest of my life, wherever I go, to help inform the  decisions I make to do the very best job that I can, every day.   Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for the honor of serving in the United States  Congress for a decade. I look forward to continuing to work with future  United States Congresses.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.
