 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Our country is facing a national security crisis, an energy crisis, a  border crisis, and an economic crisis, but here we are, voting on  cannabis legislation.   How is this helping our constituents who are paying sky-high prices  at the gas pump? How does this strengthen our military and help secure  America? How does this address Biden's record-breaking surge of illegal  immigrants at our southern border? How does this help us to leave a  stronger, safer, more secure America for our children and our  children's children?   Simple answer: It doesn't.   We are here today to vote to get America high.   In States with legalized marijuana, there are more marijuana-related  emergency room visits and hospitalizations than any other category.   Patients in a study using marijuana to treat pain, anxiety, and  depression failed to report improved symptoms, and the continued use of  marijuana brought risk of addiction known as cannabis abuse disorder.   The National Institute on Drug Abuse found that about 30 percent of  marijuana users have some form of use disorder. In Colorado, the  Speaker's home State and the leading State for legalizing marijuana,  there was a 25 percent increase in CUD among 12- to 17-year-olds.   These are our children. Allowing children, who don't know how to  rationalize long-term effects of drugs, to use a gateway drug for  recreational or medicinal purposes is reckless, negligent, careless,  and irresponsible.   The MORE Act does not responsibly end Federal prohibition of  cannabis. The MORE Act does not end the war on drugs. All it does is  poison our children and weaken our society.   This flawed legislation is not time sensitive, does not require  consideration this week, and should not take priority over the various  serious issues our country currently faces.   I urge my colleagues to vote against this bill and put our children  first, not the dope dealers.    Madam Speaker, last year I introduced H.R. 6176, with  the goal of preventing the Secretary of Energy and the President from  doing exactly what they announced this week, tapping the Strategic  Petroleum Reserve without issuing a plan for American energy  independence.   Now, several months after living under President Biden's failed  energy policies and decisions, he has announced the largest release of  oil reserves in history, putting one million additional barrels on the  market per day on average every day for the next 6 months.   Biden's anti-American energy agenda jeopardizes our national security  once again.   Tapping the SPR at the levels announced this week by this  administration is a dangerous move. Drawing down our strategic reserves  by over 25 percent poses a huge national security risk, a risk that  America would not be in the place to take if Biden would end the  Federal freeze on all new oil and gas projects and stop the regulatory  assault on U.S. energy development and financing. Tapping the SPR will  not lower gas prices.   Today is April Fools' Day, but with Biden in office you would think  every day is April Fools' Day. However, he is not pulling innocent  pranks on the American people, but he is personally harming the safety,  security, and prosperity of America.                            ____________________
