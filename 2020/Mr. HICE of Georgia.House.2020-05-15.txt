 Mr. Speaker, the Federal Government has a  responsibility to help both individuals and businesses through this  crisis because, as the government, they shut down the economy. But I do  have deep concerns with the way in which we are attempting to go about  this.   We have already spent an unprecedented amount of money, $3.6  trillion, at an unprecedented rate. Now, we have a monstrosity, and we  have yet to have a serious discussion as to how we are going to pay for  this massive debt.   In this bill--$3 trillion, 1,800 pages, zero input from the minority,  from the Senate or the White House, drafted behind closed doors, and  just very little time to review it.   As ranking member of the Government Operations Subcommittee, I want  to focus on the Postal Service. The Postal Service does not need a  bailout; they need reform. It needs reform.    We have 12 consecutive years of losing money in the Postal Service,  and it was not caused by this pandemic. It is a deeper pandemic within  the Postal Service.    Mr. Speaker, this is an issue that we have to  resolve, not with just a bailout of $25 billion. They have $9 billion  sitting in the bank over there.   This is our time to be responsible with the people's money, and I  urge my colleagues not to support this bill?
