 Madam Speaker, I rise today to strongly object to the  Article of Impeachment proposed against President Trump, which makes  the preposterous claim that President Trump wanted or expected the  riots that took place last week. He clearly said he wanted a peaceful  and patriotic demonstration. He did say he wanted people to ``fight  like hell or we are not going to have a country anymore,'' but that is  obviously standard hyperbole and was not meant to aim at physical  fights.   But what is offensive is what you are saying--and is inflammatory-- about the tens of thousands of peaceful protesters who were there last  week, as well as the tens of millions of people they represent. You  don't understand why they are here.   They are scared to death we are going to go back to the days without  Donald Trump, of hundreds of thousands of people crossing the border  every month. They are scared to death nobody is going to keep our  manufacturing here. They are scared to death that nobody else will  fight the cancel culture as we head toward an era when some things  can't be said. They are scared to death that the majority party got  here by teaming up with Black Lives Matter, a bunch founded by Marxists  and the dislike of family.
