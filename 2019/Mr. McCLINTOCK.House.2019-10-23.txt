 Mr. Chairman, I fervently agree with the premise of  this bill. American political campaigns should remain among Americans.   In California, it is now common for admitted noncitizens, some of  them here illegally, to inject themselves into campaigns and attempt to  influence voters.   Perhaps we can all agree: You are either a citizen or you are not. If  you are not a citizen, you are a guest. If you are a guest, you are not  entitled to participate in our elections or in the debate that  influences them.                                time  1500    That is especially important in a nation where sovereignty is vested  not with the government, but with the people. In most countries, the  government is the sovereign. Here in America, the people are sovereign.  But in America, our sovereign doesn't govern. It hires help. That is  what all of us are. We are hired help.   And once we are hired, the sovereign people then discuss among  themselves the job we are doing, and every 2 years this discussion  informs their decision over whether to keep us or to hire somebody  else. That is a unique exercise of American sovereignty, and it ought  to be off limits to all others.   But where I fervently disagree is with this bill's use of  governmental power to interfere with freedom of speech and association  that is absolutely essential to the preservation of our liberty. Except  for incitement to commit crimes, every person must be free to speak  their minds.   If a foreign national inserts himself into an American political  discussion, the remedy is to call him out, tell him to butt out, and  denounce such conduct for the meddling that it is. The remedy is not to  insert the government into the discussion over how the government is  doing.   Once government seizes the power to tell the people what they can say  or who they can talk to, we will have cracked the touchstone of our  Bill of Rights, and that crack will grow until it shatters the bedrock  of our freedom.    Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to tell a remarkable  story of the unacknowledged patriotism and heroism of a 23-year-old  Army scout, who, on December 3, 1944, was immersed in the horror and  peril of some of the worst of the fighting in the bloody nightmare of  the Philippines campaign. At Mount Cabunganan, Technician 5th Class  Leon G. Felt heroically engaged the enemy.   His family keeps the steel helmet he wore that day. The back half of  that helmet is riddled with shrapnel holes from the inside out. A  grenade exploded beneath him, and the deadly shrapnel blew up his left  side, blowing off his helmet from below with enough force to pierce it.   Now, Leon never talked much about what happened that day. The war  ended, and he came home after months in Army hospitals dealing with his  grave injuries. The only thing his family really knew, years later, was  a brief entry in his journal. It said, ``Lieutenant Hanna told me he  put me in for a Silver Star for what I did in the attack,'' but nothing  came of it.   His wife told me that the Army's final orders to Leon and his  comrades were: go home, get a job, look after your families. Well, that  is exactly what Leon Felt did. He joined the Southern Pacific Railroad,  ultimately retiring as a shop foreman. He became deeply involved in his  church. He married Lois Wade, his wife of 32 years, until she died in  1976. He then married Nola Pulsipher, who survives him after 42 years  of marriage. He raised eight children and today has 41 grandchildren,  110 great-grandchildren with three more on the way, and seven great- great-grandchildren.   The war never left him. Nola says she would often rescue him from his  frequent nightmares, and all he could say through his tears was, ``It's  either kill or be killed.'' His children only knew that he was in the  thick of the war, that he had come home wounded, and that those days in  the Philippines still haunted him.   In recent years, Leon's family began looking into his service record.  Having read his journal, his daughter, Lydean, began searching for what  he did that day that would have rated a recommendation for the Silver  Star. They had ordered copies of his medals, but there was no mention  of a Silver Star in them. He had received the Bronze Star and the  Purple Heart, among other decorations.   But Lydean remained curious about that entry in his diary, and what  seemed to be a confusing note on one Army form that suggested there  might be something more, though there was no official record of it.  Now, Lydean, who has all of the timidity of a heat-seeking missile,  wouldn't give up. She wrote the National Personnel and Record Center of  the National Archives. The Archives could find no record of other  medals, including the Silver Star. A fire in 1973, they feared, would  have destroyed any record if he had. But Lydean persisted.   The archives kept digging, and then they stumbled upon a curious  thing: a collection of citations of the most heroic deeds of World War  II. In it, they found the citation for Leon G. Felt and what he did  that December day in 1944. They were right about one thing: he was  never awarded the Silver Star.   On February 12, 1945, as he lay recovering from his wounds in an Army  hospital, Leon Felt had been awarded the Nation's second highest honor,  the Distinguished Service Cross, revered more than any other medal, but  the Medal of Honor itself. But somewhere along the way, probably  because of a clerical error, his service record was never updated, and  word never reached him.   Now, here are the words that were supposed to have been spoken as he  received our Nation's second highest military honor:   ``Technician Fifth Grade Leon G. Felt, Serial Number 39902244,  Cavalry, United States Army. For extraordinary heroism against the  enemy at Mount Cabunganan, Leyte, Philippine Islands, on 3 December  1944.   ``Advancing through very rugged terrain, his troop encountered the  enemy entrenched in a strong position astride a narrow ridge. The enemy  were well dug in, their rifle pits being concealed with top coverings  of brush and grass. During an attack by our troops, the advance of the  right platoon was temporarily diverted by heavy enemy fire, but upon  receiving reinforcing fire from the left platoon, the intensity of the  enemy fire slackened. Seizing this opportunity, Technician Felt, a  scout for his platoon, voluntarily rushed the nearest enemy rifle pit,  and grasping the top cover, stripped it off, exposing three occupants  whom he killed. Continuing his advance, he reached and uncovered a  second pit and killed three more enemy. He then advanced toward a third  pit but was struck and wounded by the fragments from an exploding hand  grenade.                                time  2000    ``Despite his wound and the warning shouts of his comrades, he  continued to push his attack, and reaching the foxhole, killed its two  occupants. Unable to advance farther because of his wounds, he from his  advanced position directed the attack of his platoon upon remaining  enemy within the position. This attack was successful, and the enemy  were driven from the position with heavy losses.   ``Technician Felt's prompt, heroic actions in voluntarily attacking  the enemy single-handedly were an inspiration to his comrades and  reflect the highest traditions of the United States Army. By command of  General MacArthur.''   Long ago, soldiers coined the term ``snafu'' to describe the military  bureaucracy. It is an acronym that, roughly translated, means,  ``Situation Normal--All Fouled Up.''   Well, in a terrible snafu, the medal was never given to Technician  Felt. He was never told of how grateful his country was for the  sacrifices he made, for the bravery that saved the soldiers in his  unit, and for the exemplary heroism and leadership that turned the tide  of battle.   His family arranged to surprise him with this long-overdue  presentation about 3 weeks ago on October 5. This was the Saturday  before his 98th birthday. They gathered from across the country. They  decorated the house and made a cake.   I have never been more honored or more moved than to have been asked  to fulfill that long-overdue presentation that General MacArthur had  ordered so long ago.   On my way to meet this gentle giant, as his family called him, I  received word that Leon Felt had passed away in the early hours of that  morning, surrounded by his loving family. But they were still gathered  at the house, in grief now as well as pride, and so I made the  presentation posthumously to his widow, an extraordinary woman in her  own right.   There is some consolation in this story. As his health began slipping  in the days before he died, his family told him that he had been  awarded the Nation's second-highest military honor and that he was  about to receive it at his birthday celebration.   Mrs. Felt told me that his face brightened up, and he said, ``So, I  really am your hero.'' And his wife replied, ``That is what I have been  telling you all these years.''   The tragedy is that this honor should have followed Leon Felt  throughout his life, as Shakespeare said, to ``remember, with  advantage, what feats he did that day.'' He should have been feasted  and feted, and thanked every day of his life, as this honor spoke of  his courageous deeds.   Instead of feeling guilt, he should have felt pride. For every  nightmare he suffered alone, he should have enjoyed the gratitude of  his fellow citizens. Instead, Technician Leon Felt, a recipient of the  Distinguished Service Cross that he never received, did what he was  told, quietly went home, got a job, and looked after his family.   His memorial service will be held in Dixon, California, tomorrow, and  he will be buried with full military honors  [[Page H8453]]  at the Sacramento Valley National Cemetery. He will take to his grave  pieces of shrapnel from the injuries he sustained at Mount Cabunganan.  He will also take the Distinguished Service Cross that he was supposed  to have been awarded 74 years ago.   I want to say to his family on behalf of our country that this long- missing medal now attests that the American people finally know what  the Felt family has known all along, that he really was and is our  Nation's hero, too.   Mr. Speaker, I wanted to tell this story tonight, not for Leon Felt's  sake, but for our country's sake, to remind us what we owe heroes like  him for the sacrifices often unrecognized and unrequited that they have  made, to answer James Michener's haunting question: ``Where do we get  such men?''--and also to place in the Record in these hallowed Halls an  apology, really, for a 74-year-old clerical mistake, a snafu that  prevented him from knowing in life the gratitude and respect that our  Nation can now express only after his death.   Mr. Speaker, I ask that the House observe a moment of silence to  honor the memory of Technician Fifth Grade Leon Gustave Felt, United  States Army, recipient of the Distinguished Service Cross.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 8 o'clock and 6 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Thursday, October 24, 2019, at 9 a.m.                            ____________________
