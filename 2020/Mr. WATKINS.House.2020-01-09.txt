 Madam Speaker, I spent somewhere around 8\1/2\ years in  conflict environments and post-conflict environments between Iraq and  Afghanistan. And all that time I knew many people who suffered at the  hands of Qasem Soleimani.   One in particular takes me back to 2006 or 2007. I was smoking and  joking at the embassy in Baghdad. I was doing so with a friend--really  a brother, a West Point classmate--who shortly thereafter went out on a  mission and was ultimately killed in a complex attack perpetrated by  Qasem Soleimani.  [[Page H102]]    I understand that action leads to risk, but inaction leads to more  risk in the long run. And when searching for this divine strategy, look  to what tactical operators know to be true, and that is, when we go  throughout our work on the ground with the assault rifle in one hand, a  sat phone in the other, we need to know that should anything happen to  us, our President is going to have the freedom to rain fire down upon  our enemies, and I am thankful for that.
