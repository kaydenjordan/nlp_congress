 Mr. President, along with my colleagues Senator  James E. Risch, Representative Mike Simpson, and Representative Russ  Fulcher, I pay tribute to former Idaho Governor Phil Batt for his  immense service to our State.   As his last official act in the Governor's Ceremonial Office in the  Idaho State Capitol, outgoing Idaho Governor C.L. Butch Otter co- presented, with current Idaho Governor Brad Little, the 2019 Idaho  Medal of Achievement to Governor Phil Batt for his many accomplishments  and years of service to the State of Idaho. The award is considered the  highest civilian honor bestowed by the State. Phil Batt is the third  recipient of this great honor, for which many nominations from across  our State have been made by the public.   Governor Batt has an extensive career of service to our State and  Nation. He served as our State's 29th Governor from 1995 to 1999. Prior  to his service as Governor, he served as Idaho Republican Party  Chairman, Lieutenant Governor of Idaho, and president pro tempore of  the Idaho Senate. He served in the Idaho Senate for approximately 15  years after serving in the Idaho House of Representatives from 1965 to  1967. He also served in the U.S. Army from 1945 to 1946 after growing  up on a farm in Wilder, ID.   Idaho has benefited greatly from Governor Phil Batt's sensible voice,  commitment to service, and outstanding leadership. Governor Batt's  principal role in advancing human rights in Idaho is among his many  achievements on behalf of Idahoans. He led efforts to establish a  Commission on Human Rights and pushed for benefits for Idaho  farmworkers.   Governor Batt, you have much to be proud of and reflect on for your  outstanding service over your exemplary life. You have stood against  inequities and, in so doing, helped make others' paths better. Your  mentorship, encouragement, and guidance have been instrumental in  helping current and future leaders in our great State get a start.  Thank you for you your leadership, friendship, humor, and extraordinary  service to our State and Nation.                            ____________________
