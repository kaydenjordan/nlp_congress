 Mr. President, today I am pleased to recognize Dick Hiser,  who is being inducted into the Wyoming Agriculture Hall of Fame. Every  year since 1992, Wyoming has recognized individuals who have made  substantial contributions to agriculture in our great state. With  nearly 60 years of involvement in the agriculture community in Wyoming  and beyond, Mr. Hiser is well deserving of this honor.   A native of Saratoga, WY, Mr. Hiser spent the early portion of his  career working for the University of Wyoming as an extension agent in  Carbon County. During his time in this position, Mr. Hiser led the  Wyoming 4-H program in Carbon County to much success. He was critical  in helping Carbon County students succeed, encouraging their efforts in  everything from judging livestock to earning valuable academic  scholarships. He is remembered by many in Wyoming that participated in  the 4-H program for always being willing to share his knowledge and  experience with the younger generation so they could be successful on  their own journeys in the agriculture industry and beyond.   Fortunately for Wyoming, Mr. Hiser's contributions include not only  his unwavering commitment to youth programs, but Wyoming's ranching  community as well. Many know him for his stalwart commitment to  sustainable and high-quality cattle and remaining true to his three  qoals: ensuring cattle were functional in their environment,  structurally sound to compete in the marketplace, and would grade well  once prepared for final sale.   This commitment to Wyoming's agriculture community was reflected in  Mr. Hiser's many successes in national cattle shows like the National  Western Stock Show and the Arizona National Livestock Show. He has also  been recognized as an outstanding alumni of the University of Wyoming  College of Agriculture and is honored in the Carbon County 4-H Hall Of  Fame. Mr. Hiser has dedicated much of his time to agriculture interest  groups across the State, including the Wyoming Livestock Board, Wyoming  Beef Council, Wyoming Stock Growers Association, and Wyoming State  Board of Veterinary Medicine.   In addition to his tremendous contributions to the agriculture,  education, and 4-H communities in Wyoming, Mr. Hiser showed what it  means to be a truly upstanding member of the community while serving as  a Carbon County commissioner.   Mr. Hiser's values, dedication, and work ethic exemplify the Wyoming  way of life. I want to extend my congratulations to Mr. Hiser and thank  him for his service and years of hard work. Mr. Hiser truly lives the  Code of the West, and I am proud to have the opportunity to recognize  his achievements as an inductee into the Wyoming Agriculture Hall of  Fame. Wyoming is well served by his lasting and continuing  contributions to our great State.                            ____________________
