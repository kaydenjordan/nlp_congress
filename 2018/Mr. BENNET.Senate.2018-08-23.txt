 Mr. President, I would save my colleague from North  Carolina from having to object to his own motion, but I so much believe  in what he is trying to do that I can't object. I thank him for his  leadership, through the Chair, on this issue over many years. This  should be a bipartisan issue. It is a bipartisan issue. My colleague  from Colorado, Cory Gardner, and I wrote an op-ed piece together--can  you believe that?--in the Denver Post, supporting the work that Senator  Burr from North Carolina is trying to do.   It is long past time for us to stop continuing to play these  political games and actually do some work for the American people.  There is not a county in America that doesn't have a Land and Water  Conservation Fund project. That is not what I am here to talk about,  but I thank him for his leadership.   I am here to talk about another area that should be bipartisan, and  that is addressing the urgent matter of climate change in the United  States of America with the leadership of our government. Instead, this  week, President Trump made his latest assault on our country's climate  policy by gutting the Clean Power Plan. This decision creates more  uncertainty for coal miners by delaying for 2 years what everyone knows  we ultimately have to do, and it creates uncertainty for everybody  else.   President Trump has campaigned for years on the idea that there is a  war on coal, ignoring his own Department of Energy's observation that  the reason why coal has fallen as a source of our energy is that  natural gas, because of the ingenuity of the American people, has  become so cheap. That is what displaced coal, but he is ignoring it,  just like he ignores economic reality after economic reality.   This is not going to help Colorado. We have added 60,000 clean energy  jobs and 230,000 outdoor recreation jobs, and we have 170,000  agriculture jobs that are inseparably linked to the stability of our  climate. One of the reasons this sector is growing so rapidly is that  Colorado does not have the luxury of operating in a fictitious economy.  We see the threat of climate change every day, from an infestation of  pine and spruce beetles that have destroyed our drought-stricken trees  to wildfires that are no longer bound to a season because now they  burn, or can burn, all year long, to shorter ski seasons and longer  droughts that are affecting our farmers and ranchers.   These consequences of climate change are costing Coloradans billions  of dollars each year, and this cost is only expected to increase.   I have said it before. My State is one-third Republican, one-third  Democratic, and one-third Independent. We have a consensus in my State  that climate change is real and that humans are contributing to it.  That doesn't mean everybody agrees with what the solution should be,  but there is a consensus that if we do not act, we will not be  fulfilling our obligation to the next generations of Coloradans.   In Colorado, for that reason, we have made significant progress  transitioning to a cleaner energy mix because we are betting on the  economy as it actually exists, not as Donald Trump imagines. So far,  that bet has paid off. We have had $6 billion invested in clean energy.  We have created hundreds of thousands of clean energy jobs in  construction, maintenance, and installation that cannot be outsourced  and cannot be sent to China.   Wind jobs alone are expected to triple by 2020, and our largest  utility, Xcel Energy, announced this past June that it is retiring two  coal plants early and replacing them with wind, solar, and natural gas,  and energy storage.   This has nothing to do with the Environmental Protection Agency-- nothing--or regulation. It is because it is cheaper. It is cleaner for  the environment, but it is also cheaper for the rate base. That is what  we are accomplishing in Colorado, and I know it is true across the  country.   This assault by President Trump on the Clean Power Plan, which so  many States were already complying with, is just the latest in a year- and-a-half attack on important environmental regulations: fuel economy  standards for cars and trucks that he got rid of that will make our  automobiles and our trucks less competitive overseas; commonsense rules  to decrease methane leaks from oil and gas production; opening up of  the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and our coasts for drilling;  attacking the Antiquities Act and the Endangered Species Act;  appointing Scott Pruitt, a climate denier, to be the head of the EPA;  trying to roll back the clean water rule; trying to use taxpayer  dollars to revive retiring coal and nuclear plants on the taxpayers'  dime; trying to delay ozone standards to limit smog to prevent our  children and seniors from getting sick; and withdrawing from the global  climate agreement. We now have the distinction of being the only  country in the world not to be part of that agreement. Syria has now  joined it, but we are by ourselves.   I can tell you that the generation of people in this Chamber who are  the age of the pages in this Chamber have a consensus that climate  change is real.   I know my colleague is here. So I am going to bring this to a close,  but let me say that the Republican Party nationally has had a  distinguished record on environmental matters until very recently. That  may surprise people who have seen the debate and watched it, but it is  true. Richard Nixon, a Republican President, signed the Clean Air Act  and signed the Clean Water Act. He created the Environmental Protection  Agency. Anybody who wants to remember what was going on back then only  needs to think about the Cuyahoga River catching on fire and what that  looked like. Anybody who remembers that knows that it is very hard to  make the argument that net-net the Clean Air Act and the Clean Air Act  haven't been good for our economy. That doesn't mean that it is  perfect, but it is very hard to make that argument. People will, but I  think it is very hard to make it convincingly.   Ronald Reagan, one of the great conservative Republicans in the  history of America, is the guy who was President when the ozone layer  got a hole in it. He was a survivor of skin cancer. Kids who come to my  meetings today don't know what the hole in the ozone layer is. They can  thank Ronald Reagan for that.   Both Bushes said that climate change is real and that humans are  contributing and that we have to do something about it, and we need to  work through multilateral organizations--in that case it was the U.N.-- to do something about this.   Then, what changed? In 2010 the Supreme Court made a decision in  Citizens United that opened up our entire Federal Government to  billions of dollars of outside money, and the threat of outside money  came with a promise to sign something called the ``climate pledge,''  which denied that it was real. Ever since then, we haven't been able to  do any bipartisan work on it.   The Supreme Court in that opinion talked about its worries about the  corruption of action. What we have is the corruption of inaction--the  bills that aren't written, the amendments that never get a vote, and  the committee hearings that are never held because of a distortion in  our political system. We have to change that together because if we are  serious about climate, we need an enduring solution. We can't have  something that is ripped out like the Clean Power Plan after a year and  a half. That will not fulfill the responsibility we have for the next  generation of Americans--or to the planet, for that matter.   So I am very sorry to be here today under the circumstances that I am  here, but I thought it was important to note what the President had  done, and I will say again that I hope the time will come when we can  make bipartisan progress on climate change.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an article from the Wall  [[Page S5896]]  Street Journal and an article from the Washington Post be printed in  the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                [From the Wall Street Journal, Mar. 8, 2016]                   Companies Go Green on Their Own Steam                            (By Cassandra Sweet)         U.S. companies are cutting emissions voluntarily and buying       clean energy at the fastest pace ever, as lower renewable       energy prices and easier availability of these sources makes       these economical options.        Companies such as Salesforce.com Inc. have started to       embrace energy generated from wind, solar and other clean-      energy sources in earnest this past year, while General       Motors Co. GM 1.18% , and Whole Foods Market Inc. have       doubled down on their renewable energy usage.        U.S. companies, in 2015, agreed to buy 3,440 megawatts of       solar and wind power under long-term contracts--enough to       power Sacramento, Calif.--and, roughly three times the amount       they bought in 2014, said Herve Touati, research director at       the Rocky Mountain Institute, a clean-energy think tank.       Displacing fossil fuel energy with that amount of renewable       energy is roughly equivalent to taking 1.4 million cars off       the road, according to the institute.        ``It's a combination of social pressure on large, visible       corporations to do good for the world, and the fact that       today you can sign deals that are attractive economically,''       Mr. Touati said.        A decline in renewable-energy prices alongside a larger       energy slump are playing a key part in the shift. The price       of wind power averaged $29 a megawatt-hour in 2015, down 27%       from 2012, according to research firm Bloomberg New Energy       Finance.        Solar power bought under multiyear contracts also fell last       year to $57 a megawatt-hour on average, down by nearly one-      fifth from 2012. One megawatt of wind energy can serve about       270 average U.S. homes, and the same amount of solar power       can serve 164 average homes, according to wind and solar       power industry groups.        The price of fossil-fuel based power averaged $35 a       megawatt-hour in 2015, according to a Wall Street Journal       analysis of data compiled by the Energy Department.        GM signed a deal last year to operate more than half its       assembly line in a Dallas suburb on electricity generated by       a West Texas wind farm. Workers at the plant in Arlington,       Texas, are expected to assemble 1,200 Chevrolet Suburbans,       GMC Yukons and Cadillac Escalades daily using a renewable       power source when the wind farm goes online later this year.        GM says it has saved more than $80 million from green-      energy purchases and investments since 1993, when it started       on its renewable energy initiatives, said Rob Threlkeld, the       company's global manager of renewable energy.        ``Any renewable energy project has to provide a savings,''       he said, adding that in Michigan, Ohio and Indiana the auto       maker is using electricity generated from burning landfill       gas and trash to power its factories.        Mounting solar panels on the roofs of its big-box stores       and warehouses has helped Wal-Mart Stores Inc. trim its       electric bills, the company says. With nearly 350 commercial       solar installations on its buildings, the Bentonville, Ark.-      based company outpaces every other corporation in America for       on-site solar adoption, according to the Solar Energy       Industries Association.        ``The financial impact is important to us. Our customers       vote with their pocket books,'' said David Ozment, Wal-Mart's       senior director of energy.        Wal-Mart buys enough wind, solar and other renewable energy       every year to power 26% of its stores, warehouses and       distribution centers around the world.        By 2020, the retailer also aims to save $1 billion a year       by more than doubling the amount of renewable energy it uses       and trimming its electricity consumption at each store by       20%. ``Customers have said, `We love what Wal-Mart is doing       in this space. We want you to continue doing this. But we       don't want to pay a premium for our diapers for that,' '' Mr.       Ozment said.        Intel Corp., as part of efforts to shrink its carbon       footprint, has installed a lot of solar panels. The company's       green efforts help attract and retain top-flight talent in       California's competitive hiring environment, according to a       study by Bain & Co.        ``We have a variety of awards and programs that are       associated with sustainability objectives and actions,'' says       Intel spokeswoman Claudine Mangano. For example, the company       awards ``bonus points'' to employees who figure out ways for       Intel to meet its annual environmental goals, such as cutting       power use. The points can be converted to cash.        Whole Foods, the chain that markets itself as a purveyor of       organic food, has faced obstacles in trying to establish an       environmentally friendly image. One of the grocery chain's       main initiatives--the repurposing of used cooking oil to       generate power in a kitchen outside Boston that made prepared       meals for Whole Foods stores across New England--failed.       Lower crude oil prices forced the cooking-oil supplier to       abandon the project.        Whole Foods is going solar, and plans to install solar       panels at 100 stores after putting arrays on 25 others.                                   ____                  [From the Washington Post, Nov. 17, 2017]   The U.S. Has More Climate Skeptics Than Anywhere Else on Earth. Blame                                  the GOP.                            (By Amanda Erickson)         In most of the world, climate change is settled science.        Not so in the United States. President Trump has called       human-made climate change a ``hoax perpetuated by and for the       Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing noncompetitive.''       Former House speaker Newt Gingrich has suggested that climate       change is the ``newest excuse to take control of our lives by       left-leaning intellectuals.'' Conservative broadcaster Rush       Limbaugh called it ``one of the most preposterous hoaxes in       the history of the planet.''        In fact, the United States is home to more climate-change       skeptics than most other countries. Don't believe me? The       U.K.-based market research firm surveyed 16,000 people in 20       countries about their attitudes on climate change.        More people in the United States doubt that humans are       responsible for climate change than just about any other       country. What accounts for this discrepancy?        Our politics. Climate-change denial is a core tenet of one       of our two major political parties. Its skepticism is       unmatched around the world. A paper from researchers at the       University of Bergen in Norway found that among major       political parties--even conservative ones--the GOP stands       alone in its rejection of the need to tackle climate change.       One analysis by PolitiFact agreed that ``virtually no       Republican'' in Washington accepts climate-change science.        It wasn't always this way. In 2008, Republican presidential       candidate John McCain produced an ad praising him as a       candidate who ``sounded the alarm on global warming.''       According to an insightful New York Times article, the party       transformed itself into a party of skeptics in just a decade,       thanks to ``big political money, Democratic hubris in the       Obama years and a partisan chasm that grew over nine years       like a crack in the Antarctic shelf, favoring extreme       positions and uncompromising rhetoric over cooperation and       conciliation.''        The Times explains that fossil fuel industry players, like       Charles D. and David H. Koch, funded a powerful campaign to       scare Republican lawmakers away from supporting climate-      change legislation. Their group Americans for Prosperity       pushed a ``No Climate Tax'' pledge and helped unseat       supportive Democrats from Virginia. (When the smoke cleared       from the 2010 midterms, 83 of the 92 new members of Congress       had signed that pledge.) President Obama, frustrated by       Congress's inability to act, pushed executive actions to       combat climate change, moves that only further infuriated the       right. (``It fell into this notion of executive overreach,''       Heather Zichal, an Obama climate adviser, told the New York       Times.) The tea party, too, saw fighting climate change as       one more big government program it wanted nothing to do with.        That reality is reflected in our news coverage. A 2011       report by James Painter from the University of Oxford and the       Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism looked       specifically at how climate change was covered in newspapers       in six countries.        He found that U.S. and U.K. print media quoted or mentioned       climate change skeptics significantly more than outlets in       Brazil, China, India and France. Together, outlets in the       United States and Great Britain accounted for about 80       percent of all skeptic quotes and mentions. About 40 percent       of those articles ran in opinion sections. American       publications were much more likely to quote a skeptical       politician than outlets in the other countries, in large part       because politicians in the U.K. and U.S. are more skeptical,       on the whole, of human-caused climate change.        Painter also found that right-leaning outlets are much more       likely to publish skeptics than left-leaning outlets.        And it's reflected in how Americans think about climate       change. Americans are unusually divided on climate change       among major democracies. A large percentage of Democrats       believe in human-made climate change; many Republicans don't.       As Painter explained to me in an email, ``the polarization of       attitudes towards climate change between Republicans and       Democrats is very acute, and this is not replicated to the       same extent in other countries.''        As Pew explained in a 2015 report, this polarization       doesn't look so different than American divides on a lot of       other things like abortion and gun control.        In other countries, climate change just isn't a partisan       issue. Broad majorities of people accept what scientists       say--that climate change is being caused by humans, who are       pumping carbon dioxide into the air at alarming and       unprecedented rates. That might be because in many places,       people are experiencing the impact of a changing climate       directly, so they're more likely to believe the science. It's       also true that in countries with the highest carbon emissions       like the United States, concern about human-created climate       change is lowest. Most other places, too, don't have big       lobby groups or think tanks with links to fossil fuel       companies pushing out their message into the public sphere       and media.     I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I did want to thank my colleague for his  statement about the Attorney General. I think he is absolutely correct  about what he said. I used to work at the Department of Justice, and  the FBI and the DOJ are filled with honorable civil servants who are  doing their best to enforce the law. I thank him for his remarks.   I yield to the Senator from Oregon.
