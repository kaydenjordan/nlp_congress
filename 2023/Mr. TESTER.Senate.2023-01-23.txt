 Mr. President, today I would like to honor the 30 years  of public service and career of a distinguished American and champion  for veterans, servicemembers, and their families: Mrs. Cheryl L. Mason.   As the Department of Veterans Affairs' Chairman of the Board of  Veterans' Appeals, Chairman Mason helped deliver thousands of veterans  and their families appeals on their earned benefits and VA services,  ensuring they received timely decisions, including throughout the  COVID-19 pandemic.   Chairman Mason's lifelong commitment to serving veterans,  servicemembers, and their families is no surprise given her background.  She is the daughter of a U.S. Navy World War II veteran and a proud  military spouse, serving her country alongside her husband Brett during  his nearly 21 years in the U.S. Air Force.   Like many military spouses, Chairman Mason experienced a few breaks  in her professional career due to relocations. However, she never let  that stop her from working, whether it was as an LBJ intern on Capitol  Hill for Congressman Bob McEwen, for the Department of the Air Force,  in academia, or in private practice as an attorney. In fact, her  experience served as a catalyst for her to become a champion for the  military spouse community, where she went on to assist VA, the  Department of Labor, Defense, and the Hiring Our Hero's Program at the  U.S. Chamber of Commerce to reduce military spouse unemployment and  underemployment.   After decades of public service, Mrs. Mason was confirmed by the U.S.  Senate and sworn-in as the Chairman of  [[Page S51]]  the Board of Veterans' Appeals in November of 2017. She is the first  woman and military spouse to hold this position.   During her time as Chairman, Mason demonstrated strong leadership to  the veterans and communities she served. From hiring 65 new veterans  law judges to increase both hearing and decision capacity, to expanding  use of remote work during the pandemic that resulted in record-setting  hearings, she delivered on her commitments.   As the top Democrat on the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee since  2017, it was a great honor to work with Chairman Mason and the Board of  Veterans' Appeals to spearhead landmark laws such as the Veterans  Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act, which reduced the claims  backlog from 472,000 cases to 96,000 cases in 4 years, and the VA Tele- Hearing Modernization Act, which VA was able to quickly implement as a  result of Chairman Mason's efforts.   Cheryl has also been an outstanding champion for the hiring of  veterans, military spouses, and caregivers at VA and in the executive  branch. And as a PREVENTS ambassador, she has done great work in  developing and distributing a holistic public health approach to  suicide prevention, working locally and nationally to end suicide.   It is my honor to recognize Cheryl's 30 years of outstanding service  and top-notch commitment to serving our military men and women,  veterans, and their families. While Cheryl is beginning a new chapter,  I have no doubt she will continue to serve as a leading national  advocate.   Chairman Mason, on behalf of myself and a grateful nation, I extend  my greatest appreciation to you for your enduring leadership, advocacy,  and service to all veterans. Your impact will be felt by veterans  nationwide for years to come. Thank you.                            ____________________
