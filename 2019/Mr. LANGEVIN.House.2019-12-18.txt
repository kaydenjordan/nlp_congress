 Madam Speaker, our Nation was founded on certain  principles: that government should be of, by, and for the people; that  a system of three coequal branches of government would provide the  checks and balances necessary to ensure the people's voices are heard;  and that no one is above the law.   Today, sadly, we are voting to impeach President Donald John Trump  because he has fundamentally broken his covenant with the American  people. In doing so, we are using the powers the Founding Fathers  enshrined in the Constitution to address a President who has violated  his oath of office.   The evidence is clear and the facts are not in question:   President Trump has consistently engaged in a pattern of behavior  inconsistent with the rule of law;   He has refused to take responsibility for his actions;   He has undermined the checks and balances we rely on by obstructing  Congress at every turn;   And, most importantly, he has abused his power by using his office to  solicit foreign interference in our elections, undermining the will of  the people.   So, on this sad day for our Nation, I will do what the President has  so often failed to do: I will fulfill my oath to support and defend the  Constitution, and I will vote in favor of impeachment.                                time  1400
