 Madam Speaker, I thank Congressman Cartwright for  yielding, and I thank him for outlining some of the many benefits to  climate in this bill because for my adult children and so many of the  college students in my district, their number one issue is finally  taking meaningful action to address climate change.   But these bills do so much more than that. After more than 50 years  of failed trickle-down economics and unfulfilled promises to prioritize  our Nation's infrastructure, the last administration decided to punt on  infrastructure and double down on giveaways to the rich by passing yet  another tax cut for the ultra-wealthy. What did that get us? Widening  income inequality, a shrinking middle class, crumbling roads and  bridges, and increased corporate welfare.   For too long, America's economic policy has revolved around support  for the rich and powerful rather than working people. With President  Biden, we are ready to change that.   I am proud to be part of a Congress that is prioritizing the American  people.   In partnership with the Biden administration, Democrats in Congress  have set out to offer the greatest potential for American families and  American small businesses to achieve prosperity and the American Dream  in half a century. We need both the bipartisan Infrastructure  Investment and Jobs Act and the Build Back Better Act to meet that  potential and deliver a fairer, more balanced economy that works for  all Americans.    After too many infrastructure weeks to count, Congress will soon  deliver an infrastructure bill to the President's desk that creates  economic opportunity for all Americans in the 21st century and beyond.   My district, Pennsylvania's Fifth, is home to Philadelphia's airport,  port, and rail yard; miles and miles of interstate highways and  passenger rail lines; and regional commuter and light-rail lines that  link Philadelphia and its suburbs. Our infrastructure is aging, heavily  used, and, in many cases, beyond its usable lifespan. Anyone who has  been stuck in traffic or a pothole on the Schuylkill Expressway, the  Blue Route, or I-95 knows how important an infrastructure bill is to  our region.   State and local governments in Pennsylvania and across the country  simply don't have enough money to meet basic maintenance needs, much  less to invest in modernization, expansion, or other improvements to  our national infrastructure. That is precisely why the Infrastructure  Investment and Jobs Act is so critical for my district and our national  economy.   The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act will fix our ailing roads  and bridges and fund improvements to other critical infrastructure at  our port and airport. These upgrades are essential to maintain our  region's position as a logistics hub on the East Coast and to ensure  America's competitiveness in a global economy.   America can't engage in international trade if it can't get goods in  and out of the country or across the country due to crumbling  infrastructure and related backlogs in processing.                                time  1900    The COVID pandemic brought into sharp focus how essential the  internet is for Americans to work or find employment, to participate in  remote learning, to access healthcare, to stay connected with friends  and family, and to carry out any number of basic activities in the 21st  century. Yet, millions of Americans live in areas where there is no  broadband infrastructure, or they can't afford it.   Our infrastructure bill will expand broadband access for millions of  Americans, including many of my constituents. In addition to investing  in broadband infrastructure, the bill will also lower prices for  internet service and create a permanent program to help more low-income  households access the internet.   Much like the Federal Government's efforts to provide electricity to  every American nearly a 100 years ago, this effort will be  transformative. It will drastically improve the ability for all  Americans, no matter where they live or their income level, to access  services and opportunities that are essential to modern life.   Another aspect of the infrastructure bill that is important for my  district is the funding it provides for climate resiliency,  particularly flooding. Communities like Eastwick, and economic engines  like the Philadelphia airport, are especially vulnerable to climate  change. We have seen the damage done by flooding, hurricanes, and  even--astonishingly, in southeastern Pennsylvania--tornadoes.   Sadly, these extreme weather events are only getting worse. Funding  from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act will make our  communities safer and our infrastructure more resilient to the impacts  of climate change.   But fixing our Nation's physical infrastructure can only take us so  far. The bipartisan infrastructure bill creates jobs that will provide  new opportunities and reduce costs for many Americans, but it won't  change the calculus for the working mom or dad who can't find adequate  childcare for their kid. It won't improve our schools or prepare for  the future, and it won't reduce the spiraling cost of prescription  drugs.   All of these factors are holding back families from fully  participating in our economy, and in turn, preventing them from buying  homes and building wealth for retirement. Without addressing the  failings of our ``human infrastructure,'' a majority of Americans-- particularly women and people of color--will continue to be held back.  That is why we need universal pre-K, better access to affordable  childcare, a dependable system of care for our seniors, and investments  in higher education and workforce training.   The Build Back Better Act will lower the cost of things that keep  families up at night, while also delivering a massive tax cut for the  middle class through the expanded child tax credit and the earned  income tax credit--giving the middle class more breathing room. That is  what my constituents need.   Already this year, through the American Rescue Plan that we passed in  March, we have seen the child tax credit benefit 126,000 children in my  district alone. That is 76,000 families who got extra help for  essentials like childcare, food, and diapers--much less paying for  school clothes, extracurricular sports, or putting something aside for  college.   By making the most significant investment in children and caregiving  in generations, we are helping individual families and the country as a  whole. Because people--particularly women--can get back to work when  they know that their family members are cared for. And ensuring access  to quality daycare and preschool sets children up for success, making  them more likely to graduate, pursue higher education, hold jobs, pay  taxes, and have higher earnings.   In addition to increasing the maximum for Pell grant awards, the  Build Back Better Act expands opportunities for Americans to  participate in job training programs that prepare them for careers in  fast-growing sectors. This bill is going to help the working people in  PA-05 and across the country.   It will help families like the one I met in Media--a mom who was  beaming about her son's good-paying, new job at the Philadelphia  shipyard, which he got after completing the Maritime Career Development  Program at Delaware County Community College. It will help low-income  workers in my district who work two or more jobs every day but still  can't make ends meet.   It will help families that struggle to pay for the prescription drugs  that keep them alive without forcing them to choose between forgoing  medication or housing or heat or food. And the best part, the Build  Back Better bill is paid for by making those at the top pay their fair  share for a change.   Madam Speaker, 17 Noble Prize-winning economists recently wrote in  support of this legislation, ``Because this agenda invests in long-term  economic capacity and will enhance the ability of more Americans to  participate productively in the economy, it will ease longer-term  inflationary pressures.''   We have the chance to set a new path that creates real, sustained  economic growth and benefits everyone, not just multimillionaires and  real estate developers. It is time to get this done for the American  people.    Madam Speaker, I have heard of other States that have  that problem. I heard Kentucky has a bridge that is out right now that  is desperately in need of repair.
