 Mr. Speaker, Wells Fargo is the Nation's  third largest bank, with nearly $2 trillion in assets. In the past  several  [[Page H7105]]  months, Wells Fargo has engaged in blatant and systemic fraud  perpetrated against millions of its own customers by opening fee- generating accounts without customer authorization, changing mortgage  terms without customer knowledge, and forcing Wells Fargo auto loan  customers into costly insurance products they did not need or want.   Mr. Speaker, Wells Fargo has demonstrated a blatant, egregious  culture of corruption, costing their customers tens of millions of  dollars in unauthorized fees and financial hardship.   Today I am calling on the Federal Housing Administration to ban, to  immediately declare ineligible, Wells Fargo from participation in the  Federal mortgage guarantee program. Wells Fargo has violated its public  trust and that of millions of its own customers and clients.                            ____________________
