 Mr. President, I rise today in support of the  resolution designating January as ``National Trafficking and Modern  Slavery Prevention Month.''   I am proud to introduce this resolution every year to raise awareness  about the ongoing atrocities of human trafficking. We must continue to  support the ongoing partnerships between governments, nonprofits,  service providers, and survivors, who are all working to end human  trafficking.   The human trafficking industry generates an estimated $150 billion in  illegal profits a year. And human trafficking impacts 50 million  victims around the world. Many of the victims of human trafficking are  often difficult to identify and are subjected to manipulation, force,  fraud, and abuse. We cannot turn a blind eye to ongoing exploitation  and forced labor in our country and throughout the world. We have a  responsibility to raise awareness of these horrendous acts, ensure  victims understand that they are not alone, and provide legislative  solutions to support and protect survivors.   Last Congress, I was able to work with my Senate colleagues to  reauthorize the Trafficking Victims Protection Act. By designating  January as ``National Trafficking and Modern Slavery Prevention  Month,'' we will shine a light on the issue and continue the bipartisan  charge to end trafficking and exploitation.   I respectfully ask my colleagues to support this resolution.    Madam President, today I rise to introduce the Crime  Gun Tracing Modernization Act.   This bill would bring ATF into the 21st century by allowing the  Agency to electronically search for the records of guns used in crimes  across the country. It is hard to believe that ATF still must store  paper records and search them by hand in order to identify the guns  used for criminal activity. These archaic rules prevent the people  responsible for enforcing our laws from doing their jobs effectively.   The National Tracing Center at ATF is responsible for quickly placing  crime gun ownership information into the hands of law enforcement  officials so they can solve crimes and save lives. In 2021, National  Tracing Center receive over 540,000 trace requests.   Unfortunately, the timely completion of these trace requests has been  made nearly impossible because ATF cannot search these records  electronically.   To make matters worse, these millions of records are stored in  thousands of boxes that are overflowing the hallways of the National  Tracing Center in Martinsburg, WV. The records that agents must search  through are so massive, ATF has been told that if it places more boxes  inside the facility, the floor may collapse.   Every moment after a crime is committed matters dearly to our law  enforcement agencies. Prohibiting the efficient search of these records  puts our communities at risk.   I thank my former colleague Senator Leahy for championing this bill  last Congress. I am committed to continuing the fight for this  important fix.                                  ______                                         By Mr. THUNE (for himself, Mr. Lankford, Mr. Cotton, Mrs. Hyde-         Smith, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Sullivan, Mr. Rubio, Mr. Barrasso, Mr.          Risch, Mr. Marshall, and Mr. Moran):   S. 204. A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, to prohibit a  health care practitioner from failing to exercise the proper degree of  care in the case of a child who survives an abortion or attempted  abortion; to the Committee on the Judiciary.

Nearly 4 million girls and women across this country participate in  high school and college athletics. Participation in sports has been  shown to provide lifelong benefits to their physical and mental health.  Athletic participation helps develop self-discipline, initiative, and  confidence. When female athletes are supported on the field, they are  empowered to become leaders off of it.   For far too long, the many achievements of women in sports have not  received fair recognition. Female athletes, coaches, and trainers are  consistently paid less than their male counterparts, subjected to  subpar working conditions, and receive substantially less investment  and promotional support for their athletic programs. This country must  do all it can to break down the barriers of discrimination, inequality,  and injustice in sports.   Today's resolution celebrates the tremendous accomplishments of  female athletes across the United States, supports the growth of female  sports, and encourages the next generation of athletes to follow their  dreams.   I thank Senator Capito for leading this important bipartisan  resolution with me, and for all of our supporters in the Senate.                            ____________________
