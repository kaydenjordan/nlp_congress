 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R.  3440, the DREAM Act, to protect DREAMers like Adam, a student at the  University of California Santa Cruz majoring in mathematics.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair would advise that all time has  been yielded for the purpose of debate only.   Does the gentleman from Oklahoma yield for the purpose of this  unanimous consent request?
