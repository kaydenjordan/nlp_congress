 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the commitment,  selflessness, and advocacy of Peyton ``Pete'' Taylor, the owner of a  community pharmacy in our district and our Central Virginian of the  Week.   Mr. Taylor graduated from pharmacy school in 1979. After graduating,  he began operating Goochland Pharmacy to serve our community and  provide patients with healthcare services tailored to their needs.   Despite the evolving pharmaceutical landscape over the past decades,  Mr. Taylor remains committed to providing personalized service to those  in his community. His deep concern for the rising costs of prescription  drugs has made him a vocal advocate for the needs of his customers in  the Goochland community.   Mr. Taylor's knowledge of the challenges facing small business  pharmacies has been a vital resource to my team and me, and I am  grateful for his thoughtful engagement.   Mr. Taylor truly has the best interests of his community at heart,  and I thank him for his 40 years of dedicated service to Goochland and  the greater Seventh District.                            ____________________
