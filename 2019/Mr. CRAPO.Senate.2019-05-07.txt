 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that  notwithstanding the provisions of rule XXII, the cloture votes on the  Reed, Bachus, and Pryor nominations occur at 4 p.m. on Tuesday, May 7;  further, that if cloture is invoked on the nominations on Wednesday,  May 8, at 10 a.m., the Senate vote on the confirmations of the  following persons and nominations in the order listed: Bianco, Reed,  Bachus, and Pryor; that if confirmed, the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table and the President be  immediately notified of the Senate's actions and the Senate resume  consideration of the Dhillon nomination.    Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of several of  the nominations to the Export-Import Bank: Ms. Kimberly Reed, to be  President of the Export-Import Bank; the Honorable Spencer Bachus, to  be a member of the Board of Directors of the Export-Import Bank; and  Ms. Judith Pryor, to be a member of the Board of Directors of the  Export-Import Bank.   These three highly qualified nominees, if confirmed, will be in a  position to ensure that the Export-Import Bank has the ability to  provide finance in response to governments, like China, that provide  aggressive subsidies and place U.S. exporters at a disadvantage.   The President and his team have recently reinforced their commitment  to restoring the ability of the Bank to support American economic  interests in global marketplaces.   The Director of the National Economic Council, Larry Kudlow, recently  noted that the Ex-Im Bank is needed in the current trade environment,  particularly with respect to China, in order for the United States to  compete and succeed in international markets, calling it a ``financial  tool and a national security weapon.''   U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer has called the lack of a  functioning Ex-Im Bank a serious blow to the economy.   Peter Navarro, Director of the Office of Trade and Manufacturing  Policy, has said: ``The costs of keeping the Ex-Im Bank on the  sidelines can be measured in the tens of billions of dollars of  products we fail to export--and in the thousands of jobs we fail to  create when this country does not have a fully functioning export  credit agency to compete with its counterparts around the world.''   It is clear that in our current trade environment, a fully  functioning bank could help the United States better succeed in  international markets.   President Trump's recent budget submission to Congress notes that the  President ``supports a fully functioning Ex-Im Bank to implement  reforms and help American exporters compete in an increasingly unfair  global marketplace.''   As President of the Export-Import Bank, Kimberly Reed will be able to  draw from an already distinguished career in public service, having  previously served as a senior adviser to former Treasury Secretaries  Paulson and Snow, as well as on several congressional committees.   During her nomination hearing, she committed to focusing on strong  standards of conduct, increased transparency, sound risk management  practices, and eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse.   I can testify that she has gone out of her way to make herself  available to all Senators on both sides of the aisle to introduce  herself and to answer any questions the Senators have and to discuss  any reforms and improvements  [[Page S2668]]  she may be able to make to the Bank when she is confirmed.   Former Representative Bachus and I were elected to the House of  Representatives in the same term and worked closely together in the  House for a number of years. He served the Sixth District of Alabama  from 1993 to 2015. During that time, he served as both chairman and  ranking member of the House Financial Services Committee. He is a  pragmatic conservative and has demonstrated a longstanding commitment  to promoting economic opportunity.   Finally, a native of Cleveland, OH, Ms. Pryor has spent the majority  of her career in the private sector, working with international  businesses, many in the high-tech industry. More recently, she has  served as the Vice President of External Affairs at the Overseas  Private Investment Corporation under President Obama. During her  confirmation hearing, Ms. Pryor expressed a commitment to particularly  help raise awareness of the Export-Import Bank's financing products for  small businesses and community banks.   While it is not really being included in the coverage of these  nomination votes as being one of the consequences of there being a lack  of a quorum on the Board, it is important to understand another  important reason to confirm not one but all three of these nominees.   When the Export-Import Bank was last reauthorized in 2015, Congress  implemented a number of reforms to the Bank. However, by not confirming  a quorum of at least three Board members for the last several years,  Congress has actually impeded implementation of a number of its own  reforms, which require a vote of a quorum of the Board for approval.   These reforms include appointing a chief ethics officer, appointing a  chief risk officer, forming a risk management committee, implementing  new guidelines to expedite small business loans under $25 million, and  developing an expanded medium-term program to finance and ensure  transactions up to $25 million.   We have many colleagues who have said there need to be reforms  implemented in order for them to further support operation of the Bank,  and they would like to work with us on the Banking Committee to pursue  those reforms. I support reforms, too, and look forward to working with  interested colleagues, but we need to understand that we will need a  quorum on the Ex-Im Bank to finalize them.   For any previous or future congressionally directed reforms to be  implemented, Senators need to support all three nominations before the  Senate this week in order to restore the quorum necessary to implement  those reforms.   The Banking Committee approved each of these nominees with broad  bipartisan support earlier this year. Each will be an asset to the  Bank's Board, and I urge my colleagues to support these nominations.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I have 5 requests for committees to meet  during today's session of the Senate.
