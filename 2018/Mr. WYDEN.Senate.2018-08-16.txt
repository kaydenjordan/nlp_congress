 Mr. President, I thank Senator Whitehouse not just for  today, as we talk about wildfires, but because, year after year, he has  been on this floor, prosecuting the consequences--playing out the  consequences of the failure of dealing with climate change. Certainly,  it is hotter and dryer in the West. What I am going to do is to spend  some of this short period we have together in describing these  wildfires.  [[Page S5677]]  They are not your grandfather's wildfires. They are bigger, they are  hotter, and they are more powerful.   In my home State last summer, we saw a fire leap the Columbia River.  The Columbia River has always been a break in terms of fire, and the  fire just leaped over it. We are seeing that around the country. It is  getting worse. The fires are so bad today and the smoke is so thick  that people in my home State are fleeing their communities to find  pockets of breathable air. In Portland, residents are being warned  against spending time outside and are being advised to wear respirators  if they must. Those without homes to provide safe air are being told to  seek shelter from the smoke in public places, like libraries and  government buildings.   So I would say to my friend and to the Presiding Officer, who is also  a westerner and a friend, that this is not the stuff of fiction. This  is real life--right now--for communities across the West that are just  getting clobbered by fire. This is climate change at work.   As Senator Whitehouse and I speak today, there are more than 100  large wildfires that are destroying homes and businesses across Oregon  and the West, burning almost 1.8 million acres. Farmers have watched as  crops have burned to the ground. Families who are located in evacuation  zones have fled their homes. Choking smoke throughout my State has left  children and seniors afraid to go outside, and schools have canceled  sporting events because of the unhealthy air quality.   I remember when I began in public service that westerners would  prepare for individual fire seasons and that some would be a bit worse  than others. Yet now we are basically in a situation in which we have  infernos raging throughout the year. In California, for example, the  Thomas fire set the all-time record--wouldn't want to have it--as the  State's largest recorded wildfire in December. It was not exactly a  Christmas gift. The record didn't stand long, as my colleague just  mentioned last week's fire in Mendocino.   In Oregon, the Taylor Creek fire and the Garner Complex fire led  agencies to issue evacuation notices to more than 1,000 people. This is  the second year in a row that the air quality in southern Oregon has  ranked among the worst in the Nation. When I was driving to southern  Oregon recently in order to get a briefing from fire officials, the  smoke, in effect, was going north, drifting 100 miles north of Medford.  In my hometown of Portland, now--this week--air is at unhealthy levels.   Fires have gotten so big that the plumes of thick, choking smoke have  shown up on NASA's satellite images from space. My colleague and I  served on the Intelligence Committee together, and I think,  increasingly, we are going to see folks at the Forest Service and at  weather agencies who will be interested in a lot of those kinds of  satellite opportunities in order to get a better handle on the  dimensions of the problem. A huge portion of my State is blanketed with  smoke, and this is taking place when hikers, fishermen, rafters, and  guides, along with countless tourists from around the country, ought to  be enjoying the outdoors. Talking about economic consequences,  recreation has become a big economic engine in the West.   I am very pleased to have been the sponsor of a bill with Chairman   Rob Bishop, who I think would be pleased if I called him one of the  most conservative Members of the other body. Our bill is called the RNR  bill, Recreation Not Red-Tape. It is just sensible suggestions for  putting permitting information online--those sorts of things.   It is pretty hard to recreate in the West, Senator Sullivan, if  everything is burning up. It is pretty hard to really cap the potential  of this extraordinary new recreation engine, but right now dangerous  fires and unhealthy smoke are blocking recreation opportunities for  folks in the West to get outside. It is an economic nightmare, in  addition to being a danger to life and property.   We don't remember wildfires this catastrophic happening 30 years ago,  and people want to know why. My view is it is not a coincidence that  the megafires now happen routinely and are getting bigger, and a  significant factor in this is climate change.   According to research by Oregon State University, our average  temperature has increased by more than 2 degrees over the past century.  Last week, the National Weather Service issued an excessive heat  warning for the Willamette Valley, advising that the heat could touch  100 degrees. This is not Death Valley. The Presiding Officer knows our  area. We don't get roasted by triple-digit heat--or we didn't used to.  But we are today.   The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced that  the contiguous United States experienced the warmest July in recorded  history. The temperature hikes bake forests and landscapes. They dry  out materials, and they are magnets--magnets--for fuel for the  infernos. Yet the Trump administration, as Senator Whitehouse has  talked about, seems to be working overtime to say that this isn't a  problem.   For starters, the President pulled the United States out of the Paris  climate agreement, which would make us the only country to reject it.  Senator Whitehouse knows more about this than any other Senator. What I  was particularly troubled about is that the arguments they made weren't  tethered to the facts. They kept saying that there were all kinds of  mandates in the agreement. As my colleague knows, there really aren't.  It is voluntary. There is a wide berth for countries to pursue  strategies that make sense for them.   It is not just pulling out of the international agreement. At the  Department of the Interior, Secretary Zinke is doing everything he can  to roll back environmental protections.   I say to my colleague: I was one who voted for Secretary Zinke. He  said that he was going to be a Roosevelt Republican. The Presiding  Officer would be interested in this. He said that nine times in his  hearing in the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. I thought, he is  a Duck; he said he was a football player. I was a basketball player. I  would give it a shot. I now consider that one of the worst votes I have  cast in my time in public service because he is doing everything he can  to roll back environmental protections, giving oil and gas executives  free rein to exploit public lands, and he is putting an end to  commonsense regulations to curb emissions of methane, a dangerous  greenhouse gas.   The story doesn't get better at the Energy Department. They are there  wrapping themselves into a legal pretzel to figure out how to waste  taxpayer money to prop up the coal industry, an energy source whose  costs are too great for the market to bear.   Over at the EPA, the Environmental Protection Agency, they are  rolling back fuel standards for cars. That is a double loser. It is bad  for the environment and bad for the consumers who are going to have to  pony up $1 trillion more at the pump. While the Federal Government is  abandoning leadership, they are also browbeating the States to do the  same thing.   The Trump administration now threatens California's ability to set  its own air quality standards under the Clean Air Act, which affects 12  other States, including Oregon. How many times, colleagues, have we  heard Senators come to the floor of the Senate and virtually pound on  their chests and say that the States are the laboratories of democracy?   Basically, on climate change, Senator Whitehouse, what the Trump  administration is saying is that they are for State's rights if they  think the State is right. That is their position on climate change. It  is clear that we are not seeing any real movement from the Trump  administration.   Two weeks ago, the President tweeted several times that water from  Northern California is being diverted to the Pacific Ocean rather than  being used for firefighting. State officials and Republicans-- California veteran Republicans--essentially said that this was  nonsense. When the President's press office was asked about the tweet,  really, they went completely silent.   The megafires are the new normal, so westerners are going to have to  embrace new, cooperative, and collaborative ways of dealing with the  effects of climate change. Our priority ought to be to work with the  States. Government at all levels should continue to develop more  efficient, low-carbon energy technologies, renewables, and energy  storage. It is a winner all around for Oregon, the West, and our  country.  [[Page S5678]]  Not only are solar and wind cleaner, they are also cheaper than a  number of the plants that burn fossil fuels.   What we said in our tax reform bill is that there are more than 40  separate breaks in energy, many of them just monuments to yesteryear.  We proposed throwing them in the trash can. Out they go, $40 billion  worth over a few years, substituting the $40 billion for clean energy,  clean transportation fuel, and energy efficiency. That is going to be  in line with what Senator Whitehouse has said, which is that America  can get more green for less green, or fewer taxpayer dollars.   I very much appreciate my colleague coming to the floor today. I want  to close with just one point. More than any other factor of my time in  public service--I think I have discussed this with both the Presiding  Officer and Senator Whitehouse--what I have been interested in finding  is what I call principled bipartisanship. Bipartisanship is not about  Republicans and Democrats taking each other's dumb ideas. Anybody can  do that. Then you can pat yourself on the back and say: Oh, my  goodness, we are being bipartisan. What it is all about is finding good  ideas.   What Senator Whitehouse has done--and, boy, do the fires in the West  right now convey the urgency; in effect, he has tried to take markets,  marketplace forces, and fuse them together with the best environmental  practices we know of. Both sides ought to find that pretty attractive.  Conservatives can say: Senator Whitehouse is talking about using  marketplace forces--and he has attracted some pretty prominent  Republicans to his ideas, as well--and Democrats can say: We are not  going to dawdle in terms of trying to improve the environment, and we  are not going to turn back the clock on environmental practices.   I very much appreciate Senator Whitehouse's leadership. I am going to  have to run off to another meeting. I will just say that I appreciate  his including me.   I say to my colleagues: It might not be that wildfires are happening  in your State this morning, but climate change affects every single  American in one way or another, and we have to find a way to create a  bipartisan path to address this growing harm.   With thanks to Senator Whitehouse, I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I lend my support to the Fairness for  High-Skilled Immigrants Act to ensure the equality of opportunity for  all.   Throughout our history, America has been committed to opening its  doors to those who wished to build a new life here; yet, despite being  ``the land of opportunity,'' the laws that we have had in place have  left many families seeking a better life in limbo. Over the last 2  years, the crisis has reached new levels of inhumanity as this  administration irresponsibly ended the Deferred Action for Childhood  Arrivals, DACA, program and ripped families apart at our borders.   This legislation should be considered in the context of a more  comprehensive bill which would also address the pressing issues of DACA  and family separation. It will be an important piece of the puzzle that  will hopefully put us on a path to changing the unfair laws that are  currently in place and once again makeAmerica a place of possibility  for all. The Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act makes important  and long overdue changes that will create a more equitable employment- based immigration system. This system will distribute green cards based  not on the applicant's country of birth, but on his or her skills. It  will slowly get rid of the employment-based country caps and instead  create an evenhanded ``first come, first serve'' system for equally  qualified, highly skilled immigrants.   This legislation is an important step towards more comprehensive  immigration reform. The system as it is now is rigged and unfair. I  hope that we can begin to move towards a more comprehensive bill and a  brighter future where America is once again, without a doubt, the land  of opportunity.                            ____________________
