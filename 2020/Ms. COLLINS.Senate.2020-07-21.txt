 Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill with my  colleague, Senator Smith that will help the hardworking loggers across  this Nation whose operations have suffered serious losses directly due  to the pandemic. In Maine alone, logging has a roughly $650 million  annual economic impact, and is the backbone of the forest products  economy. The industry is made up of countless multi-generational family  businesses, whose survival is being seriously threatened.   In Maine and in many places across the Country, the logging industry  first felt the effects of COVID-19 in January as exports to foreign  markets were significantly limited if not eliminated entirely. Declines  in demand for paper products and other wood fiber based products caused  by the COVID-19 pandemic have prompted shutdowns, slowdowns, and  closures across the globe. As a result, Maine has seen declining demand  for wood from mills across the board, and low prices and quotas driven  by that lack of demand. And while timber prices have remained  relatively stable, mills have drastically reduced their processing  capacity--resulting in a ripple effect that has hit loggers and timber  hauling companies hard.   The Professional Logging Contractors of Maine projects at least a 20  percent reduction in the annual harvest, which would threaten more than  600 jobs and represent the potential loss of $86 million in economic  activity in my State. The explosion of a pulp digester earlier this  year at a mill in Jay, coupled with the recent shutdown of a paper  machine at another mill in Westbrook, have compounded the harm imposed  by the pandemic.   Although the industry is certainly not alone in its struggles during  this time, it faces unique challenges, including high capital costs  relative to payroll and the fact that payroll costs do not reflect the  amounts paid to independent contractors. And unlike some of our farmers  who have been able to access direct payments from USDA and our  fishermen who were allocated relief funding in the CARES Act, our  forestry professionals have not been provided targeted assistance.   The legislation we are introducing today would direct the Secretary  of Agriculture to provide financial assistance to loggers and timber  hauling businesses that have experienced at least a 10 percent loss in  revenues from January 2020 through July 2020 as compared to the same  timeframe last year. The amount would be equal to 10 percent of 2019  gross revenues and could only be used for operating expenses, including  payroll. I am grateful for the American Logging Council's support of  our legislation, and urge my colleagues  [[Page S4351]]  to join in this effort to support one of our country's core economic  drivers.   Loggers and forestry industry professionals were rightfully deemed  essential workers during this public health crisis, and we must ensure  that they receive the support necessary to emerge from this downturn.                                  ______                                         By Mr. REED (for himself, Ms. Murkowski, Mr. Jones, and Mr.          Tillis):   S. 4237. A bill to extend zero interest rate benefits and payment  suspension to all Federal student loan borrowers, and for other  purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.
