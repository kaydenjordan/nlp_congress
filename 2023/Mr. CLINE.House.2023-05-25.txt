 Mr. Speaker, the communities throughout the Sixth  Congressional District of Virginia and, in fact, every community across  our Nation are now border communities because of the deadly fentanyl  pouring through our open borders under the failed leadership of  President Joe Biden and Secretary Mayorkas.   Since October, Customs and Border Patrol agents have seized over  14,000 pounds of fentanyl, enough to kill over 3.1 billion people. Even  in western Virginia, drug cartels have been caught smuggling rainbow- colored fentanyl with the intent of targeting our children.   Just last year, roughly 75,000 people died of drug overdoses from  synthetic opioids, largely illicit fentanyl or fentanyl-related  substances.   That is why, today, the House will be voting for the HALT Fentanyl  Act because enough is enough.   This legislation would raise penalties for fentanyl traffickers under  the Controlled Substances Act, support research to understand the  devastating mental health effects of fentanyl-related substances, and  supply law enforcement with the resources needed to keep this drug off  our streets.    While our President has no plans to fix open borders or stop deadly  fentanyl from being smuggled into our interior, the House will take  action today to protect innocent lives by passing this important  legislation.                            ____________________
