 Mr. President, unfortunately, rates of suicide have risen  to epidemic levels in the United States, with suicide now the tenth  leading cause of death in the country. On average, there are 129  suicides every day, roughly one every eleven minutes, a staggering  statistic. That is why I am pleased to be introducing the Suicide  Prevention Lifeline Improvement Act with Senator Moran to help turn the  tide on this increasingly dire situation.   This legislation would provide $568 million in new funding over five  years for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, delivering an  infusion of new funds to help improve call capacity, make improvements  to the Lifeline, and make the switch to a new, easy-to-remember, three- digit number, 9-8-8. The Lifeline has long been underfunded, but we  have worked on a bipartisan basis to more than double the funding over  the last three years. However, much more is needed, and this new  legislation will help build on these efforts to ensure that the  Lifeline is able to answer the calls of those seeking help.   In 2019, 47,500 Americans lost their lives to suicide. That same  year, there were 1.4 million suicide attempts. We must renew our  efforts on suicide prevention. In 2004, working with my colleague,  former Senator Gordon Smith of Oregon, we authored the Garrett Lee  Smith Memorial Act. This law authorized new youth suicide prevention  programs in honor of Senator's Smith son, who tragically died by  suicide just a couple of weeks short of his 22nd birthday. For over a  decade, these programs have funded college campus, state, and tribal  efforts to prevent suicide among our youth and young adult populations,  who are particularly at risk of suicide. During this time, youth  suicide rates have decreased significantly in my home state of Rhode  Island. However, nationwide, suicide rates have skyrocketed.   That is why we must renew our attention and focus on suicide  prevention, including by increasing funding for, and improving access  to, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. This effort is critical  to ensuring that when people in crisis call looking for help, someone  will be there on the  [[Page S5021]]  other end of the line to offer hope and counseling. Last Congress, I  was able to work with my former colleague Senator Gardner, and Senators  Baldwin and Moran on legislation to designate the Lifeline as an easy  to remember, three-digit number, 988. This common-sense law will make  it easier for people across the country to access the Lifeline when  they really need it. I am glad that the bill was signed into law last  year, paving the way for every state to implement the switch to 9-8-8  by July 2022. This upcoming deadline, however, makes it all the more  important that we provide more funding for the Lifeline.   I am pleased to once again have the opportunity to partner with  Senator Moran on suicide prevention efforts. I look forward to working  together with our colleagues, as well as stakeholders supporting these  efforts, to pass this critical legislation.                            ____________________     Mr. President, unfortunately, rates of suicide have risen  to epidemic levels in the United States, with suicide now the tenth  leading cause of death in the country.
