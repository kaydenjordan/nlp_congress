 Mr. Chair, I rise in support of my amendment to ensure  that Purple Heart and Medal of Honor recipients, veterans with service- connected disabilities, and former prisoners of war have access to  military exchanges, commissaries, and morale, welfare, and recreation  facilities.   We should all agree that these heroes of our Armed Forces have done  more than enough to earn this access. It is our duty as a Nation to not  only say that we appreciate their service, but also to enact policies  such as this demonstrating this gratitude.   A 2017 Defense Department report shows expanding access will not only  make life easier for these veterans, but will also strengthen the  commissary and exchange system.   This amendment has been endorsed by the VFW, American Legion,  Military Order of the Purple Heart, Wounded Warrior Project, Disabled  American Veterans, and AMVETS.   Mr. Chair, I thank Congressman Walter Jones for joining me on the  bill and on this amendment. I thank the chair and ranking member for  including my amendment in this bloc and for their work on this bill,  and I urge my colleagues to support these amendments.
