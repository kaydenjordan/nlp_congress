 Mr. Speaker, first, I would like to join my friend  from Texas, as the author of the Violence Against Women Act.   In 2018, I encouraged my colleagues to step up and pass this vital  legislation that now protects all who have been abused in some way from  sexual assault, sexual harassment, stalking, and, yes, domestic  violence.   I am saddened that the House has not seen fit to join this bill that  I have authored with over 35 national nonpartisan groups and, as well,  with over 150-plus Members of the United States Congress. It is time  now.   Finally, sitting in the United States Senate, listening to the  hearings regarding Judge Kavanaugh and Dr. Ford, let me say that I hope  our colleagues will yield not to politics but to the rule of law,  adhere to the American Bar Association that says pause, to the Jesuits  who have taken away their endorsement, and realize that we are not the  important factor, but it was the weight of the Supreme Court that  requires better.   Finally, I am delighted to note that we are moving forward on  juvenile justice, as we have done today--legislation that I have  authored--and that we are working on behalf of the people.   But again, Mr. Speaker, it is important in the United States Senate  that the rule of law and the Constitution prevail. Advice and consent  must be given with knowledge.                            ____________________
