 I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Better  Energy  [[Page S3063]]  Storage Technology Act. I am pleased to be partnering with Senator  Heinrich on this initiative. I would also like to thank Senator  Gardner, Senator Smith, Senator Coons, Senator McSally, and Senator  King who have joined us as original cosponsors of the BEST Act.   Our bipartisan bill supports narrowly tailored energy storage  research to develop the next generation of technologies at the  Department of Energy. Advancing next generation energy storage  technology will allow us to integrate more renewables into the power  grid, such as wind energy or solar energy which, in turn, will help to  reduce emissions and slow climate change.   Energy storage systems provide a wide range of benefits. First, these  technologies increase the reliability and the resilience of the  electric grid by limiting potential disruptions. Energy storage helps  us to better manage supply and demand on the grid and allows for the  expanded use of renewable energy. The reliability of our grid and grid- scale storage systems go hand-in-hand.   Second, this type of technology can decrease energy costs, a goal  that we all share. In Maine, the price of electricity rises steeply  during the coldest days of the year. For example, in late 2017 and  early 2018, very cold temperatures in New England led to higher energy  costs--more than a billion dollars in the wholesale energy market--in  just 15 days.   The next generation of energy storage technologies could help to  transform our grid, meaning that we would no longer need to generate  more expensive power to meet demands during the hottest and coldest  days of the year. Instead, we could use more affordable energy sources  that have been stored for later use.   Third, energy storage systems can allow for more intermittent  renewable sources, such as wind and solar power, to be placed on the  grid and used precisely when they are needed. The Aqua Ventus, a  floating, deepwater offshore wind project being developed by the  University of Maine and a consortium of groups, could benefit from  energy storage innovation. Off the coast of Maine, there are very  strong and consistent winds where offshore wind turbines can produce  electricity almost 50 percent of the time. This next generation storage  technology will ensure that we can use this wind power closer to 100  percent of the time by storing electricity to use when the wind isn't  blowing.   One of the biggest hurdles to commercializing energy storage is cost.  To overcome this obstacle, our bill specifically directs the Department  of Energy to work to decrease the cost of this exciting technology.  This is similar to the Department's SunShot initiative that decreased  the price of solar power by approximately 75 percent in less than a  decade.   Furthermore, energy storage systems are technology neutral. This bill  will foster innovation and enhance deployment of these innovative  technologies without picking winners or losers.   Specifically, our bill would do the following: It would focus energy  storage research on highly flexible, longer duration, and seasonal  storage systems. It would support five energy storage demonstration  projects. The bill would create a strategic plan and allow the  Department of Energy to develop cost targets. It would coordinate  research and support the coordination of research. Finally, the bill  would authorize $60 million annually for each of the next 5 years.   I am pleased to report that our bipartisan bill has earned very broad  support, including the endorsements of the Bipartisan Policy Center,  Citizens for Responsible Energy Solutions, ClearPath, Edison Electric  Institute, Energy Storage Association, the Information Technology and  Innovation Foundation, the National Audubon Society, the Natural  Resources Council of Maine, the National Hydropower Association, Solar  Energy Industries Association, the Union of Concerned Scientists, and  the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.   Frankly, it has been a long time since I have seen a bill be able to  attract that much support from groups that have different ideological  goals, and I am very proud that we were able to line up the support of  all of those groups.   The BEST Act will help advance energy storage technologies to improve  the efficiency of our Nation's electrical grid while helping to promote  the wider use of clean, renewable energy. The goals of this bill are  those which I would hope every Member of this body could embrace. I  urge my colleagues to support this legislation.   Thank you, Mr. President.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Better  Energy  [[Page S3063]]  Storage Technology Act.
