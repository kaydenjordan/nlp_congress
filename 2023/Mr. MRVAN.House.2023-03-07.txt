 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 20, the  Richard L. Trumka Protecting the Right to Organize Act of 2023,  legislation that honors the name and tireless advocacy of my friend who  passed away all too soon.   Throughout my career in public office, I have been proud to stand  with organized labor and American workers. Unions are the backbone of  the northwest Indiana economy, and we must do all we can to fight for  the right to collectively bargain.   The PRO Act improves the ability for all workers to form a union and  improve their ability to collectively bargain for fair wages, safe  working conditions, access to healthcare benefits, and a secure  retirement.   I appreciate the continued leadership of Ranking Member  Bobby Scott  and my colleagues on the Education and Workforce Committee, and I  encourage all of my colleagues to join me in standing with our workers  in supporting the PRO Act.                            ____________________
