 Mr. President, I voted against the nomination of Merrick  Garland to be Attorney General because President Biden's campaign  promises included permitting the Department of Justice to take  unilateral and unconstitutional actions to infringe upon Second  Amendment rights. Gun control advocacy groups applaud these promises  and encourage even more executive actions to erode the right to keep  and bear firearms. Absent an explicit promise from Judge Garland to  respect the Second Amendment, my oath to defend the Constitution  prevented me from voting to confirm him as Attorney General.                            ____________________
