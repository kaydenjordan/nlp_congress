 Mr. President, I am going to make remarks on two subjects  and I believe I will go a bit longer than 10 minutes. I ask unanimous  consent to speak for up to 20 minutes as in morning business.    Thank you very much, Mr. President.   I am going to talk first about the devastating fires that are  pounding my State, and then I am going to talk about the new  legislation introduced earlier today by our colleagues Senator Graham,  Senator Cassidy, and Senator Heller.   With respect to the fires, I spent much of last weekend essentially  going from one base camp to another, visiting six counties to get  updates at fire camps and emergency operation centers. In these  travels, I saw major fires burning in Oregon from our northern border  with Washington State to our southern border with California. Two of  these fires were so large that they covered more than one county. So I  believed it was important to visit both their eastern and their western  fronts. Doing so in each case took almost 2 hours of driving from just  one side of the fire to the other.   Of the 1.5 million acres burning in the West last weekend, almost  500,000  [[Page S5475]]  were burning in my home State alone. Now, there are 17 fires burning in  Oregon. Thousands of Oregonians have been evacuated this summer, and  thousands more are facing the prospect of evacuation.   Thousands of firefighters from Oregon and all over this country have  been putting themselves in harm's way to help Oregon battle these  infernos. From the Columbia River Gorge on the Washington border to  Oregon's southwest corner, hundreds of miles away on the California  border, I felt it was an enormous honor just to be able to say thank  you to the thousands of hard-working men and women who are battling  these life-threatening blazes.   I met with emergency service responders on the Eagle Creek fire in  the gorge. The Chetco Bar fire in Southwestern Oregon that stretches  across Jackson and Josephine Counties, the Jones fire in Lane County,  and the Miller Complex fire in Jackson County. In each of these  settings, I met men and women who exemplify what I call the Oregon way.  The Oregon way isn't written down anywhere. It isn't a law or a rule,  it is an ethic. It is an ethic where Oregonians step up and make sure  friends and neighbors aren't in jeopardy, and the Oregon way is all  about Oregonians staying on the job until it is finished.   I was also very moved by the presence of those from all over the  country who came to our State, sometimes from thousands of miles away,  to help save Oregon treasures--people from California, Arizona, all the  way from the east coast and many points in between who came to Oregon  to help out. It was just stunning to meet folks from Florida who, while  worrying about their friends and loved ones in the path of Hurricane  Irma, were up and working on our natural disaster, which is wildfire.   To get this job done right for generations to come, you have to  recognize the inescapable proposition that the fires are getting  hotter, they are getting bigger, and they are getting much more  dangerous to fight. In one example, I heard how the Eagle Creek fire  raced 13 miles in 15 hours, and it burned with such ferocity, with high  winds, that it jumped the Columbia River. It jumped the river to start  a fire on the Washington side of the gorge. For those who might not be  familiar with normal fire behavior, I want to just take a minute and  say how serious that is. Usually a river, and certainly a river as  large as the Columbia, acts as a natural fire break, but these fires we  are seeing today are not normal fires. These are not your grandfather's  fires. These are gargantuan, dangerous fires. I haven't seen anything  like it, along with my friend who has been on the Natural Resources  Committee for a long time. This year is on track to be the worst fire  in history in terms of total acres burned.   The Washington Post newspaper on Friday reported that with the dozens  of fires that have spread across the West, an area larger than the size  of Maryland has been burned straight through.   The way the Federal Government has historically paid for fighting  fires is just plain wrong, and it leads to a cycle that adds fuel to  these exceptionally dangerous fires. I have been on this floor raising  this issue. I served as the chairman of the Energy and Natural  Resources Committee not too long ago. Our committee has heard in  hearings again and again about the dangers fires pose to our community,  but the system for funding fire prevention in a timely way before our  country has to spend so much more money for putting the fires out  hasn't been fixed. That system is still broken as we discuss it here  today.   Last week, I came to the Senate floor and talked about this subject  the same day Congress passed legislation to keep the government open  for 3 more months and provide aid for the recovery efforts after  Hurricane Harvey. Thankfully, that legislation also included funding to  ensure the Forest Service can refill the funds the agency is being  forced to borrow from fire prevention accounts to fight the fires now,  but that funding, certainly necessary now, doesn't fix the long-term  problem.   The Congress must make sure the Forest Service has the resources it  needs to treat the forest before they burn, to help deal with this  issue before the forest burns, because that will make them more flame  resistant and stronger in terms of the capacity to deal particularly  with the heat and lightning strikes and fuel buildup.   Let me lay out the steps the Congress needs to take in the coming  days. First, Congress needs to lock in disaster funding to get the  communities devastated by wildfires back on their feet. They are facing  destroyed homes and businesses. Recreational areas that are the  lifeblood of a lot of western communities have been destroyed. They  lost timber revenue. The cleanup and restoration efforts are going to  be tough and costly. So that is step 1 on this to-do list.   Step 2 is fixing the broken disaster fueling budget system known in  the West as fire borrow. As the government spends more on fighting  fires, it has stolen, in the past, funds that are supposed to go to  fire prevention so the money isn't there to thin out the dead and dying  material from our forests, and all it takes is one spark to start an  inferno. The problem is only going to get bigger year after year as  climate change roasts the landscapes across the West and wreaks havoc  across the Nation. This has gone on for years. It is leading to bigger,  more threatening fires, and it is critical that this Congress put a  stop to it.   Other parts of our Nation faced horrible natural disasters over the  last several weeks with hurricanes battering Texas, Florida, and much  of the South. The way the government pays for firefighting right now  would be like funding emergency hurricane response teams with the money  that is supposed to pay for levies and sandbags for the next storm. The  practice of fire borrowing that has plagued so many western communities  just defies common sense.   Years ago, along with my colleague from Idaho, Senator Crapo, I  introduced a fix to this problem with the Wildfire Disaster Funding  Act. Senator Crapo and I feel like we have been at it longer than the  Trojan War. We have been at this year after year, and now we have the  support of 261 groups and experts, folks in the forestry industry,  environmental folks, scientists. Senator Crapo, as chairman of the  Banking Committee, has another bill that, in effect, builds on this  work we have done for years. I support his sensible proposal as well.   The bottom line is, the West cannot wait any longer for Congress to  send them help and repair for the long term, which is fixing this  broken system that shortchanges prevention and adds fuel to the raging  wildfires. There is bipartisan commitment to solving this crisis, and I  know Senators across the West, where these fires are burning, have been  going on exactly the same kind of tours I went on last weekend. I am  sure they met, as I did, these incredibly dedicated, courageous  firefighters who are just working themselves to exhaustion. I am sure  they heard from many of the same types of operations teams about the  fight they are facing.   Those men and women on the frontlines fighting fire are doing their  part. It is time for the Congress to do ours. Let's make sure our  communities have the funds they need to fight fires, put the fires out.  Once and for all, let us end this bizarre, commonsense-defying budget  process called fire borrowing that, in effect, has the Federal  Government consistently shorting prevention and then having to spend  more down the road when we have these enormous fires as a result of the  fact that you haven't gone in there to clean out that dead material.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I would like to turn to healthcare. For me,  healthcare has always been the most important issue. It goes back to my  days when I was director of the Oregon Gray Panthers. I have always  felt, as a general proposition, that it is extraordinarily important  for us to pursue bipartisan approaches in this space. I have focused on  that, and, frankly, I got a lot of welts on my back to show for it.   I was very proud last night to be able to work with Chairman Hatch,  and we have, in effect, announced the beginning of an agreement to deal  with the Children's Health Insurance Program, a bipartisan approach,  and do it in a responsible way. Obviously, there are other steps to go,  but I think it reflects, again, a big, important issue in  [[Page S5476]]  polarized political times--the Finance Committee trying to find common  ground.   The reality is, the principles around which healthcare reform has  traditionally been based are still pretty valid. I believe, as the  ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, that healthcare is a  basic human right. I also believe our colleagues on the other side of  the aisle have valid points as well about having a role for the private  sector in the delivery of healthcare. So I have long used those kind of  bedrock principles to guide me with respect to healthcare, and that is  why I wanted to come to the floor today to talk about what was just  announced by Republican Senators--Republican Senators only--to make one  last attempt to roll back Americans' healthcare before they lose the  opportunity to take advantage of the special rules that would allow  partisan-only approaches, and they expire at the end of the month.   As I said, my focus--as was the case last night with Chairman Hatch,  and we are far from done here--was to find common ground with respect  to a critical program for children.   Earlier today, our colleagues, Senators Graham, Cassidy, and Heller,  introduced a partisan bill that, in my view, might be the most harmful  version of TrumpCare yet, so I wanted to take a few minutes this  evening to explain why this type of legislation is still a bad deal for  American families.   This legislation that has been authored by the three Republican  Senators gives a super block grant--a blank check--to the States so  that they can do whatever they want to Americans' healthcare. Based on  everything else I have seen this year, that is going to mean an awful  lot of pain for vulnerable people and an open door to the worst abuses  of insurance companies, which had been relegated to the history books  when the Affordable Care Act was passed. My view is that this is  probably the largest healthcare devolution in history, which is pretty  much sending it to the States and saying: Have at it.   First of all, the bill ends Medicaid as Americans know it today. This  year's debate over healthcare made one matter clear--that Medicaid  matters. It pays for the healthcare of America's most vulnerable and  serves as a safety net for the people who might not think they will  need it. It covers nursing home care for older Americans who spend down  their hard-earned savings. It pays for addiction treatment services for  those who are struggling with opioids, as millions of Americans are  today. It helps Americans with disabilities live healthy, productive  lives in their communities rather than in institutions. That is just  the tip of the iceberg of the good work Medicaid does for those from  Portland, OR, to Portland, ME. Under the legislation that I am  discussing--Graham-Cassidy-Heller--that is gone.   The plan ends the expanded Medicaid coverage that 11 million  Americans count on today. It puts a cap on Medicaid and offers hundreds  of billions less in support from the Federal Government. It is  essentially telling States ``good luck'' and is asking them to make all  of the hard decisions about which Americans will get adequate  healthcare and which people will go without. History tells us that the  most vulnerable Americans who are without a voice or a powerful lobby  are inevitably going to be the ones worse off.   There is one more step that this bill takes that is different from  previous versions of TrumpCare and similar proposals. Rather than  reducing the tax credits that help Americans get help, which is similar  to earlier Republican approaches, this bill just gets rid of them. It  gets rid of them completely. That means asking States to use their  Federal health block grants to cover Medicaid, nursing home care, care  for those with disabilities, addiction treatment, tax credits for  healthcare, and more--and all from the same pot of money. To me, that  is a recipe for a healthcare disaster.   This proposal also opens up loopholes for the big insurance companies  to undermine key consumer protections--those that bar discrimination  against those who have preexisting conditions and set essential  benefits that all Americans are entitled to receive.   I thought we were done with those days--the days when, in effect,  healthcare worked for the healthy and the wealthy and when we had  discrimination against those with preexisting conditions. Basically,  unless you were healthy and did not have a preexisting condition or  unless you were wealthy and could pay for your healthcare costs, you  were really in deep trouble. As far as I can tell, this new proposal  undermines those key consumer protections that bar discrimination  against those who have preexisting conditions, and it takes us back.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed for up to 10 more  minutes.    Mr. President and colleagues, thank you for your courtesy.   During the TrumpCare debate, it was clear that unraveling the  consumer protections that Americans count on today causes the whole  system to come apart at the expense of those who need healthcare the  most.   I have heard the authors of this bill argue that the States will be  able to keep the Affordable Care Act or do it their own way, but this  bill asks each State to do a whole lot more with a whole lot less. That  does not sound like a prescription for State innovation; it sounds like  more of the same failed, partisan approach that the public witnessed  earlier this year.   I know a bit about State innovation and have enjoyed talking with the  distinguished President of the Senate about it. I wrote the provision  that is currently in law that says that States have a chance to do  better, not worse. What the States have been most interested in up  until now is something called reinsurance, and the States that have  been making headway in terms of their getting the green light from the  Federal Government have used the existing law that I wrote. Yet the  idea of letting States do worse is a different story, and it sure looks  to me as if we will be seeing benefits cut and insurance plans being  worth little more than the paper on which they are written. On top of  that, Americans in red States should not be subjected to worse  healthcare than those in blue States simply on the basis of their ZIP  Codes.   So I come back to the bottom line in terms of bipartisanship in  healthcare. I think that the way one makes lasting change in the  American healthcare system is to find common ground across the aisle. I  talked about some of the key principles behind it. I mentioned the fact  that Chairman Hatch and I came together last night on a general  framework for the children's health insurance bill.   Now, I have been approached by colleagues about this legislation, so  I can only assume that means it is going to be pushed forward through  the deeply partisan process known as reconciliation. That did not end  well previously, and I am sure going to fight with everything I have to  block partisan reconciliation tactics in the days ahead.   I close by saying let's try to pick up on the kind of approach  Chairman Hatch and I tried to pursue last night--with a bipartisan  effort on CHIP. Let's try to find common ground. I think healthcare is  a basic human right. I also think Republicans have valid points with  respect to there being a significant role for the private sector. I am  interested in approaches that give all Americans the ability to have  affordable, good-quality healthcare, and I think that we get it best if  we pursue bipartisan approaches. I believe many of my colleagues here  in the Senate share these views, and I hope the Senate will not have  yet another knockdown, drag-out battle over a partisan reconciliation  bill that will harm the American people but will instead pick up on the  kind of bipartisan principles I have discussed tonight.   I thank the Presiding Officer and Senator Hoeven for the courtesy of  having the additional time.   I yield the floor.   (At the request of Mr. Cornyn, the following statement was ordered to  be printed in the Record.)                            ____________________
