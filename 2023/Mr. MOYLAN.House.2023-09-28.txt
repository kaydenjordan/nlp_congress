 Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate and celebrate  a remarkable milestone, the 35th anniversary of the Micronesia Mall.  This celebration is a testament to the vision, dedication, and hard  work that have shaped the mall, their businesses, and the island of  Guam into what it is today.   Since 1988, the mall, under the leadership of the Goodwind  Development Corporation, has been a beacon of economic success in the  region, providing goods and services to locals and tourists alike as  the largest shopping center in Micronesia. As I speak here today, I  look back at an incredible 35 years, while also looking forward to  seeing what the mall will establish in the future with new  opportunities, challenges, and accomplishments on the horizon.   I am confident in the mall's dedication to the island, and I wish the  mall a sincere congratulations and may the legacy of the mall continue  to shine in our hearts and in our community.                            ____________________
