 Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Chairman, I, too, rise in support of this bipartisan  amendment. I thank my colleagues, Mr. Brat, Mr. Poe, and Mr. Khanna,  for introducing it.   We want to prohibit funds from being used by the Department of the VA  on studies that cause significant pain and distress to dogs.   As a former member of the House Veterans Affairs' Committee and a  longtime advocate of animal protection, I firmly believe we should not  be using taxpayer dollars to fund painful and unnecessary experimental  procedures when we have technological advances that can move us toward  alternative methods.                                time  1900    We have seen the NIH in their chimpanzee research, and they said that  available technologies are more accurate, faster, and less expensive  than animal testing.   The U.S. military is moving away from using live animals in trauma  medical testing. We have seen that when the Coast Guard gave up their  live tissue training program.   The Los Angeles VA just recently announced it is suspending  controversial and gruesome experiments on a colony of narcoleptic  Dobermans. It is now time for the rest of the VA to do the same thing.   This amendment is supported by the Humane Society, the Animal Welfare  Institute, and the White Coat Waste Project.   It is estimated that 44 percent of all households--and you heard my  colleagues mention this--in the United States have a dog. In our  culture, they are considered cherished pets, and they are a member of  the family. They are not to be used for experiments. Even veterans  themselves depend on dogs on the battlefield and at home for therapy.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support the amendment, and that  is just the way it is.
