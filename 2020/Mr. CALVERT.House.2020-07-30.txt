 Mr. Speaker, I rise in reluctant opposition to the  defense appropriations division of H.R. 7617.   However, first, I thank the full committee chairwoman, Nita Lowey,  for her dedicated leadership and years of service to the Committee on  Appropriations and to this institution.   I also extend my deep gratitude to Chairman Visclosky, who has been a  great partner on the committee and a friend these many years. You will  both be very much missed, and I wish you all the happiness in your next  chapter.   I also thank our full committee ranking member, Kay Granger, for her  leadership on this bill. She has been a tireless advocate for our men  and women in uniform.   Mr. Speaker, the bill before us today provides funding for many key  programs consistent with the National Defense Strategy and is focused  on great power competition with China and Russia.   The bill makes critical investments in 5th generation combat  aircraft, ships, and an additional Virginia-class submarine, while also  providing the combatant commanders the resources necessary to carry out  their missions. The bill also continues to invest in research and  development of new technologies essential to maintaining U.S. military  superiority.   I am also pleased at the focus on providing for the health and  welfare of our men and women in uniform. It reflects the longstanding  concerns that so many of our members have had with defense health  programs; sexual assault prevention, suicide prevention, and a long- awaited electronic health record.   These are all examples of critical investments in this bill that I  strongly support. That is why it is so unfortunate that important  initiatives that have broad support are overshadowed by political  issues.   While this is a very strong bill, there are numerous provisions, like  the prohibition on funding for the southwest border wall construction  and limitations on DOD's general and special transfer authorities that  will draw a veto threat from the administration. It is important that  the bill becomes law as soon as possible.   While I cannot support it in its current form, I am committed to  working with the majority to produce a bill that can be signed by the  President.   The importance of getting a bill done on time cannot be overstated.  According to a DOD comptroller, a continuing resolution wastes roughly  $1.7 billion a month. $1.7 billion a month wasted. This year, a CR  would halt many of the modernization priorities that are vital to  maintaining our military superiority over near-peer threats, such as  [[Page H4118]]  China and Russia. This is no way to run the most sophisticated and  professional fighting force in the world.   There are currently over 200,000 U.S. servicemembers deployed around  the world, ensuring that threats never meet our shores. They do their  job every day; there is no allowance for pause or break. They do what  we ask, and it is time for Congress to do what is necessary and  required in the U.S. Constitution and provide for the common defense of  our Nation in a timely and consistent manner.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, I thank the staff, both minority and  majority staff, for their hard work during some very challenging times.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume,  and I rise in opposition to the Democratic en bloc amendment.   Mr. Speaker, while there may certainly be valid adjustments  reflecting important priorities, there are also political statements  that have no place in the Defense appropriations bill, such as language  insinuating that our military is being used in a way that violates the  First Amendment.   Make no mistake, the men and women of the United States military  protect and defend the First Amendment along with the entire  Constitution to which they swore an oath. It is beneath the institution  to call their loyalty into question. As such, I urge rejection of this  en bloc.   Mr. Speaker, if the gentlewoman has no further speakers, I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in support of a bipartisan en bloc, which includes important  changes to the bills that reflect Member priorities. I would also like  to thank the full committee chairwoman and Chairman Visclosky for their  willingness to work with Members on both sides of the aisle to  accommodate as many amendments to the defense division as possible.   It is vital to our work that we have input from members who know  their districts best and who want to ensure their constituent interests  are being reflected in the appropriations process.   The defense portion of the bipartisan en bloc includes 55 amendments,  and I thank the many Members who are included in this en bloc for input  and insight.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Alabama (Mr. Aderholt), the ranking member on the Commerce, Justice,  Science Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Wisconsin (Mr. Tiffany).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Missouri (Mrs. Hartzler).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Bost).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Illinois.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Minnesota (Mr. Stauber).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  South Carolina (Mr. Wilson).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Wisconsin (Mr. Grothman).    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in support of the Republican en bloc, which includes important  changes to the bill that would enable us to finish our work and deliver  to the President a bill that he could sign, including removing language  prohibiting the funding of the border wall.   While I certainly agree with my colleagues on the other side of the  aisle that wall funding should not come from the DOD, it is unfortunate  that the majority continues to ignore the problem along our southern  border and funds no wall construction or Border Patrol agents in their  FY 2021 Homeland Security appropriations bill. In doing so, they are  forcing the administration to deal with the security of our borders  through any means possible, including using DOD funds to build the  wall.   Finally, I will simply say that all Members should have an  opportunity to have their voice heard on annual appropriation bills on  the House floor. While I acknowledge the difficulty of doing our work  safely during the pandemic, and I thank the chairwoman for the  bipartisan en bloc, which includes many of our minority's priorities,  nothing should stifle our Members from having the opportunity to offer  debate and have a vote on an amendment germane to the bill.   Therefore, I urge adoption of the Republican en bloc, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  West Virginia (Mrs. Miller).                                time  1245     Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Alabama (Mr. Aderholt), who is the ranking member of the Commerce,  Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Washington (Mr. Newhouse). The gentleman is from the land of hops.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Wright).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Bost).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  North Carolina (Ms. Foxx), who is the ranking member of the Education  and Labor Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  North Carolina (Mr. Bishop).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Wisconsin (Mr. Steil).    Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers, I urge a  ``yes'' vote, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Indiana (Mr. Visclosky), chairman of the Subcommittee on Defense.    Mr. Speaker, serving in the United States military is an  honor, and we should be thanking the thousands of young people who  choose to join the military to defend this great Nation.   The assertion that joining the military is a bad thing for low-income  youth or any young person, is fundamentally flawed. It is insulting to  the men and women who currently serve and those who served before them.   The military recruits the best and the brightest. They should not be  prohibited from recruiting the best and the brightest from lower,  socioeconomic classes or in the activities in which young people  participate, such as esports.   In fact, studies show that when compared to their peers, military  veterans do better across-the-board on education attainment, income,  and quality of life.   It is important to remember the quotation, ``This Nation will remain  the land of the free only so long as it is the home of the brave.'' The  world is more dangerous now than it has ever been. It is because of the  brave men and women in our military that our freedoms and security are  assured.   I respect each branch of our military and it is the moral  responsibility of every Member of this body to show these men and women  the respect and the appreciation they deserve. Please join me in doing  just that and voting ``no'' on this amendment.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Mr. Speaker, I have no objection to this en bloc  amendment.   I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Balderson).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Zeldin).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Missouri (Mr. Smith).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from the  great State of Alaska (Mr. Young).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Minnesota (Mr. Stauber).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. LaMalfa).    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from California an  additional 30 seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers. I support the  en bloc amendment, and I urge a ``yes'' vote.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
