 Madam President, public service is about making people's  lives better, and here is what is on offer this afternoon to make  people's lives better in our country: Reduced healthcare costs for  seniors, reduced carbon emissions, reduced energy costs, and reduced  cheating by wealthy tax cheats. That is just a part of what is on offer  this afternoon.   Let me just briefly touch on each of them.   We all know that medicines are way too expensive in our country.  People always come back from trips, and they say: Why is it so much  cheaper overseas?   It is because these big pharmaceutical companies are under absolutely  no restraints to hold down the prices, and that is what we are  beginning to change today.   What we are beginning to change today is to say that for those  seniors who count on Medicare, for the first time, the program that  they love, Medicare, is going to have the power to negotiate lower drug  prices for them. The fact is, the Senate is lifting a curse with this  legislation. That is how seniors feel when they hear that Medicare  can't even go to bat for them. And, of course, Big Pharma has protected  this ban on Medicare negotiating like it was the Holy Grail. Even  today, they are warning that when we pass this, they are going to try  to tie it up with the courts and the State legislatures and the  Agencies. But we are not going to let that happen.   The prediction from some independent authorities on medicine has said  that because of the compounding benefits of our bill--with more drugs  being negotiated on a regular basis--we are looking at the possibility  of a trillion dollars in savings before too long.   If a drug company refuses to negotiate, they are going to face a  steep excise tax on the sale of their products until they come to the  table. If they are price gouging, if they are raising their prices  above the rate of inflation, say, for an older drug, they are going to  pay a penalty.   And then we have new significant relief for seniors who, when they  get mugged at the pharmacy counter, come home and say they just can't  pay all the bills. Our legislation puts a new $2,000 out-of-pocket cap  on Medicare Part D so that seniors are no longer forced to choose  between paying for medicine and paying for food.   Those are all important benefits. The fact is, that penalty for price  gouging is going into in effect in a couple of months, in November, so  seniors are going to be able to say: We are seeing real relief from  this legislation.   There are other steps that we would have liked to take. I understand  that. I pushed for them. The President of the Senate has pushed for  them. But let's understand the bottom line here. Every one of the  policies I have outlined, on their own, is going to be life-changing  for millions of senior citizens, and it is going to lay the groundwork  for doing more.   I would also like to move briefly from healthcare to climate because  the Inflation Reduction Act includes the biggest effort in history to  save our climate and invest in clean energy and jobs. And because we  all worked together, those are going to be jobs here in America. They  are going to be clean energy jobs in our country because of the black  letter text that we wrote into the bill.   The old system was a joke. It picked winners and losers, and anybody  who was powerful could probably figure out how to get a tax break. And  there were permanent breaks for oil and gas but only temporary  incentives for clean energy. The system was broken. It was out of date  a long time ago.   We put that old system into the dustbin of history, and we put in  place emissions-based credits to turbocharge investment in clean  energy, clean transportation, and energy conservation. Our new plan is  going to reduce the typical American household's energy cost by $500  per year, and it is going to create 600,000 new jobs from Portland, OR,  to Portland, ME.   As the President of the Senate knows, we pay for this bill with a few  important changes in our tax law. For example, we just showed a couple  of days ago that of 100 companies--these are companies with billions of  dollars in profits--they are paying--many of them, more than 100--an  effective tax rate of 1.1 percent.   Let me say that again: More than 100 hugely profitable companies that  are going to pay under this legislation, and the President of the  Senate did very important work on this, they are paying, on average,  1.1 percent in taxes.   Now, it is no surprise that those companies that are paying 1.1  percent think that somehow making them pay a minimum rate--a minimum  rate, by the way, which is far less than the rate that a firefighter  and a nurse pay--that, oh, my goodness, we won't have jobs, we won't  have businesses if they do.   And we make it clear that we are not raising taxes on anybody.  Anybody making less than $400,000 is not going to pay any additional  taxes under this bill. I know there are some of our colleagues on the  other side who have always subscribed to this trickle-down theory of  economics and say that, well, if those at the very top--say, those  corporations paying 1.1 percent--actually pay some taxes, that means  that nurses and firefighters are going to pay more taxes, and nurses  and firefighters don't buy that for a second.   We also paid for the legislation in an important way that was  proposed by our colleague from Ohio, Senator Brown, that I was proud to  join him on, and that is a 1-percent tax on stock buybacks.   Corporations have spent trillions of dollars on stock buybacks in  recent years, a huge windfall for corporate executives and wealthy  shareholder. It set a record in 2018, broke it again in 2021 right in  the middle of a global pandemic, and I just noticed the profits of some  of the biggest oil companies here in the last few weeks, again, they  are kind of leading the league in stock buybacks.   Stock buybacks make a lot of wealthy people even wealthier on paper,  but they do very little to strengthen the economy, drive innovation, or  improve the well-being of American workers.   Our 1 percent tax is not only going to help pay to prevent the worst  effects of climate change, it is also going to encourage big  corporations to invest in their workers and research and development  instead of more handouts to the top.   Finally, I just want to emphasize this question of tougher IRS tax  enforcement. We have heard some of our colleagues on the other side say  that somehow this is going to target the working person. I see our good  friend from Delaware, another member of the committee. That is just not  going to happen. And the reason it is not, as my colleagues on the  Finance Committee know so well, working people are not the problem  here. They pay taxes with every single paycheck. It is right there on  their paycheck. Everybody knows what taxes they pay, and should they be  engaging in any questionable activities, it would end up showing up on  these forms. They are not the problem.   But as we have been told again and again by independent experts,  Democrats, Republicans, and Independents, we do have a problem with  big, wealthy tax cheats. Big, wealthy tax cheats don't pay taxes with  every single paycheck like firefighters and nurses.   And after a decade of Republican budget cuts, we are now in a very  difficult position to go after these wealthy tax cheats who rip off the  American people for billions of dollars every year.   The current Commissioner who joins many Democratic Commissioners and  Republican Commissioners in the past--the current one is a Republican  appointee--estimated the number of  [[Page S4070]]  taxes owed that are not collected could be as much as a trillion  dollars per year.   We believe that the Agency ought to have the resources it needs to go  after sophisticated, lawbreaking tax cheats at the top. And I know that  my colleagues on the Finance Committee join me in saying: We are going  to watchdog the Agency very carefully and make sure the focus is on  these wealthy tax cheats and not the typical working person, as my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle have talked about.   So there you have it, folks. Here is what is on offer: What is on  offer are lower costs for seniors, reduced climate emissions, help for  working families, cracking down on wealthy tax cheats. That is what  this is all about today. That is why this legislation, I believe, is  going to give public service a good name.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Yes.    Yes.    I thank the Senator for his inquiry and can clarify that  the Senator is correct that the current-law limitations that generally  apply to tax credits under section 38 would not reduce the amount of  credits eligible for transfer by the transferor of transferable tax  credits under the bill and that the Treasury Department should issue  technical guidance that reflects this intent.    I thank the Senator for her inquiry. That is correct. The  credit is intended to incentivize production of biofuels of a certain  quality, usable as fuel for highway vehicles or aircrafts, but not  limited only to fuels which are actually used in highway vehicles or  aircrafts.    Yes, regulations such as these would be in line with the  legislative text and our intent for companies to be able to  appropriately utilize foreign tax credits in the corporate alternative  minimum tax.    I thank the Senator for his inquiry and can clarify that,  for purposes of the corporate alternative minimum tax, Other  Comprehensive Income is not included in financial statement income.    I thank the Senator for his inquiry. That is correct. The  credit is intended for any eligible components produced and sold after  December 31, 2022, regardless of the portion of the component that was  produced before January 1, 2023.    Yes, we believe that Treasury will have authority to issue  regulations dealing with potential issues with the ordering of the  calculation of the credit under section 53 and the tax under section  59A. Regulations such as these would be in line with our intent in  drafting the BEAT interaction provisions in the corporate alternative  minimum tax.    A commercial lawn mower could qualify as mobile machinery,  since it performs a similar operation to the purposes listed in the  statute. Therefore, if such a vehicle met the other criteria for the  qualified commercial clean vehicle credit, it would be eligible.    Mr. President, this amendment would strike a four-tenths- of-a-cent-per-gallon fee on Big Oil refiners that helps pay for the  cleanup of toxic waste spills, especially important to our low-income,  historically disadvantaged communities.   One expert analysis found that our bill is going to decrease the  average household's energy costs by $500 per year. So, for many  consumers, the Superfund fee would be less than $10 a year, a fraction  of the savings from our bill.   I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment.                          Vote on Amendment No. 5301     Madam President, I rise in opposition to my friend's  amendment. We all agree here that taxpayers with less than $400,000 in  taxable income should not face a tax increase. And there is language  already--and I would like to note this--in the enforcement section of  the bill that says just that.   But the Crapo amendment goes much further than that. It applies--and  I quote here--``to taxpayers with taxable income.''   And as Americans have learned recently, billionaires often have  little or no taxable income for years on end.   So under this amendment, the billionaires who live off their  borrowings would be immune from audit, and that would invite further  tax avoidance.   I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.                          Vote on Amendment No. 5404     Madam President, I gather that this is the first of the  motions to commit this legislation back to committee.   I want my colleagues to understand what this is really all about.  These motions to commit are motions to kill this bill, period. And what  that means is: Let's try to do everything we can to delay Democrats  from being able to deliver for the American people lower prescription  drug costs for the elderly, lower healthcare premiums, lower carbon  emissions, lower energy costs, less tax cheating by the wealthy.   The Senate ought to be moving this legislation forward instead of  trying to kill the bill through these motions to commit.   One last point, I gather we are going to have a bit more of this  discussion.    I ask unanimous consent for 30 seconds of additional time.    I urge opposition to the Scott proposal.                           Vote on Motion to Commit     Mr. President, I oppose this amendment for two reasons.  The first is, it would water down the new negotiations program, so it  would be harder to negotiate over the most expensive drugs in Medicare  today, including cancer drugs, which are at the top of our list.  Second, it would water down the efforts at the Internal Revenue Service  to beef up tax enforcement against wealthy tax cheats.   I would urge opposition to the Marshall amendment.                          Vote on Amendment No. 5389     Mr. President, unfortunately, this amendment is just bad  news. This amendment lowers capital gains taxes, and it is more tax  giveaways to the most fortunate.   And if you are a wealthy tax cheat, you can rest easy because  Republican budget cuts at the IRS mean you can get away with breaking  the law scot-free. I urge my colleagues to vote no.    Mr. President, once again, this sends the bill back to  committee and kills Democratic efforts to reduce the cost of  prescription medicine, reduce health insurance premiums, reduce carbon  emissions, and crack down on wealthy tax cheats. And if you are a  wealthy tax cheat, you can rest easily because Republican budget cuts  at the IRS mean that you can get away with breaking the law scot-free.   I urge my colleagues to vote no.    Madam President, what Americans don't want is wealthy tax  cheats to be able to rest easy because Republican budget cuts to the  IRS mean that they can get away with breaking the law scot-free.   And I want everybody in this body to understand that, on our watch at  the Finance Committee, we are watchdogging this Agency every single day  because there is no evidence of what the Senator from Texas has said is  going on with respect to the privacy of innocent Americans, and on our  watch it is never going to.   I urge opposition.                          Vote on Amendment No. 5263     Madam President, the Senator from Georgia is absolutely  right in his description of this moral abomination where the citizens  he represents have no healthcare decency. And he is right that it stems  from the decisions of Republican Governors. He is talking about  individuals with too much to qualify for Medicaid and not enough to get  ACA subsidies.   Tragically--and I have talked with my colleague about this--to  preserve the rest of this bill's health, climate, and tax policy, it is  just not possible--as much as I want it--to get this fixed today.   I will just close by saying to my colleague that I will work with him  every day, day in and day out, until his citizens get the healthcare  decency he so correctly calls for this morning.   Reluctantly, I oppose the amendment.    Mr. President, I rise in opposition to this amendment.   This, again, is about delay, about postponing, about putting off the  job that needs to be done. What the focus of this bill is all about is  cutting costs.   What I have said to colleagues--and my friend, the Presiding Officer  of the Senate, knows this--is that our bill on prescription drugs kicks  in this fall. We really kick in on the efforts to hold down price  gouging when medicine is going up faster than the rate of inflation.   I urge my colleagues to oppose this. We can't afford any further  delay in priorities like saving senior citizens from their medicine  costs.    Mr. President, there are no tax increases on small  businesses in our bill. The only companies that are paying under our  bill are corporations with at least $1 billion in profit per year.   Republicans are calling private equity giants and foreign  corporations with at least $1 billion in profits small businesses  because they want private equity and foreign corporations to get more  favorable treatment. Rather than close loopholes for billion-dollar  private equity firms, Republicans would raise taxes on those making  less than $400,000 per year.   I urge a ``no'' vote.                          Vote on Amendment No. 5472     I am pleased to join the senior Senator from Nevada in  this colloquy today to discuss sections 13701 and 13702 of the  Inflation Reduction Act. These sections of the Inflation Reduction Act  reflect the work of a variety of Members, but few Members have been as  focused on geothermal energy than the Silver State's senior Senator.    I appreciate the question. For those unfamiliar with  geothermal energy, it is generally produced by delivering geothermal  brine and steam from underground reservoirs to the surface, where the  resource then runs turbines to generate electricity. In some cases,  there is a de minimis of amount of naturally occurring noncombustion  emissions released in the renewable generating process and the  electricity produced is considered emissions free.   Thanks in part to the relentless efforts from Senator Cortez Masto,  the Inflation Reduction Act provides the same incentives for geothermal  energy resources placed in service after December 31, 2024, as it does  for electricity produced by solar, wind, and other renewable resources.  Indeed, all geothermal energy is included among the resources meeting  the definition of ``qualified facility'' for the purposes of the new  sections 45Y and 48D included in the Inflation Reduction Act.   I thank my colleague from Nevada for her dedication to and leadership  on geothermal energy incentives. I am pleased to have worked with her  on these incentives, and I most certainly agree that electricity  produced from geothermal resources property qualifies for the  production and investment incentives provided by sections 13701 and  13702 of the Inflation Reduction Act. That has been my intent  throughout the course of drafting this legislation. Geothermal  resources are critical to our clean energy future, and I thank my  colleague for her collaboration in developing these robust new tax  credits for clean energy.
