 Madam Speaker, as we get ourselves sort of organized,  last Monday, I did an entire hour here on the floor--55 minutes--and we  actually did a presentation up and down the budget. Not this budget  cycle, but basically what does our country look like over the next 30  years? What is driving the projections of $112 trillion of debt 29  years from now?   Look, it is one of those presentations that is rather uncomfortable  for most of us because the punch line is demographics, and that is not  what we typically do here. But the reality is, we have a real issue. We  are getting old very fast as a society.   Let's do a bit of a reminder here and actually look at the math. We  are going to walk through a couple of these that are the same as last  week, but the difference tonight is we are going to try to talk about a  handful of solutions. There is a big package of solutions, and most of  them are really hard and are really going to be cantankerous around  here, but there are solutions to deal with.   Let's actually first walk through where we are at today. Once again,  I won't worry about 1965 in the mix. It is important that anyone  watching this, fellow Members of Congress, understand.   Today, 2021, 77 percent of all the spending that will come from  Washington is mandatory. Only 10 percent is defense; 13 percent is  functionally what we vote on. I think there is a huge misunderstanding  in the public that we march off to Congress and are voting on these $4  trillion budgets. We are not. We are functionally voting on this little  green wedge here that is discretionary spending.   So if I came to you right now and said, okay, what is driving the  debt over the next 30 years? I am going to show you a number of slides  that are going to show the budget is in balance except for two things-- Social Security and Medicare. And it is mostly Medicare.   Social Security is actually quite fixable. There is a number of  levers. None of the levers will make anyone particularly excited or  happy, but we once calculated we had 24, 26 different levers to make  Social Security solvent and keep our promises.   Remember, Social Security and Medicare are earned benefits. It is a  societal contract. We have an obligation to be there.   But Medicare is a really tough one, and we need to actually go back  to having the honest conversation about what drives much of this debt.  Well, if you see here, this is taxes paid in, benefits out for Social  Security. You notice they are pretty much in balance. Social Security  is a fairly square deal. You get a little bit of a SPIF, on average,  for the average American.   Where the numbers get really difficult is the average American couple  is going to put in about $161,000 into the part A Medicare, which is  only the trust fund for just the hospital portion. The pharmaceuticals,  the other doctor visits, the other things are general fund. So when you  are paying your FICA tax, you are paying this here.   But that average couple is going to get $522,000 in benefits. So the  differential from $161,000 to $522,000 is the driver of the vast  majority of U.S. sovereign debt over the next 30 years. It is this  differential here. It is not that complicated.   One of the great frustrations here is my brothers and sisters on the  left will come behind the microphone and say things like: Well, if we  had Medicare for All, or we expanded the ACA, ObamaCare. That is not  true. If anyone just takes a quick breath and steps back--and, look,  Republicans are guilty on part of this, too. Those are financing bills.  The ACA was financing it, who got subsidized and who has to pay.  Medicare for All is just a change of who pays. None of that is about  what we pay. And the Republican alternative was the same. It was about  who got subsidized and who had to pay.   So what we are going to talk about are some of the revolutions in  what we pay, changing the cost of healthcare. But we first need to  understand the scale of these. Look, this is functionally the same size  as we just had, but it is important to understand that for every dollar  in, particularly on Medicare, we get $3 in benefits back. And now you  start to do that with the demographics of the country.   This is just a graphic. So you see the orange here. That is us just  getting old. That is just simply us moving into our benefit years. The  green is healthcare costs. We have known people were going to turn 65  for how many years in this country? And we are still avoiding the  issue.  [[Page H6175]]    But you start to see, when you start to get into the 2050s, this  here, your country has $112 trillion of publicly borrowed debt, and 78  percent of that is just Medicare.    This is one of the slides that I actually see in my dreams because,  if you understand math, if you are willing to own a calculator, this  slide should scare you to death. The purple is functionally the  borrowing of Social Security and the interest on it. This is the  spending of Medicare and the interest on that.   You will notice in this board here $112 trillion of borrowing, and it  is mostly the cost of Medicare and the financing of that. The rest of  the budget, if you remove Social Security and Medicare, is actually in  balance.   Just a quick aside before the next board. How many times today behind  these microphones did anyone come up and say that functionally the  greatest threat to the stability of the country is the fact that we  have waited so long? We are well into the baby boom moving into  retirement, and you start to see the debt curve just explode on us.   So take a look at this board. Now, if you remove the pandemic years  here and just functionally look at this 10-year cycle, why this is  important--I know there are a lot of numbers and a lot of colors here.  This board is basically saying one very simple thing. The vast  majority, matter of fact, almost the entire debt for this decade and  the decade after that and the decade after that, but for this decade is  driven solely by Social Security and Medicare.   Think of that. In functionally 9 budget years, your country is  scheduled to have functionally about $2.2 trillion of borrowing, just  borrowing every year, and almost all of that just came from Social  Security and Medicare.   And look, dear Lord, please don't let interest rates move against us,  but you start to actually see the Medicare outlays, the Medicare  revenues, and then you get these arguments saying, well, if you would  adjust defense. Well, defense is lying down here, and you start to  realize--excuse me, the Medicare taxes and those are down here. You  start to look at these gaps. This is where we are at.   Sorry, I was skipping ahead a board. If you were to eliminate the  entire defense budget--so let's just wipe out the defense budget--you  realize it buys you a year or two, but that is about it because this is  the projected defense line, and this is Social Security and Medicare  where we are going.   You would think, Members of Congress, if you actually cared about  keeping our promises that we are going to protect Social Security, we  are going to protect Medicare, how come every Member of Congress isn't  walking behind this microphone holding up these boards and saying we  are going to work on a solution to this? Instead, this is almost toxic  around here.   I can't tell you how many Members I run into who say, David, I want  to talk about the debt and deficits, too, and the fact that as we grab  all the capital stock of the country, and maybe the world, that we are  going to slow down the economy, that we are going to be poorer. Poor  people will be poorer; rich people will be poorer. The country's  productivity will be crushed. Oh, but I can't actually talk about the  drivers of the debt.   I am going to actually say there are solutions. There is a way to  actually start to take a step back and say, if we are willing to have  an honest moment and say, okay, because the vast majority of Medicare  is a general fund expenditure, what do we do? It is complicated. There  are lots of parts of it.   But let's first understand. There is a rule about healthcare, and  this is not only Medicare, Medicaid, VA, and Indian Health Services,  but everything. Five percent of the population is over 50 percent of  the spending. So if you love and care about people, but you also care  about spending and healthcare costs, we need to understand the 5  percent of our brothers and sisters who drive most of our spending but  also are the folks often living in absolute misery.   It turns out if you are willing to spend and invest to end people's  misery, it ends up being a way you can actually also take on that debt  and deficit.   Look, Republicans often come behind these microphones, and we have  all sorts of ideas. My suggestion is we do all of them, but we need to  be realistic.   Just as some of my Democratic colleagues will walk behind a  microphone and say, well, if we had Medicare for All--back to the  comment before, it is a financing bill. It doesn't actually change the  cost of procedures. Unless they are willing to ratchet down and go into  rationing, which they swear they won't, it is just an alternative way  of paying for it.   Then we have Republicans who will come here and say, well, price  transparency, I love price transparency. But the best peer-reviewed  academic studies out there, it is only 0.1 to 0.7 percent improvement  on price for healthcare costs.   Now, you still should do it, but if you really want to start thinking  about things that drive healthcare costs, what would happen if I came  to you and said--you saw in that previous board--what?--it was about  $78 trillion of borrowing, just borrowing is Medicare over the next 29,  30 years.   Thirty-one percent of Medicare is just diabetes. Thirty-one percent  of Medicare cost is diabetes, and that is just Medicare. We haven't  done the math for Medicaid, for Indian Health Services, for VA, for  just the general populations.                                time  1900    But it helps you start to think about, okay, we know chronic  conditions, 5 percent is over 50 percent of spending. We know in  Medicare 31 percent is just diabetes. Maybe we are starting to  understand the drivers of what actually consumes our healthcare costs.   My proposal to anyone that is willing to hear is let's actually do  something fairly radical--the concept of stepping up and legalizing  technology in healthcare but also investing in disruption.   Right now, the left actually has some proposals that would  functionally do some weird, quirky things such as, as soon as a drug  comes off exclusivity, they are going to start to tax it, and hopefully  that taxing actually starts now to move to create generics or force the  one over here to become less expensive now because it is all  functionally exclusivity off-patent, and I would like radically  different thinking.   How about investing in absolutely curative disrupting research in  drugs but also technology?   Let's actually walk through something that I find fascinating--and  this board is a little hard because there is a lot of noise on it--but  16 percent of U.S. healthcare expenses is people not taking their drug  appropriately. Think of that. That is like $550 billion a year. So over  half a trillion dollars a year is when someone doesn't take their  hypertension medicine and then they have a stroke.   It turns out the fastest thing you can do tomorrow is the technology  that actually helps people know that they should have taken their  hypertension pill or their insulin at a certain time, the technology-- because this is 16 percent of all healthcare.   If tomorrow you could remind grandma to take her medicines at the  proper times during the day, someone with hypertension that they took  their pills so they don't have a stroke, 16 percent of healthcare. And  we have real simple technologies out there. We have the pill bottle cap  that talks to you and reminds you that says, hey, you didn't open me  today.   For someone that may have multiple pills at certain times of the day,  you actually now have--and there are apparently all sorts of versions  of this now--that drop the pill in the bottle and send you a text  message, sends your grandkids a text message also to know that the  pills are there.   The technology is here, and almost no one ever thinks about personal  technology like this as a way to crash the price in healthcare. But it  is 16 percent. It is $550 billion in a single year, not 10 years, in a  single year. So over half a trillion dollars a year you can strip out  of healthcare costs if you could just get our brothers and sisters to  take their pharmaceuticals in a way that keeps them healthy.   Now for some more radical proposals, so far this year, there are two  papers out, one U.S.-based and actually one Taiwanese-based, but both  from very prestigious universities. They appear to be peer-reviewed. We  have been reading through them multiple times. We are trying to get  other comments.  [[Page H6176]]  They talk about, hey, there may be a cure for type 1 diabetes. There  may be a cure, still has a long way to go, but there actually appears  to be some in-lab breakthroughs on type 2 diabetes.   Wouldn't you and I, the left, the right, stop some of the monkey  business around here and say if we know 31 percent of Medicare cost-- and we know Medicare is the primary driver of U.S. sovereign debt. It  is time for an Operation Warp Speed for diabetes. You don't have to  call it ``Operation Warp Speed'' because I know that triggers some  folks on the left, but the fact of the matter is a concentration of  bringing disruption to cure people to end misery because we have to  stop this thought process here of saying the way we are going to end  people's misery is we are going to build more clinics so you have more  access to a doctor.   My argument is to have the revolution because the revolution is here.  Just think, a couple of years ago, we were dealing with the cost of  liver transplants for hepatitis C, and then we came up with a cure. We  can do this.   Now you start to understand there are clinical trials out there for  some new types of stem cell therapy. I read this paper multiple times  because it was complicated and fascinating. Stem cell therapy, they  worked through the rejection problem, and it appears--at least the  early paper--to be a cure for type 1. There is a derivative paper that  is out there actually from a Taiwanese university talking about their  success in type 2.   It is a different thought process. One of the greatest things we can  do for U.S. sovereign debt and not collapsing this society and  destroying my 6-year-old daughter's economic future, as well as anyone  that is heading toward retirement, is actually how we invest our money  today in things that end people's misery, and by ending that misery,  all of society as well as those individuals' benefit.   The amusing part is I have been on this floor for several years  talking about messenger RNA. Back when we used to call it CAR-T and you  heard the stories about taking someone who functionally their immune  system, the cancer they had, doing functionally what we now know as  mRNA. Well, it looks like the breakthroughs and the fact that we have  now turned much of what are diseases into software problems, and this  is hard for a lot of folks to think through, particularly in the time  where we have those who are very virus and vaccine conscious, but there  is incredible hope here.   As you all know, right now going into the field is functionally a  vaccine for malaria. Now, it is only about 30 percent, is the data,  effective, but when teamed up with some other pharmaceutical, it is  like 70 percent. It will change misery around the world.   Well, it turns out, that same messenger RNA goes far beyond COVID. We  actually now are starting to understand malaria, a whole bunch of  cancers. Do you know one of the published papers from early this summer  looks like they think they actually have a cure for HIV? Influenza,  heart disease, it is fascinating. But helping the body, actually its  immune system, work and rehab the heart. There are some amazing things.  You saw the papers earlier this year about cystic fibrosis and thinking  we are almost there for a cure.    Remember, 5 percent is 50 percent of our healthcare spending. Maybe  it is time to rethink about the world and the fact that we are going to  invest in the disruption that is cures that end the misery instead of  financing a country where we might actually lower drug costs, but the  disruptions, the cures that could come in the future don't show up.   We can show you, in lots of studies, there are multiples out there  when we are looking at the Democrats' H.R. 3 that by the end of the  decade you actually saw the curve actually go up in healthcare costs  because the cures didn't show up.   The other thing, and this is not a particularly great slide, and it  is getting a little old, but we have a whole binder in the office of  articles talking about algorithms and, in this case, AI being able now  to detect cancers very early, and the fact of doing that with this type  of technology and technology that you can have at home. You can  actually almost have it wearable. You can have it in your own medicine  cabinet. Using those types of technologies is also part of our path to  crash the price of healthcare.   Remember, we are not going to change the United States getting older  fast, the graying of America. But where we can bend the curve, bend  misery and also bend the threat of the incredible amount of debt we are  building up every single day, it is saying we are all in. We are going  to do wearables. We are going to legalize technology. We are going to  actually invest.   The fact of the matter is it is happening right now where we are  actually seeing countries around the world realizing how big of a  problem diabetes is. Now there are awards going out saying, wow, we  actually now have lines of research that look like we can finally  disrupt the disease.   So, this was sort of the follow-up on last week where we did the  whole slide chart of what is actually happening in U.S. sovereign debt  and how much trouble we are really in and how fast it is building.   You have to do a whole series of things. You have to grow the economy  consistently. You have to manage tax policy. You have to manage  regulatory policy in a way that is for maximizing economic expansion.  You actually have to deal with immigration in a way that maximizes  economic growth. Opening up your border, importing massive amounts of-- let's be brutal about this--poverty where that poverty and inflation  are crushing the working poor in this country. The working poor will be  substantially poorer at the end of this decade because of these  policies. That is cruel.   How about if we had growth? Because growth is moral. So you do these  things of tax policy, regulatory policy, immigration policy, and then  the financing and tax incentives and the encouragement to do things  that disrupt because you could actually do it in both healthcare; you  can do it in energy; you can do it in transportation where we can make  the future actually pretty darn amazing and actually end a lot of  suffering and turns out it is the path that actually bends that debt  curve that wipes us out as a society if we don't actually start to tell  the truth and deal with it.   There is a path. There is optimism. Every day this place squanders  working on the real problems and instead of the insanity of some of the  policies that are being proposed today that the economists on both  sides say will make the country poorer by the end of the decade, we are  going the wrong direction.   Madam Speaker, I hope at least someone out there hears the message  that there is a path. It is just getting harder and harder to get there  because every day we fall further in debt.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
