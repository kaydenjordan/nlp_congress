 Mr. Chair, I thank the chairwoman for yielding.   My amendment will direct the State Department to use $10 million from  the NADR account to take advantage of the opportunity to advance U.S.  diplomatic goals in the Middle East through scientific engagement with  a contribution to the SESAME Project.   SESAME, the Synchrotron-light for Experimental Science and  Application in the Middle East, is a major science facility in Jordan.    About an hour drive from Amman and an hour drive from Jerusalem, it  is a cooperative venture by scientists and governments throughout the  region, including Israel, Iran, and everyone in between.   Science is a universal language that can cross barriers and build  bridges, if we let it. As a high-energy particle physicist who spent my  career working with international teams of scientists, I saw firsthand  that even when a country's politicians cannot get along, often its  scientists can.   This U.S. support will strengthen the SESAME Project and encourage  scientific collaboration among all of the countries in the Mideast.   I urge my colleagues to join me and vote ``yes'' on this en bloc  package.
