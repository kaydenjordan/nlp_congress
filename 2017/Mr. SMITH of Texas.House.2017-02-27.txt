 Mr. Speaker, a recent poll shows that the  American people agree with all of President Trump's major executive  orders, though they are not likely to learn about it from the liberal  media.   Fifty-five percent approve of revoking Federal funding for sanctuary  cities. Only 33 percent disapprove. Fifty-five percent approve of  prohibiting refugees from seven countries from entering the U.S. Only  38 percent disapprove.   By wide margins, the American people side with the President on  freezing regulations and Federal hiring, building pipelines, and  constructing a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico.   As favorable to the President as this poll is, think how much more  favorable it would have been if the media had not incessantly  criticized his executive orders.                            ____________________
