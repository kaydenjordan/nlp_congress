 Mr. President, for families, for healthcare workers,  for small businesses, and for people who are waking up today all across  the country who are asking ``What is next?'' I believe that today we  can report there is good news.   The resolve and determination of this Senate, working in a bipartisan  way and working with the White House, has delivered a rescue plan--a  rescue plan for the American people and for American healthcare  workers.   We are going to pass new authorities, new resources, and new programs  today to deal with two crises that we as a nation are facing. One is  the medical crisis, the coronavirus, and the other is the economic  crisis that is as a direct result of the medical crisis we are facing.   This Senate is providing an overwhelming and massive healthcare and  economic response package. We are doing both. We have to do both at the  same time, as it is a rescue operation for the resources that our  healthcare providers need and the resources that our economy needs. The  healthcare resources are going to be surging for communities all around  the country--every one of the 50 States is affected--with there being  over $100 billion for our hospitals and the heroes who are taking care  of coronavirus patients.   As the Presiding Officer knows, I am a physician and have practiced  medicine for a long time in Wyoming. People go into medicine so they  can do a number of things, but when people go into medicine, what we  expect of our healthcare providers is for them to save lives, to cure  the sick, and to prevent disease.   For all of those men and women who are working in this profession, I  will tell you that this will be their finest hour. We are hearing about  heroes all over the country, and that is going to continue as long as  this crisis is in effect because that is what we are asking them to do  every day--to save lives, heal the sick, and prevent disease.   We see that with our public health officers who are out there, trying  to prevent disease. We see it in communities. Day and night, we see  people trying to heal the sick and to save lives in the hospitals. What  they are asking from us are for resources, and that is now going to be  provided in the bill that we are going to pass today that will  hopefully soon be on the President's desk.   We are also surging dollars to individuals, to families, to  businesses, and to distressed parts of our economy--direct money:  $1,200 per individual, $500 per child--take a look at that--and $350  billion in bridge loans and grants to small and medium-sized  businesses.   We are providing unemployment insurance to workers--people who were  working and were ready to go to work the next day but were not able to  because of the medical crisis affecting us. So this will be to make  sure that workers who are not able to work right now are made whole.   We held the line against so many of the ideological issues that the  Democrats and specifically the Speaker of the House tried to put into  this legislation. We made it clear that lives were at stake. Those are  debates for another day. The crisis is upon us, and the rescue work  needs to be done.   I believe time was wasted. We should have passed this last Sunday.  Time was wasted, and it was time the American people didn't have, but  we are working on this action plan today.   Pass the Senate bill today to stabilize American jobs and to surge  healthcare resources to the frontlines. The House cannot delay. The  House needs to get this passed today and sent to the President of the  United States for his signature today. America should not wake up  tomorrow and have to watch and wait and worry to see if the House is  going to pass this bill. The House needs to act today. The American  people need that reassurance today.   Everyone--families, young people--has committed to slowing the spread  for the remainder of the 15-day window. There is about a week longer to  go. And people are doing it all around the country. People are going to  continue to ramp up the manufacturing of medical equipment--masks,  ventilators, respirators, tests--to save lives. People are going to  keep cutting redtape and pressing on scientific and medical  breakthroughs for treatments and vaccines.   Going forward--and I see the minority leader on the floor--we need to  take  [[Page S2025]]  a long, hard look at our supply chain. China has been exposed. We  cannot allow ourselves ever again to be in any way dependent on China  for medicines, for materials, or for minerals.   My focus, along with what I know to be the President's focus, is to  bring America back stronger than ever before. We are a strong and  resilient nation. We will get through this. Our country's healthcare  infrastructure and our economic resolve are today being tested. We will  defeat the virus, and we will be back stronger than ever.   I yield the floor.
