 Madam Speaker, on January 3, we stood here on this floor  and swore an oath to defend our Constitution against enemies, foreign  and domestic. Three days later, that oath was put to the test when a  violent mob tried to break down those doors to stop us from performing  our constitutional duty. This mob was not without a leader.   On that day, the President told them to walk to this Capitol, 16  blocks from where he stood. They were radicalized by his lies and  conspiracy theories he spent months fueling, many of which I have heard  on this floor the last week. He needed to say only two words to end the  violence: ``I concede.'' Because that is what leaders do in a  democracy. Because that is what we do in the United States. They put  politics aside and put country first.   Madam Speaker, as I look to our colleagues over on the other side, I  wonder how many of them will demonstrate that leadership and join us in  holding President Trump accountable for inciting this deadly attack,  and I wonder how many will uphold our oath and put our country first to  defend this Constitution from the threat in the White House. To do  anything less, is to turn your back on the oath altogether.
