 Madam Chair, I thank Chairwoman Lowey and Ranking  Member Granger.   I support this supplemental. It is very necessary. The destruction in  Puerto Rico from Hurricane Maria and the terrible earthquake last  month, with its ongoing aftershocks, make this relief more necessary  than ever.   I am thankful that legislation I proposed, H.R. 3307, to provide a  Federal supplement to the earned income tax credit in Puerto Rico and  the other U.S. territories, was included in the bill.   Unlike Americans in every other State, working Puerto Rican taxpayers  are excluded from the Federal EITC to supplement their incomes. This is  a deeply unfair restriction. It has tied the commonwealth's hands at  the worst possible time as islanders are recovering from disaster and  facing high unemployment and dreadful levels of poverty.   The EITC has repeatedly proven a critical tool to alleviating  poverty, improving health outcomes, and encouraging labor  participation. Why shouldn't our fellow Americans in Puerto Rico--and  they are our fellow Americans--be able to earn the same benefit?   With this Federal support, we can provide a very powerful tool for  Puerto Ricans to get back on their feet and get a leg up. They deserve  that help.   Madam Chair, I ask that we support this legislation.
