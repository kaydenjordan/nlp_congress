 Madam Speaker, I recently toured my district to meet  members of the community nominated by their fellow residents who served  their fellow citizens extraordinarily during the pandemic.   During my tour, I had the honor of meeting Mena Police Chief Tommy  Stueart and Bearden Police Chief Nathan Greeley. These men cared for  their communities by delivering food and prescriptions and taking care  of the sick and elderly, all while dealing with their own staff  shortages.   When our local police officers go to work, they wear many hats. Of  course, they are protectors, but they also play the role of nurse,  comforter, teacher, caretaker, and confidant.   Ask any police officer and they will say it is just part of the job,  but it is a grave mistake to take this for granted.   Madam Speaker, another grave mistake is the Democrats' move to defund  police. This National Police Week, let's honor the heroism and the  daily kindnesses shown by our law enforcement, and let's work to  support those brave men and women who protect and serve.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 297, offered by our Natural  Resources Committee colleague, Congressman Case from Hawaii. This bill  is the first step toward the creation of Hawaii's first national  forest.   This bill requires a study to identify potential parcels of land that  could later be incorporated into a national forest that would help  fulfill the National Forest System's mission.   Hawaii is one of the few States without a national forest and the  only State that has tropical rainforests. Hawaii's rainforests are  among the wettest places on Earth. This bill would help inventory how  best to conserve and expand Hawaii's unique forests and lay the  groundwork for the establishment of a national forest.   While I question my friends from Hawaii on why they would be  interested in potentially giving the Federal Government jurisdiction  over any land in Hawaii, especially considering the unfortunate state  of our national forests on the mainland, I do urge adoption of the  measure, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 49, offered by my  colleague from Florida (Mr. Soto).   Nearly 5 years ago, on June 12, 2016, a senseless and horrific mass  shooting was perpetrated by an ISIS-inspired coward at the Pulse  nightclub in Orlando, Florida. In the attack, 49 innocent people were  killed and 53 were wounded.   This bill, and the number H.R. 49, is a thoughtful tribute to the 49  individuals killed in the attack. In the aftermath of the unspeakable  tragedy at Pulse, the owner of the club established a nonprofit called  the onePULSE Foundation to memorialize those who died in the mass  murder, known as the 49.   The foundation worked quickly to establish an interim memorial in  Orlando and has been working to build a permanent Pulse memorial and  museum, which will be completed in coming years.   This bill would redesignate the Pulse Memorial in Orlando, Florida,  as the ``National Pulse Memorial.'' The bill makes clear that this  memorial will not be a unit of the National Park System and that  designation as a national memorial does not require any Federal funds  to be expended.   The House's action on this bill today complements the United States  Senate resolution passed on June 11, 2020, honoring the victims of this  tragedy, as well as the State of Florida's designation of June 12 as  Pulse Remembrance Day.   Madam Speaker, I urge adoption of the measure, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    I reserve the balance of my time, Madam Speaker.    In closing, Madam Speaker, again, I urge adoption of  H.R. 49, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 478, the Blackwater Trading  Post Land Transfer Act. This bill will place approximately 55 acres of  land in Pinal County, Arizona, into trust for the Gila River Indian  Community. According to the Tribe, these lands and the former  Blackwater Trading Post have a historical connection to the Tribe, as  the trading post served many Tribal members since at least the 1930s.  In 2010, the Tribe purchased the Blackwater Trading Post and  surrounding lands after the former owners retired.   Pursuant to the 2004 Arizona Water Rights Settlement Act, the Gila  River Tribe cannot acquire off-reservation lands into trust absent an  act of Congress.   Madam Speaker, I urge adoption of the measure, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I thank the majority for the bipartisan support on  this good piece of legislation.   H.R. 810, authored by our colleague from Nebraska, Congressman  Fortenberry, directs the Secretary of the Interior to study the  feasibility of designating the Chief Standing Bear National Historic  Trail.   Chief Standing Bear of the Ponca Tribe is one of Nebraska's most  important historical figures and is honored here in the Capitol as one  of Nebraska's contributions to the National Statuary Hall Collection.   Chief Standing Bear led his people through a crisis that began with  its displacement by droves of westward-bound settlers. The Ponca Tribe  moved twice in search of new land but had no success. Finally, in 1877,  the U.S. Government forced their relocation.   By 1878, when they reached their destination in Oklahoma's Indian  Territory, starvation and disease had claimed almost a third of the  Tribe. Among the dead was Bear Shield, the first son of Standing Bear.   Standing Bear's desire to honor his son's wish that he be buried in  his Nebraska birthplace, at a time when Native Americans could not  legally leave their reservations without government permission, led to  the trial for which he is best remembered today. The case established  that Native Americans were persons under the law and are entitled to  the same rights as anyone else in the Nation. During that case, the  words of Chief Standing Bear, pleading on behalf of his Tribe, moved  the Nation.   The Chief Standing Bear Trail, extending approximately 550 miles from  Nebraska to Oklahoma, follows the route taken by Chief Standing Bear  and the Ponca people during Federal Indian removal. If supported by the  study, any designation of the trail would require additional action  from the Natural Resources Committee and the Congress.   Madam Speaker, I urge adoption of the measure, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Fortenberry).    Madam Speaker, I urge support of this bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 1688 amends the Indian Child Protection and  Family Violence Prevention Act to reauthorize three programs  administered by the Department of Health and Human Services and the  Department of the Interior that are intended to prevent cases within  Indian communities where child abuse, neglect, family violence, and  trauma may occur and to provide treatment for victims of Indian child  sexual abuse.   The authorization for appropriations for the three programs expired  in 1997. The bill also makes several technical changes to the  underlying statute, requiring agencies to report on grant awards.   Advocates cite the Indian Child Protection and Family Violence  Prevention Act as the only federally dedicated child abuse prevention  and victim treatment funding for Tribal governments, but Congress has  only appropriated approximately $5 million for this program.   I appreciate the sponsor bringing attention to this important issue  as abuse, neglect, and violence have no place in any community.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Alaska (Mr. Young), the dean of the House and a true  expert on Tribal issues.    Madam Speaker, I urge support of this bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2208, sponsored by my colleague from Texas (Ms.  Escobar), would amend the act of Congress that restored the Federal  recognition of the Ysleta del Sur Pueblo and Alabama-Coushatta Tribe of  Texas.   The amendment would override a gaming limitation imposed by Congress  on the Tribes, thereby authorizing the Tribes to operate casinos  regulated not under Texas law, as Federal law currently provides, but  under the Federal Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988.   The question of whether Texas law or the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act  applies to the two Tribes is no longer under serious dispute. Federal  courts have settled the question, and the result of the litigation is  that the two Tribes may not conduct gaming under the Indian Gaming  Regulatory Act, unless Congress enacts a measure to allow them to do  so.   The bill enjoys significant local support in the communities around  the reservations of the two Tribes, and the members who represent the  Tribes strongly support enactment of the measure.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the measure, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Alaska (Mr. Young), the dean of the House.    Mr. Speaker, in closing, I support this bipartisan  bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.
