 Mr. Speaker, tomorrow, May 24, marks 1 year since the  massacre at Robb Elementary in Uvalde, 1 year since 19 children and 2  teachers were murdered, leaving a community forever scarred and parents  all across the country holding their little ones closer.   I know my heartbreak won't pass new legislation, but like many  parents, I am heartbroken.   I know my outrage won't bring these kids back, but like many Texans,  I am still outraged.   I also know that we don't have to live like this. Last year, we  finally ended 30 years of inaction by passing gun violence prevention  legislation.   We can build on that. We can strengthen background checks, pass red  flag laws, and raise the purchasing age of an assault-style rifle to  21. All of these policies are overwhelmingly supported by the American  people, but we have to work together.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to  join us in looking for common ground because I know I am willing to  work with anyone to save lives. The people of Uvalde and all Americans  deserve no less.  [[Page H2534]]                                ____________________
