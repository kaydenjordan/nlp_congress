 Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Iowa's  Nashua-Plainfield student Caleb Sinnwell.   Caleb won first place in this year's National History Day competition  for his project on the Ghost Army, a World War II unit of 1,100 men  tasked with deceiving German intelligence.   To recognize his outstanding work, Caleb is being awarded the  Certificate of Achievement by the U.S. Special Forces Army Unit.   Caleb's thesis states in part: ``Through masterful miscommunication,  the Ghost Army successfully deceived German troops, which aided Allied  advancement to victory in World War II.''   He is now asking Congress to pass the Ghost Army Congressional Gold  Medal Act, a bill to recognize the critically important work of the  Ghost Army during World War II.   Madam Speaker, I am honored to support this effort, and I am hoping  my colleagues in the Senate will take up this measure very soon.   Keep up the great work, Caleb.                            ____________________
