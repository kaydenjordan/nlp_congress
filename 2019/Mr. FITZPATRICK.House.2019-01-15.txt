 Mr. Speaker, this weekend, I was proud to stand with  our community and join Homes For Our Troops as a new house for an  American hero was unveiled. On Saturday morning, Kevin McCloskey and  his wife, Bridget, received the keys to their new home in Upper South  Hampton in Bucks County, Pennsylvania.   On June 8, 2008, Corporal McCloskey was severely injured in  Afghanistan after his vehicle struck an IED. He suffered critical  injuries to both his legs and vision in his right eye, and he suffered  severe burns and traumatic brain injury.   While Kevin has made significant progress in his recovery, everyday  activities can still be challenging. The McCloskeys' new home is  retrofitted to make these tasks easier and more accessible for Kevin  and Bridget.   Mr. Speaker, Kevin is a true patriot and an American hero. We thank  him for his service, and we wish him and Bridget all the best in their  new home. We are so proud to have them join our Bucks County family.   I would also like to thank Homes For Our Troops and their entire  board for honoring those who sacrifice for our freedom.                         Recognizing Pineville Tavern     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a small  business in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, that has gone out of their way  to help Federal employees who are not being paid due to this prolonged  government shutdown.   For the duration of the government shutdown, Pineville Tavern has  offered furloughed workers and their immediate family their popular  pickle-brined chicken at no cost. At this time of so much unneeded  uncertainty for our Federal workers, the charity of Pineville Tavern is  deeply appreciated by our community.   Pineville Tavern chef Drew Abruzzese says it best when he calls the  current impasse ``a political game of chicken.''   Mr. Speaker, I call on my colleagues to put aside our differences,  fund our government, and get our Federal employees back to work.   I am grateful for Drew's generosity and leadership, along with his  father and the owner of Pineville Tavern, Andrew Abruzzese. Their  dedication to our community is deeply appreciated.

Ed Burns embodied public service throughout his entire life and  his storied career.   A Navy veteran, Ed became a teacher after graduating from La Salle  College and Temple University. He later served as the head of the  Bensalem Recreation Department and served on the school board.   In 1972, Ed entered State government, serving as a State  representative for the 18th District for nearly 20 years. Notably, Ed  later became the first mayor of Bensalem, serving honorably from 1990  to 1994.   We would like to extend our heartfelt condolences to Ed's wife, Joan;  his son, Joseph F. Burns; and his two beautiful grandchildren.   Ed's legacy of public service to Bensalem and to Bucks County has  left an indelible mark on our community, one that will last for  generations.                            ____________________
