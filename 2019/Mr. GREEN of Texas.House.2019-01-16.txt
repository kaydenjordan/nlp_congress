 Mr. Speaker, and still I rise, proud to have the  preeminent privilege of serving in the Congress of the United States of  America, a proud American, and proud to say that, yesterday, this  Congress went on record indicating that it is opposed to bigotry. It  went on record saying it is opposed to hate.   I read to you the style of the resolution, H. Res. 41. It reads:  ``Rejecting White Nationalism and White Supremacy.'' That is the style  of the resolution.   I will not read all of the whereases, but I do think it appropriate  to read the resolved.   ``Resolved, That the House of Representatives once again rejects  White nationalism and White supremacy as hateful expressions of  intolerance that are contradictory to the values that define the people  of the United States.''   I thank all of my colleagues. I heard many of them speak, and much of  what was said really touched my heart. I thank them for saying it,  because it was made very clear yesterday that we reject bigotry. It was  made very clear that bigotry will not be tolerated.   I am appreciative that this happened because there was a time in the  history of our country where such a resolution would not have been  brought before the House of Representatives. There was a time when  people would deny the existence of racism and bigotry and hate,  xenophobia, homophobia, anti-Semitism.   There was a time when people would have denied the existence, and  then when you deny the existence of something, you don't have to deal  with it because you say that it isn't there and it doesn't exist. Why  would you deal with it? But yesterday, we went on record not only  saying that we reject it, but we also acknowledged the existence of it,  which is important.   I also have to single out just one Representative, Congressman    Bobby Rush, who voted against the resolution--one vote against. I want  to acknowledge that he was right. He was right because he said it  wasn't enough. I concur.   I thank my colleagues for the resolution indicating that we oppose  bigotry, but the real question that we have to answer at some point in  the future is the corollary that flows from being in opposition to  bigotry. The corollary is this:   If you oppose bigotry, if you reject bigotry, will you reject the  bigot? If you reject racism, will you go on record rejecting the  racist? If you are antithetical to anti-Semitism, will you go on record  rejecting and opposing the anti-Semite?   This is the question.   I appreciate greatly and I am going to be eternally grateful to those  who brought this resolution. It was timely. It was something that was  necessary. But I also appreciate Mr. Rush's position, because the  corollary has to be addressed at some point.   We cannot continue to say we are opposed to something. That is a  talking point. We have to get to the action item, which is: What are  you going to do about it if you oppose it? What will you do about it?   What will you do about it when it emanates from the highest office in  the land? What will you do about it? Will you simply say ``I oppose  it,'' or will you take a vote to indicate that it is an action item and  you are going to reject it?   One step closer to impeachment, yesterday's resolution brought us one  step closer. The clock is ticking. Impeachment is not dead.
