 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of a great  New Yorker, someone that has made us all proud, someone that we all  stand on his shoulders, the late Mayor David N. Dinkins.   Words cannot express how we feel in New York with the passing of  Mayor Dinkins. Many of us stand on his shoulders, as many of us here in  this Chamber stand on the shoulders of other giants that came before  us. None of us really stand on our own. We stand on the shoulders of  those trailblazers, those pioneers that opened the door to men and  women across the country.   Mayor Dinkins was such a leader. He was the first and, up to today,  the only African-American mayor in New York City, a city that prides  itself on diversity. In fact, New York City says that its strength  really comes from the depths of its diversity.   People from all over the world, immigrants, as I was in 1964, coming  from the Dominican Republic, people from all over the world come to New  York City looking for that dream. Different races, ethnicities,  religions make New York City strong. And Mayor Dinkins often called the  city a gorgeous mosaic, and that was its strength.    So we honor his legacy and his many years of service as a New York  State Assembly member, as a Manhattan borough president, and then, of  course, as mayor of the city of New York.   His detractors, and those that attempt to be revisionists of history,  will never acknowledge the great things that he did. But those of us in  the trenches, in the neighborhoods that have been traditionally  forgotten, those of us that know that our communities lacked the voices  to be heard, the disenfranchised of the city of New York will forever  remember him for his accomplishments.   Community policing, he got $1.8 billion to establish the community  policing program; foot officers, foot patrol officers, in neighborhoods  across the city of New York fighting crack and crime but, most  importantly, knowing the community, the small business owners, having a  daily relationship, almost as family members, preventing the kind of  conflict that is plaguing America today.   The beacon schools that he opened up, after-school programs that  became the center of communities across the city of New York; the  Arthur Ashe Stadium for tennis, which houses the US Open and yields  more revenue than baseball, basketball, and football for the city of  New York.   And, of course, that day when he welcomed Nelson Mandela to New York  City, it was such an important day. I went to that celebration, and  many of us in New York felt that day that New York was the center of  the universe. Every neighborhood enjoyed and celebrated freedom for  South Africa, and Mayor Dinkins was our mayor. What a great day. What a  great mayor.   What a legacy, Mr. Speaker.   I stand here to honor that legacy so that it will never be forgotten  that the great, late David N. Dinkins was an integral part of the  gorgeous mosaic that he always called New York.                            ____________________
