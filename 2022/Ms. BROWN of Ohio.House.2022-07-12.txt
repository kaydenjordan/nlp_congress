 Mr. Speaker, last week I was heartbroken when I  learned a 10-year-old rape victim from my home State was forced to  cross State lines for an abortion because of Ohio's 6-week ban, which  became law when the Supreme Court overturned Roe.   Grief quickly became anger because I know she will not be the last  victim of an extreme agenda to criminalize abortion nationwide. The  overturn of Roe was a direct attack on Americans' reproductive rights,  and it is clear that too many support criminalizing contraceptive care,  arresting doctors for offering reproductive care, and even charging  women with murder because of their fundamental right to decide.   We must make Roe the law of the land to restore women's fundamental  rights and protect other victims from harboring the ramifications of  rape.                            ____________________
