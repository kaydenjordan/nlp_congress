 Mr. President, I rise tonight to talk about the  bipartisan legislation that is before the body. It is an opportunity  that provides significant needed regulatory relief, primarily to  smaller financial institutions like community banks and credit unions.   The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act  will modernize the Federal Dodd-Frank regulations to ensure that small-  and medium-sized banks, as well as credit unions, can lower their  compliance costs, which will mean more loans to small businesses and  better deals for their customers.   For years, Dodd-Frank has hurt these smaller community banks and  credit unions that have been caught up in this broader effort to rein  in a select few larger financial institutions--primarily financial  institutions on Wall Street. In effect, these smaller banks were caught  in the web.   Last week, I met with some of Ohio's community banks. I meet with  them regularly, and they tell me these stories. Their view, of course,  is these Dodd-Frank rules targeted at the big banks are actually  hurting the little guys. Over the past several years, they have told me  story after story about how their compliance costs have increased. A  small bank will say they used to have one person doing compliance, but  now they have three people doing compliance, and those costs get passed  along to their consumers. They also say, with the redtape and  regulations and rules they live under, it makes it harder for them to  lend to small businesses, which is one of the problems we have today in  our economy. As the economy is beginning to grow, we need to ensure  that startups and people who are interested in taking a risk and may  not have a lot of business experience are able to get that loan to get  started.   What has happened is, there has been a consolidation of these  community banks because of these costs. In fact, they say one community  bank is becoming insolvent every day in this country because of these  big compliance costs, but others are consolidating into larger banks.  That may be fine in some cases, but I like these community banks.   I like the fact that these community banks are close to the people in  the neighborhood, and they know the businesses that are coming to them  for loans. Again, it is easier for small businesses to get loans when  you actually have a banking relationship. They also are very involved  in our communities.  [[Page S1400]]    So these community banks, which are really the backbone of America's  financial sector, are what this bill is primarily about. The bill on  the floor this week makes it easier for them to extend credit, loans,  mortgages, and provide other products and services to working families  in Ohio and around the country.   The legislation does more than that though. It also focuses on the  regional banks in Ohio. These are banks that were not part of the  financial crisis. They had nothing to do with it, but despite that,  they have been required to live under the onerous systemically  important financial institution rules and regulations or the SIFI  designation. It has caused higher compliance costs for them. Again, it  has hurt lending to Ohio businesses.   In Ohio, we happened to have three very big employers in the State  that are regional banks--Fifth Third Bank, Huntington Bank, and  KeyBank. They are all examples of well-capitalized Ohio regional banks  that will benefit from this legislation, and the benefit will go to  their thousands of employees, but it will also go to their many  thousands of customers.   This legislation also increases important consumer protections for  veterans, senior citizens, victims of fraud, and those who have fallen  on tough financial times   Another thing I like about the legislation that is particularly  important to me is it includes a specific piece of legislation I  authored to make it easier for a group called Habitat for Humanity to  carry out their mission of providing safe and affordable housing to  those in need. Habitat is a great organization. I volunteer at Habitat  regularly. I see firsthand the great work they are doing back in my  home State of Ohio.   My legislation is called the Housing Opportunity Made Easier Act or  HOME Act, and it simply ensures that Habitat affiliates and other  organizations--nonprofits--can receive donated appraisals of the homes  they build. This is a really important issue for Habitat because Dodd- Frank disallows this donated appraisal, and the affiliates have  traditionally accepted the donations. That has allowed them to have  lower costs. When they have to pay the appraisal fees, it increases the  cost of the homes to the families that are so badly in need of  affordable housing. So getting rid of this redtape is something that  should be bipartisan and even nonpartisan. It has been tough for us to  get this legislation moving because people have wanted to block  anything that has to with Dodd-Frank, but this obviously, I hope, was  inadvertent. So in this legislation we have the ability for Habitat and  other nonprofits to take advantage of these donated appraisals. Getting  rid of that redtape is going to help create more affordable housing for  families in need.   I want to thank Chairman Crapo for including that legislation. I also  want to congratulate him and his colleagues on the Banking Committee  for their bipartisan work on this legislation, dealing with the very  real problem we have, which is the burdens, the redtape, the compliance  costs, and coming up with a balanced product that can be supported on  both sides of the aisle, get through the House, get through the Senate,  get to the President for signature, and begin to improve this economy  even more.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on another economic issue, I want to talk  for a minute about the good news coming out of my State of Ohio with  regard to the tax reform legislation. In just the past few weeks, I  have visited eight separate businesses across the State talking about  this issue, asking them what has been the impact of the tax reform  bill, what are they doing with their savings.   There are three of these I want to talk about tonight, briefly. One  is a small auto parts manufacturing business in Zanesville, OH. They  have three auto parts stores. One is a multinational credit card  processing company headquartered in Cincinnati, OH, and one is a  premier medical center in Cleveland, OH. They are very different  businesses in different sectors of our economy, but all are benefiting  from the tax legislation.   GKM is the small auto parts store in Zanesville. They are reinstating  healthcare benefits to their employees directly as a result of this tax  reform bill. Under the Affordable Care Act, the company's healthcare  costs increased dramatically--like so many other businesses--by double  digits every year. They had a 22-percent increase in their costs in  2016, and the company went to its employees and said: We simply cannot  afford to pay for this 22-percent increase on top of other double-digit  increases. We don't know what to do. We are going to have to have you  go out on your own and find healthcare, including in the exchanges.   Now, with the money GKM Auto Parts is saving as the result of this  tax reform, all of their full-time employees are once again able to get  healthcare through the company, and they are very grateful, having  talked to some of the employees who had to go out to the exchanges,  while others chose to pay the penalty. They are really happy to have  their healthcare back.   These kinds of real, tangible benefits are exactly what we intended  to accomplish in developing tax reform, but businesses small and large  are benefiting from these pro-growth changes to the Tax Code.   The second company I want to talk about is a big C corporation-- Worldpay, Inc. It is the largest credit card processing company in the  world now by volume. It has about 2,000 employees in Ohio at their  headquarters. I recently went to their headquarters to talk about what  they were doing, and when I was there, they announced cash bonuses of  $1,000 and up to $2,000 for all of their hourly employees, higher wages  for their frontline positions, an increased 401(k) match, greater  company investment in employee wellness and recognition programs, and  significantly more charitable giving. As Worldpay's executive chair  said, tax reform is ``ensuring Ohio companies like Worldpay can remain  competitive and recruit the region's top talent.''   They merged recently with a foreign company. Thank goodness they  stayed in Ohio, but now they are rewarded for that because, although  they were punished for being a U.S. company before, now with our Tax  Code changes in place, they are actually benefiting from being an  American company, where it is more beneficial to make the investment  here rather than, in their case, in the United Kingdom.   A more competitive business tax code, an international tax code that  encourages investments in this country rather than overseas, and  incentives like immediate expensing that is in the Tax Code now are  helping to create jobs in my home State of Ohio. It is helping Worldpay  continue to be an American company and to be strong. It also is helping  foreign direct investment in my home State because companies that are  not American companies but foreign companies invested in Ohio are more  likely to increase that investment rather than an investment somewhere  else in the world because of the tax reform legislation. Immediate  expensing and lower tax rates, this all helps to create good American  jobs.   The most recent Federal jobs report shows strong job gains and the  fastest wage growth since 2009. According to a recent National  Federation of Independent Business survey, the NFIB, which represents a  lot of small businesses in Ohio, 32 percent of their companies now say  they are going to expand. By the way, that is the highest level in the  survey's history, and it is the highest level of optimism also in their  survey about the future among these small businesses. A lot of that is  from the increased opportunity and the optimism that comes from this  tax reform legislation.    One website I saw here in Washington tells us that across the country  more than 400 businesses have now announced bonuses, higher wages,  increased benefits, or a combination of these things as the result of  the tax reform law. Four hundred is impressive, but I have to tell you  it is a lot more businesses than that. I have been to small business  roundtable discussions and individual businesses over the past several  weeks in Ohio and talked to over two dozen individual companies--none  of whom are on the list of 400 because they are not big companies that  made a big public announcement--but every single one of them are taking  this tax reform and the benefits they are getting from that, and they  are reinvesting it into their people, their  [[Page S1401]]  workers, their company's plant, equipment, technology, making their  workers more productive. So 400 is impressive, but I know it is much  larger than that. Thousands of businesses are taking advantage of this  and therefore their employers are and therefore you are seeing this  increased optimism.   The final example I want to talk about is one that has to do with our  communities. I recently visited the University Hospital Rainbow Center  for Women and Children in Cleveland, OH--a really impressive new  facility they are building. This is a new $26 million medical facility,  and I learned during this visit that it was the new markets tax credit  that was key to making this project possible. New markets is a tax  incentive to spur economic growth and community redevelopment projects,  and it helps to spur private investment, as it did in this case. In  this Cleveland case, it spawned significant private investment from  foundations and from individuals. This is something that has worked in  the cities I represent in Ohio. We fought to preserve the new markets  tax credit in the Senate version of the tax legislation, and the final  agreement that became law has the new markets tax credit made  permanent. That is critical for economic development opportunities like  this new university hospital medical center I talked about.   So these benefits from tax reform are not abstract. They are very  real. They are extra money in your paycheck, they are more affordable  healthcare coverage, they are increased investments in emerging  communities, and much more.   As the good news continues to roll in from tax reform, I will keep  traveling Ohio, meeting with businesses, families, and workers to  discuss ways tax reform can help them achieve a better economic future.  A brighter future is really what our tax reform and tax cut legislation  was all about.                            ____________________     Mr. President, finally, I want to talk about something  else we were working on in Congress to create a brighter future for  many Americans. I am talking about our efforts to provide justice for  victims of sex trafficking and to hold accountable those online  entities, those websites that knowingly facilitate these evil crimes. I  am talking about this because, although this week we are focused on  these reforms to Dodd-Frank to help our smaller banks make the economy  stronger and help individuals and small companies, next week we hope to  take up this issue of sex trafficking.   We are closer than ever to getting this legislation passed, and just  recently we had some good news in our bipartisan effort. The Stop  Enabling Sex Traffickers Act, or SESTA, a bill I introduced with 24  Senators back in August, is gaining momentum in Congress. Last week,  the House of Representatives actually offered the SESTA legislation as  an amendment on the floor to a broader bill, and it passed by an  overwhelming vote--over 300 votes. Just a couple of days later, the  White House expressed their support for this legislation.   It is now the Senate's turn to act on this critically important  issue, and Leader McConnell--the leadership in the Senate--again has  made a commitment to me and my colleagues that we will hold a vote on  this sex trafficking legislation, the SESTA legislation, in the next  couple of weeks. We now have 67 Senate cosponsors for SESTA. That is  not typical around here.   It is a majority of Democrats; it is a majority of Republicans--two- thirds of the Senators in this body. By the way, this is a diverse  group with wide-ranging political and ideological backgrounds. They  have all signed on to this legislation because they want to be part of  the solution. It is a commonsense solution to what is unfortunately a  growing problem here in our country and in every State represented here  in this body.   Unbelievably, sex trafficking is actually increasing in this country  right now. In this century, in this country, sex trafficking is  actually increasing. How can that be? What the experts tell us is that  it is because of the online presence of these evil websites that are  selling women and children online. The ruthless efficiency of social  media--of the online presence of these websites--is what is causing  this increase.   Victims of sex trafficking in Ohio have told me, as I have met with  them: Rob, this has moved from the street corner to the smartphone. One  website called backpage.com is the industry leader in online sex  trafficking. They are involved in nearly 75 percent of all child  trafficking reports that the National Center for Missing and Exploited  Children receives from the public. Seventy-five percent of the reports  that this great organization receives to try to stop sex trafficking  relate to this one site.   The Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations here in the Senate,  which I chair, conducted an 18-month investigation into this issue. We  looked at what the online presence was and why it was happening. We  learned, of course, that backpage.com was by far the biggest problem.  We found that backpage not only had the vast majority of the commercial  sex traffic on their site, but they had knowingly facilitated and  assisted criminal sex trafficking and covered up evidence of those  crimes in order to increase their own profits.   For years, unbelievably, we have allowed them to get away with it. I  think that is a stain on our national character. I think we need to  address it, particularly because we have the opportunity here in the  Senate to change a Federal law to help stop this.   Courts have consistently ruled that backpage.com and these other  websites are protected by a Federal law--a law that we passed over two  decades ago--called the Communications Decency Act that protects these  websites from liability for crimes users commit through their site, no  matter how complicit they are in those crimes. It was certainly not the  intent of Congress to permit this, but that is how the courts have  interpreted it.   Prosecutors and courts from across the country, including 50 State  attorneys general, have called on Congress to fix this injustice. In  one of the most direct calls that I have seen, a Sacramento judge last  year dropped pimping charges against backpage.com, stating: ``If and  until Congress sees fit to amend the immunity law, the broad reach of  Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act even applies to those  alleged to support the exploitation of others by human trafficking.''  In other words, this judge is saying that there is now an immunity--a  protection under Federal law--that allows these people, even when they  are knowingly involved with sex trafficking, to continue to do what  they are doing.   Our legislation makes two very simple changes to the Federal law that  currently protects websites like backpage in an effort to restore  justice.   First, SESTA says that if you are violating a Federal law, the  Federal law on trafficking--and that is a law that was in existence  long before we started this investigation. It is a law that is well  established. If you are violating the Federal law on trafficking,  assisting, supporting, or facilitating sex trafficking, and if you are  doing it knowingly, which is a very high standard to prove, then you  can be held liable and held to account. Again, this is very narrowly  targeted legislation to deal with this specific problem.   Second, the legislation will allow State attorneys general--who  cannot now but would be able under this legislation--to prosecute  websites that violate Federal sex trafficking laws. It is very  important because that is where you are going to see most of the  action--at the State level, the State prosecutors.   We have tailored this legislation narrowly to ensure no threat to the  freedom of the internet but ensure we are getting at this problem and  actually dealing with immunity in Federal law.   Sex trafficking survivors, their families, and anti-trafficking  advocates have shown great courage by sharing their tragic stories and  personal accounts of injustice at the hands of online sex traffickers  as we worked with them to develop this narrowly crafted legislation.   In testimony before the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations and  in testimony before the Commerce Committee--which unanimously endorsed  this legislation--we heard from victims and their families. We heard  from moms who told us about their teenage daughters having been  trafficked online.  [[Page S1402]]    One mom talked about her daughter who, at 14, was trafficked. She had  been missing for 10 weeks. She finally found a photograph of her  daughter on backpage. She called and said: I found my daughter. She is  on your website. Thank you for taking her off your website. She is 14  years old.   The person at the other end of the line from backpage said: Did you  pay for the ad?   The mom said: No, I didn't pay for the ad. That is my daughter.   They said: Then we can't take down the ad.   That is who these people are.   They have shown great courage by coming forward with their stories.  Now it is our turn to show courage by coming together and voting on  this bill, sending it to the President's desk, and fixing this problem,  fixing the Federal law to allow justice for the trafficking victims and  to finally hold accountable those who knowingly facilitate these  crimes.   We have an opportunity to do something important here to create a  better, safer, and more just society. I am hopeful that next week we  will have that legislation before this body. We will have the debate.  We will pass the legislation and begin to provide these victims of  trafficking the justice they deserve and, most importantly, stop women  and children from being exploited online.   Thank you, Mr. President.   I yield back my time.                            ____________________
