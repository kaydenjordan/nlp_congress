 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Last week, Republicans tried to take away your health care; and,  today, they are trying to take away your privacy.   Republicans have said broadband providers and other internet  companies should be under the same privacy rules. But oddly enough,  when the committee considered an amendment to give the FTC, the Federal  Trade Commission, rulemaking authority like the FCC, a change that  would allow the agencies to adopt the same privacy protection, every  single Republican voted no. In fact, Republicans proposed making it  harder for the FTC to pursue privacy and data security cases.   The protections that the FCC adopted last year were very simple:  consumers should know what data is being collected, opt in to sharing  of sensitive data, have their data reasonably protected, and receive  notice when their data is compromised. But this dangerous resolution  puts America's privacy and data security at risk.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to stand up for consumers  and vote ``no.''
