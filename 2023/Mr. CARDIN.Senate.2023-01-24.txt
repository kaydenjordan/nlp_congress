 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, President Biden, on June 3, 2021, issued  a memorandum on ``Establishing the Fight Against Corruption as a Core  United States National Security Interest.'' I want to quote from the  President when he issued that memorandum. President Biden said:         Corruption threatens United States national security,       economic equity, global anti-poverty and development efforts,       and democracy itself. . . . [B]y effectively preventing and       countering corruption and demonstrating the advantages of       transparent and accountable governance, we can secure a       critical advantage for the United States and other       democracies.    Corruption is a national security core interest. Corruption is the  source of Mr. Putin's resources that he uses for his international  activities, including the war in Ukraine and to try to bring down  democratic states.   Today, the Atlantic Council is releasing a report--the report titled  ``Why the kleptocrats still win: A strategy for the United States and  Europe to address weaponized corruption.'' The report points out how  the kleptocrats hide their wealth in Western countries because they  believe it is safer in Western countries to hide their wealth. And the  report points out the need for us to coordinate efforts between the  United States and Europe.   Today, I am filing legislation, the Combating Global Corruption Act.  I am joined by my friend Senator Todd Young of Indiana--bipartisan  legislation--to deal with the U.S. leadership in fighting global  corruption. It will give the State Department and the United States an  important tool. It will give the United States leadership in showing  the international community the steps that need to be taken in order to  counter corruption. It would require the State Department to publish a  list of countries in three tiers, the highest tier being those  countries that are taking the steps necessary to fight corruption; the  bottom tier would be those countries that are not making the required  effort to deal with corruption in their country.   The State Department will be using internationally established  standards for fighting corruption that the international community has  already signed off on as being the proper way to fight corruption in  your particular state.   For example, it references the Inter-American Convention Against  Corruption, the Organization of American States--the OAS--that was  passed in 1996: acknowledged procedures in our hemisphere to deal with  corruption. It references the Convention on Combating Bribery of  Foreign Public Officials, international business transactions of the  Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development--the OECD--which  was adopted in 1997.   It references the United Nations Convention against Transnational  Organized Crime that was agreed to in 2000 and the United Nations  Convention against Corruption, which was agreed to in 2003.   These guidelines already exist and allow the United States to use  those guidelines that have already been established by the global  community to judge how every state is meeting their commitment to fight  corruption.   Countries that are not meeting their commitment, we put a spotlight  on them. That spotlight encourages them to do more. It points out ways  in which they can take action to fight corruption in their own country.   Now, this is not a new strategy that we just came up with that we  start giving a report on all countries on how well they are doing in  fighting corruption. It is not a new concept. We have done that  successfully in several other areas. One that we should take great  pride in this institution--because we were ones who established this-- is the Trafficking in Persons requirements.   Today, the United States files a report on every country as to how  well they are meeting their international responsibilities to protect  the modern victims of slavery, trafficking in persons. It has been  bipartisan. It has been very effective.   Secretary of State Blinken said, in releasing the report of this  year, on July 19, 2022, he said:         Today we're releasing the 2022 Trafficking in Persons       Report. It assesses how 188 countries and territories,       including the United States, are performing in terms of       preventing trafficking, protecting victims, prosecuting       traffickers. That makes this one of the most comprehensive       sources of information anywhere on anti-trafficking efforts       by government--what works, what doesn't, and how we can       continue to do better.    We do that in preventing trafficking. We can do that in stopping  corruption.   We have a country report on human rights. Again, I will quote from  Secretary of State Blinken when he released this report on April 2,  2022. This is a report that judges all countries on how well they are  dealing with human rights. Secretary Blinken said, in releasing that  report on April 2 of last year:         For nearly five decades, the United States has issued the       Country Reports on Human Rights Practices, which strive to       provide a factual and objective record on the status of human       rights worldwide--in 2021, covering 198 countries and       territories. The information contained in these reports could       not be more vital or urgent given ongoing human rights abuses       and violations in many countries, continued democratic       backsliding on several continents, and creeping       authoritarianism that threatens both human rights and       democracy--most notably, at present, with Russia's unprovoked       attack on Ukraine.    [A]nd using resources like the Country Reports on Human Rights  Practices, we can come closer to building a world where respect for  human rights is truly universal.   That human rights report works. Putting a spotlight on what countries  need to do brings about change. It promotes a core value in the United  States, respect for human rights and good governance. We do that here  in the United States to show global leadership.   I will mention one other report that is issued by our State  Department, one on international religious freedom. Again, this was  bipartisan. So on June 2 of last year, Secretary Blinken said, when he  released the International Religious Freedom Report:         This report offers a thorough, fact-based review of the       state of religious freedom in nearly 200 countries and       territories around the world. We produced this document every       year since 1998. . . . Now, more than two decades later, we       have more than 35 governments and multilateral organizations       that have created offices that are dedicated to this goal.        This year's report includes several countries where we see       notable progress thanks to the work of governments, civil       society organizations, and citizens. For example, last year,       the Kingdom of Morocco launched an initiative to renovate       Jewish heritage sites like synagogues and cemeteries, and to       include Jewish history in the Moroccan public school       curriculum. . . . [T]his report is about  [[Page S78]]       spreading that kind of progress to more parts of the world. .       . . Unfortunately, the report also shows that we have more       work to do.    There is value in what we do in showing the international community  what works, what doesn't work, what countries are doing to make  progress, whether it is on trafficking, whether it is on human rights,  whether it is on religious freedom. And we need to do the same on  fighting corruption. We had the model that works. And the legislation  that Senator Young and I have introduced today allows us to provide  such a report in fighting corruption.   The legislation also gives the Secretary of State some additional  tools that could be helpful. The bill directs the Secretary of State  and Treasury to evaluate whether there are foreign persons engaged in  significant corruption for the purposes of potential imposition of  sanctions under the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act in  the countries listed in tier 3. That is the lowest performing tier.   I mention that because the Magnitsky Sanctions have had a proud  history in this Chamber. We initiated the Magnitsky Sanctions  originally against Russia because of the torture and death of Sergei  Magnitsky. We then made it global for those that are perpetrating gross  violations of international human rights.   I introduced the legislation with my partner who was the late Senator  McCain. The two of us said we need to include corruption as one of the  basic human rights violations that would be eligible for individual  sanctions. And we did.   In the last Congress, we made the Global Magnitsky Sanctions  permanent. And I was proud that we were able to do that in the National  Defense Authorization Act. What is unique by these sanctions is that  they are individual. They are not against the country. They are  personal to the individual who violates the basic rights.   And what does it do? It prevents them from getting a visa to come to  America because they like to visit their wealth that is here in our  country. And it prevents them from using our banking system. It works.   It was reportedly the first issue between Mr. Putin and President  Trump in their first bilateral summit meeting. Mr. Putin was upset  about these sanctions. Good. I am glad that he is.   This legislation that Senator Young and I have introduced allows us  to look at whether we should be using these individual sanctions--these  Magnitsky Sanctions--against the perpetrators of corruption who have  not been held accountable in their own country.   There is lot to be said about why this legislation is so important.  So I would like to just conclude by pointing out the bill that we  introduced today is nearly identical to the bill that we introduced in  the last Congress. It was reported out on a bipartisan basis by the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee.   I want to thank Senator Menendez for his help and Senator Risch for  his help. This is not a partisan bill. This is a bipartisan bill to  promote an American value and a national security concern and that is  making sure that America leads in fighting corruption so we do not have  the resources going into a country like Russia, where Mr. Putin uses it  to try to bring down our system of government.   I urge my colleagues to join me and Senator Young in this effort. I  hope that we are able to pass this bill quickly in the U.S. Senate.   We came close to doing it in the last Congress. We can get it passed  in the House and signed by the President. I think we will look back at  this day when that report comes out and say that we were able to  accomplish concrete improvements in making this world a better place,  in promoting American values, that this report will make a difference.                            ____________________     Madam President, President Biden, on June 3, 2021, issued  a memorandum on ``Establishing the Fight Against Corruption as a Core  United States National Security Interest.''
