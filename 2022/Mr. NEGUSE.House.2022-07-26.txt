 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 1254 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 1254         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 3771) to       amend the Public Health Service Act to provide for research       and improvement of cardiovascular health among the South       Asian population of the United States, and for other       purposes. All points of order against consideration of the       bill are waived. In lieu of the amendment in the nature of a       substitute recommended by the Committee on Energy and       Commerce now printed in the bill, an amendment in the nature       of a substitute consisting of the text of Rules Committee       Print 117-58 shall be considered as adopted. The bill, as       amended, shall be considered as read. All points of order       against provisions in the bill, as amended, are waived. The       previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill,       as amended, and on any further amendment thereto, to final       passage without intervening motion except: (1) one hour of       debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and       ranking minority member of the Committee on Energy and       Commerce or their respective designees; (2) the further       amendment printed in part A of the report of the Committee on       Rules accompanying this resolution, if offered by the Member       designated in the report, which shall be in order without       intervention of any point of order, shall be considered as       read, shall be separately debatable for the time specified in       the report equally divided and controlled by the proponent       and an opponent, and shall not be subject to a demand for       division of the question; and (3) one motion to recommit.        Sec. 2.  At any time after adoption of this resolution the       Speaker may, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare       the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       5118) to direct the Secretary of Agriculture to prioritize       the completion of the Continental Divide National Scenic       Trail, and for other purposes. The first reading of the bill       shall be dispensed with. All points of order against       consideration of the bill are waived. General debate shall be       confined to the bill and amendments specified in this section       and shall not exceed one hour equally divided and controlled       by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on       Natural Resources or their respective designees.

The       bill, as amended, shall be considered as the original bill       for the purpose of further amendment under the five-minute       rule and shall be considered as read. All points of order       against provisions in the bill, as amended, are waived. No       further amendment to the bill, as amended, shall be in order       except those printed in part C of the report of the Committee       on Rules accompanying this resolution.

All points of order against such further       amendments are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of       the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report       the bill, as amended, to the House with such further       amendments as may have been adopted. In the case of sundry       further amendments reported from the Committee, the question       of their adoption shall be put to the House en gros and       without division of the question. The previous question shall       be considered as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto       to final passage without intervening motion except one motion       to recommit.        Sec. 3.  During consideration of H.R. 5118, the Chair may       entertain a motion that the Committee rise only if offered by       the chair of the Committee on Natural Resources or his       designee. The Chair may not entertain a motion to strike out       the enacting words of the bill (as described in clause 9 of       rule XVIII).        Sec. 4.  Upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in       order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 6929) to       increase the benefits guaranteed in connection with certain       pension plans, and for other purposes. All points of order       against consideration of the bill are waived. The amendment       printed in part D of the report of the Committee on Rules       accompanying this resolution shall be considered as adopted.       The bill, as amended, shall be considered as read. All points       of order against provisions in the bill, as amended, are       waived. The previous question shall be considered as ordered       on the bill, as amended, and on any further amendment       thereto, to final passage without intervening motion except:       (1) one hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the       chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Ways       and Means or their respective designees; (2) the further       amendment printed in part E of the report of the Committee on       Rules accompanying this resolution, if offered by the Member       designated in the report, which shall be in order without       intervention of any point of order, shall be considered as       read, shall be separately debatable for the time specified in       the report equally divided and controlled by the proponent       and an opponent, and shall not be subject to a demand for       division of the question; and (3) one motion to recommit.        Sec. 5. (a) At any time through the legislative day of       Friday, July 29, 2022, the Speaker may entertain motions       offered by the Majority Leader or a designee that the House       suspend the rules as though under clause 1 of rule XV with       respect to multiple measures described in subsection (b), and       the Chair shall put the question on any such motion without       debate or intervening motion.        (b) A measure referred to in subsection (a) includes any       measure that was the object of a motion to suspend the rules       on the legislative day of July 26, 2022, July 27, 2022, July       28, 2022, or July 29, 2022, in the form as so offered, on       which the yeas and nays were ordered and further proceedings       postponed pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX.        (c) Upon the offering of a motion pursuant to subsection       (a) concerning multiple measures, the ordering of the yeas       and nays on postponed motions to suspend the rules with       respect to such measures is vacated to the end that all such       motions are considered as withdrawn.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Burgess), pending  which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During consideration  of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the Rules Committee met and reported a rule, House  Resolution 1254, which provides for consideration of H.R. 3771, the  South Asian Heart Health Awareness and Research Act, under a structured  rule. It provides 1 hour of debate, equally divided and controlled by  the chair and the ranking minority member of the Committee on Energy  and Commerce, making in order one amendment, and provides one motion to  recommit.   The rule also provides for consideration of H.R. 5118, the Wildfire  Response and Drought Resiliency Act, under a structured rule. The rule  self-executes a manager's amendment from Chairman Grijalva, makes in  order three amendments, provides 1 hour of debate, equally divided and  controlled by the chair and the ranking minority member of the  Committee on Natural Resources, and provides one motion to recommit.   The rule also provides for consideration of H.R. 6929, the Susan  Muffley Act, under a structured rule. The rule self-executes a  manager's amendment from Chairman Neal, makes in order one amendment,  provides 1 hour of debate, equally divided and controlled by the chair  and the ranking minority member of the Committee on Ways and Means, and  provides one motion to recommit.   Finally, the rule provides the majority leader or his designee the  ability to en bloc requested roll call votes on suspension bills  considered on July 26 through July 29. That authority lasts through  July 29.   Mr. Speaker, I am grateful to have the opportunity to argue the rule  today on three important bills. The first, as I mentioned, is H.R.  3771, which has been brought forward by our colleague from Washington  (Ms. Jayapal). We are grateful to her for her leadership on this  particular bill, the South Asian Heart Awareness and Research Act.   As you may know, Mr. Speaker, heart disease is the leading cause of  death in the United States. South Asian Americans are four times more  likely to be at risk of developing heart disease than the general  population. Congress must invest in strategies to reverse that deadly  trend.   This legislation establishes a grant program to provide for community  groups involved in South Asian heart health promotion. The bill also  supports health research by authorizing the Secretary of Health and  Human Services to conduct research related to cardiovascular disease,  type 2 diabetes, and other heart-related diseases among various  populations.   Again, I thank Representatives Jayapal and Wilson for not only  raising awareness about the risk factors for heart disease but also  ensuring that those living with heart disease receive the care, the  treatment, and the support that they need.   The rule also provides for consideration of a second bill, H.R. 6929,  the Susan Muffley Act of 2022, brought forward by our distinguished  colleague from Michigan (Mr. Kildee). We are very grateful to Mr.  Kildee for his leadership on this particular bill and the clarion call  that he has offered year after year in fighting for relief for those in  the manufacturing sector.   As the Speaker may know, the economic downturn that started in  December 2007 significantly impacted the manufacturing sector  throughout the United States, including Michigan. During this time, the  auto industry underwent a major restructuring with the assistance of  the Obama administration through the Presidential Task Force on the  Auto Industry. General Motors and Chrysler required financial  assistance from the Federal Government at that time.   The Delphi Corporation, which Mr. Kildee will explain in greater  detail, formerly a wholly owned subsidiary of General Motors, was a  major supplier of auto parts and components in the industry. In 2005,  Delphi declared bankruptcy due to a downturn in sales. During their  reorganization, General Motors agreed to assist Delphi by assuming some  of the company's pension liabilities.   General Motors backed out of that deal in July 2009, and the pension  plans were terminated by the U.S. Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation,  a government corporation that insures the pension benefits of workers  in the private sector.   The Federal Government cut retirement benefits by as much as 70  percent,  [[Page H7136]]  Mr. Speaker, for more than 20,000 salaried retirees.   The Susan Muffley Act, brought forward by Mr. Kildee, will right this  wrong. The bill is named after Susan Muffley, whose husband was one of  the 20,000 retirees who saw their benefits reduced when the plan was  terminated. She joined the Delphi Salaried Retirees Association, and  she became part of the core leadership of that group, which fought to  restore their pension benefits.   Mr. Speaker, fundamentally, this is a pretty simple bill. If you work  hard and play by the rules, you should be able to retire with dignity  in America.   These hardworking retirees have waited too long to receive the  benefits that they earned, but thanks to Representatives Kildee and  Turner, and with the support of this Chamber, they won't have to wait  much longer.   The rule provides for consideration of one final bill, my bill, H.R.  5118, the Wildfire Response and Drought Resiliency Act.   Catastrophic wildfires and drought, exacerbated by the climate  crisis, are wreaking havoc on much of the Western United States and  across many regions of our country, impacting millions of Americans,  including in my State, the great State of Colorado.    This crisis is harming ecosystems, impacting water supplies and food  production, and risking the well-being and the livelihood of countless  families.   The Wildfire Response and Drought Resiliency Act represents a major  step by House Democrats to address the dual crises of wildfire and  drought plaguing communities across the country, communities like those  in my district, Colorado's Second Congressional District.   The legislation makes specific strategic and targeted investments to  protect communities from catastrophic wildfires, reduce risks of future  fires, and help our firefighters currently fighting these flames.  Similarly, the bill improves drought resiliency by investing in water  projects with rapid timelines, modernizing data and technology, and  providing near-term drought response.   The package builds on the investments that were made as part of the  bipartisan infrastructure law that this Chamber passed last year and  supports a whole-of-government commitment to addressing the climate  threats that are already impacting millions of Americans.   This bill is a critically important bill, and if I might, I will  offer one final story to explain why.                                time  1830    On December 30 of last year, the Marshall fire swept through the city  of Louisville, the town of Superior, and unincorporated areas of  Boulder County, all incredible communities that I have the privilege of  representing here in the United States Congress. That fire destroyed  and damaged more than 1,000 homes in a single night. It became the most  destructive wildfire that our State has ever known.   Over the last several months, I have heard countless concerns from  Coloradans across our great State, including in my district, about  future wildfires, about our ability to recover, about our ability to  build resiliency and tackle the drought that we are experiencing.   This bill meets those needs. It meets the needs of the American West,  and that is why I am proud to support the bill and to present this  evening on the rule for consideration of the same.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, before I yield to Mr. Kildee, let me just  respond a bit to my distinguished colleague from the State of Texas to  say, first, I know he made reference to priorities vis-a-vis the  appropriations legislation.   I think that most Americans who are watching these proceedings  tonight would agree that our work to help Americans stay healthy is an  important priority, that our work to increase firefighter pay for those  brave firefighters that are sacrificing so much to keep our communities  safe, that that is an important priority; that righting a wrong that  unjustly impacted tens of thousands of hardworking American families,  workers in Michigan and Ohio, that that is an important priority.   I will say with respect to the wildfire bill and the gentleman's  comments regarding forest management, I agree with regard to his praise  for the Forest Service's 10-year national wildfire plan. That plan was  funded through the bipartisan infrastructure bill which, unfortunately,  so many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle opposed.   But for House Democrats getting that bill done, the wildfire plan  that my friend praises, would not have been enacted by the Forest  Service. The good news, Mr. Speaker, is that my colleague has another  opportunity to vote on a bill that would authorize additional projects  that he and so many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle  apparently support.   That bill is the bill that we are debating this week. That bill is  the Wildfire Response and Drought Resiliency Act because it includes an  authorization for funding of additional projects so the Forest Service  can continue doing the important work that it is doing in Colorado,  Idaho, Utah, Arizona, and across the Western United States.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Kildee).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I will yield to my distinguished colleague from Colorado in just a  moment, but before I do, I would be remiss if I didn't say that I heard  the comment that my distinguished colleague from Texas made earlier  with great interest regarding the supposed partisanship of the three  bills that we are considering today under this rule.    I think it is important for both the Speaker and the American people,  those who are watching, to perhaps clarify what it is precisely that we  are debating this evening and what we will be debating this week.   Just as a reminder, again, a bill to help Americans stay healthy; a  bill to right a wrong that was generated through the bankruptcy of  General Motors that impacted hundreds of thousands of Americans,  hardworking families in Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and across our  country; and addressing the scourge of wildfires across the United  States, including by increasing the pay for our Federal wildland  firefighters. That is what these three bills that we are going to be  considering this week and that are part of this structured rule are all  about.   I have to say to the gentleman from New York, whom I have great  respect for, that I say thank you to him for supporting one of these  bills, H.R. 6929, the bill brought forward by Mr. Kildee. I was a bit  surprised when the gentleman from Texas said that these proposals were  not bipartisan, when, in fact, H.R. 6929 is supported by many of my  colleagues from the other side of the aisle and led by Mr. Turner of  Ohio.   I was just as surprised when he described the bills in that fashion,  since H.R. 3771 is also co-led by a Republican member, Mr. Fitzpatrick  of Pennsylvania.   I was just as surprised when he characterized our wildfire bill in  that fashion, given that Mr. LaMalfa and Mr. Moore have two bills  included within that omnibus package.                                time  1900    These are bipartisan solutions in my view and in the view of many of  my colleagues, and it is important that we proceed to debating them on  the merits, which is precisely why I encourage my colleagues to vote  for the rule.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr.  Perlmutter), a distinguished member of the Rules Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, today's rule is a testament to the hard work of so many  of my colleagues and the House Democratic Caucus.   These underlying bills will make our communities more resilient. They  count for the impacts of climate change, invest in our Nation's public  health infrastructure, and fix a decades-old mistake by restoring  terminated pensions for hardworking Americans across our country.   Contrary to what my Republican colleague would have you believe about  these bills, two of these bills are bipartisan. They are co-led by  Republican Members of the House.   The other bill incorporates multiple bills and legislative proposals  that have been introduced by Republican Members of the House.   Mr. Speaker, Americans are worth investing in. Our families, our  students, our firefighters, our manufacturers, our communities are  worth investing in.   I urge a ``yes'' vote on this rule.   The text of the material previously referred to by Mr. Burgess is as  follows:                     Amendment to House Resolution 1254         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 6. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the       House shall proceed to the consideration in the House of the       resolution (H. Res. 1255) expressing continued support for       all U.S. Border Patrol agents who carry out the important       mission of securing our borders. The resolution shall be       considered as read. The previous question shall be considered       as ordered on the resolution and preamble to adoption without       intervening motion or demand for division of the question       except one hour of debate equally divided and controlled by       the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on       Homeland Security. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to       the consideration of House Resolution 1255.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.
