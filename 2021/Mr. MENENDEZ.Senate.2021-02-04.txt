 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I come to the floor today to make the  case that we should invest $10 billion in the prevention and defeat of  COVID-19 in the foreign assistance portion of this budget resolution.   For so long as COVID-19 is anywhere, it can spread everywhere,  directly threatening our national security, our economy, and the health  and safety of the American people.   COVID-19 has devastated the world. To date, there have been nearly  103 million confirmed cases worldwide. More than 2 million people have  died, including over 450,000 in the United States.   The lockdowns necessitated by the pandemic have triggered the worst  recession since the Great Depression. We must join with our partners  and allies around the globe to end this scourge once and for all.   Now, with so many Americans shattered by the death, disruption, and  economic devastation unleashed by the coronavirus, I am sure more than  a few would question why we should bother spending any resources in the  global fight against COVID-19, let alone $10 billion.   The simple answer is: COVID-19 knows no borders.   The pandemic didn't start here, but it came here. The world is in a  race against COVID-19, and we cannot lose, for the longer we allow this  virus to spread, the more it will mutate into new strains, and the more  that it mutates into new strains, the greater the threat to the  efficacy of our vaccines and our ability to rebuild our economy and  restore our way of life.   This $10 billion investment will ramp up American efforts to fight  COVID-19 and stop new variants before they reach our shores and cost  more American lives.  [[Page S429]]    It will fund humanitarian assistance to respond to the suffering  inflicted by COVID-19 and channel resources to international  organizations charged with responding to these challenges and  preventing further spread. And it will support the global race to  develop new vaccines.   As Dr. Anthony Fauci publicly stated last month, we have to start  work now preparing additional vaccines to deal with new and virulent  strains of COVID-19.   This will require investment both at home and abroad.   In addition to our own efforts, we must invest in international  research and development and support technology transfers so that  vaccines capable of protecting us from future variants are produced and  made available quickly around the world.   The package also includes funding for global health programs that  strengthen health systems in developing countries. As we have learned  firsthand, COVID-19 can overwhelm even the most robust of healthcare  systems. For countries with poorer public health infrastructure, the  challenge is exponentially harder. And the longer we allow COVID-19 to  ravage health systems around the globe, the longer it will remain a  threat to the United States.   The resolution will also help us protect two decades' worth of  investments to combat the spread of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria  through the Global Fund. Specifically, the resolution ensures that  lifesaving treatments for those three deadly diseases continues.   It also provides resources to support the Global Fund's newly  developed COVID-19 response mechanism, allowing countries to better  prevent, care for, and treat this disease.   It is hard to recapture the scale of the suffering unleashed by this  pandemic, but here is what we know: The number of people facing  faminelike conditions around the world has doubled, and child  malnutrition and death rates are on the rise. Through this resolution,  we will be able to address the pandemic's toll on the most vulnerable,  including children and refugees, by funding organizations such as the  World Food Programme and UNICEF.   It will also enable us to help confront dramatically increased rates  of violence against women and girls, what the United Nations has called  the ``shadow pandemic'' of gender-based violence. And it will provide  urgently needed funding for the World Health Organization, which the  Biden administration rejoined on the President's first day in office.   We cannot forfeit our seat at the table to other countries that do  not share our values or our interests. We must engage, and we must  lead.   Finally, the resolution will support ongoing State Department and  USAID operations that protect Americans overseas and advance our  diplomatic and economic interests around the globe. We must begin to  undo the damage to the State Department and USAID wrought by the Trump  administration and ensure that both agencies have the resources to deal  with the effects of COVID-19, including the impacts on our foreign  service officers and their families, Embassy operations, and lost  revenue due to disruption of services, even as we look to replenish and  revive these critical instruments for our national security.   So I will end where I began: We cannot hermetically seal ourselves  and believe that we can avoid any consequences from anyplace across the  globe. Disease, including this one, knows no boundaries, knows no  borders.   Unless and until COVID-19 is stamped out globally, American lives and  livelihoods remain at risk. Simply put, our international efforts to  stop the spread of COVID-19 abroad are directly linked to our national  and economic security at home.   So I urge all of my colleagues to support continued relief, recovery,  and prevention efforts by voting in support of the budget resolution   I yield the floor to my distinguished colleague, the senior member of  the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Mr. Cardin.    Mr. President, I oppose this amendment because my  distinguished colleague and friend put it in a very narrow context.   The reality is that this amendment suggests that all agreements,  proclamations, or declarations entered into between the United States  and Mexico will be preserved. The problem is Congress does not have a  clear picture of the international agreements, arrangements, and  supporting documents that the Trump administration negotiated with  Mexico. I requested those documents for almost 2 years as the ranking  member on the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. Yet the Trump  administration was afraid to put them up for congressional and public  scrutiny.   Without knowing what they say or how low they may have stooped, I  don't see how any Member can take an educated vote on this amendment to  consent to that which Members don't even know exists.   I, therefore, oppose the amendment for those and other reasons.                                Point of Order    Mr. President, I raise a point of order that the pending amendment is  not  [[Page S440]]  germane to the underlying resolution and, therefore, violates section  305(b)(2) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.                               Motion to Waive
