 Mr. Chair, today, I rise in support of an amendment to  the underlying bill, the National Defense Authorization Act.   The NDAA is a bill that articulates our defense priorities and  secures our national interests. I am very, very proud and thankful to  Chairman Smith and committee staff to have incorporated a number of  provisions into this bill. Of particular importance, I am honored to  have included a provision that improves privatized military housing.   I think all of us can agree that it is imperative that the Department  of Defense develop a holistic solution to remedy systemic privatized  military housing issues and empower servicemembers and their families.   I saw this need firsthand in my district while engaging with  servicemember constituents throughout this past year. That is why I  offered legislation that was included in the NDAA that enhanced  transparency, communication, and accountability standards.   The core elements of this bill, the Better Military Housing Act,  included a tenant bill of rights, housing advocacy, and an improved  work order system.   This amendment that I am speaking about today adds two additional  important provisions.   First, it authorizes an additional $5 million for new military  housing construction, utilizing the Army's high-performance and healthy  living All-American Abode design.   Second, it requires the Department of Defense to provide an  accounting for the legal services available to servicemembers harmed by  health or environmental hazards while living in privatized military  housing.   We must continue to prioritize the health and safety and the  lifestyles of our servicemembers and their families. They serve us.  Let's continue to serve them.   I thank Chairman Smith, the committee, the professional staff, and my  colleagues for their support on my amendments.
