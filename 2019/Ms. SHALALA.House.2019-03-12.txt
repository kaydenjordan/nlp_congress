 Madam Speaker, last weekend, I traveled to the Colombia- Venezuela border to see firsthand the catastrophic humanitarian and  public health crisis caused by the criminal Maduro regime.   I met with refugees at a hospital in Colombia and heard their  harrowing stories of being on the verge of death due to malnutrition,  treatable diseases, and a lack of medical care for high-risk  pregnancies.   People with HIV cannot access antiretroviral drugs, as the government  supplies dwindle and the Maduro regime continues to reject humanitarian  aid. And now this crisis is spreading.   I met with Colombian officials who are doing everything they can to  support 1.5 million refugees crossing the border. They can't do it  alone. We must increase aid to countries like Colombia for public  health.   Madam Speaker, our response to the crisis must include supporting the  Venezuelan community that has already contributed to the richness of  south Florida and the United States. Thousands of Venezuelans claiming  political asylum in this country are stuck in limbo because of  unnecessary delays in the adjudication of their claims. Granting TPS is  necessary and humane for those Venezuelans now here.                            ____________________
