 Mr. President, I think we were all really pleased last  night to hear the President's unifying message. It was refreshing for  everyone after such a difficult election season. It was great to see  even my friend the Democratic leader occasionally applauding the  President last night. It is a reminder that we are all in this  together.   Yesterday, I laid out my hopes for his address to Congress. I said  that the middle class is ready for a new direction after 8 years of  disappointments. I said that we all knew what needed to get done, too-- issues like simplifying taxes to create more jobs, reforming  regulations to get the economy moving, and repealing and replacing  ObamaCare to bring relief to the middle class. It was great to hear the  President touch on each of those issues last night.   It was also great to hear him talk about his outstanding nominee to  the Supreme Court, Judge Neil Gorsuch--a judge who has earned  widespread acclaim and who will be a worthy successor to Justice Scalia  on the High Court.   Last night President Trump talked about a new spirit of optimism in  our country. He talked about repositioning us for success, both at home  and in a dangerous world. He talked about growing opportunity, better  jobs, and a thriving middle class. Then, he actually put forward  policies that could get us there. What a change from the last 8 years.   He also outlined some of the actions he has already taken to move  these priorities forward. For instance, he took action yesterday to  send the so-called waters of the United States rule back to the drawing  board. He demonstrated that there are realistic ways to protect our  Nation's waterways without excessive and duplicative regulations that  infringe on the property rights of individuals.   Let me again commend him for protecting the middle class from yet  another regulation based more on ideology than fact. It is just the  type of thing Americans are so tired of--leftwing regulations spun as  one thing, but that really do another; left-leaning laws that purport  to help the middle class, but that actually hurt middle-class families.   A great example of that is ObamaCare. Americans were promised that  costs would go down, but, of course, they went up. Americans were  promised more choice, but they got less. Americans were promised that  they could keep their plans, but that was a broken promise as well.   No wonder Americans were so tired of what they have seen over the  last 8 years. They are ready for something entirely new. They are ready  to start believing in the future again. The President made clear last  night that he is ready to work with Congress on policies that can  actually move us forward. He will find many partners in Congress  excited to get those things accomplished.   We share his commitment on other issues he outlined too. We agree  that our children deserve better than failing schools. We agree that  our veterans deserve better than failing bureaucracy. We agree that our  brothers and mothers and friends and neighbors deserve better than the  scourge of heroin and prescription opioid abuse.   In an era of divided government, Congress took what action we could  on those issues. It was often significant action, and we are all proud  of it. But we now have a chance to achieve even more. So, of course, we  are excited about the opportunity to improve the lives of the men and  women who sent us here. That is why we all signed up for this job in  the first place.   I am not just talking about Republicans. I know our Democratic  friends have different ideas than us on many of these things. I know  the far left is pressuring them to burn the place down because it can't  accept the results of last year's election. But everyone knows that  won't get us anywhere at all.   Let's remember that we have a historic opportunity before us. We can  [[Page S1510]]  keep refighting the last election over and over and over, or we can  heed the President's message of unity last night. We can come together  to accomplish big things. We can pull down the barriers of the past. We  can uphold, in the words of the Democratic leader himself, our ``moral  obligation'' to ``avoid gridlock and get the country to work again.''   Now, I know he said that just before the election. I know he hoped  the election would turn out differently. But we each have a duty to  accept the results. We each have a duty to bring the country together  and to move it forward. That is now the challenge before our Democratic  friends.   I ask them to meet the moment--to meet the moment. I hope they will  because the American people are counting on us all. They are ready for  a new start. We are determined to work hard on their behalf. As the  President himself said last night, so is he.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote on the  nomination, and I move to table the motion to reconsider.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.
