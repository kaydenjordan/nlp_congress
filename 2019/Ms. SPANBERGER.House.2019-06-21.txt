 Madam Speaker, central Virginia is home to some of  the most community-centered and service-minded students in the country,  and yesterday I was fortunate to recognize two of these students as  winners of the Congressional Award Gold Medal.   Two of my constituents, Kasey Mize from Jeffersonton and Ciara Noelle  Smith from Chesterfield, earned this national recognition for their  respective work in community service, personal development, physical  fitness, and exploration of the world around them.   Kasey's community service centered on organizing a sewing circle and  providing more than 200 dresses a year to impoverished girls around the  world, breaking down practical barriers that keep many girls from  attending schools.   Ciara's service to her community involved volunteer hours spent  working at the Science Museum of Virginia and constructing  rehabilitation structures for a central Virginia wildlife foundation.   Both young people have demonstrated an ability to set goals, make a  strategy, and see it through to the end.    Madam Speaker, I congratulate Kasey and Ciara on their  accomplishments. I look forward to seeing how these two amazing young  women will continue contributing to our Seventh District communities in  the future.                            ____________________
