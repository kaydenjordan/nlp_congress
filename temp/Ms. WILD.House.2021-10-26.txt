 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the bipartisan Family  Violence Prevention and Services Improvement Act of 2021, and, quite  honestly, it is just mind-boggling to me that anybody could find  anything to criticize about this bill.   Since it was signed into law four decades ago, the Family Violence  Prevention and Services Improvement Act has remained the main source of  Federal funding for the domestic violence shelters in which so many of  the most vulnerable people in our society find safety.   Despite the progress that we have made in this country in  acknowledging the scourge of domestic violence, Congress has not  provided the necessary resources to keep pace with this crisis. This  bill would reauthorize programs that have not been fully funded in more  than a decade, since 2010--programs that are a literal lifeline for all  those who are facing domestic violence across the country.    Domestic violence affects millions of Americans. According to the  Centers for Disease Control, around one in five homicide victims across  our Nation are killed by an intimate partner, and approximately one in  every five women and one in every seven men in the United States will  experience major physical violence from an intimate partner at some  point in their lives.   Madam Speaker, we must pass this critical legislation.
