 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. No  one can be a better spokeswoman for this issue than Mrs. Demings, who  proudly represents her district in Florida and served as the police  leader in her hometown.   Mr. Speaker, as we remember the police officers who have fallen in  the line of duty, it is with great sadness that I must add another name  to that list.   Officer Jimmy Inn of the Stockton Police Department was killed  yesterday while responding to a domestic violence call.   Just 30 years old, Officer Inn joined the force in 2015 and was a  member of the Honor Guard. He was a husband and a father who leaves  behind a 7-month-old son, a stepson, a stepdaughter, and a wife, who  also serves as a Stockton police officer.   Officer Inn is remembered as a kindhearted, selfless, and positive  person. His commanding officer, Stockton Police Chief Eric Jones, said  that he was the epitome of what a police officer should be.   Officer Inn's last act was to help a woman and child in grave danger.  Officer Inn sacrificed his life in service to others, and I ask  everyone to join me in honoring his life, his service, and his memory.
