 Mr. Speaker, this month, Californians have faced one of  the hottest and longest heat waves on record. From Sacramento to San  Diego, families have suffered triple-digit temperatures.   These extreme temperatures put an enormous strain on our electrical  grid. It is urgent that Americans increase the energy efficiency of our  homes.   Fortunately, the Inflation Reduction Act makes this transition easier  and cheaper. Thanks to this new law, which I helped pass, families can  get new tax credits and rebates for installing energy-efficient  products in their homes, including windows, water heaters, and heating  and cooling systems. I recently welcomed Secretary of Energy Jennifer  Granholm to visit an Orange County family saving money on utilities  with efficient appliances.   As the climate crisis continues to harm communities, the Inflation  Reduction Act delivers relief. We can conserve energy and save families  money at the same time.                       Nursing Homes Aren't Commodities     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to champion protecting our  seniors.   Wall Street shouldn't get to decide if older Americans can age with  dignity. But across the country, private equity firms are spending  billions to turn nursing homes into commodities.   When private equity firms take over nursing homes, they cut costs and  cut corners; they lay off trusted staff; and they stretch care workers  too thin to provide the care and attention older Americans need.  Quality of care declines, and deaths among residents rise dramatically.   We cannot entrust our loved ones to these bad actors. They focus on  maximizing returns for investors at the expense of delivering protected  care to seniors, their patients.   I have long pushed to hold private equity accountable and to end  corporate abuse in healthcare. The health and well-being of our seniors  are not for sale.                      Climate Crisis Is a Health Crisis     The climate crisis is a health crisis.   This month, high temperatures threaten the well-being of  Californians. For some, it was a matter of life and death.   In the past decade alone, extreme heat has killed 3,900 Californians.  We know who dies from extreme heat.                                time  1045    Older Americans die in homes they can't afford to keep cool. Workers  die in the sun, doing jobs they can't afford to lose.   After years of ignoring the climate crisis, our Nation has finally  directed resources to fighting climate change. Green investments in the  Inflation Reduction Act will help older adults live longer and avoid  heat-related health emergencies. They will protect our children from  wildfire smoke that causes chronic breathing conditions. And by  contributing to a healthier workforce, they will keep our economy  strong.                            Broadband Competition     Mr. Speaker, the ability to shop for the best deal is  fundamental to a free market economy. Yet, for years, many people in  apartments and office buildings have been stuck with only one option  for internet.   Service providers have unfairly locked out competitors by securing  exclusivity agreements with landlords. Tenants are trapped into one  choice for broadband, whether they are getting a fair deal or whether  they are getting ripped off.   Allowing big corporations to gatekeep the market is not healthy  capitalism. I have previously pushed for the Federal Communications  Commission to crack down on abusive Internet Service Providers. I am  pleased that the FCC unanimously adopted new rules this year to end  these predatory agreements.   Strengthening competition for broadband is proven to lower costs,  improve service, and promote innovation. Americans should have the  freedom to choose the internet plan that is best for them.                            ____________________
