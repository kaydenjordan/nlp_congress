 Mr. Speaker, there were over a dozen  instances in the past 10 years in which members of the Louisiana State  Police ignored or concealed evidence of beatings and interfered with  efforts to root out misconduct. The videos show extremely distressing  scenes where primarily Black Louisianans were subject to horrifying  violence by troopers.  [[Page H5106]]    For years, Louisiana State Police has displayed blatant disregard for  the accountability practices regarding excessive use of force. It is  clear that the department will not clean up its own act.   That is why I am calling on the Department of Justice to conduct a  full and expedited pattern-or-practices investigation on Louisiana  State Police. Only with an in-depth investigation can we ensure  transparency and accountability.   While the majority of officers work hard to protect and serve, we  need Federal action to root out misconduct and to get those who are  violators. Congress can and must help by passing the George Floyd  Justice in Policing Act.                            ____________________
