 Mr. President, we just heard from the senior Senator from  Illinois. I remember when he was a junior Congressman from Illinois,  elected in 1982, along with about 80 other Democrats and Republicans  from all over the country. One of them was me. One of them was me. And  he has been a colleague off and on. I left the House to become the  Governor of Delaware, and he came over to the U.S. Senate, and now, we  get to work together again.   He is a smart guy, a very bright guy, and a very caring person and  very good at not just working with Democrats but working across the  aisle. I admired that about him in the House, and I admire that about  him in the Senate.   He is passionate about a lot of things, but one of those is an  important one, immigration reform. And immigration reform may seem like  it is far afield from what we are talking about here today, but for the  8 years I was privileged to be the Governor of Delaware, it was a good  economy--Bill Clinton was the President--and it was a good economy for  the country. More jobs were created in Delaware in those 8 years than  in any 8 years in Delaware's history. As Governor, I didn't create one  of them, but we did see a lot of job creation and economic growth, and  I was the beneficiary of that, as were other people in my State and  around the country.   One of the reasons why I believe that comprehensive immigration  reform is something we should have done and ought to do is not just  because we are reminded on Sunday afternoon of Matthew 25--when I was a  stranger in your land, you welcomed me--but also, it makes good  business sense. One of the keys to economic growth, whether it is my  State or the State of New Mexico, where the Presiding Officer is from,  one of the keys is the workforce, having people who are either already  trained or trainable and able and willing to do the work that needs to  be done.   We have a little bit of a mismatch right now in our economy with  respect to the skills that a lot of folks who are without jobs would  like to be having; they would like to have a job or maybe a better job.  There is a mismatch in what employers are looking for and what a lot of  workers bring to the workplace. A big part of what we have done in  these legislative packages--I call them cares packages--in the last  year or 2 is to provide money for workforce development and  redevelopment to better equip people with the tools that they need.                                  H.R. 3684    Mr. President, the reason why I mention these things--comprehensive  immigration reform, workforce training, retraining--is those are  important ingredients to get our economy and to keep our economy  moving. Our economy is moving in the right direction now, but we have  to keep it going.   When I was privileged to be Governor of the First State, we built a  highway. I took the handoff from Republican Governor Mike Castle, and  we built a highway all the way from I-95, in the northern part of our  State, down past Dover, past the Dover Air Force Base, all the way to  our beaches. Dover has, I think, more five-star beaches than any State  in America, I am told, and it is a significant part of our economy, our  tourist economy. And, just as tourism is an important component, I  think, in the economies of most of ours, we found that, for folks to be  able to get to our beaches, they needed to have roads, highways, and  bridges.   We built State Route 1--a limited highway--from one end of the State  almost to the other. We took I-495, which basically circles the city of  Wilmington, and essentially shut it down and resurfaced it. We  resurfaced I-95 from Wilmington all the way up to the Pennsylvania  line.   We did a lot of things that were designed not just to help the people  of Delaware get where they needed to go, wanted to go, and move  products, but also to help interstate commerce, and that is a key  ingredient for those serious about growing the economy of our country.  We have got to invest in our roads, highways, bridges, and in our rail.   As it turns out, I came down here today on a train, as I do many  days. God willing, I will go home tonight on a train. It is an Amtrak  train.   Interestingly enough, if you were to take a ton of freight and move  it from, we will say, Washington, DC, to Boston, you can do it on about  a gallon of diesel fuel. Think about that--a ton of freight from  Washington, DC, to Boston, MA, on about a gallon of diesel fuel.  [[Page S6035]]    You can move a lot of people on Amtrak. In the Northeast corridor,  they travel on electricity. Out of the corridor, they use different  fuels to move their locomotives.   But one of the beauties about the legislation that we have been  debating here for the last week or two is that actually, in terms of  getting our economy moving, keeping our economy moving, we provide  significant investments in passenger rail service. We also provide  significant investments in roads, highways, and bridges. We provide  significant investments in rail to be used by freight, and we make  significant investments in our ports.   A lot of people are going to be involved, as the Presiding Officer  knows, in doing all the work involving the different kinds of  investments I just mentioned. Those are good jobs. Many of them are  union jobs. They all pay the prevailing wage and provide a lot of  income for communities and for the folks who do that work.   The other thing, at the end of the day, when work is more or less  completed--we have made a lot of progress on roads, highways, and  bridges, on broadband deployment, on our ports and our rail and our  airports--at the end of the day, we will have created a ton of jobs,  and we are going to leave in place an economy that is more efficient  and more productive at the same time and will enable us to grow our  economy.   One of the things that I most enjoyed in the last campaign was  hearing Joe Biden talk about climate change or global warming. He said  that when he heard the words ``climate change'' or ``global warming,''  the word that came to mind for him was ``jobs.'' ``Jobs.''   I like to say it is possible to do good and do well at the same time.  It is possible to build a more efficient, more productive economy and a  cleaner economy, but it puts people to work as we do that, and then  they will continue to work in the years to follow.   At the end of all those investments and all that work, we will end up  with far fewer emissions from our cars, trucks, and vans. God willing,  we will end up with a lot fewer emissions from our stationary emitters  of greenhouse gasses.   The second major source of emissions in our country is powerplants,  and the third greatest source of emissions in our country is from  manufacturing operations--cement plants for example. Those are the  three top ones. The legislation that is before us enables us to--we  will make greater progress with respect to those three sources of  carbon pollution than just about anything I can think of.   The President hosted a press conference the other day at the White  House. He invited several of our colleagues to join him and  participate. He also invited the auto industry, auto big three, to come  and the other auto companies as well. There were folks there from the  environmental community. It was a great celebration.   What the President did is he signed an Executive order that said  basically, why don't we--just like this legislation before us builds on  a foundation of legislation that was reported out of the Environment  and Public Works Committee on drinking water, wastewater sanitation  investments, and also legislation reported out of the Environment and  Public Works Committee that Senator Capito and I have the privilege of  leading that focuses on roads, highways, bridges, and the climate. But  the press conference was designed to really complement what we are  doing here today. The Presiding Officer was there, along with others,  as I recall.   But the President, in concert with the auto industry, has basically  come to an agreement that, just like our legislation on the floor today  and for the last week, was built on the work of several committees,  including the Commerce Committee, rail safety; including the Energy and  Natural Resources Committee, energy--nuclear energy. It is built on the  work of the Banking Committee with respect to investments in transit  and built on the work of our committee too.   The President's Executive order was based on an agreement between  really five auto companies from about a year ago in the State of  California, the California Resources Board, to gradually step up over a  period of years, from 2022 to 2026, the requirements for required  reductions by mobile sources, reductions in greenhouse gases, with the  idea that after 2026, we will expedite and increase the amount of  reduction that will be expected in greenhouse gases from our mobile  source.   In any event, it is going to be hard for the auto industry, which was  represented at that press conference. It is going to be hard for them  to meet the kind of goals that are laid out in the President's  Executive order unless we make investments not just in roads, highways,  and bridges but also in charging stations and fueling stations.   As the Presiding Officer knows, there are investments in our  committee's bill and in this bill that is before us today that make  significant investments in charging stations and fueling stations. When  we say ``fueling stations,'' I am not talking about necessarily  gasoline and diesel; I actually am thinking of hydrogen.   In the Finance Committee piece--it will probably be in the  reconciliation package that we take up--there is legislation that  provides tax incentives to really build a much more efficient and clean  economy in a variety of ways.   Our Presiding Officer has worked a lot on methane, to reduce methane  emissions, and to provide maybe an economic structure where leakage of  methane, which is a potent greenhouse gas--we want to reduce that--but  to develop an economic model that rewards companies, refineries, and  others to reduce their methane emissions and figure out how to reinvest  that money and ways to create clean energy.    But one of the most encouraging investments in clean energy is with  respect to hydrogen. I remember going to the Detroit auto--Delaware  used to build more cars, trucks, and vans per capita than any other  State. We are not a big State. We have about a million people. But we  had, as recently as, gosh, 10 years ago about 3,000 or 4,000 men and  women working at a Chrysler plant near Newark, where the University of  Delaware is located, and a GM plant near Wilmington, and it also had  about 3,000 employees. When we went into the great recession a decade  or so ago, both companies went into bankruptcy. We lost both of those  plants.   The question is, What do we do about it? How do we recapture those  jobs--really good jobs, union jobs, high-wage jobs, high-skill jobs?  How do we recapture those jobs? One of the ways that we can do it is  providing an infrastructure that supports energy-efficient vehicles,  electric vehicles, and hydrogen-powered vehicles.   I remember being at the Detroit auto show 10 years ago. It was the  first time I met Mary Barra, who was a rising star at General Motors,  later to become the first woman CEO, and Debbie Stabenow, Senator  Stabenow, was nice enough to introduce me to Mary Barra that day.   I also remember that that day, I think it was the Chevrolet Volt was  named the Car of the Year, and the Chevrolet Volt had its--you know, it  runs on battery, and at the time, it got about 38 miles on a charge,  and then when the electricity went away, it was all used up, the  battery could run on gasoline. It was a classic hybrid. But that was 38  miles to a charge. Ten years later, my family and I just bought an  electric-powered vehicle, and it gets 326 miles on a charge--326 miles  on a charge. You think about 38 miles on a charge a decade ago to 326  miles on a charge today, that is one heck of an improvement, an  increase. If we want to lead the--and that is where people are going to  go.   I drove to the train station this morning. It is just a fun car to  drive. It has great torque, and it is just a fun car, a great looking  car. When you drive it, you have the joy of knowing that you are not  polluting our planet. If we can provide the electricity in sustainable  ways, renewable ways--offshore wind, for example, solar--that is even  better. It is even better.   So we are at a point right now where I think about 3 percent of the  vehicles on the road in this country are powered by electricity or  hydrogen or some other sustainable source--3 percent. That is up from  about 1 percent just a couple years ago. That may seem small, but when  you look at the market capitalization of Tesla and compare it to, I  think, any of the big three, the market capitalization of Tesla is  enormous compared to the other companies from which I bought our  family's cars for decades, and they are getting into the race.  [[Page S6036]]    You know, renewable energy, electric vehicles, hydrogen-powered  vehicles have a little bit of catching up to do, but the market signal  here that we are getting from Tesla's market capitalization is the  market says EVs--hydrogen-powered fuel cells--that is where the market  is going. It sends a very strong signal for investment purposes, and  that is where we are going. We in this country can choose to follow the  parade, or we are going to lead the parade, and we can follow the  parade led by the Chinese and Japanese and others toward this new  future or not.   I want to go back to the Detroit auto show. I was there a couple of  years after the Chevrolet Volt was named the Car of the Year, and I was  walking around the place, a huge place, and I was walking around, and I  came across a--they call it a stand, and at the auto show--it is not  really a stand, but they have these platforms for vehicles, you know,  maybe 2 or 3 feet up. They have platforms that they have for different  models. Sometimes they are models that are just being launched;  sometimes they are models of the future, you know.   One day I was at the Detroit auto show, about 5 years ago. I think it  might have been Toyota--I went by their stand, and they had this-- really different--they had built around the vehicle on the stand, and  they had framing. It was like 2 by 4's of what I was told was a garage.  There was a car in the--you have to use your imagination, but there was  a car in the garage, and there was a house, part of a house, attached  to the garage.   I asked the person from I believe Toyota--I said: What is this?   They said: This is the future.   They had actually named their future of--division of the company--I  think it is called Mirai, something like that, which means ``future.''   The idea there is to use fuel cells and hydrogen. They told that  day--they said that combination can help propel that vehicle that is in  that make-believe garage. It can heat the house that is there alongside  of it using--image, heat that house in the winter and cool that house  in the summer.   I said: Really?   They said: Yes. That is the future.   They were going to call it, I think, Mirai. And that is becoming  real. That is becoming real.   One of the pieces of legislation that a bunch of us have worked on is  how do we provide hydrogen in a clean way so we don't contribute to  more greenhouse gases. There is a process--I studied economics, but I  know relatively little about chemistry, but there is a process called  electrolysis where you can use electricity and water and create oxygen  and hydrogen and do it in a clean, sustainable way.   So those are some of the things that are going on. The reason why I  mention them is because, in order for us to lead the parade on cars,  trucks, and vans, low-emission vehicles around the world; in order for  us to create the kinds of good-paying jobs that will flow from that  economic activity; in order to get reduction in not just carbon dioxide  and greenhouse gases but in other pollutants, the way to do that is to  invest, and it is not all on the Federal Government.   We provide R&D for technology through a variety of ways, but the idea  is for us to make those investments in ways that can be monetized, if  you will, by businesses, by industry to create good-paying jobs and do  good and do well at the same time, create economic value, create good- paying jobs, and help us meet our targets to reduce greenhouse gases in  this country by a great deal by the year 2050. That is the goal of the  current administration. It is the goal of a lot of us here in this body  and across the country.    I hadn't really thought about giving a talk, but it was just playing  off of what Senator Durbin was talking about, and I wanted to share  that with everybody today.   I love to quote Albert Einstein. A lot of people remember Albert  Einstein used to say: The definition of ``insanity'' is to do the same  thing over and over again and expect a different result. That is a  pretty good quote, but my favorite is, in adversity lies opportunity.  In adversity lies opportunity. I believe that with every fiber of my  being.   We face plenty of adversity politically here in this country today,  with direct threats against our country from terrorism and threats  against our planet from too much carbon in the air and greenhouse  gases. But it turns out, on almost every one of those fronts, there is  opportunity to make a better world and to make a better world by  providing a lot of jobs and a lot of economic opportunity.   With that being said, I don't see anyone waiting to speak, so I am  going to give my prepared remarks. I should be finished by about  sundown, or it may seem that way, but it won't be. But these are too  good not to enumerate.   It is good to see the Presiding Officer this morning--this afternoon.  I rise to talk about the downpayment that the bill before us makes in  terms of climate by making investments in clean vehicles and clean  vehicle infrastructure.   Long before I began representing Delaware in the U.S. House of  Representatives and later as Governor and as Senator, I was a naval  flight officer in the Vietnam var. I am the last Vietnam veteran  serving in the U.S. Senate today.   In the Navy, we had a lot of sayings, but the Navy has one saying  that I think is most fitting for our fight against climate change, and  it is this: ``All hands on deck.'' ``All hands on deck.'' This is an  all-hands-on-deck moment, and it requires us to move past divisive  rhetoric and to work together to find solutions.   Today, we are showing that we can work together and make real  progress here in our Nation's Capital, and that is what the people who  sent us here want us to do. Fortunately, we now have a President and  even a majority of Members of Congress who understand that we can no  longer wait for climate action. We need to take that action, take those  steps.   On President Biden's first day in office, he put the United States  back in the Paris climate agreement. Soon after, President Biden told  the world we would put this country on a path to reduce over half of  our climate emissions by the end of the current decade.   The President then laid out a roadmap through the American Jobs Plan  on how he would reduce emissions, replace our crumbling infrastructure,  and grow our economy all at the same time.   The bill before us today does not fully realize that transformative  vision, as some of us had hoped. In many areas, it falls short of the  investments we need to reach our climate goals. But this bill does make  significant and in some cases historic investments in sustainable  infrastructure and a cleaner economy.   As many of our colleagues know, some of the most important climate  investments we can make in the Federal Government are investments in  clean transportation. The transportation sector is the largest source,  as I said earlier, of greenhouse gas emissions in our economy. Roughly  28 percent comes from cars, trucks, and vans that we drive. So reducing  emissions from our mobile sources--our cars, trucks, and vans--is a  critical part of reaching our Nation's climate goals.   In the Environment and Public Works Committee, I am privileged to  lead with Senator Capito of West Virginia and our colleagues on both  sides of the aisle. We worked together earlier this year to pass the  surface transportation reauthorization that advances many of the  climate goals in President Biden's American Jobs Plan.   I might add that we have 20 members of our committee--10 Democrats,  10 Republicans--and we voted unanimously to report the bill out of  committee and to send it to the Senate floor, where it became part of  this legislation that is before us today.   Our bill includes a historic climate title with over $18 billion in  investments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and make our roads more  resilient to a changing climate.   Within the surface transportation climate title is significant  funding in support of a national network of clean vehicle recharging  and refueling infrastructure throughout our Nation's highways and our  State roads. This investment is about giving Americans a real choice  when it comes to figuring out what they want to drive and ensuring that  every driver in America in every region of our country can conveniently  access fueling and charging stations for electric or hydrogen-powered  vehicles.  [[Page S6037]]    Investments in clean vehicle infrastructure is more important today  than ever. Every CEO of our Nation's car manufacturers tells us the  same thing: The future of the auto industry is zero-emission vehicles.  Let me say that again. The future of the auto industry in this country  and around the world is zero-emission vehicles. The global market is  rushing to zero-emission vehicles, and our car companies need to invest  in electric vehicles or be left behind.   I mentioned Mary Barra earlier. I met her at the Detroit auto show a  number of years ago. I called her last year and urged her and General  Motors to join five car companies that had found common cause with the  California Air Resources Board and several dozen other States in  stepping down and reducing greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles in  manufacture. I urged her to bring GM into the fold and join with the  other five or so companies that had found common cause with California  and lots of States, including my State of Delaware.   She said to me: We are not prepared to do that just yet. She went on  to say that the future is electric. She said the future of her industry  is electric. I am all in on electric. She said: We need three things in  order to be able to be successful in doing that, in making that  transition. The first thing we need is a 300-mile range on recharging.   I just bought a vehicle a month or two ago that gets 326 miles on a  charge--326. That is up from 38 miles on a charge on a Car of the Year  10 years ago, a Chevrolet product, and it was a huge improvement.   Anyway, Mary Barra said: We need a 300-mile range. And they have it  in their cars now, several models. Ford has it. Chrysler is moving in  that direction and a bunch of foreign companies as well.   Anyway, she said: In addition to a 300-mile range, we need fueling  stations, charging stations. We need them, she said, not just in a  couple of places, but we need them all over the country   The third thing she said: We need technology where people can charge  and recharge their batteries and not in hours around the country but in  minutes.   My wife and our son and I drove over the Fourth of July weekend. We  drove from Wilmington, DE, to Wilmington, NC, in our new electric  vehicle. We had to recharge it a couple of times, but it has a 326-mile  range.   The other thing: Along I-95, we have a lot of charging stations. We  have a vehicle that actually tells us where the charging stations are,  so you don't have to worry about having range anxiety.   But we don't have enough charging stations, and the legislation that  is before us today will not create enough in and of itself. But the  investment tax credit that will be part of our Finance Committee  package later on will help encourage a whole lot of investment from the  private sector. So we are using a little bit of Federal money--actually  quite a bit of Federal money to incent investment by the private  sector.   I was talking to some folks from a company; I think it is a  Tennessee-based company. I don't want to mess up their name. But they  have truckstops throughout the country where larger trucks can fill up  on diesel fuel. They sell gasoline, and they have food and that kind of  thing. They are interested in investing in charging stations and  fueling stations, hydrogen fueling stations, and what they need is an  incentive to do that. The legislation that is before the Finance  Committee provides that kind of incentive, and I think it will make a  difference.   So the need for charging stations and fueling stations is not going  to be just on the Federal Government's dime. It is not going to be just  the State and local governments. It is not going to just be the Wawas  of the world or the convenience stores of the world. It is not going to  just be the auto industry. It is really all of us, with a major role  that the Federal Government could play to encourage those investments.   Speaking of General Motors, General Motors has announced its  intention to produce only electric vehicles by 2035--only electric  vehicles by 2035. Ford has announced that all the vehicles it sells in  Europe will be electric by 2030. Jaguar will go electric in 2025. Volvo  has announced that it will sell only electric cars by 2030. Volkswagen  has announced its plan to increase its sales of electric vehicles by  2030 such that 70 percent of the vehicles it sells in Europe and 50  percent of the vehicles it sells in the United States and China will be  electric. Mini, like Mini Cooper, has also announced its transition to  electric vehicles. Mercedes just announced its new cars would all be  electric by 2030 in markets that are ready for electrification. And the  list goes on.   The leading trade association for the auto sector states that it is  committed to ``net zero carbon transportation'' and believes that the  nation that leads development and adoption of electrification and other  innovative technologies will ``shape supply chains, define global  standards, and potentially reshape the international marketplace.''   A recent letter from the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, United  Auto Workers, and the Motor and Equipment Manufacturers Association  states that both business and labor are ``committed to working toward a  netzero carbon transportation future that includes a shift to electric- drive vehicles.'' To accomplish this, they believe that the United  States must have a ``comprehensive national vision and strategy''--a  ``comprehensive national vision and strategy.''   Expanding and improving access to clean vehicle infrastructure will  facilitate increased consumer demand for more clean vehicles, spurring  cleaner air and a healthier climate and growing economy.   You know, the thing that we love most of all about our electric  vehicle is it is just fun to drive. It is, as we say in Delaware, a  hoot, and great torque, great acceleration, and a lot of fun to be out  on the road. That more than anything else will help sell it and provide  the infrastructure that they need.   With all the good work we did in our EPW Committee on the surface  transportation bill, it should be no surprise that the EPW bill is part  of the foundation of the $1.2 trillion bipartisan deal that is before  us today. The bipartisan compromise before us expands investments for  charging and refueling infrastructure to a total of I think about $7.5  billion. The bill also includes funding for electric schoolbuses and  electric transit buses.   Specifically, our bill authorizes a grant program for alternative  fuel corridors that will provide much needed funding to strategically  deploy publicly accessible electric vehicle charging infrastructure  along designated alternative fuel corridors that will be accessible to  all drivers.   We also create a community grant program to provide funding to expand  access to electric vehicle charging infrastructure, especially in rural  and disadvantaged communities.   This bill will also provide an additional $5 billion distributed by  formula to the States to build out EV charging so that drivers and car  buyers can be confident of having access to a nationwide network of  charging infrastructure.   As I said before, this is just a downpayment on what we can and must  do in terms of climate action. However, as everyone who has bought a  house knows, sometimes downpayments are hard to do and the most  important step toward success.   Let me close with this. My colleagues know that I try to focus on the  areas where we can find consensus.   We just had a funeral out in Wyoming a couple of days ago to say  goodbye to our beloved colleague, Senator Mike Enzi, who is sort of--I  call him--the author of the 80-20 rule that says: We agree--this is in  his words. He used to work with Ted Kennedy on the Health, Education,  Labor, and Pensions Committee. It is an amazingly productive committee  and an important committee. Ted Kennedy was the senior Democrat, and  Mike Enzi was the senior Republican.   And I always asked Mike Enzi on this floor--I said: How can the two  leaders in this committee, one a Democrat and one a real conservative  Republican--how can you get so much done?   And he said: We believe in the 80-20 rule. We focus on the 80 percent  that we agree on most of the time; and the other 20 percent, we set it  aside to work on it some other time.   If Mike Enzi is looking down today, I know that he will be saying  ``amen.'' And we should follow his lead there, and this is one good  place to do that.  [[Page S6038]]    I always want to get things done by working with my colleagues across  the aisle because I think bipartisan solutions are lasting solutions. I  like to find those where we can. I am committed to working with my  Republican friends in the Senate on getting all these actions across  the finish line.   We will continue to work toward these urgent needs in the budget  reconciliation process. Again, it is an all-hands-on-deck moment,  requiring meaningful investments in climate actions in a lot of  different ways. The last thing we cannot afford is inaction. The last  thing we cannot afford to do is to wait until later.   We got to put in place commonsense policies, some of which we talked  about today, and a lot of which is included in the legislation before  us. These are policies that can spur economic investments in our  Nation's aging infrastructure, reduce our transportation pollution, and  support the millions of Americans who are considering buying a clean  car today or sometime soon.   My hope is that we can work together to support our Nation's clean  energy infrastructure and move our economy to a brighter future.   And before I yield the floor, I will just say to the Presiding  Officer my appreciation to her and the work that she and the committee  that she serves on and helps to lead, the Energy and Natural Resources  Committee.   I mentioned that a major source--a large source of carbon emissions  comes from our mobile sources, but No. 2 is power plants, and the  Presiding Officer is doing good work that helps to address emissions  there. The rest of us look forward to being able to partner with her on  that in the days ahead, so I thank the Presiding Officer for her good  leadership.   Before the gentleman from Ohio speaks, I just want to acknowledge my  friend and the friend of the Democrats. I shouldn't say complimentary  things like that to our Republican colleagues, I suppose, but I just  want to applaud him for the leadership that he and Senator Sinema and  20 other colleagues have fought for us in trying to get us to a good  place and bringing the legislation here before us. We are grateful for  his leadership. He has about another year, year and a half to serve in  the Senate, and I and the rest of us want to make sure that that is a  very productive period of time. We are hopeful we can get this done,  and we will not just celebrate together, but we will do good work. We  will have done really good work together.   I yield the floor.
