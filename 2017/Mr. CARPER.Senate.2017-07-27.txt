 Mr. President, I spent many years of my life in Navy  airplanes. I am a retired Navy captain. Senator Alexander said  something the other day about the fact that a pilot doesn't start up  and take off in an airplane unless he or she knows what the destination  is. I thought that was pretty interesting. It is true.   With respect to healthcare in this country, we have actually known  for a long time what the destination is, and the destination is a  combination of three things: better healthcare coverage for less  money--and cover everyone. That is really our destination. It is not  just the destination this year in this Congress; it has been our  destination really since Harry Truman was President.   For some years, we have argued and disagreed about how to get to the  destination. I don't think anyone would argue about the need to get to  that destination, but the question is how.   In 1993--I mentioned yesterday in my remarks on the floor--Hillary  Clinton was a brandnew First Lady and worked on something called  HillaryCare. In response, Republicans came up with something that  really has its roots and origin from the Heritage Foundation. They had  more of a market-based approach, which called for every State having  their own exchange, where people without coverage could get healthcare  coverage. There would be a sliding scale tax credit that would help buy  down the cost of premiums for folks who got the coverage in their  State's exchange. Low-income people got a bigger tax credit. Higher  income people had a smaller tax credit that would eventually fade away.   The third piece of the Republican alternative to HillaryCare was the  idea of an individual mandate, which basically said that everybody has  to get coverage. If you don't, we can't make you, but you have to pay a  fine. Over time the fine would go up.   The fourth piece of the Republican proposal in 1993 was that  employers of a certain size with a certain number of employees would  have to make sure they provided coverage for their employees. I don't  remember a lot of specificity of what that coverage would include, but  if they had quite a few employees, they would have to provide coverage  for them, make it available.   The last piece was the idea that health insurance companies would say  at that time: If you have a preexisting condition, sorry, we are just  not going to cover you. The Republican proposal said: That is verboten.  You can't do that, insurance companies.   So that was their idea that was introduced here. There were, I think,  about 23 cosponsors, led by John Chafee, who was a former marine,  former Governor of Rhode Island, U.S. Senator, and highly regarded. The  legislation he introduced in 1993 had 20, 22 cosponsors, I think,  including some people who are still here--Senator Hatch, Senator  Grassley, and a number of others. That idea became RomneyCare.   In 2006, Governor Romney sought to cover everybody in the State of  Massachusetts before running for President. It was a pretty good idea.  It was such a good idea that when we worked on the Affordable Care Act,  that idea was one of the major principles, one of the major pillars of  the Affordable Care Act.   Now--I said this yesterday--Barack Obama gets credit for coming up  with that approach to provide healthcare. He is a smart guy, but that  wasn't his deal. He didn't come up with that. I didn't come up with  that. Governor Romney didn't come up with that. I don't think Senator  John Chafee, beloved Senator from Rhode Island--neither he nor Senator  Hatch nor Senator Grassley came up with that. I think it was an idea  from the Heritage Foundation. It is probably heresy, as a Democrat, to  say this, but it was a good idea. It was a good idea in 1993. It was a  good idea in 2006 in Massachusetts, and it was a good idea when we  folded it into the Affordable Care Act as one of the major pillars.   I want to go back and revisit 2009 just for a little bit. There are  those who believe that there was no bipartisan involvement and the ACA  was just hustled through without a lot of thought or debate. As it  turns out, I think we spent 80 days all total in the U.S. Senate in  that Congress in 2009, debating the bill in committees--the two  committees of jurisdiction. I served then and I serve now on the  Finance Committee. We spent a heck of a lot of time in debates and  markups where people had a chance to offer amendments, debate them. The  Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee spent a lot of time  that year, 2009, similarly in bipartisan hearings, with bipartisan  amendments, debate.   All totaled, I believe, over 300 amendments were offered in Senate  committees of jurisdiction, and I am told that 160 amendments offered  by Republican Senators were adopted and made part of the legislation.   I know our Republican colleagues believe that they were shut out of  the process, but I think a closer review of that process in history  would suggest that just wasn't so. Was it a perfect process? No. Could  it have been better? Sure. You can always do things better. But it was  a process that we went through in order to address this concern.   In 2008, during that year's election, one of the things I learned was  that we were spending in this country, as a percentage of GDP for  healthcare, 18 percent of GDP. I have a friend who, when I ask him how  he is doing, says: Compared to what?   I would just say: Well, what were the Japanese spending in 2008 as a  percentage of GDP for healthcare? It was 8 percent. Think about that.  Well, maybe we got better results; maybe people live longer in this  country or we have lower rates of infant mortality than the Japanese.  No, it is not true. They got better results. They spent half as much,  and they got better results.   Well, maybe a lot of people in that country didn't have coverage and  we covered everyone. Actually, just the opposite is true. They covered  everyone. We had 40 million people who went to bed in 2008 without any  healthcare coverage, and for a lot of them, access to healthcare  coverage was the emergency room of a hospital.   As you all know, as we know, when people get sick enough, they will  get care in this country. It may not be cost-effective care. It may be  expensive care because it is not just an emergency room visit. In many  instances, it is the admission to the hospital and a stay that could  last for days or even weeks. We do have some idea how much it costs to  stay in the hospital. It is hugely expensive. Eventually, people would  get healthcare coverage or healthcare attention, but a lot of times it  costs an arm and a leg, literally and figuratively. So the question  was, could we do better than that?   What we came up with is a multifaceted approach, which includes that  Heritage Foundation idea of the exchanges where people didn't have  access to coverage. And the focus would be not just on spending money  on people when they were sick, but to save us--not to have so much a  sick care system, but to have a healthcare delivery system that focuses  more on helping people to stay healthy and well, with a much bigger  focus on prevention and wellness and frankly a focus on, for example,  making sure people, when they reach the age of 50, get a colonoscopy  and they don't have to pay a whole lot of money to get it because it  would be part of their health insurance coverage.   I have a friend whose mom died several years ago. My friend and I  work out at the YMCA in Wilmington from time to time. She just turned  50, and I said: Well, how old are your parents? My friend is really  fit, and I said: How old are your parents now?   She said: They are both deceased.   I said: Really? What happened?   She said: My mom died of colon cancer a number of years ago.   I said: Didn't she get the colon screening--the colorectal screening  and all?  [[Page S4351]]    She said: No, no, no. She didn't like that, didn't want to do that.  It costs a lot of money, and so she just didn't do it.   We have other people who, over the years, have not had prostate  screenings for prostate cancer, and we have had people who didn't have  breast cancer screenings because, in some cases, it is unpleasant and,  in some cases, just because it can cost a lot of money, and a lot of  that was out of pocket, so people would forego that. We have changed  that. We want people to get the screenings and to be able to get those  screenings and find out and make sure that they are not going to get  sick and cost a lot of money.   My friend's mother was sick for many months. I can't imagine how much  it cost--and all that for maybe a $1,000 colorectal screening that was  not taken.   We don't do that stuff in this country much anymore. We actually  offer the screenings. They are free. With our focus on wellness and  prevention and things like annual physicals, we want to catch problems  when they are small.   One of the reasons healthcare coverage in Japan--as a Naval flight  officer, I flew a lot of missions in and out of Japan during the  Vietnam war, and one of the things I learned about Japan is that, one,  the people are very slender. In this country, about one-third of our  people now are obese or on their way to being obese. Obesity is a great  precursor, which says that this person is going to have healthcare  problems and costly healthcare problems. There are a lot of people in  this country who still smoke--not as many as before--but that is  another predictor of people on whom we are going to have to spend a  whole lot of money.   The other thing that caught my eye in Japan was the access to primary  healthcare close to where people live. In almost every neighborhood of  any consequence, people had access to a clinic where they could go for  a checkup, for a physical to catch problems when they are small and to  address them when they are small. As we looked around the world at  things that were working, that would seem to be something that worked,  we tried to make sure that was part of our approach in the Affordable  Care Act.   Another thing we found that worked is, in some countries and  literally here in this country--the Mayo Clinic, the Cleveland Clinic,  and places like that--one of the secrets of their success, better  results for less money, is the idea of coordinating the delivery of  healthcare--coordinating the delivery of healthcare.   My mom, now deceased, lived until she was 82. She had dementia. She  had arthritis. She had congestive heart failure. She had any number of  ailments. My dad had passed away several years earlier. She lived near  Clearwater, FL. We had people--my sister had people living with her to  take care of her until later in her life. At one time, my mom was  seeing five or six doctors. They were prescribing a total of 15  medicines for her. I remember we had in her home something that looked  like a fishing tackle box--my dad's fishing tackle box. You may have  seen one of these. If you open it up, it has all these medicines in it  to take before breakfast, with breakfast, after breakfast, before  lunch, all the way to bedtime, and they are all set up and  arranged. Fifteen different medicines she was taking from five or six  doctors who never talked to each other. Nobody had any idea what was  being prescribed for my mom. Nobody was coordinating that care. That is  foolish. I know a lot of those medicines probably interacted badly with  each other and hastened my mom's decline and death.    The focus we had on the Affordable Care Act, with coordinated  delivery of healthcare among different doctors and different  specialties and with hospitals, nursing homes, federally qualified  community health centers, and the VA, we do a much better job at  coordinating delivery of healthcare.   In Delaware, we just don't have electronic health records for  healthcare--we have those all over the country now. One thing that came  out of the Affordable Care Act was we put the pedal to the metal and  said we want a whole lot more electronic health records being used that  talk to each other for coordinated delivery of healthcare--better care.  Delaware took it a step further. In Delaware, we have something called  the Delaware Information Network, which I signed into law, authorizing  it in my last term as Governor. I had no idea really what the potential  was of what we were doing, but with some help from the Federal  Government, we have now just a terrific utility, a terrific mechanism  to help us take this idea of coordinating delivery of healthcare and  put it on steroids and further improve the quality of healthcare.   I have been approaching this day with real concern. I am an  optimistic guy. I am a glass half-full guy, but I have been troubled a  lot more than not. I went home last night and my wife met me at the  door and she said: You don't seem yourself. I said: I am troubled, and  she said she was too. She had been watching too much TV. There are a  lot of concerning things going on in this city, at the White House, and  even in this building.   We are at our best when we work together. We Democrats didn't create  Social Security by ourselves. The GI bill--I was a beneficiary of the  GI bill at the end of the Vietnam war, and so was my father at the end  of World War II. There have been good ideas like Medicare. Democrats  didn't create them by themselves, Republicans didn't create them by  themselves. We worked together to create those landmark pieces of  legislation and programs that all of us would agree are good for this  Nation and good for our people.   When you are dealing with a subject that involves maybe everybody in  the country and perhaps one-sixth of our population, this is one we  ought to do together. We ought to do this together.   John McCain and I served during the Vietnam war. We came to the House  of Representatives together, and we worked on normalizing relations  with Vietnam. He was a Senator with John Kerry, and I was a House  Member with a bunch of my colleagues over there.   John McCain stood right over here a couple days ago. We were all  happy to see him back. We welcomed him back because we need him and his  leadership. He said a number of times during his remarks that what we  need is regular order.   I guess people who might have been watching on C-SPAN are wondering  what is regular order.   We have a new crop of pages here. Let me just say to our pages who  are rising juniors and coming from States all over America and actually  do a great job of helping make sure this place doesn't get too messed  up in more ways than one, regular order is when people have a good  idea, whether it is in healthcare, defense, or agriculture, and  actually take their good idea and introduce legislation. I try to  introduce legislation most times with bipartisan support. I have  learned you get better results in the end if you do that.   The idea of regular order is introducing legislation that reflects  and addresses a need or an issue. That bill is introduced here in this  Chamber. It is assigned by the Parliamentarian to the committee of  jurisdiction. The sponsor or sponsors of the bill go see the chair of  the committee where the bill is assigned and ask for a hearing. If they  convince the chair of the committee it is a good bill, with a good  idea, then there is a good chance they will have a hearing. At that  hearing will be witnesses--expert witnesses, stakeholders. Those  witnesses will say: I like this about that bill or I see a problem with  that bill, and there are changes that should be made to the bill. In  some cases, we invite the Congressional Budget Office, sometimes  Senators or House Members to come in and testify as well.   On an issue that is this important, we need regular order because  whatever the Republican ideas are--and hopefully we will find out what  their ideas are today--we need to check the tires, take the time to  find out what is good about it and what is not and fix it in committee,  where Democrats and Republicans can offer amendments, debate them. That  would be done in the Finance Committee and also in the Health,  Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee.   That is what we ought to do. If we take that approach, we will end up  with a better final result; rather than being a country that looks at  other countries around the world, asking: Why does Japan get better  results than  [[Page S4352]]  we do, spending half as much money and they can cover everybody--why is  that?   I am proud of much of what we do in this country with respect to  healthcare; in many ways, we are on the right track, but as I said, in  everything I do, I know I can do better. We can sure do a better job on  healthcare.   Last thought. I see we have been joined by the Democratic leader, and  I will say a few words before yielding the floor. I was fortunate  enough to visit Tanzania with my wife. We met our sons over there two  summers ago. After going to a seminar, we went out across the country,  had a chance to just see an amazing--for those who have never been  there, and I never spent much time in Africa, it was an incredible  experience, all the life and animals and nature and it was beautiful  and incredibly exciting. One of the many things I learned there was  this proverb, and it goes something like this:    African proverb: If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go  far, go together.   If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.   We need to hit the pause button. We need to fix the exchanges in  every State to stabilize the exchanges. There are three easy ways to do  it: make clear that the individual mandate is going to be maintained or  replaced by something that is at least as effective; a doctor  reinsurance program that will help stabilize the program, much as  reinsurance was used as a mechanism to stabilize and make successful  the Medicare Part D Program; and, finally, we should make clear that  the cost-sharing arrangements we have, the subsidies that help reduce  the costs, the copays and deductibles for people getting their coverage  in the exchanges, just make it clear they are not going to go away. The  insurance companies tell us, if we would do those three things--secure  the individual mandate or something as good as the individual mandate,  reinsurance, and address the cost-sharing arrangements, that they are  not going away--if we do those three things, they tell us the cost of  premiums across the country would drop by as much as 25 percent to 35  percent.   Think about that. What you would have is the insurance companies not  fearing they are going to lose their shirts because of not having a  pool of people they can insure. They are fearful of having a pool of  people to insure in the exchanges that are sick, crippled, and there  are not a lot of young, healthy people who create a mix that can  actually, effectively and predictably, be insured by insurance  companies. The great thing about reducing premiums by 25 to 35 percent  in the exchanges is this. People who get the coverage in the exchanges  benefit. They save money.   Do you know who else saves money? Uncle Sam, because we are paying a  significant amount of support to help make sure the exchanges  envisioned all those years ago by the Heritage Foundation--to make sure  they work.   That sounds like a pretty good step: hit the pause button; stabilize  the exchanges; make sure we have coverage for people in every State  through the exchanges in every county and bring down the premiums by 25  percent to 35 percent; provide certainty and predictability for the  insurance companies. With that predictability and certainty, we have  more competition. The insurance companies get into the game, and they  say we are going to offer policies as well.   After we have done that, let's pivot and address, as Democrats and  Republicans working together, fixing those parts of the Affordable Care  Act that need to be fixed and preserve the parts that need to be  preserved. Let's do that together.   With that, I yield the floor.                      Recognition of the Minority Leader    The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader is recognized.                  Thanking the Senior Senator from Delaware     Mr. President, I intend to offer a motion to commit the  reconciliation bill to the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, HELP,  Committee with instructions to ensure the bill does not harm or reduce  the size of the individual health insurance market risk pool in any  State.   I am offering this motion to ensure that the healthcare bill does no  harm to the States' individual and small business health insurance  markets by fracturing or reducing insurance market risk pools in ways  that would drive up health insurance premiums and deductibles for older  Americans or Americans with preexisting conditions.   The following Senators support my motion to commit: Senators Coons  and Shaheen.   I ask unanimous consent that the full text of my motion to commit be  printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                     Motion to Commit With Instructions         Mr. Carper moves to commit the bill H.R. 1628 to the       Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions with       instructions to report the same back to the Senate in 3 days,       not counting any day on which the Senate is not in session,       with changes that--        (1) are within the jurisdiction of such committee; and        (2) ensure that the bill does not weaken or reduce the size       of the individual market risk pool in any State.     Mr. President, I intend to offer a motion to commit the  reconciliation bill to the Finance Committee with instructions to  ensure the bill includes reforms to our healthcare system that lower  healthcare costs and improve health outcomes.  [[Page S4377]]    I am offering this motion because the healthcare bills before us make  devastating changes to our country's healthcare system that endanger  Americans' access to healthcare and raise healthcare costs for all  Americans, but contains no commonsense reforms to our healthcare system  that drive down underlying healthcare costs and improves health  outcomes. Millions of Americans wrestle with unaffordable healthcare  costs and our fee-for-service healthcare system remains inefficient and  wasteful. Instead of passing the buck to States and reducing access to  healthcare for low- and middle-income Americans, we should be focusing  on reforms that can improve the healthcare system and lower healthcare  costs for all Americans.   The following Senators support my motion to commit: Senators Coons  and Shaheen. I ask unanimous consent that the full text of my motion to  commit be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                     Motion to Commit With Instructions         Mr. Carper moves to commit the bill H.R. 1628 to the       Committee on Finance with instructions to report the same       back to the Senate in 3 days, not counting any day on which       the Senate is not in session, with changes that--        (1) are within the jurisdiction of such committee; and        (2) ensure that the bill improves health outcomes and       lowers health care costs.
