 Mr. Speaker, this chart by the Republican Study  Committee shows the difference not just a year makes but what an  attitude to governing makes toward making a living and managing  families' needs, even enjoying what you have earned and how you see fit  to spend it.   Energy independence: Stopping production and oil and gas  infrastructure in the U.S. gives higher prices, which are eclipsing $4  now even in my home State of California.   Lumber: Though our California and Western forests burn millions of  acres each year, somehow we have a lack of harvest and lumber  shortages, thanks to strange environmental thinking prohibiting the  forest harvest and management we need to prevent fires and keep the  lumberyards full. I know it is not the logger or the log truck driver  making the killing here in the quadruple pricing per board-foot.   Home costs: They ride right up there with lumber as well, and all the  other inputs, up 20 percent.   Coffee: Up 50 percent. Coffee has to come from somewhere.  [[Page H2635]]    Wheat: Up big. Bread and cereal won't be any cheaper. Will the farmer  see this windfall? Not likely.   Corn: The same thing. Will the farmer do any better with the much  higher cost of corn? No.   Copper: Used in so many of our mechanical and electrical devices, it  is going up, making it harder to wire our homes.   The bottom line is: Everything you need is much more expensive,  thanks to Biden policy.                            ____________________
