 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman very much and  his good friend as well for yielding, and I appreciate their intent,  but let me be very clear: What we have here is a complete collapse of a  system that is attempting to save lives.   Our administrative process, our administrative APA, these individuals  are grounded with the expertise of the particular agencies that they  are in.   Under this legislation, what we would have is a complete politicizing  of the Presidentially appointed and Senate-confirmed appointees because  that would be another monkey wrench, if you will, into why they should  not be confirmed.   In addition, this will encourage gamesmanship. If you think the  confirmation process is slow, wait till this bill becomes law.   Congress already has, and the Republicans have used it quite often,  the Congressional Review Act so that we can determine whether or not  rulemaking or a particular issue is one that is not only reviewed but  should be changed.   In the rulemaking process with experts that we oversee, because we  have congressional hearings, we are dealing with clean air, clean  water, safe toys, safe cars, and safe workplaces, but, more  importantly, as I was sitting in a meeting today, we are dealing with a  new initiative dealing with taking lead out of water.   Do we want to stop the process of removing lead from the water that  our children drink because we implement this particular procedure that  will stop our Presidentially-appointed officials from doing their job,  from helping us to ensure that our children are safe?   This is a slowdown. This is where lives are not saved. I would argue  to my friends that this legislation, unfortunately, should not move  forward because there is too much good work going on and the work that  is going on will be thwarted, will be stopped.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the AFSCME,  American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees, who  oppose this particular legislation, along with the administration  policy statement as well as a number of other agencies.                                                          AFSCME,                                                  December 11, 2023.      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Reprssentative: On behalf of the 1.4 million members       of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal       Employees (AFSCME), I write to express our strong opposition       to the Ensuring Accountability in Agency Rulemaking Act (H.R.       357), because it would deliberately create unnecessary and       confusing bureaucratic hurdles for agency officials as they       work to promulgate essential rules for public health,       environment and worker protections.        H.R. 357 would create uncertainty within agencies and would       stifle effective government functioning. While H.R. 357       purports to improve agency accountability, the proposal       actively undermines the constitutional authority of agencies       to delegate the routine task of signing a rulemaking to       subordinates as an efficiency measure. Senior agency       appointees already ratify the signing of the rulemaking after       the fact to comply with this clause.        In addition to attempting to solve a non-issue, H.R. 357       generates more confusion in the rulemaking process as the       bill's requirements do not directly define what action       qualifies as ``initiating'' a rule. As agencies are impacted       by this uncertainty, significant steps in the rulemaking       process could be delayed without clarity, and as a result,       even regulations that streamline compliance for regulated       entities could be stifled.        Congress should seek ways to support and fully staff       agencies that are responsible for designing rules that       protect our workers, public health and environmental safety.       We oppose H.R. 357 and urge you to vote against this bill.            Sincerely,                                                    Edwin S. Jayne,      Director of Federal Government Affairs.                                   ____                      Statement of Administration Policy   H.R. 357--Ensuring Accountability in Agency Rulemaking Act--Rep. Cline,                           R-VA and 19 cosponsors         The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 357, a bill that       would require that notice-and-comment rulemaking be initiated       by a ``senior appointee'' and be issued and signed by a       Senate-confirmed Presidential appointee. This bill would       result in unnecessary delays in the regulatory process when       Senate-confirmed positions are temporarily filled by senior       officials while nominees await confirmation. It would add       unnecessary bureaucratic hurdles that would encumber the       rulemaking process without providing any additional benefits,       as there are procedures already in place that provide for       engagement, oversight, and accountability by Executive Branch       agency leadership, such as review of significant rules by the       interagency under Executive Order 12866. H.R. 357 would also       limit the flexibility of Senate-confirmed officials to       delegate signature authority to experienced subordinates who       have the requisite authority and experience to oversee       regulatory development.        If the President were presented with H.R. 357, he would       veto it.                                   ____                                                  December 11, 2023.        Dear Representative, The undersigned organizations and       individuals write in opposition to the misleadingly-named       ``Ensuring Accountability in Agency Rulemaking Act'', H.R.       357. This bill would codify Executive Order 13979, entitled       ``Ensuring Democratic Accountability in Agency Rulemaking,''       issued by former President Donald Trump at the end of his       term and repealed by President Joe Biden. This legislation       would decrease the accountability of industry to the public.       It would do so by adding intentional ambiguity that would       lead to considerable delay in the creation, promulgation, and       implementation of critical new public health and safety       safeguards, financial reforms, and worker protections.        For example, H.R. 357 provides that ``any rule promulgated       under section 553 of Title 5, United States Code, shall be       issued and signed by an individual appointed by the       President, by and with the advice and consent of the       Senate.'' As you are aware, under the Constitution's       appointments clause, agency rulemakings are authorized by       ``principal'' officers who are Senate confirmed, and in       practice, this often occurs through necessary delegation. No       agency, however, would ever issue a rule without       authorization from a relevant agency leader. Rather than       ensuring public protections and industry accountability in       and through agency rulemaking, it would create confusion,       ambiguity, and uncertainty and pointless delays.        As government openness and accountability advocates, we       strongly urge you to oppose the Ensuring Accountability in       Agency Rulemaking Act.            Sincerely,      Government Information Watch,      National Center for Health Research,      Project On Government Oversight,      Earthjustice,      Government Accountability Project,      National Federation of Federal Employees (NFFE),      Steve Lenkart, CEO, Government Executives International,      Liz Borkowski, MPH.                                   ____                                              Coalition for Sensible                                                      Safeguards,                                                       May 23, 2023.        Dear Representative: The Coalition for Sensible Safeguards       (CSS), an alliance of over 150 labor, scientific, research,       good government, faith, community, health, environmental, and       public interest groups, and the undersigned allied       organizations strongly oppose the Ensuring Accountability in       Agency Rulemaking Act, H.R. 357.        The Ensuring Accountability in Agency Rulemaking Act would       codify Executive Order 13979, entitled ``Ensuring Democratic  [[Page H6839]]       Accountability in Agency Rulemaking,'' which was issued by       former President Donald Trump in his very last days in office       and was repealed by President Joe Biden. It will add       unnecessary ambiguity and considerable delay in the creation,       promulgation, and implementation of critical new public       health and safety safeguards, financial reforms, and worker       protections--making industry even less accountable to the       public. These consequences are particularly objectionable       because the bill purports to ``solve'' a problem that does       not actually exist. Rather than advance good government       reform, this bill demonizes our public protection agencies       and promotes a harmful anti-regulatory narrative.        The Ensuring Accountability in Agency Rulemaking Act       provides that ``any rule promulgated under section 553 of       Title 5, United States Code, shall be issued and signed by an       individual appointed by the President, by and with the advice       and consent of the Senate.'' Yet, under the Constitution's       appointments clause, agency rulemakings are authorized by       ``principal'' officers who are Senate confirmed, and in       practice, this often occurs through necessary delegation.       Currently, senior agency appointees sometimes delegate the       routine task of signing a rulemaking to subordinates as an       efficiency measure. Senior agency appointees ratify the       signing of the rulemaking after the fact to comply with this       clause.        Given the expense and legal consequences involved, no       agency would ever issue a rule without authorization from a       relevant agency leader. At best, this bill would serve to       create needless bureaucratic hurdles for agency officials,       rather than correct any real problem of public       accountability.        The bill further requires that all rules ``shall be       initiated by a senior appointee'' but does not define what       ``initiated'' means. Since the Administrative Procedure Act       does not define this term, this will create uncertainty that       could thwart rulemaking.        For example, what action qualifies as ``initiating'' a rule       under this bill? Is it when a rule is proposed? Is it when it       is assigned a Regulatory Identification Number (RIN)? Would       the granting of a citizen petition for rulemaking satisfy       this requirement? The bill is silent on this important       detail. Yet, these are significant steps in the rulemaking       process, and none of these wou]d take place without approval       of the Senate-confirmed official.        In the worst case, the uncertainty due to this provision       could stifle the effective functioning of agencies. Drawing       on their unique experience and expertise, rank-and-file staff       at agencies often provide the inspiration for an idea that       eventually becomes a rule. Indeed, senior agency officials       rely on career staff for these innovations. This bill risks       creating a disincentive for career staff at agencies to       propose innovative solutions to the problems the agency was       created to address. Significantly, many of these solutions       could even be the kind that achieve regulatory objectives at       lower compliance costs for regulated businesses.        Congress should be searching for ways to ensure that       federal agencies are able to enforce laws designed to protect       our safety, air quality, water, food, financial security, and       much more, not putting up roadblocks to sensible safeguards       that protect the American people.        For these reasons, we strongly urge you to oppose the       Ensuring Accountability in Agency Rulemaking Act.            Sincerely,                                                  Rachel Weintraub,                                                Executive Director.    Madam Speaker, this legislation is opposed by the  Coalition for Sensible Safeguards. I would like to dwell on this  question of water and lead coming out of water since many of us were  here during the Flint incidents, and we also know what goes on in our  own congressional districts.   Let's not stop children from living. Let's not stop the lifesaving  regulatory process. Let's oppose H.R. 357.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 357, The Ensuring  Accountability in Agency Rulemaking Act.   H.R. 357 would require any agency rule promulgated under the  Administrative Procedure Act's notice and comment process to be  ``initiated'' and signed by someone who was appointed to their position  by the President and confirmed by the Senate, with limited exceptions  for national security and public safety.   Simply put, this anti-regulatory bill is an attempt to codify bad  federal policy issued during the Trump Administration that was later  repealed by President Biden, and it would add unnecessary ambiguity and  delay in the rule making process from beginning to end.   While my Republican colleagues will tell you that this is just about  transparency and accountability, it is not.   This is about shutting down the regulatory process.   By requiring that any rulemaking be initiated and signed by a  presidentially appointed and Senate confirmed official, this bill could  grind the regulatory process to a halt during long appointment periods  or presidential transitions.   Rulemaking could be delayed (or even prevented altogether) by the  already substantially politicized Senate confirmation process,  especially during the transition between Administrations and for  agencies that experience frequent turnover or have longstanding  vacancies among their senior leadership.   If you think the confirmation process is slow and contentious now,  wait until this bill becomes law.   The party opposing the President will have every incentive to block a  nomination and prevent an agency from having an eligible head in place  who can issue regulations.   Like the Separation of Powers Restoration Act (SOPRA) and the  Regulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny (REINS) Act--that  nearly all House Democrats opposed earlier this Congress--this is a  patently transparent effort to effectively halt Executive agencies from  performing their Congressionally mandated duties to serve the American  people.   This proposal is a dangerous solution in search of a problem.   While H.R. 357 purports to improve agency accountability, the  proposal actively undermines the constitutional authority of agencies  to delegate the routine task of signing a rulemaking to subordinates as  an efficiency measure.   Senior agency appointees already ratify the signing of the rulemaking  after the fact to comply with this clause.   And Congress also already plays a significant role in placing and  removing restrictions on agency rules by conducting oversight and  restricting how funds can be used and passing legislation to limit  agency discretion.   As demonstrated time and time again in the House this year, Congress  can use the Congressional Review Act (CRA) to overturn rules it  disapproves of.   For instance, my Republican colleagues have already tried to use the  CRA to repeal reasonable restrictions on deadly weapons, jeopardize  affordable student loan repayment and make it harder for women- and  minority-owned businesses to access funds to grow their businesses.   While most can agree improvements can be made to the regulatory  process, measures that make it harder for agencies to make new rules  cuts against the interest of all who reside in the United States.  Because most importantly, regulations are necessary to save our lives.   Regulations are critical to ensuring the safety and soundness of  virtually every facet of our lives, including clean air, clean water,  safe toys, safe cars, and safe workplaces.   We should reject any effort that would prevent agencies from issuing  these life-saving regulations.   Yet rather than ensuring public protections and industry  accountability in and through agency rulemaking, this bill would create  confusion, ambiguity, uncertainty, and pointless delays.   The bill would only ensure delay and prevent necessary public  protections from being promulgated in the process causing, and  avoidable harm and risk to the public.   If enacted, this bill would give extreme legislators another  opportunity to obstruct federal policymaking by blocking the  confirmation of agency officials in the Senate, putting critical  government functions from civil rights enforcement and financial  regulation to protecting consumers and the environment in jeopardy.   It is also important to highlight that the Coalition for Sensible  Safeguards, consisting of over 160 labor, consumer, and environmental  organizations are strongly opposed to this bill.   Additionally, if the President were presented with H.R. 357, he would  veto it.   For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to vote in opposition to H.R.  357, The Ensuring Accountability in Agency Rulemaking Act.    Madam Speaker, the people of Texas have been on an  emotional roller coaster, and they have been on an emotional roller  coaster with our fellow Texan Kate Cox, her husband, and her family.   This young woman wanted nothing more than to have a healthy baby and  to expand their family. It was that love and deep desire that caused  her to go public on an absolutely abusive law that tells her what kind  of medical care she can get.   In addition, it should be made clear that a judge did give her  permission to make the decision with her doctor, her faith, and her  family. However, political intervention to the State supreme court  caused them to stop her in her tracks. This young woman had to leave  Texas.   Madam Speaker, that is why I am back here, to reintroduce, if you  will, my legislation, that creates a criminal offense for anyone to  stalk someone who is attempting to get good healthcare in the State of  Texas.   That is all Kate Cox wanted.   I will be standing by her and her family, as many Texans will. We  must stop this now, and we must reinstate reproductive freedom in this  Nation.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for her great  leadership.   Madam Speaker, I stand here for the children. We must stand for the  children. A little boy riding with his grandmother, Oleksandr Ivanov,  was killed by the Russians and more children have been killed in all  the conflicts that are going on.   We must move forward so that the humanitarian aid comes along with  the aid that is needed to fight the Russians who have lost 87 percent  of their military since they started. This can be winnable for the  children. We need humanitarian aid in all the wars that are now going  on, and I want to stand for that fight. The bill named after Oleksandr  Ivanov is to protect our children wherever they are, humanitarian aid  and war aid to ensure that the children are our priority. I hope that  this fight will be won, and we will win for democracy and we will win  for our children.   Madam Speaker, I rise today to support Ukraine as it stands up to  tyranny and defends their sovereignty in the face of Russia's  continued, unprovoked aggression. But I rise for the children in all  wars--and I ask and demand humanitarian aid for children in all the  wars.   We must send the unmistakable message that in the 21st Century, a  dictator cannot conquer or carve up neighboring territories.   On February 24, 2022, Russia, under the leadership of Vladimir Putin,  launched a premeditated war against Ukraine in an attack on democracy  and a grave violation of international law, global peace, and security.   The war in Ukraine continues to severely impact people's lives and  damage civilian infrastructure, triggering evacuations from front-line  areas and driving humanitarian needs.   According to the United Nations Refugee Agency, as of July 2023,  there are a recorded 5.1 million internally displaced people in  Ukraine, 6.2 million refugees from Ukraine globally, and 17.6 million  Ukrainian people in need of humanitarian assistance.   The unjust and brutal war has put millions of Ukrainian women and  children at risk of trafficking. Millions of children have been  deprived of their education and are experiencing trauma, and according  to a report by Yale University, more than 6,000 children are in  Russians custody.   According to a report by Yale University Humanitarian Research Lab  (Yale HRL), at least 6,000 children from Ukraine ages four months to 17  years have been held at camps and other facilities within Russia- occupied Crimea and mainland Russia since Russia's full-scale invasion  began.   Forcibly transferring children of one group to another group is a  violation of Article II(e) of the Convention on the Prevention and  Punishment of the Crime of Genocide 1948 and the Geneva Convention IV,  including articles 24, 25, 50, 78 and 82.   Today, I call my colleagues to action and ask that they join me in  seeking liberty and justice for all those in Ukraine.   Ukrainian children are being forcibly taken to Russia and put up for  adoption into Russian families in an apparent effort to assimilate  them, a practice that genocide scholar Timothy Snyder has said could be  considered genocide under the 1948 Genocide Convention.   Ukraine's Office of the Prosecutor General has confirmed more than  17,000 cases of Ukrainian children abducted to Russia. But the number  is likely much higher.   The U.S. State Department has said it has reliable information that  Russian authorities have deliberately separated Ukrainian children from  their parents during so-called ``filtration'' procedures and abducted  others from Ukrainian institutions before putting them up for adoption  inside Russia and estimates that the number may be as high as 260,000.  [[Page H6850]]    This is only the first step in what appears to be a deliberate  Russian policy.   Once Ukrainian children arrive in Russia--or in Russian-controlled  part of Ukraine such as Crimea--they are put into Russian orphanages.  After a short period, they are given Russian citizenship.   This is done because Russian law allows for the adoption of foreign  children.   Last Spring Putin signed decrees streamlining the process for  children to receive Russian citizenship and for adoption.   Families are also given financial incentives to adopt children.   In Russian custody, Ukrainian children are subjected to reeducation  programs meant to ``Russify'' them, told that their parents no longer  want them, and convinced that their future lies in Russia.   Disgustingly, Russian propaganda cynically portrays its adoption of  Ukrainian children as an act of generosity that gives new homes to  helpless orphans.   Russian state media shows local officials hugging and kissing newly  arrived Ukrainian children and handing them Russian passports.   Many of these children are not orphans at all.   Ukrainian institutions also house children whose parents were not in  position to take care of them for a period of time or who had special  needs.   Once adopted, children's names and dates of birth are often changed,  making it extremely difficult to find them and reunite them with their  families in the future.   We need to act now to stop the abduction and forced assimilation of  Ukrainian children to Russia.   We need to raise our concerns loudly and often and speak out to  counter the disgusting Russian propaganda that would use children in  this way.   We should consider whether there is a need to establish a registry to  record data on children believed to have been taken to Russia or  Russian-occupied territories to assist law enforcement and also future  family reunification in the future.   Of course, any such system must protect children's personal  information.   In addition, we should also look at what role international  organizations might play in tracking and rescuing these children,  including the Red Cross.   Further, Ukraine's children are suffering serious injury and trauma  due to Russia's genocidal war on Ukraine.   According to the United Nations, almost two-thirds of the country's  children have been displaced.   Thousands have been injured and, although UNICEF has said more than  1,000 children have been killed, that number is likely much, much  higher as there is no reliable way to verify how many civilians have  been killed in the most decimated areas of Ukraine, like Mariupol,  where, just as one example, Russian forces bombed a theater housing  hundreds of civilians despite clear markings that children were  present.   In addition to the immediate dangers of war, the effects of war on  children could have lasting consequences.   Many Ukrainian children have witnessed unimaginable violence,  including the murders of their own parents or family members.   They have had to endure the stress of being under almost constant  bombardment, in fear of their safety.   Others have experienced hunger, cold, and weeks spent hiding in wet,  frigid basements without daylight or fresh air and without sanitation  or healthcare.   This constant stress takes a heavy toll on the youngest victims of  war.   Moreover, disruptions to education may never be fully recovered.   In this regard, I would like to recognize the Ukrainian government's  exceptional campaign to keep children linked to their schools by  mobilizing the remote learning infrastructure built up during the  COVID-l9 pandemic, as well as the many European countries which have  opened their schools to Ukrainian refugee children.   Children--and their families--need support to heal from the trauma  they have experienced.   There are organizations on the ground providing psychological  treatment, art therapy, humanitarian aid, and for some even new homes.   We all need to support such programs and to act now to ensure their  continued action and expanded reach.   The longer children go without receiving treatment for their trauma,  the longer it will take to heal.   There is also significant concern for the physical, mental, and  psychological well-being of women in Ukraine.   Amnesty International reports that women in the country face grave  risks, an increased burden of caring responsibilities and immense  stress and hardships when living in war zones.   Amnesty International's Secretary General explains that ``Time and  time again, women bear the brunt of war's brutality. They are  consistently on the frontlines of conflict--as soldiers and fighters,  doctors and nurses, volunteers, peace activists, carers for their  communities and families, internally displaced people, refugees, and  too often as victims and survivors.''   Women confront increased sexual and gender-based violence and  perilous health conditions, while being forced to make life and death  survival decisions for their families.   At the same time, women are often excluded from the decision-making  processes and their rights and needs remain unprotected and unmet.   While many women in Ukraine have joined the resistance to Russian  aggression, very often caregiving responsibilities for children and  family members fall disproportionately on women.   Managing these caregiving responsibilities is especially difficult in  the perilous conditions of the conflict.   A woman living in the conflict zone in Donetsk Oblast, told Amnesty  International how the invasion has impacted her as a mother and  caregiver for her parents: ``All changed for the worse. Men [from the  family] are at war, women are left alone, many with small children on  their backs without any income. There is no help--no physical help, no  financial aid.''   The invasion has also had a distinct detrimental effect on women's  mental, physical and sexual and reproductive health.   For menstruating women and girls, limited supplies any increased  prices for menstruation management products are forcing them to choose  between food and sanitary products.   I am especially concerned about reports of rape and sexual assault  committed by Russian troops, not only of women, but also of children  and men.   Gender-based violence is aggravated and intensified for those living  in the conflict-affected regions for many reasons.   These include the lack of security, the absence or erosion of the  rule of law, the pervasiveness of impunity for the perpetrators, and  lack of trust in the occupying authorities, as well as the stigma  attached to disclosing experiences of sexual and gender-based violence.   This is not only an effort to humiliate and terrorize, but also could  amount to genocide as some women report being told by their tormenters  that they would be raped until they could no longer have Ukrainian  children.   Russia must be held accountable for their heinous actions and the war  crimes they have committed against the women, children, and people of  Ukraine.   I urge Congress to act to protect the safety, security, and well- being of the people of Ukraine, especially vulnerable populations like  women and children.   Congress cannot remain complicit in the face of Russian aggression.   We must act to defend the rights and freedoms of Ukraine's children  and all its people.   To hold accountable those who have committed these atrocities and  have put the lives of thousands of Ukrainian women and children at  risk, I introduced H.R. 5800, the Oleksander Ivanov Act.                     H.R. 5800, THE OLEKSANDER IVANOV ACT    This bill will help rescue and support the children of Ukraine from  Russian aggression and to prevent human trafficking in refugee flows.   Specifically, under this bill, the United States will:   Support programs for trauma treatment and healing, rehabilitation and  where necessary prostheses, for Ukrainian children affected by the war  including nationwide educational programs of psychological support to  address emotional trauma and stress for all of Ukraine's children,  integrated into school curriculum and offered through clinical and  social services.   Support programs to rebuild the education system in Ukraine and  education for Ukrainian child refugees, in cooperation with other  countries, international organizations, and civil society.   Support the development of a unified and consolidated searchable  registry of missing Ukrainian children in order to facilitate  identification of children and family reunification. The registry  should ensure strict data protection and availability in the Ukrainian,  Russian, and English languages. In addition, the public should be made  aware of its existence and use.   Support the creation of a unified central emergency call center hub  linked to law enforcement in Ukraine and in other countries to enable  reporting on and interventions on behalf of missing children originally  from Ukraine and suspected cases of human trafficking and sexual  exploitation, including online, of children originally from Ukraine.   The bill will also undertake new global actions to protect refugees  and combatting human trafficking by:   Supporting the creation of an international mechanism to facilitate  vetting of volunteers and other non-governmental front-line responders  working with refugees or with victims  [[Page H6851]]  of other major crises or natural disasters by government authorities or  law enforcement. Such an international vetting system could include  internationally recognized certifications verifying individuals who  have been recently cleared to work with refugees.   Supporting efforts to only allow appropriately vetted and  credentialled individuals (such as described above) access to refugees.   Continuing to support efforts by the Ukrainian government to increase  collaboration with their European counterparts on anti-trafficking  investigations and increased awareness efforts.   Supporting the development of robust child protective mechanisms for  vulnerable children, including those from Ukraine, in Ukraine and in  countries that have received Ukrainian refugees, that include social  assistance and protection to help prevent human trafficking and sexual  abuse of Ukrainian children.   And working with Ukrainian authorities to ensure that law enforcement  officials stationed at major border crossing points during a refugee  crisis are appropriately trained to prevent human trafficking and  support other measures to monitor for indications of human trafficking  targeting refugees in areas surrounding border crossings.   Further, my bill directs sanctions to hold Russia responsible for its  actions against the children of Ukraine by doing the following:   Imposing financial blocking and visa sanctions on any foreign person  or organization that the President or Secretary of the Treasury, in  consultation with the Secretary of State, determine are responsible for  engaging in or facilitating the transfer of Ukrainian children to  Russia or Russian-controlled areas of Ukraine or for their forced  assimilation, adoption, or placement in a foster home, and engaging in  or facilitating the human trafficking of Ukrainian refugees.   The actions laid out in this bill would represent a major step  forward for the children of Ukraine, illustrate America's strong stance  against Russian aggression, and protect the most vulnerable during this  time of conflict and crisis.   Holding Russia accountable for war crimes is crucial.   There can be no impunity for these heinous crimes.   And so today, I call on my colleagues to join me in continuing our  support for a victorious Ukraine, and to put an end to these heinous  crimes Russia continues to commit.   It is important that we continue to do everything we can to help  Ukraine succeed on the battlefield and protect its people, and we  cannot under any circumstances allow America's support for Ukraine to  be interrupted.                                time  1830
