 Madam President, I would like to speak about the  legislation that is before us right now on the floor. It is the annual  National Defense Authorization Act, incredibly important legislation  that the Senate, pretty much every year, is able to pass on a  bipartisan basis.   It is really an exception. There is so much else that we are locked  up on here with partisan gridlock. With regard to our troops, we tend  to come together, Republicans and Democrats, and make commitments to  them that we are going to give our men and women serving in the Armed  Forces the resources and support they need to carry out their critical  mission.   We have now proceeded to that legislation. I want to talk a little  about it. It has a lot of incredibly important things in it. It is  really important to Ohio.   In my State of Ohio, we have a lot of defense installations. They are  very important to our national security because they do important work.  They are also important to our Ohio economy. Ohio's defense spending  now accounts for more than 66,000 direct jobs, more than $4 billion in  salaries, and more than a $14 billion economic impact. Forty-three of  our 88 counties in Ohio are impacted by these facilities. So they are  critical to our State, to our economy, to our soldiers and their  families, and to tens of thousands of civilian employees as well.   Again, because of the good work being done in Ohio, including at  Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, which is our largest single employer  in Ohio, it is really important to our military readiness and to our  national security. This bill has proceeded through the Armed Services  Committee in the bipartisan manner in which it usually is done. I love  seeing that. It is legislation that every Member of this body, I hope,  will be able to support at the end.   It has a lot of important initiatives and some much needed reforms-- including, by the way, this year, a 3.1-percent pay raise for our  troops. I think that is necessary. They are in harm's way around the  world. They are ensuring our safety, and we should ensure that they are  fairly compensated for their hard work and their sacrifices.   One of the bill's other important initiatives that has a big impact  on my State is authorizing $1.7 billion to increase the rate of  production for both our M1 Abrams tanks and also for upgrades to 165  tanks that are already in service. That is an increase from last year's  figure. It also authorizes about $249 million to upgrade the Stryker  armored fighting vehicles.   This is great news for the men and women who are out in the field in  our Armed Forces. They love these vehicles, and they need them. The  Abrams  [[Page S4545]]  and the Stryker are the most advanced and lethal tanks and armored  vehicles on the battlefield today. One of our priorities in Congress  should be to ensure that we are providing our troops with what they  need to be able to do their duty and to protect themselves. We want to  be sure they have the highest quality equipment to be able to do that.  Only by ensuring that these funds are allocated to such key vehicles  like this can we be sure our Armed Forces are able to maintain their  advantage--their qualitative advantage on the battlefield.   This isn't just a big win for our military, however. It is also a big  win for a plant called the Joint Systems Manufacturing Center, or JSMC,  which is the tank plant in Lima, OH. The best tanks and armored  vehicles in the world are made at this plant. It has the best workforce  in the world to do it. I have seen them in action many times. It is the  only facility in the United States that has the capacity to produce  tanks like the Abrams tank and the Stryker armored vehicle. It is a  really important strategic asset for our country in Lima, OH.   Having been out there a lot, visiting with the workers, watching them  work, seeing what they can make, and having talked to the soldiers in  the field who use these products, I can tell you how important they  are. Most recently, I was at the Lima tank plant in March where I was  able to speak directly with the workers there about the long-term  health of the Lima plant, which the Obama administration, about 8 years  ago, attempted to shutter.   The President sent a budget to Congress--President Obama--saying we  would like to close down the tank plant because in the future we won't  need these tanks, at least not immediately, and some day we will have a  new generation of tanks, and meanwhile, let's just shut down this  plant. Some of us stood up, and I fought against that. We were able to  convince the U.S. Congress to overturn what the President wanted to do  and instead to provide funding for the tank plant to keep it open. Even  though production was down at that time, we were able to keep the plant  open and not have it be mothballed, as the administration wanted to do.  Thank goodness we did that because now we know--particularly with the  Russian influence in Europe and what our allies are telling us they  need--that we have to have these armored vehicles and these tanks, and  we need to continually upgrade them.   If we had shut down that plant, we would have lost this incredible  workforce that is there building something that is unique. There is  nothing quite like the welding, as an example, and the cutting that  goes into our tanks. We also would have lost the supply chain. That  would have been detrimental. It would have cost taxpayers so much more  to try to take that plant out of mothballs and recreate it again than  to keep it open as we did.   Now, frankly, we kept it open mostly through foreign sales. Other  countries around the world, including our allies, were still buying  Abrams tanks and Stryker vehicles. And Israel was buying the Nemera  vehicle, which is an armored vehicle that is much like our Abrams tank  without the turret. That kept us going, plus a little bit of upgrade to  our tanks.    Now, today, again, and since 8 years ago, when there was a proposal  to shutter this plant, we have been able to increase production slowly  but surely to the point that today we have the ability to really have  that plant humming. We have a lot of people who are working. It is on  its way up, and that is really exciting.   The funding allocated under this legislation we talked about today is  really important because it will allow this JSMC--the Lima tank plant-- to hire, train, and retain more workers dedicated to making the best  equipment possible to protect our troops.   I will tell you that the workers at the tank plant are very proud of  what they do. A lot of them are veterans. They know that what they are  doing every day by providing these armored vehicles has the potential  to save the lives of the American men and women in uniform across the  world who are relying on these vehicles to keep them safe and to be  able to have that qualitative advantage on the battlefield by having  the best equipment possible.   Last year, I had the opportunity to be the first Member of Congress  to see the latest models of the Stryker Dragoon vehicles, up-armored at  Lima. This was a real fight also. The Army came to us and said: We need  to have some additional capability with regard to our Stryker vehicles  to be able to push back against potential threats on the European  continent. At that time we had no tanks in Europe, and we needed to  upgrade what the Strykers could do by providing for additional  lethality, particularly to provide a turret on top of the Stryker  vehicle. We did that.   Now, as I saw with the 2nd Calvary Regiment in Germany, they are  using these vehicles, and those drivers of those vehicles, those other  troops who are using those vehicles, love them. It feels like, again,  it gives them the ability to be effective on the battlefield. They are  also training with a coalition of our allies, including Poland, the  United Kingdom, and Denmark. The work our men and women in uniform are  doing with our allies in Europe is vitally important because it forms a  framework of defense to protect our NATO allies from aggression.   The importance of an American military presence in Europe has never  been in doubt, but perhaps now, more than at any time since the end of  the Cold War, the security of Europe is uncertain. We have seen  repeatedly, these past few years, instances of military aggression,  electoral interference, and diplomatic provocation by Russia toward its  western neighbors.   Nowhere is Russia's continued maligned behavior on display more than  in the country of Ukraine. For the past 5 years, we have seen Ukraine  work to break free of Russia's orbit and seek greater integration with  the democratic framework of the West, with the EU, with the United  States, and with our NATO allies. Most vividly during the 2014 Maidan  protest in Kiev, Russia responded to these appeals for democracy by  illegally invading and annexing Crimea, which remains occupied in  violation of international law to this day.   In the eastern region of Donbass, more than 4,000 Ukrainian soldiers  have been killed fighting Russian-backed separatists. I have been to  the frontlines, the so-called line of contact in the Donbass, and let  me tell you that it is very much a hot war. Just last November, the  Russian Navy attacked three Ukrainian naval vessels and captured two  dozen Ukrainian sailors in international waters near the Kerch Strait.  These individuals remain unlawfully detained by the Russian Government  to this day. I urge my Senate colleagues and the entire international  community to join me in calling for the release of those sailors.   I know here, on this side of the Atlantic, what is happening in  Ukraine can sometimes seem like it is half a world away, but it is not.  It is very relevant. In a sense, it is where the modern battle is  taking place between two different ideologies--between whether a  country wants to go toward freedom and democracy in the West or  whether, again, to stay under the orbit of the Russian influence.   Here, in Ohio, we have a large and vibrant Ukrainian-American  community, particularly in Northeast Ohio, who have a vested interest  in seeing that their ancestral homeland can defend itself from Russian  aggression as it works to align itself more with NATO and the West  while promoting a platform of democracy, freedom, transparency, and  free markets.   Frankly, we should all be supportive of Ukraine's efforts to reshape  itself as a beacon of liberty in the region. As cochair of the Senate  Ukraine Caucus, which I cofounded with my colleague Dick Durbin, I have  been an advocate of the Ukraine as it works to break free from Russia's  influence. I traveled to Kyiv to meet with their newly elected  President, Volodymyr Zelensky. I am encouraged from my meetings that  they will stay on the right path toward reform, but to properly do so,  they also have to defend themselves from Russian aggression.   For the past 3 years, I have successfully introduced and passed  amendments to the legislation before us today, the National Defense  Authorization Act, to expand U.S. military aid to the Ukraine. These  provisions built and expanded the primary statutory framework for U.S.  security assistance to Ukraine, the Ukraine Security Assistance  Initiative.   This year, I was pleased to see a further $300 million authorized in  lethal  [[Page S4546]]  and nonlethal aid to Ukraine in the NDAA. This security assistance  package is good news and sends a strong signal that America stands with  the Ukrainian people, and we will make sure their military has the  capabilities it needs to defend its sovereign territory on land and in  the sea and air.   But our commitment to Ukraine security should extend to other forms  of support as well. I have offered an amendment that I hope will be  included in the final bill to pressure Russia to release the Ukrainian  sailors kidnapped in the Kerch Strait. It would do so by adding the  release of the 24 Ukrainian sailors as a condition for any U.S.  military cooperation with Russia. We need to take a firm stance against  Russia's blatant disregard for international law in this matter, and  passing this amendment will help us do so.   I am glad to see that the National Defense Authorization Act will  keep the lines of production running, from the factory floors in Lima  to the frontlines all around the world. I am glad we will be continuing  to help Ukraine defend itself from unlawful Russian aggression. I hope  we can also push for the release of the Ukrainian sailors who have been  detained illegally in the Kerch Strait.   I look forward to voting on the bill's final passage in the Senate in  the next week so the men and women who give so much of themselves to  keep us safe have the resources they need to fulfill their important  mission.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Mount  St. Joseph University on its 100th anniversary of service to higher  education.   Since 1920, Mount St. Joseph University has stood the test of time as  an institution of higher education in Greater Cincinnati, grounded in  the spiritual values and vision of its founders, the Sisters of Charity  of Cincinnati. As the Mount approaches its centennial in 2020, it  remains on a mission--to educate students, build better communities,  and to serve the common good.   Mount St. Joseph University enrolls 2,168 undergraduate, graduate,  and doctoral students. The majority of Mount graduates--i.e. more than  13,000 of the 16,600 living alumni--stay in the Cincinnati region to  pursue their careers and to raise their families, contributing to the  overall success of this region.   The Mount also serves a diverse population. Over 31 percent of  students are first generation, 23 percent represent minority  populations, and 100 percent receive financial assistance through  scholarships and financial aid. About 48 percent of Mount students are  from families in the low or moderate income levels.   Students at the Mount pursue studies in 39 undergraduate degree  programs, 6 master's degree programs, and 2 doctoral programs. As a  result of the academic excellence and career focus of the university,  more than 98 percent of Mount students are successful in starting their  careers, securing significant volunteer opportunities and obtaining  admission to graduate programs within 6 months of graduating.                            ____________________
