 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Reverend  Marie Galatas Ortiz, Louisiana's matriarch in the civil rights  movement.   After the death of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Ortiz became  increasingly involved and determined to work toward equality in her  community. She founded the Grass Roots Organization for Women, GROW, in  1975, aiming to encourage women's participation in leadership roles and  challenge patriarchal social systems.   Ortiz also led protests and demonstrations, including one demanding  justice for the death of Stanley Magee. She actively fought against  racially motivated violence and worked to remove Confederate statues in  Louisiana.   Ortiz remains committed to her spiritual mission and continues to  support underserved individuals through various organizations.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Reverend Galatas for her hard work and  dedication. I pray that she will continue to fight assuring a  successful and bright future for all men and women. Today, we give her  roses while she lives.   God bless Reverend Galatas, and may she continue her great work.                            ____________________
