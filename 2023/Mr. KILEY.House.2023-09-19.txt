 Mr. Speaker, I am taking a moment to recognize a cheerful,  spirited, and vibrant community member residing in my district, Ms.  Lisa Eck, for her 40 years of public service at the downtown Roseville  library.   Ms. Eck embarked on her journey as a young teen, starting at the  library as a quotidian shelver in 1983. In her tenure, she has become  one of the most beloved librarians in our region.   She is well known for her ability to captivate the magic of childhood  through her lively readings. Dressing in full costume and performing  books theatrically are just some of the ways that she captures the  attention and adoration of Roseville children and residents.   Ms. Eck's determination and dedication to bringing these stories to  life knows no bounds, and her unique approach makes her storytime  sessions a cherished tradition. Her special touch reaches all  generations, as she has marked the lives of tens of thousands of people  over the years.   Ms. Eck has an unfaltering commitment to promoting literacy and  educational opportunities for our local youth, and her efforts have  made an indelible impact in our communities.   As a former English teacher, I understand the importance of  developing a love for reading in students and value the efforts of  those like Ms. Eck to foster that passion through her creative and  innovative storytelling abilities.   Therefore, on behalf of the United States House of Representatives, I  am pleased to join the Roseville community in celebrating and  recognizing Ms. Lisa Eck for her four decades of leadership as a  librarian and her continued commitment to inspiring children and adults  alike with a desire for knowledge and learning.             Celebrating Virginia Lakes Resort 100th Anniversary     Mr. Speaker, I am taking a moment to recognize the  centennial anniversary of a special business in my district, the  Virginia Lakes Resort in the heart of the High Sierra, located in Mono  County, California.   In 1923, Walter Foster and Charles Foster signed an agreement with  the Forestry Department to build a fish camp at Virginia Lakes. After  the first year of operation, Walter Foster and his wife, Anita, became  the sole owners and operated the business for 30 years.   They quickly found success, as within the first 5 years of the  business they built several cabins that housed guests such as Hollywood  stars Fred MacMurray, Betty White, and Lon Cheney. They are also known  for hosting the 1938 USC football team for training before the team  went on to win a national championship.   The resort had a few different owners, such as the Coopers and Bill  Newman, before the current owners, John and Carolyn Webb, began their  journey in 1974. The Webbs will celebrate their 50-year anniversary as  owners next year and are well known by others for their commitment to  community engagement and dedication to providing an exceptional  experience for their visitors.   Today, the Virginia Lakes Resort offers key amenities such as rental  cabins, boat rentals, tackle shop, and a cafe. Visitors enjoy the  stunning scenery of the Sierra Nevadas while participating in a variety  of recreational activities at the resort, such as camping, fishing, and  hiking.   Therefore, on behalf of the United States House of Representatives, I  am honored to recognize the Virginia Lakes Resort for their 100-year  anniversary and commend them for their significant contributions  throughout the years to their community and the local economy.                            Thanking Jaime Robles     Mr. Speaker, I recognize an exemplary individual who  interned in my district office this summer.   Jaime Robles ensured that people's voices were heard, by taking down  their concerns and sharing them with me. He even helped people renew  their passport and access the services and benefits they are entitled  to receive from the Federal Government.   Jaime is a recent graduate of Sierra College in Rocklin and will be  attending UC Berkeley in the spring to major in economics. He served as  vice president and student senator of the Sierra College Student  Senate, vice president of student engagement for the social science  club, and is a Phi Theta Kappa honor society member. Jaime is also  bilingual, and I have repeatedly been impressed with his ability to  utilize that skill and serve our Spanish-speaking constituents.   Mr. Speaker, Jaime has been a pleasure to have in my office and, like  all our interns, has been a tremendous help to me and my team in  serving the people of the Third Congressional District of California. I  am incredibly grateful that he chose to invest his time and talents  with us.   On behalf of the United States House of Representatives, I thank  Jaime for his commitment to public service.                            ____________________
