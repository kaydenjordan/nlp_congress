 Madam Speaker, I rise today to remember and  honor a highly esteemed surgeon, compassionate physician, hero, and an  incredible person.   Dr. Fred Mullins, who was president and CEO of the Burn and  Reconstructive Centers of America, sadly, passed away at the age of 54.  In his over 30 years of caring for thousands of patients, he was a  trailblazer in burn care across the Nation and the world.   Dr. Mullins was also a founding board member of the Georgia Trauma  Foundation, a member of the Georgia Trauma Commission, and chairman of  the JMS Research Foundation. He was a native Augustan and graduated  from Augusta College before attending the Medical College of Georgia.   Dr. Mullins was given a foundation for his skills in burn care by Dr.  Joseph M. Still, and his focus was on carrying Dr. Still's legacy to  provide the best possible care to patients.   I became acquainted with Dr. Mullins in February of 2008, after the  explosion of the Savannah Sugar Refinery in my hometown of Port  Wentworth. A number of the victims there were taken to the Augusta Burn  Center; and there, I witnessed Dr. Mullins' compassion, his concern,  and his care for patients.    Madam Speaker, because of Dr. Mullins' unrivaled work and care for  patients, he now leaves behind a legacy that represents dedication to  the well-being of patients and improving healthcare across the Nation  and world.   Madam Speaker, my thoughts and prayers go out to his family, his  friends, his patients, and all who knew him.                          Remembering Harrison Deal     Madam Speaker, I rise today to remember and  honor Statesboro native Harrison Deal, who, tragically, passed away on  Friday, December 4, from a fatal car cash in Pooler, Georgia.   Harrison was a 20-year-old student at the University of Georgia and  was expected to graduate in 2022. He was a former intern for Senator  Perdue, and worked in the Athens office for Senator Kelly Loeffler's  campaign.   Governor Brian Kemp stated Harrison was a member of the ``Kemp  Strong'' family, and was a Kemp son and brother they never had. He has  been described as an incredible, magnificent young man by Senator  Perdue and Senator Loeffler.   He clearly touched countless lives in the State of Georgia and  beyond.   Madam Speaker, Harrison was the son of Bulloch County Commissioner  Curt Deal and his wife, Jenni, and was the brother of Hannah and Halli  Deal.   My thoughts and prayers go out to the Deal family, Harrison's  friends, and all who knew him during this most difficult time.                           Recognizing Marcus Hill     Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor and  congratulate a great American. Marcus Hill retires from serving as a  senior executive adviser for the Federal Law Enforcement Training  Centers, or FLETC, on January 28, 2021.   Marcus began his career of service as a personnel management  specialist with the Department of the Navy in 1983 and was assigned to  the naval submarine base located in Kings Bay, Georgia. This position  further inspired him to a life of service, so he went on to serve an  Active-Duty tour in the United States Air Force.   Before he transferred to FLETC in 1999, Marcus served in several  leadership assignments within the Navy. His career in FLETC spanned  widely and included joining the Transportation Security Administration,  or TSA, after the tragic events of 9/11.   Marcus' life has been marked by distinguished commitment to serving  his country and fellow man, which is why he has received numerous  awards and honors, to include the 2017 Presidential Rank Award for  Meritorious Service among many others.   It is people like Marcus who inspire us to live for something greater  than ourselves, and I am thankful for the wonderful example he has set,  which will surely outlast his career for countless years to come.   Madam Speaker, I wish him and his family the best as he embarks on  his retirement.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  Savannah, Georgia, WTOC news anchor Dawn Baker for appearing in this  year's ``CNN Heroes'' special.
