 Mr. President, I rise to speak to Baldwin amendment No.  1139. Wisconsin families need a tax break, and that is what I am  working for. This budget will fast-track enormous tax breaks for the  wealthiest few. It increases the deficit and puts Medicare and Medicaid  on the chopping block to pay for it.   I don't think it is right to ask the middle class to pay for tax  breaks for the top 1 percent with cuts to Medicare and Medicaid and  rising deficits--deficits that will surely be used by my Republican  colleagues to continue to justify an unwillingness to invest in the  essential pillars of economic security for families.   The entire reason reconciliation was created was for deficit  reduction, which the majority claims to care so much about. My  amendment is very simple. It would reinstate a point of order, known as  the Conrad rule, against reconciliation legislation that increases the  deficit. Let's not use reconciliation to add to our deficit.   I urge my colleagues to support my commonsense amendment that has  been cosponsored by Senators Warner, Whitehouse, Kaine, Coons, King,  Wyden, and Van Hollen.
