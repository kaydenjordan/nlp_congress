 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 97, I call up  the joint resolution (H.J. Res. 26) disapproving the action of the  District of Columbia Council in approving the Revised Criminal Code Act  of 2022, and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the joint resolution.  [[Page H785]]     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of Representative Clyde's H.J.  Res. 26, a resolution disapproving the District of Columbia's Revised  Criminal Code Act of 2022.   There is a crime crisis in America's Capital City. According to the  D.C. Metropolitan Police Department, carjackings in the District have  increased by 90 percent compared to this time last year. Total property  crime is up 31 percent, and homicides are up 29 percent. In fact, D.C.  is currently on track to have the most homicides since 1995.   But the radical D.C. Council has chosen to prioritize legislation  that will turn this crime crisis into a catastrophe. The D.C. Council's  progressive soft-on-crime legislation eliminates almost all the  mandatory minimum sentencing requirements for violent crimes, and it  drastically reduces the maximum penalties allowable to the courts.  These changes further embolden criminals to run rampant throughout the  District of Columbia.   The act also grants the right to a jury trial for most misdemeanor  offenses. The D.C. court system is already overloaded. This change will  burden the D.C. court system even more, reducing the resources devoted  to hearing cases for serious felony offenses.   The D.C. Council's legislation is eroding an individual's right to a  fair and speedy trial granted them through our Constitution.   All Americans should feel safe in their Capital City, but they don't  because of D.C. Democrats' leniency toward criminals at the expense of  Americans' safety.   Ensuring public safety and addressing crime is a cornerstone of the  House Republicans' policy agenda. In November of last year, Americans  voted for a new majority in the House--a new majority that will address  crime head-on to ensure a nation that is safe.   This D.C. Council legislation is a brazen rejection of law and order.  Ignoring the high rates of criminality in the District and doubling  down on leniency for society's violent criminals is a dereliction of  duty. This terrible policy will impact anyone who sets foot in the  District of Columbia, including residents, the commuting workforce,  Federal Government officials, foreign dignitaries, and Americans  visiting their Nation's Capital.   If the D.C. Council wants to continue to skirt its responsibility to  the people, then they will have to answer to this Congress.   It should be noted that we in Congress are not alone. The D.C. Police  Union, representing 3,500 members, and the National Fraternal Order of  Police are strongly in favor of H.J. Res. 26 stating in a recent letter  to Congress that the D.C. act ``will embolden criminals, dramatically  increase crime and violence, and render police officers in the District  of Columbia virtually powerless to adequately police the city and keep  its residents and visitors safe.''   This resolution is also endorsed by the National Association of  Police Organizations representing over 241,000 law enforcement  officials across America and the Federal Law Enforcement Officers  Association.   Additionally, on January 4, Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser  took the extraordinary step of vetoing this legislation, calling the  proposals controversial and stating that the act does not make the  District of Columbia safer.   Mayor Bowser's bold executive veto sent a strong message that the  policy proposals of this bill are simply unworkable and unsafe for the  District. There may not be much Mayor Bowser and I have agreed on in  the past, but today we are on the same page.   Mr. Speaker, I call on my colleagues to join me in supporting Mr.  Clyde's resolution disapproving of the D.C. Revised Criminal Code Act  of 2022. We must ensure these terrible criminal code reforms are not  put into place.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, it appears my Democratic colleagues would  rather disregard their statutory responsibility in the Home Rule Act.  How convenient to pick and choose when to do their duty.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  Clyde) who is the sponsor of the resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. McCarthy), the Speaker of the House.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I feel compelled to respond. These resolutions have been called  paternalistic. However, the last time Congress passed a joint  resolution of disapproval was all the way back in 1990, my senior year  in high school--I am 50 years old, Mr. Speaker--over 30 years ago.   Congress does not act upon D.C. legislation unless it is absolutely  necessary, and that is what we are faced with today.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Lawler).    Mr. Speaker, I am pretty sure we haven't had a carjacking  in my congressional district in several years. If someone thought about  carjacking a vehicle in my district, it probably wouldn't end well for  them. I don't think this has anything to do with this important bill in  a city that has been ravaged with crime and carjackings every day.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  D'Esposito).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from New York.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Louisiana (Mr. Scalise).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record four letters of support for this  resolution, letters from the D.C. Police Union, National Fraternal  Order of Police, National Association of Police Organizations, and the  Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association.                                                DC Police Union,                                   Washington, DC, February 6, 2023.      Speaker Kevin McCarthy,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker McCarthy: I am writing as Chairman of the       Fraternal Order of Police, Metropolitan Police Department       Labor Committee, D.C. Police Union (``D.C. Police Union'')       and on behalf of the nearly 3,500 members of the D.C. Police       Union regarding in support of the disapproval resolution       regarding a dangerous law that the D.C. Council has passed       that will embolden criminals, dramatically increase crime,       and render police officers in the District powerless to       adequately police the City.        On January 17, 2023, the D.C. Council overrode Mayor Muriel       Bowser's veto of the Revised Criminal Code Act of 2022 (the       ``RCCA''). The RCCA eliminates mandatory minimum sentences       for all crimes, drastically reduces the maximum penalties for       crimes such as carjacking, and eliminates accomplice       liability for felony murder. The provisions in this bill will       create lawlessness, prevent police from holding criminals       accountable, and increase the number of officers who leave       the department.      The RCCA Eliminates Mandatory Minimum Sentences and Dramatically                    Reduces Statutory Maximum Sentences         The RCCA eliminates all mandatory minimum sentences in the       District and dramatically reduces the statutory maximum       sentence which may be imposed for nearly all crimes. This       reckless legislation brings the District into uncharted and       dangerous territory. Indeed, the Council has conceded that       ``no U.S. jurisdiction has entirely eliminated mandatory       minimums.'' Despite this, the Council has persisted in its       irresponsible encouragement of lawlessness in the District.       The RCCA promotes crime by eliminating the certainty of       punishment for offenders through the elimination of mandatory       minimums while simultaneously stripping judges of the ability       to impose a punishment that matches the severity of the       offense through the dramatic reduction in statutory maximums.      Elimination of Accomplice Liability for Felony Murder Prosecutions         Section 22A-2201 of the RRCA eliminates accomplice       liability for felony murder prosecutions in the District.       Accomplice liability for felony murder is critical in       establishing liability across multiple perpetrators when       evidence is otherwise unable to prove which perpetrator       committed the ``lethal act.'' By eliminating accomplice       liability, the RCCA ensures that police and prosecutors will       be unable to hold the most violent and dangerous criminals       accountable.                    Reduction in Penalties for Carjacking         The RCCA dramatically decreases the penalties for       carjackings, despite the fact that carjackings have spiked in       the District over the past two years. The RCCA endangers       District residents and encourages lawlessness by reducing the       penalties for carjacking offenses. Doing so also removes a       critical degree of discretion from judges who, previously,       were given proper latitude to craft a punishment that fit the       severity of the crime.      Requirement of MPD Officers to Undergo an Indeterminate Amount of                             Extensive Training         The sweeping changes to the criminal code in the RCCA will       require D.C. police officers to receive extensive training       and learn and entirely new criminal code in the District. The       extensive retraining and overtime that will be required comes       at a time when the number of officers in the District is at       historical lows as a result of anti-police legislation passed       by the Council. The RCCA will undoubtedly take a further toll       of D.C. police officers and accelerate the current exodus of       officers from the District.        This anti-police, pro-crime law will create a mass exodus       of police officers from the District and will unquestionably       make the District of Columbia more dangerous for citizens who       live in the District, individuals who work in the District,       and tourists that travel to the District. As a result, the       D.C. Police Union strongly urges the House Oversight and       Accountability Committee to take all action necessary to       prevent this reckless legislation from becoming law.            Respectfully,                                                Greggory Pemberton,      Chairman, D.C. Police Union.                                   ____                               National Fraternal Order of Police,                                   Washington, DC, February 6, 2023.      Hon. Kevin O. McCarthy,      Speaker of the House, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Hakeem S. Jeffries,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Steven J. Scalise,      Majority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Katherine M. Clark,      Minority Whip, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Speaker and Representatives Jeffries, Scalise, and       Clark: I am writing on behalf of the members of the Fraternal       Order of Police to advise you of our support for H.J. Res.       26, a resolution disapproving the adoption of the Revised       Criminal Code Act (RCCA) of 2022 by the Washington, D.C. City       Council.        The union representing the men and women of the Washington,       D.C. Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) is proudly FOP and       the officers we represent have made it clear to us and to the       residents of the city that the RCCA will embolden criminals,       dramatically increase crime and violence, and render police       officers in the District of Columbia virtually powerless to       adequately police the city and keep its residents and       visitors safe.        On January 17, 2023, the D.C. Council overrode Mayor Muriel       Bowser's veto of the RCCA. Mayor Bowser, like the men and       women of the MPD recognize that it will quickly have a       negative impact on public safety in the District. The RCCA       eliminates mandatory minimum sentences for all crimes,       drastically reduces the maximum penalties for crimes such as       carjacking, and eliminates accomplice liability for felony       murder.        These so-called ``reforms'' have been implemented in other       jurisdictions and have led inevitably to greater violence and       crime across our country. Having it happen here, in our       nation's capital, will have a ripple effect and we are very       concerned that other cities will model their reforms on laws       like the RCCA.        To reduce the authority of law enforcement officers and       erect numerous obstacles to effective prosecutions and just       sentences in the middle of a national crime epidemic is at       variance with common sense! It is also contributing to the       recruitment and retention crisis in the District and around       the nation. In the last three years, more than 500 officers       have left MPD and many cite their terrible treatment by the       City Council as the reason for their departure.        We urge the House to adopt H.J. Res. 26 and disapprove of       the RCCA.        We further urge that the House review and consider a       similar disapproval resolution for the Comprehensive Policing       and Justice Amendment Act of 2022 which was enacted by the       City Council on 19 January 2023 without Mayor Bowser's       signature. Under the guise of police reform, the Act attacks       the rights of D.C. law enforcement officers, including       restricting their right to bargain collectively and       destroying their ability to challenge disciplinary matters       taken without just cause. The law is anti-police, pro-crime,       and the leading reason for the exodus of officers from the       MPD. Like the RCCA, it will make the District of Columbia       more dangerous for citizens who live in the District,       individuals who work in the District, and tourists visiting       the District. As a result, the D.C. Police Union respectfully       requests your assistance in defeating these horrible laws.        On behalf of the more than 364,000 members of the Fraternal       Order of Police, we strongly urge all Members of the U.S.       House of Representatives to support and pass H.J. Res. 26 to       protect the safety of the public in Washington, D.C. If I can       provide any additional information about this bill, please do       not hesitate to contact me or Executive Director Jim Pasco in       our Washington, D.C. office.            Sincerely,                                                      Patrick Yoes,      National President.                                   ____                                             National Association of                                      Police Organizations, Inc.,                                   Alexandria, VA, February 7, 2023.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Hakeem Jeffries,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker McCarthy and Minority Leader Jeffries: On       behalf of the National Association of Police Organizations       (NAPO) and the over 241,000 sworn law enforcement officers we       represent across the country, I am writing to advise you of       our concerns with the Revised Criminal Code Act of 2022 (D.C.       Act 24-789), as enacted by the Council of the District of       Columbia on January 17, 2023, and our subsequent support for       H.J. Res. 26.        According to the Metropolitan Police Department's crime       data, from this time last year, the District of Columbia has       experienced an increase in homicides, carjackings, and theft.       Particularly, D.C. is amid a rise in gun violence and       homicide rates among the city's youth. Yet, the Council still       voted to enact the revised criminal code that lowers       penalties for the crimes most impacting the city and its       residents, including carjacking, illegal firearm possession,       and robbery, and it will eliminate almost all mandatory       minimum sentences.        Proponents of the Revised Code believe that it will ensure       that sentences better fit their crimes and will give       nonviolent, low risk offenders a chance to become productive  [[Page H793]]       members of society. While NAPO agrees that these are laudable       goals--to ensure the punishment fits the crime--we disagree       on how this law accomplishes those goals. We continue to       believe that mandatory minimums are a strong deterrent for       criminals and an important tool in helping law enforcement       keep our communities safe from violent crime.        In addition, the Revised Code significantly changes the law       of self-defense for law enforcement officers that would       considerably constrain an officer's ability to protect       themselves and the public when confronted with imminent       death. Under the Revised Code, the considerations the officer       must make when faced with the need to use deadly force are       not only unrealistic in the rapidly unfolding scenario of an       attack upon an officer, they also create the perverse       situation where a suspect who escalates his/her dangerous       behavior toward an officer, to the point of deadly force       being an option, is more likely to be let go than a less-      violent suspect.        NAPO is concerned that the Revised Criminal Code Act, if       allowed to be enacted into law, will decrease public safety       and leave crime victims in a continual search for justice.       Therefore, we support H.J. Res. 26, disapproving of the       Revised Criminal Code Act of 2022, so that the Council of the       District of Columbia can work with Mayor Muriel Bowser to       revise the criminal code in a way that will not benefit       violent criminals over victims and will make the city safer.        We appreciate your consideration of our concerns with the       Revised Criminal Code Act of 2022. If we can provide any       assistance, please feel free to contact me.            Sincerely,                                          William J. Johnson, Esq.,      Executive Director.                                   ____                                             Federal Law Enforcement                                            Officers Association,                                   Washington, DC, February 7, 2023.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Speaker of the House, House of Representatives, Washington,           DC.        Dear Speaker McCarthy, I am writing on behalf of the almost       32,000 members of the Federal Law Enforcement Officers       Association (FLEOA) to express our strong support for H.J.       Res 26, ``Disapproving the action of the District of Columbia       Council in approving the Revised Criminal Code Act of 2022.''        In the past several years, there has been a dramatic       increase in multiple categories of violent crime, including       murders, homicides, robberies, aggravated assaults and       carjackings. Areas across the United States are experiencing       this heightened level of violent crime, with much violence       being highly concentrated in lower socioeconomic and minority       communities. These residents should not need to live in fear       for their safety.        So far in 2023, Washington D.C. is experiencing a 29       percent increase in homicides, an 89 percent increase in       motor vehicle thefts, and an overall 18 percent increase in       total crime. These statistics are shocking for any community,       but particularly shameful for our nation's capital city.        The primary goal of community leaders should be to provide       law enforcement the effective tools to counter and prevent       violent criminal activity. As proposed, the Revised Criminal       Code Act of 2022 ties the hands of our law enforcement       professionals. Therefore, FLEOA strongly supports this       resolution disapproving of the Revision Criminal Code.        We are grateful for your leadership on this issue and your       efforts to ensure that all law enforcement officers       nationwide have the ability to serve and protect the American       public.            Sincerely,                                                    Larry Cosme,                                     National President, Federal Law                                  Enforcement Officers Association.                                time  1015     The D.C. Revised Criminal Code Act of 2022 is  irresponsible. It is dangerous. It is playing with the livelihoods of  all who live in or visit D.C. by gutting the local justice system and  allowing emboldened criminals to remain on the streets.   This Congress must swiftly exercise its constitutional role  concerning the District of Columbia and reject this misguided  legislation from going into effect.   I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to unite in support  of law and order and support this necessary resolution of disapproval.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
