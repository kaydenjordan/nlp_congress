 Mr. Chairman, we voted on a similar amendment on this  topic a week before last in the National Defense Authorization Act. It  was defeated then, and it should be defeated now.   Mr. Chairman, I think there must be some misunderstanding. We are not  talking about a new weapons system. What we are talking about is taking  an existing weapon and taking some of the fissile material out so that  it results in a lower yield.   As the chairman from Idaho pointed out, we have similar low-yield  weapons that are air-delivered. The only difference here is a different  delivery system through the submarines.   Now, by the way, submarines already have the higher yield delivery  system. We are multiplying, though, with a low yield two different  delivery systems to complicate adversaries' calculations.   Now, why would we want to do that? Well, it turns out the Russians  have hundreds and hundreds of these lower yield weapons. And not only  that, they write and speak openly about using them, even in  conventional sorts of conflict.   So the point of the Nuclear Posture Review is we need the full range  of nuclear capability, from higher yield to lower yield, to make it  clear that our nuclear deterrent is credible at every level. Whatever  they may think they can get away with they cannot get away with.   As Secretary Mattis has written to Leader McConnell on June 3, 2018,  this ``warhead is meant to reinforce the credibility of our response,  which strengthens deterrence by denying potential adversaries the  advantages they appear to believe they could realize from nuclear first  use.''   It seems to me that that should be the thing that all of us come  together on in national security. It is having a credible nuclear  deterrent to ensure that no adversary--Russia, North Korea, no one-- believes that they can get away with using these weapons. That is the  reason this is so important.
