 I rise in opposition to the Article of Impeachment.   Let me be clear, what happened last Wednesday was a stain on our  Nation, and the criminals and the rioters responsible should be  prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.   It is clear now more than ever that our country needs to come  together, and Congress, this Congress, needs to lead by example and  begin the process of healing the deep division that exists among us as  Americans.   The article before us today will not accomplish that. In fact, the  sham Article of Impeachment will only serve to further fan the flames  of unrest and to appease the radical left's appetite for division.   We should be focusing on restoring communities devastated by  lockdowns, working on America's vaccine rollout, aiding a bipartisan  investigation into these attacks, and ensuring election integrity, not  impeaching a President who has promised a peaceful transition and who  has less than 7 days left in office.   It is time to focus on the unprecedented challenges we face, and it  is time to focus on unity. For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to  oppose the Article of Impeachment.
