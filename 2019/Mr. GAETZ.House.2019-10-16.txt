 Mr. Speaker, if Turkey is not acting like a NATO ally,  perhaps the sensible solution is to remove Turkey from NATO, rather  than keeping the United States inserted in Syria, presumably forever.  This is why I oppose this resolution.   I have heard my colleagues say we should not leave Syria without a  strategy. Perhaps it is equally logical that we should not stay in  Syria without a strategy, because in Syria we have tens of Americans  stuck between armies of tens of thousands who have been fighting each  other for hundreds of years and who will likely be fighting each other  hundreds of years from now.   Our mission to deprive ISIS of caliphate land has largely been  accomplished with the help of the Kurds and with over $9 billion being  paid to the Kurds. The Kurds have been fighting bravely where they  live, but they have been trained, funded, and equipped by the United  States. And we cannot accept the proposition that if we support a group  of people because our interests align in one case that this somehow  morally binds our country to every conflict that they have past,  present, or future; to do this would constrain the utility of America's  future alliances, not strengthen them.   The blood of America's patriots is among our Nation's most sacred  currency, and it must be spent only when absolutely vital to protect  American interests. We are not the world's police force. We are not the  world's piggy bank. I support an America first foreign policy, and I  oppose this resolution.
