 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order.    Madam Speaker, this afternoon, we are focused on the  Green New Deal. And I want to be very clear about why we need a Green  New Deal. Our fossil fuel-driven economy is making us sick and  literally killing us. But with historic investments in green  infrastructure and the care economy, we can do the opposite. We can  repair the damage done and give every person what they need to  flourish.   In the Pacific Northwest, we just saw a brutal heat wave that took  the lives of 116 people in Oregon, 112 people in Washington, and  hundreds more in British Columbia.  [[Page H3793]]    We saw catastrophic floods across Europe that killed nearly 200  people, and record-shattering rains that caused deaths in India and  China. We are living with wildfires that destroy communities and  suffocate us with smoke. Africa is being battered by drought, and  Siberia is in flames. We literally saw the ocean on fire.   We now live in a world in which extreme weather driven by climate  change is killing 5 million people per year. And in parts of my  district, you are three times more likely to die from asthma than  anywhere else in the country. We need to be crystal clear about the  fact that our economic system created this emergency, while our  political system subsidizes and protects the fossil fuel industry. That  has to change now.   The Green New Deal provides the framework we need to rebuild our  economy, society, and democracy from the ground up. The Green New Deal  recognizes that climate change, public health, systemic racism, and  economic inequality are all deeply connected. And as you will hear  tonight, it gives us a road map for tackling these crises together in a  holistic manner.   As a lifelong educator, I see the perfect place to kickstart this  process, our K-12 public schools.   Think about it, there is no single institution that touches the lives  of more people. We are talking about 50 million young people, plus  parents, teachers, staff, workers, and neighbors. Our schools are the  heartbeat of our communities, and they must become the epicenter of  transformative climate change.   For decades, we have allowed these precious places to be neglected,  particularly in redlined parts of the country. We are leaving Black and  Brown students and low-income students behind. We over-test the  academic ability of our children, but we do not support and engage them  as human beings.   And on a physical level, our schools have fallen into a state of  disrepair. In my 20 years as a teacher and principal, I saw this every  single day. We have schools with no running hot water or drinking  fountains that do not work. Schools where the drinking fountains that  do work are poisoning our children with lead.   We have schools that are infested with asbestos, mold, and rodents,  and that lack proper ventilation. So every day our children face a  whole spectrum of urgent health harms. And even as young people march  and organize relentlessly for climate action, schools are failing to  protect them from climate impacts, like extreme heat. Outdated,  inefficient HVAC systems are contributing to carbon pollution and  burdening schools with $8 billion in annual energy costs.    Last week, I introduced a bill called the Green New Deal for Public  Schools. This is a $1.43 trillion investment over 10 years designed to  fundamentally transform our public education system for the 21st  century. It will create and support more than 1 million green jobs  every year, and it centers the most precious resource in any healthy  democracy, our children.   With this legislation, we are going to upgrade and retrofit every  single public school in the country, beginning in the poorest and most  vulnerable districts. Every school will become a safe, healthy,  accessible, and zero-carbon center of the community.   We will remove toxic materials, electrify school facilities, and make  them energy-efficient, comfortable, and disaster-proof. We will install  solar panels and batteries so that every school generates and controls  its own renewable energy. We will create community gardens and green  spaces, and offer healthy food options to nourish our children, and so  much more.   These investments will be game-changing for schools in a variety of  ways. They could see their energy bills roughly cut in half and  reinvest the money that they save in the mental and behavioral health  resources that our children and families need.   In fact, this bill provides comprehensive funding for healing the  trauma of our communities. It will allow schools to hire hundreds of  thousands more educators, mental health professionals, school  counselors, and other support staff, especially from the local  community. It also provides significant resources for school districts  to form strong community partnerships and develop curricula that are  responsive to unique local needs.   The legislation tackles school inequality at the regional level by  quadrupling Title I funding. And it greatly increases IDEA funding for  students with disabilities. This is about care; caring for ourselves,  each other, our families, our communities, and the planet. That is what  the Green New Deal is all about.   Madam Speaker, I yield to my other colleagues who will highlight the  many other ways the Green New Deal framework addresses our Nation's  urgent needs.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from New York (Carolyn B.  Maloney), the chairwoman of the Committee on Oversight and Reform.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from New York  (Ms. Ocasio-Cortez), who is the original Green New Deal champion in  [[Page H3794]]  Congress and who has done so much in collaboration with social  movements to inject this vision into the consciousness of America. Her  Green New Deal for Public Housing was a major inspiration for my  schools legislation.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California  (Mr. Takano), the chair of the Veterans' Affairs Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from New Mexico  (Ms. Stansbury).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California  (Mr. Cardenas).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Missouri  (Ms. Bush), to whom I want to wish a very happy birthday today.   Ms. Bush is another powerful Green New Deal champion who has  introduced a fantastic Green New Deal For Cities bill. I also had the  pleasure of working with Ms. Bush on our public power resolution.    Madam Speaker, it is amazing, whether we are talking  about the Bronx, New York; St. Louis, Missouri; or New Mexico, it is  obvious that a Green New Deal is needed now.   Madam Speaker, I would like to close by returning to one particular  aspect of the Green New Deal for Public Schools because I think it  highlights something about the framework as a whole. For me, one of the  most exciting parts of the Green New Deal for Public Schools is how the  learning environment in every school will be enriched, putting our  young people at the center of the green energy revolution.   Students will delve into every aspect of the building retrofit  process and immerse themselves in the broader sustainability and social  challenges that we are tackling as a society. Each school will become a  living lab for the Green New Deal. I cannot think of a better way to  nurture the curiosity, ingenuity, and imaginations of our children. We  will be kick-starting climate, STEM, and STEAM careers across the  United States, and our country will reap the benefits of all that  creativity.   The Green New Deal for Public Schools and the entire Green New Deal  framework is built on the foundation of care and healing and allowing  everyone in this country to unlock their full potential.   This is an idea that is expressed in Tupac Shakur's brilliant poem  ``The Rose That Grew from Concrete.''       Did you hear about the rose that grew from a crack in the             concrete?      Proving nature's law is wrong it learned to walk without             having feet.      Funny it seems, but by keeping its dreams, it learned to             breathe fresh air.      Long live the rose that grew from concrete when no one else             ever cared.    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
