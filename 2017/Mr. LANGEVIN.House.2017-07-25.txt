 Madam Speaker, on rollcall vote No. 410 I was  unavoidably detained. Had I been present, I would have voted ``nay.''   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the resolution.   The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the ayes appeared to have it.                                Recorded Vote
