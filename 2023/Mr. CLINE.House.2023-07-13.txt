 Mr. Speaker, for years, Americans have watched their  televisions or read their newspapers and seen the FBI constantly in the  headlines--and not for the good.   Under Director Christopher Wray's leadership, the FBI has become  weaponized, and the American people's trust in the institution has been  severely damaged. We have seen the agency launch an entirely  unwarranted investigation against Donald Trump to prove nonexistent  collusion with Russia.   We have seen the agency use the Steele dossier to abuse the FISA  process and spy on conservatives.   We have seen the agency label parents concerned about what their  children are learning in schools in Northern Virginia as domestic  terrorists.   We have seen the agency target whistleblowers who expose corrupt  behavior and political bias.   We have seen the agency target Catholics in Richmond, Virginia, who  are simply exercising their First Amendment right to express their  faith.   The Republican-led House Judiciary Committee is demanding that  Director Wray accept responsibility for the agency's abusive overreach  of power, and the Appropriations Committee is taking action, using the  power of the purse to rein in the abuses that have occurred in this  agency.   There is no place for politics within the FBI, and we will not stop  working to bring an end to this weaponization of our law enforcement  agencies and the use of these agencies against law-abiding Americans.           Congratulations to Glenvar High School Men's Tennis Team     Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the Glenvar High School  men's tennis team for winning the Class 2 State title.   This victory marks the program's first championship since 1996. By  training hard to ensure that they are at their best and by encouraging  each other, the Highlanders left it all on the courts and dominated the  Bruton Panthers.   These talented young men include Blaine Bishop, Alec McIlwain, Marco  Gustafson, Logan Garner, Beckett Wilkinson, and Ian Kelley.   Leaving the singles match, the Highlanders were out to a strong 4-2  lead, needing just one more win to get the State title.   Blaine Bishop, alongside his doubles partner Alec McIlwain, clinched  the championship after Bishop dominated the Panthers' doubles team,  securing the championship for the Highlanders.   For the last three seasons, Head Coach Bob Haynie has brought the  team together, becoming not just teammates but a family they can rely  on both on and off the court.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the Glenvar High School men's tennis team  and the parents, faculty, and staff on this incredible achievement.                            ____________________
