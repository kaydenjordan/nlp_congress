 Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1424, the Fallen Warrior  Battlefield Cross Memorial Act is the first piece of legislation I  introduced as a Member of Congress, and it is fitting that we discuss  it on the floor today, just one day after Veterans Day.   This bipartisan legislation would protect the display of these  memorials at our national cemeteries and bar the Department of Veterans  Affairs from removing these tributes, as they did in national  cemeteries across the Midwest in 2017. This legislation comes straight  from the veteran community and my northeast Ohio district.   Over the past several years, Elton Boyer, the president of the 555th  Honors Detachment, made this bill his mission as he worked to erect a  Battlefield Cross Memorial at Ohio Western Reserve National Cemetery in  Seville. He and the honors detachments at Western Reserve collected the  spent brass from the military funerals they oversaw at the cemetery  with the goal to someday melt them down and form them into a  heartwarming tribute to the fallen warriors laid to rest.   When Battlefield Cross Memorials were removed from the cemetery in  the fall of 2017, Elton's work was put at risk. Elton wrote my  predecessor, Congressman Jim Renacci, for help, stating: ``It has been  said that the soldier's cross is a symbol for caring, honoring,  and remembering. `No one is left behind.'''    Elton passed away last month, but I know that he is looking upon this  House today, proud of the vote we are about to take. His efforts were  not in vain.   Battlefield Cross Memorials stand in cemeteries across our Nation as  a tribute to the service of fallen soldiers who have given their lives  for our country. They depict the soldier's boots, helmet, dog tag, and  inverted rifle, and have been a noncontroversial, time-honored  tradition since at least the Civil War.   As Strongsville, Ohio, VFW Commander Tim Zvoncheck told me: ``It's  imperative that this custom continues to be displayed for as long as  the sons and daughters of this Nation are willing to give their lives  in its defense.''   Michael Kuhn, a combat veteran from Massillon, Ohio, explained to me  what this memorial means to him:         The battlefield cross encapsulates so many of the most       important things to a combat vet: the rifle, the boots, the       tags, and, most of all, the fallen comrade. It's extremely       important for us to have those things wrapped up in one       memorial for us to kneel to, grieve with, and talk to our       brothers in arms that have died the ultimate death in laying       down their life for us and their country. As a combat vet,       you relate to very little outside of that world and always       feel like an outsider. Whenever you see that combat cross, it       brings a somber, quiet feeling of peace for that moment that       you have that direct line to your fallen comrade.    I thank Chairman Takano and Ranking Member Roe for bringing H.R. 1424  to the floor today and recognizing how important this legislation is to  our veteran communities, and I urge my colleagues to vote in support of  the bill, H.R. 1424.
