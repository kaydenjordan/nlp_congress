 Mr. Speaker, I didn't prepare a speech today. I brought  the bill to the floor because I have great empathy for my colleague on  the other side of the aisle who has the unenviable task of somehow  trying to defend this 200-page bill, the polluters over people act.  These 200 pages put polluters first at every turn.   Mr. Speaker, if you don't believe me, I encourage you to read the  bill. Buried in this 200-page bill, on page 40, is a provision that  gives the Secretary of Energy and the Administrator of the EPA the  power to grant a waiver to any refinery in this country from the key  requirements of bedrock environmental laws that have governed this  space for the better part of the last 50 years, since the days of  President Richard Nixon.   Look at subparagraph (c) that enables any party who acts under a  waiver granted under this bill to violate any environmental law and  have blanket immunity. The Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act, NEPA,  you name it, they will waive it. That is not a bill that puts people  first. It is a bill that puts polluters first. It is why I am proud to  vote ``no'' and why I encourage every Member of this distinguished body  to vote ``no'' on this bill.
