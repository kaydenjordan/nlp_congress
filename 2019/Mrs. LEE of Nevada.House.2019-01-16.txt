 Madam Speaker, on behalf of the people of  Nevada's Third District, I rise today to say it is time to end the  shutdown.   This weekend, I had the opportunity to meet with Federal workers in  my district who are dealing with the very real consequences of this  unnecessary shutdown.   One employee is now driving for Uber. Another one has been forced to  sign up for food stamps at the age of 51.   A high-tech employer in Nevada who employs Federal contractors is  dealing with his third Federal Government shutdown in 12 months. His  highly skilled employees are sick and tired of the uncertainty and  missed paychecks. If this shutdown persists, he will lose employees,  which will not only hurt his company, but our overall economy as well.   Madam Speaker, this is no way to run a country. The government should  never be shut down over a single policy, any policy.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule and the underlying  bill. I am proud to help these communities recover and families rebuild  their lives after the devastating effects of extreme weather.   But this bill is also a reminder of the cost of ignoring climate  change. As the planet continues to warm because of manmade causes, more  and more communities are at risk of extreme weather.   In my home State of Nevada, Lake Mead is 50 percent as large as it  was in the year 2000. As the water level continues to fall, water  prices will continue to rise for families across southern Nevada.   According to the GAO, climate change has already cost taxpayers over  $350 billion over the past decade.   We must take concrete steps to curb climate change. The costs--both  human and financial--are already too high.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the rule and the  underlying bill.
