 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise today in support of the  nomination of Nicole Nason to serve as Administrator of the Federal  Highway Administration at the U.S. Department of Transportation.   The Federal Highway Administration plays a central role in America's  mobility. The administration is the lead partner to State and local  transportation programs that maintain and improve our Nation's roads,  highways, and bridges. It has been without a Senate-confirmed  leadership director for far too long.   America's transportation infrastructure faces a number of challenges.  Authorization of the Federal highway programs are going to expire at  the end of September of 2020. We need to work together in Congress to  write and pass a bipartisan highway infrastructure bill that upgrades  America's roads and bridges.   The Environment and Public Works Committee, which I chair, has  already begun the bipartisan process of drafting this legislation. The  Federal Highway Administration needs a strong Administrator in the  office, one who can work with Congress on the development and  implementation of highway infrastructure legislation.   Nicole Nason is the right person for the job. She is well qualified,  and brings impressive experience in transportation policy to this  critically important position.   Under President Bush, she served as Administrator of the National  Highway Traffic Safety Administration. That is the Department of  Transportation's top road safety official.   Before that, she served as the Department of Transportation's  Assistant Secretary for Government Affairs. In that role, she played a  key part in negotiating the bipartisan passage of a 5-year highway  reauthorization bill.   Ms. Nason most recently served as the Assistant Secretary of the U.S.  Department of State's Bureau of Administration, a position where she  has managed nearly 2,000 employees and contractors.   Ms. Nason has won praise from a wide variety of groups. Helen Witty  is the national president of Mothers Against Drunk Driving. This is  what she stated:         Nicole is a true champion of highway safety and will be an       asset to the Department of Transportation as the Federal       Highway Administration Administrator. On behalf of MADD, I       wholeheartedly endorse her for this position.    The Associated General Contractors of America had this to say:         Ms. Nason is a superb choice to fulfill the Federal Highway       Administration's leadership role in improving mobility on our       nation's highways.    The Governors Highway Safety Association has stated:         Throughout her career, Ms. Nason has demonstrated a clear       commitment to public service and, during her tenure as       Administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety       Administration (NHTSA) a dedication to advancing highway       safety.    Confirming Ms. Nason to be Administrator of the Federal Highway  Administration will be an important step in supporting our Nation's  highways, roads, and bridges.   The Environment and Public Works Committee recognized this when we  reported her nomination by voice vote on February 5. That has been  nearly 2 months ago. It shouldn't take this long to confirm such a  highly qualified nominee to such an important position.   Nicole Nason will be an excellent Administrator of the Federal  Highway Administration. I encourage every Senator to vote to confirm  her.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
