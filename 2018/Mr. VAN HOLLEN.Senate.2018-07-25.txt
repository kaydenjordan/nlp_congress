 Thank you, Mr. President.   I want to join my colleague from Virginia, Senator Kaine, and others  who  [[Page S5349]]  have come to this floor to talk about the important work that is done  every day on behalf of the country by our Federal civil servants. As my  colleagues have said, these are people who do the work for the American  people in Maryland, Virginia, and States in every part of this country.  They are the nurses and doctors taking care of our veterans at veterans  hospitals. They are the folks in our intelligence community who are the  eyes and ears for our country, detecting foreign threats so that we can  respond to them in time. They are the people at the Social Security  offices, whether in Virginia or the Social Security Administration in  Maryland or others around the country, who are making sure that people  who put in a full day's work and had a long career can get the Social  Security support they earned. They are the people at places like the  National Institutes of Health who are working every day to discover  cures and treatments for diseases that impact every American family.   Unfortunately, rather than treating these Federal civil servants with  the dignity and respect they deserve, the administration is taking  multiple steps to harm the ability of these men and women to do their  job for the American people. It is especially ironic in an  administration where we have seen people appointed to heads of Cabinet  agencies who have been documented to have wasted lots of taxpayer  dollars and abused the public trust--an administration that puts those  people in the highest offices at the same time they are undermining the  work of Federal employees who go to work every day.   I am pleased to join my colleagues today to stand up for these  Federal employees. I wish we didn't have to be here, but we have to be  here because the Trump administration issued a series of Executive  orders just a few months ago that go after Federal civil servants, just  as we have seen this administration attack workers' rights in the  private sector across the country.   The first Executive order that was issued short-circuits the  collective bargaining process. It imposes a new, rigid process under  which Federal agencies are allowed to impose workplace policies without  good-faith negotiations. Good-faith negotiations are required now, and  this would undermine that requirement.   The second order imposes arbitrary limits on the time that Federal  employees in a union can carry out their duties to represent their  fellow workers. No single case is the same, and Federal employee unions  are required not only to represent the people who sign up as members of  the unions but all Federal workers. So to arbitrarily dictate the  amount of time necessary to protect the rights of a Federal employee is  simply wrong and will undermine the justice within the system.   The third Executive order, which is especially egregious, as my  colleague from Virginia just said, is the one that eliminates the  opportunity for due process before someone is fired. That opens the  door to cronyism in our system--to favoritism and cronyism.   That is why 45 Senators sent a letter to the President a little while  back calling upon him to rescind these orders and take other actions.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that that letter be printed in  the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                    U.S. Senate,                                      Washington, DC, June 19, 2018.      President Donald Trump,      The White House,      Washington, DC.        Dear President Trump: We write to express our serious       concerns about recent actions to undermine the foundations of       our civil service system. We respectfully request that you       reconsider and rescind Executive Orders 13836, 13837, and       13839, which undermine the lawful rights and protections       afforded to federal employees. At a minimum, we hope you will       ensure that managers at federal agencies do not use these       executive orders inappropriately to circumvent existing       collective bargaining agreements between agencies and federal       workers.        The approximately two million men and women in the federal       civil service are dedicated and hardworking professionals.       They safeguard our national security and food safety, perform       lifesaving medical procedures, deliver Social Security and       veterans' benefits, and fulfill countless other       responsibilities on behalf of our citizens.        The recent executive orders undermine the decades-old       rights of federal employees to fair representation in the       workplace. These orders significantly reduce the extent to       which federal agencies will negotiate collective bargaining       agreements with their workforce. Instead, federal agencies or       outside panels will impose workplace policies without good       faith negotiation.        Imposing arbitrary limits on the time that federal       employees can carry out statutory duties to represent fellow       employees--known as official time--makes it harder to resolve       workplace disputes and root out waste, fraud, and abuse. The       law already requires federal agencies and unions to negotiate       agreements that require official time to be ``reasonable,       necessary, and in the public interest'' (5 U.S.C. Sec. 7131)       and official time has helped prevent cover-ups of disease       outbreaks, address racial harassment, and expedite benefits       for veterans.        We support improving the performance of the federal       workforce, but these executive orders will do the opposite.       These executive orders discourage federal agencies from using       their discretion to create reasonable plans for federal       employees to improve their performance if they are at risk of       demotion or termination. Firing employees without due process       undermines the merit-based civil service system, and opens       the door for managers to satisfy their own personal vendettas       or political agendas.        Some federal agencies already appear to be abrogating       existing collective bargaining agreements by citing these       executive orders. We ask that you direct agency and       department heads to cease and desist from doing so.        It is time to stop the attacks on our federal workers.       These are also attacks on our veterans, who make up roughly       one-third of the federal civilian workforce. We need to keep       politics out of the civil service, and we urge you to       reconsider these executive orders.            Sincerely,          Chris Van Hollen, Tim Kaine, Sherrod Brown, Benjamin L.             Cardin, Mazie K. Hirono, Brian Schatz, Mark R. Warner,             Richard Blumenthal, Kirsten Gillibrand, Jeanne Shaheen,             Thomas R. Carper, Patty Murray, Edward J. Markey, Tammy             Duckworth, Maria Cantwell, Elizabeth Warren, Margaret             Wood Hassan, Kamala D. Harris, Sheldon Whitehouse, Gary             C. Peters, Angus S. King, Jr., Bernard Sanders, Tammy             Baldwin, Charles E. Schumer, Richard J. Durbin, Jack             Reed, Cory A. Booker, Tina Smith, Christopher A. Coons,             Robert P. Casey, Jr., Michael F. Bennet, Robert             Menendez, Tom Udall, Jeffrey A. Merkley, Joe Donnelly,             Ron Wyden, Catherine Cortez Masto, Dianne Feinstein,             Doug Jones, Bill Nelson, Debbie Stabenow, Martin             Heinrich, Patrick J. Leahy, Amy Klobuchar, Christopher             S. Murphy, U.S. Senators.     Mr. President, Federal law requires that agencies  bargain in good faith with their workers. That makes for a better  workplace, and that makes for better results for the American people.  The President cannot just repeal that law by Executive order. I hope  the courts will strike down these Executive orders as being an abuse of  process and violating the law.   With that, Mr. President, we got some good news on that front today.  Even before the President's Executive orders were in place, Secretary  DeVos over at the Department of Education had already launched her  attack on workers' rights. That attack she launched was reviewed by the  Federal Labor Relations Authority, and, as reported today in the New  York Times--the headline states: ``Education Dept. Illegally Curbed  Workers' Union Protections, Mediators Suggest.''   What we have seen is that this pattern the Trump administration has  tried to unilaterally put in place is getting some pushback from the  Labor Relations Authority.   As reported in the article--it says that ``the decisions could have  broad implications because the Education Department's actions mirror  Trump administration efforts throughout the Federal Government.'' They  mention the Social Security Administration, Department of Veterans  Affairs, and others.   I hope the courts will follow the lead of the mediators that found  President Trump's Executive orders to be illegal because, as has been  reported and as the Senator from Virginia just mentioned with respect  to Social Security in his State, we are also seeing efforts at the  Social Security Administration in Baltimore to undermine the rights of  Federal employees.   The leadership at SSA in Baltimore has already slashed official time  for union members to represent fellow employees. They plan to evict the  unions from their office space at the Social Security Administration  headquarters as early as next week. The result will  [[Page S5350]]  be that Social Security Administration workers will not have their  voices heard on issues important to their workplace. The Social  Security Administration had previously agreed to provide a certain  amount of official time and office space to its workers. Now they are  ripping apart those agreements.   Today, Senator Cardin and I sent letters to President Trump's  nominees for the Social Security Commissioner and Deputy Commissioner  to ask for their assurances that Federal workers will be treated more  fairly under their watch if the Senate confirms those nominations. We  have called upon the Social Security Administration's current  leadership to honor the existing collective bargaining agreements and  negotiate in good faith with the unions if they need to revise those  agreements.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record  the letters Senator Cardin and I sent to the nominees.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                    U.S. Senate,                                      Washington, DC, July 25, 2018.      Nancy A. Berryhill,      Acting Commissioner,      Social Security Administration, Baltimore, MD.      Ralph A. Patinella,      Associate Commissioner, Labor-Management and Employee           Relations, Social Security Administration, Baltimore, MD.        Dear Ms. Berryhill and Mr. Patinella: We are deeply       concerned about the recent actions you have taken with regard       to the workforce of the Social Security Administration (SSA)       in your respective roles as the Acting Commissioner and the       official designated to implement Executive Order 13837 at       SSA. Social Security is the bedrock of economic security for       American families, providing retirement benefits, disability       insurance, and life insurance for surviving spouses and       dependents. The federal employees at SSA are responsible for       providing the fairness and efficiency that Americans expect       and deserve from Social Security.        On June 19, 2018, we signed a letter joined by 45 Senators       to urge President Trump to rescind three Executive Orders       regarding the federal workforce, and we have attached that       letter for your reference. We remain deeply concerned about       how these orders undermine lawful civil service protections       for federal employees throughout the government. Since       signing that letter, it has come to our attention that SSA       leadership has demonstrated particular hostility towards its       workforce in the way it is implementing the Executive Orders.        President Trump's Executive Orders regarding the federal       workforce currently face serious legal challenges, but SSA       leadership has exceeded even the dubious authority provided       by these orders. Executive Order 13837 makes clear that,       ``Nothing in this order shall abrogate any collective       bargaining agreement in effect on the date of this order.''       It is our understanding that some workers at SSA are covered       by collective bargaining agreements that have not expired,       and that even expired agreements provide for the continuation       of key provisions until a new agreement is reached.        SSA leadership has abrogated its collective bargaining       agreements by slashing the official time available to unions       to fulfill their statutory duties for SSA workers. SSA       leadership has further abrogated these agreements by refusing       to provide agreed-upon reimbursement for union members to       travel for arbitrations and negotiations--even cancelling       existing reservations--and SSA leadership has moved to evict       unions from office space that SSA agreed to provide in       collective bargaining.        We understand that SSA cannot disregard these executive       orders, but we do not understand why SSA is implementing       these orders with more hostility towards its workforce than       the executive orders require (and possibly even more       hostility than they permit). Please explain to us what legal       or regulatory barriers prevent SSA from honoring its existing       collective bargaining agreements while negotiating new       agreements in good faith with the unions.        We are also concerned about protecting the independence of       Administrative Law Judges (ALJs), in light of President       Trump's more recent Executive Order removing these positions       from the competitive civil service. The integrity of Social       Security depends on a merit-based process for selecting and       managing ALJs that is free of political influence. We urge       you to continue to use a merit-based process for hiring and       managing ALJs that is not influenced by politics or pressure       from elsewhere in the Executive Branch.        Thank you for your attention to this matter. We look       forward to your reply.            Sincerely,      Chris Van Hollen,        United States Senator.      Benjamin L. Cardin,        U.S. Senator.                                   ____                                                      U.S. Senate,                                      Washington, DC, July 25, 2018.      Andrew M. Saul,      Social Security Administration,      Baltimore, MD.        Dear Mr. Saul: The Senate is currently considering your       nomination to be Commissioner of Social Security. Social       Security is the bedrock of economic security for American       families, providing retirement benefits, disability       insurance, and life insurance for surviving spouses and       dependents. The federal employees at the Social Security       Administration (SSA) are responsible for providing the       fairness and efficiency that Americans expect and deserve       from Social Security, which is why we strongly oppose recent       actions by SSA leadership to undermine SSA's workforce. We       are writing to ask for your assurance that if the Senate       confirms your nomination, that SSA will treat its workers and       their unions more fairly under your leadership.

Federal law requires agencies to bargain in good faith with       the unions representing their workforce--an obligation that       President Trump cannot overturn by Executive Order (5 U.S.C.       7114). If confirmed, we expect you to follow the law.       Therefore, as the Senate considers your nomination, we       request the following assurances from you regarding how SSA       will function under your leadership:        1. SSA will honor its collective bargaining agreements by       rescinding the unilateral changes that SSA has already made,       and will not make further unilateral changes.        2. SSA will honor the terms of expired collective       bargaining agreements until reaching a new agreement, by       rescinding unilateral changes and not making further       unilateral changes.        3. If SSA and its workforce seek to negotiate a new       collective bargaining agreement, that you will bargain in       good faith with the unions representing SSA's workforce, and       do everything in your power to reach an agreement without       resorting to the Federal Service Impasses Panel to impose       terms.        4. SSA will continue to use a merit-based process for       hiring and managing ALJs that is not influenced by politics       or pressure from elsewhere in the Executive Branch.        Additionally, please describe the formal or informal role       you have played, if any, regarding the implementation of       these executive orders at SSA.        Thank you for your attention to this matter. We look       forward to your reply.            Sincerely,      Chris Van Hollen,        U.S. Senator.      Benjamin L.

David Fabian Black,      Social Security Administration,      Baltimore, MD.        Dear Mr. Black: The Senate is currently considering your       nomination to be Deputy Commissioner of Social Security.

In closing, as our colleagues have said, it is very  important that we work together to protect the integrity of the Federal  civil service. We have had a system over time where folks have been  judged on their merits, not judged on their political favoritism or  whether they were really good at saying exactly what their boss might  want them to say. We want a civil service that values independent  thinking and also values merit. By taking these actions, unfortunately,  the Trump administration is undermining those efforts.   I hope the courts and I hope this body will join us in pushing back  on these efforts by the Trump administration to undermine the integrity  of our workforce and stand up for the hard-working Federal employees  who are doing the work of this country every day.   I thank the Presiding Officer.
