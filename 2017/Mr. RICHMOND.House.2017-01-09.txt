 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to defend an 18-year-old  school student who expressed his life experiences, and he did it in the  form of art protected by the First Amendment to our Constitution.   But what I also want to do is make sure that we, as Members of  Congress, don't use our bully pulpit in this very prestigious and most  elite body in the United States to condemn the actions of an 18-year- old who is only expressing what he sees on a daily basis.   What real leadership is is to talk to that young man and ask him why,  in his community, this is his perception; ask him why he fears the  police; and ask him why, in his neighborhood, they fear the police. We,  as Members of Congress, understand the sacrifice of law enforcement and  the fact that they put their lives on the line every day, and we honor  them.   But when there is a question on any segment of our society that they  don't get equal justice, equal protection of the laws, and that the  Pledge of Allegiance rings hollow when you say ``and justice for all,''  what real leadership does is tackle that issue as opposed to jumping on  an 18-year-old high school student.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  be given 5 days to revise and extend their remarks.

Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Louisiana?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, it is an honor and a privilege to have  this opportunity to stand on the House floor and to anchor the  Congressional Black Caucus' Special Order hour, where today we want to  discuss some of the issues and challenges confronting this country that  we hope this newly constituted Congress will be prepared to take up as  we move into the 115th Congress.   The first and most glaring issue confronting the Congressional Black  Caucus is the nomination and confirmation of Jeff Sessions to be the  Attorney General of the United States. The members of this caucus,  since its inception, have fought for equality and justice, and we do it  because it is the right thing to do, and that is how we were raised.   Jeff Sessions' record is atrocious when it comes to equal rights,  equal protection, justice for all, and voting rights. At worst, he was  a coconspirator in the promotion of segregation and discrimination. At  best, he lacked the courage and motivation to fight for equality, equal  protection, and justice.   In the words of Maya Angelou: ``When someone shows you who they are  believe them. . . .'' President-elect Trump has shown us time and time  again exactly who he is through his words and his actions. His Cabinet  nominations offer further evidence of who he is and what he values.  Each of these individuals have shown us who they are as well.   Mr. Speaker, tonight you will hear from many passionate, educated,  experienced freedom fighters from our communities, and they will each  address their concerns with the nominations coming from the President- elect. We do it out of an obligation to continue to fight for the least  of those, those who cannot hire a lobbyist, those who are struggling to  make ends meet, those who wake up every day trying to figure out how to  put clothes on their kids' back, food on the table, a house, a roof  over their head, and to continue to fight for the American Dream,  opportunity for their children.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
