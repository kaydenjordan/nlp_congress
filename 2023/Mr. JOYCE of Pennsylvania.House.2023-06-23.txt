 Mr. Speaker, we gather today to remember  the life of a Pennsylvania State Trooper, Jacques Rougeau who was  killed in the line of duty on June 17 while serving at the Juniata  County Barracks in Pennsylvania's 13th Congressional District.   Trooper Rougeau leaves behind a loving wife, Chloe, and all of our  hearts go out to her, along with the rest of his family, his friends,  and the entire Pennsylvania State Troopers.   At this time, I ask that we also recognize Lieutenant Jim Wagner who  was injured in the line of duty on that same terrible day and remains  hospitalized.   Please join me in a moment of silence to honor the life of State  Trooper Jacques Rougeau and in prayer for the full recovery of  Lieutenant Jim Wagner.                            ____________________
