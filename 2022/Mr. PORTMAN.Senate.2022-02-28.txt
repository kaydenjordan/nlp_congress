 Madam President, this is the fourth time I have come to  the floor of the Senate in the past month to talk about the crisis in  Ukraine and to talk about what we can do here in the U.S. Congress to  try to help the great people of Ukraine.   Today, I come to the floor to express my solidarity with the  courageous people of Ukraine, who, as we speak, are under attack in  Kyiv and Kharkiv, and in so many other cities and towns throughout  Ukraine.   Russia's attack on Ukraine is a brutal, unprovoked invasion of a  democracy--an ally and a sovereign nation. It must not be allowed to  stand or it will create a precedent that unravels the international  order that has kept the peace in Europe for nearly 80 years.   Earlier today, Senator Durbin and I organized a meeting of the  Ukraine Caucus. We are the cochairs. We had Ambassador Markarova come,  who is the Ukrainian Ambassador to the United States. Along with her  came a member of the Rada, their Parliament, who happened to be in the  United States when the attack began. They spoke with emotion about  their country, about what they needed--Stinger missiles, Javelin  missiles--to be able to fight against superior Russian air power and  Russian tanks.   But they also spoke with compassion about the people of Ukraine,  about the sacrifice and the courage that they are showing. From the  woman who has never fought before who now has an AK-47 and is defending  her family in her apartment building to the President of the Republic,  President Zelenskyy, all of them are showing courage in defending their  homeland, their way of life, and democracy.   I also just left a briefing that was an opportunity to hear from the  Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, and other American  officials about what we are doing as a country and to give us an update  on their view as to what is happening in Ukraine.   Just as the conversation with Ambassador Markarova and a member of  the Rada was inspiring to hear about the courage and the resilience of  the people of Ukraine, the briefing with our American officials was  sobering.   It was encouraging to see America stand up to protect freedom; but  also, an understanding that the Russian forces outnumber those in  Ukraine--and certainly their equipment, technology, their planes, and  their tanks, and their ships are going to make this a very, very  difficult battle.   Thankfully, the world is rallying on this side of freedom. That is  encouraging and inspiring.   I was in Cleveland, OH, last night at a prayer vigil and then a  rally. Over 1,000 people showed up. Many were Ukrainian Americans who  live in Northeast Ohio--it is a strong community--but many were not.  Many were from other countries: Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Poland,  people who have family from Romania, Bulgaria, people from the entire  region--including some from Russia--but all standing firmly with the  people of Ukraine.   As was said last night at the prayer vigil: Tonight, we are all  Ukrainians. Tonight, we are all Ukrainians.   There were also demonstrations and rallies all around the country  yesterday. We are told over 40 cities had rallies to support Ukraine  and the people of Ukraine.   Last night, I heard stories about family members who are in harm's  way. Again, people with their voices choked with emotion were talking  about what is going on, what they are hearing from their family members  back in Ukraine. One guy who I know told me that his brother-in-law  back in Ukraine who, again, has never picked up a weapon before in his  life, has joined the military. He is probably about my age. He has  joined the military to put his life at risk for his country and for his  neighbors.   The people of Ukraine did nothing to cause this invasion--nothing.  Their only desire is to live in peace. As Ambassador Markarova said  this afternoon: Ukrainians never attack anybody. We just want to live  in peace. Allow us to determine our own fate, our own destiny.   That is what Vladimir Putin cannot abide, and that is what we in  America and the rest of the free world must support Ukrainians in  doing, to allow them to have the future that they choose through a duly  elected government. The freedoms and democracy and prosperity that we  take for granted so often in this country, they relish.   In 2014, at the Maidan, once again they threw off the shackles of a  Russian-backed government. They know what it is like to live under the  thumb of Russia, under the thumb of the Soviet Union before that. They  don't want to go back. In 2014, they made a conscious decision to go  forward, looking to the West, to stand with us.   I was there while the Maidan was still smoldering. The tires were  still smoldering. People were still there, gathered. Even though the  Russian-backed government had been removed, they still weren't sure  what would happen. Then an election occurred, a democratic election.  And a President was elected. And a parliament, a Rada, was elected. And  they began to fight for not just the freedom of Ukraine and the  democracy in Ukraine but the rule of law to get rid of some of the  oligarchical structure that Russia had left, the corruption. And now  this, after so much progress. Since 2014, they have fought and fought  and fought to be like us. And now this.   Hundreds of innocent Ukrainians--men, women, and children--have  already lost their lives in this invasion. Nobody knows the exact  number. But we saw footage today on CNN, on FOX, on the networks, of  apartment buildings that had been attacked by missiles. We heard from  the Ambassador that two five-story apartment buildings had been  attacked today, and women and children had lost their lives.   This humanitarian crisis, of course, is pouring refugees into other  countries as well. Hundreds of thousands of people have escaped to  Poland, mostly women and children. Romania is also taking its share of  refugees.   But make no mistake: Ukrainians are fighting. They are fighting back  bravely. And they have inflicted great costs already on their Russian  invaders.   I commend those brave Ukrainians and Armed Forces who picked up arms  against these great odds and have already denied President Putin his  initial objective and immediate occupation.   I want to particularly commend the brave leadership of Ukraine  President Vladimir Zelenskyy. His defiance in the face of evil is what  leads free countries and societies through difficult and dark days like  Ukraine is experiencing right now. When it was suggested to him that  the West would like to help him to find a way to escape, his response  this week was: ``I need ammunition, not a ride.'' ``I need ammunition,  not a ride.''   This has been a rallying cry not only for the people of Ukraine but  around the world. Unfortunately, Ukraine is used to this Russian  aggression. They have suffered already during an 8-year war on Ukraine  since 2014, since the Revolution of Dignity, since the events under  Maidan I talked about earlier. Fourteen thousand Ukrainian citizens  have lost their lives at the hands of Russian snipers, Russian  military, and artillery.   I have been to the front. They call it the line of contact. It is the  border now between Ukraine and these so-called occupied territories,  the Donbas. ``Line of contact'' is a euphemism. It makes it sound like  there are gloves touching at the contact. It is a line of war, and it  has been for 14 years. Again, 14,000 Ukrainians have lost their lives.   I had to wear the helmet and the flak jacket because there were  snipers that  [[Page S828]]  day taking pot shots at Ukrainian soldiers. But I saw with those  Ukrainian soldiers the patriotism, the nationalism that I knew would  lead them to fight; that the miscalculation by President Putin was  that, somehow, Russia would be greeted as victors. Some even said that  he thought he would be greeted with flowers. Instead, they are being  greeted with AK-47s. And having been there on the frontlines, you knew  this would happen. These Ukrainians are not going to give up their  country.   When President Putin decided to invade Ukraine in 2014 and seize  Crimea and come into the Donbas, it was clear that Russia was not a  rational actor but one motivated by the irrational dreams of recreating  an empire at all costs. The world warned Russia to stand down then, and  they refused. And the sanctions were too weak. This time, the world  again has warned Vladimir Putin to stand down. Instead, he has ordered  airstrikes into the capital city of Kyiv. Now there are reports of  Russian military deliberately striking hospitals, kindergartens, and  apartment complexes, as I talked about a moment ago.   These are war crimes, and the world is watching. I would say to  Russian officials tonight, Russian commanders, there is another way.  Stop this atrocity. The world is watching, and the war crimes are being  recorded. You can refuse these orders--and you must for the sake of  humanity. Why would you want to kill your neighbors in Ukraine who are  innocent and just want to have the opportunity to lead their life as  they see fit?   These are not just war crimes; they are a clear violation of Russia's  international commitments under the Budapest Memorandum, the Minsk  agreements, the U.N. Charter, international law--as was the decree  issued earlier in February, about 2 weeks ago, by President Putin,  which recognized the independence of parts of Ukraine, the Donetsk  People's Republic, the Luhansk People's Republic. He did so as a  pretext to ordering the Russian military to conduct so-called  peacekeeping missions in occupied Ukrainian territories.   We now see that this was one more case of disinformation. The lies  and disinformation will continue, as they did today. But they are  taking in fewer and fewer people because people can see what is  happening. This is the age of digital communications, where people can  see videos in realtime of the war crimes being committed.   I was among those advocating for tougher sanctions upfront,  preinvasion, believing that might dissuade Russia from launching a  full-scale assault. I cosponsored legislation to do just that and had  hoped Congress would pass bipartisan legislation mandating tough  financial sanctions, Nord Stream 2 sanctions, assistance to combat  cyber attacks, disinformation, in addition to advanced military aid.   I honestly don't know whether it would have kept Vladimir Putin from  making this terrible mistake, but I thought it was something we should  have done. We chose not to. And we are where we are. And now, we are  seeing not just the United States but the rest of the world step  forward with these tough sanctions.   And I congratulate the Biden administration for getting the rest of  the world on board, as they have. There is more to do. We have now  targeted Russian banks, Russian elites with sanctions, placed limits on  high-tech commerce and Russia's ability to do business in dollars. All  are welcome. In particular, the Treasury Department's imposition of  economic measures that target the core infrastructure of Russia and  more than 50 percent of the total banking system in Russia will have a  devastating economic effect over time. Already today, they closed down  their markets in Russia, their stock market. They are saying that  foreign reserve cannot leave the country. So it is already having an  impact.   In addition, the administration's announcement that they will sell  250 M1A2 battle tanks to Poland, I commend. I have been pushing for  that for some time. These are the best tanks in the world. And Poland  wanted them, and it is great we are now delivering those.   We have now deployed more U.S. troops to Germany and Eastern Europe  to enhance NATO defenses. That is necessary, in my view. We are not in  Ukraine but in the countries around Ukraine to ensure that, should  Vladimir Putin expand this war--and who knows whether he will or not-- he will meet even stiffer resistance from NATO.   We must make it part of a deliberate, coordinated strategy to enhance  the military readiness of our Eastern European allies and do so  quickly.   I also applaud the United States working with our European allies-- with Australia, with Canada, with South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, and  Singapore on a coordinated export control response. Combined, by the  way, these four Asian countries I named account for over 70 percent of  the world's semiconductor production. A ban on semiconductors, on  chips, would be very costly to Russia's ability to arm and resupply its  military. We must be sure this action comes to fruition. This must  happen.   However, these are just first steps, in my view. We can and should do  more. And I think there is a bipartisan consensus now here on Capitol  Hill to do just that. Let me offer a few more suggestions.   I welcome the news from this weekend that we are going to be joined  by a number of allies in sanctioning Russia's central bank and cutting  off a number of their institutions from the SWIFT financial system. We  are still seeing details of these plans. But as of now, it looks like  they still have some carve-outs in this plan for certain financial  institutions when it comes to SWIFT. I think it is a better idea to put  all of Russia's banks on this sanctioning list.   As for the central bank, I am glad we are getting global cooperation,  but who we really need to step up to the plate is China. I am told  China holds 14 percent of Russia's finances in reserves. China needs to  know that this is a decision point. Will they stand against this  tyranny that the global community is standing against or not?   I believe we should also target Russia's trade sector by revoking our  permanent normal trade relationship, or PNTR, with Russia. In other  words, the United States should no longer give Russia unrestricted  access in trade to our country. This would have the effect of raising  tariffs on goods from Russia to the rates at which they were before  Russia joined the World Trade Organization and received this special  status, PNTR, from the U.S. Congress.   When I was U.S. Trade Representative, I helped negotiate this  agreement, and it does give them certain privileges with regard to our  economy. Free trade with the United States is a privilege, not a right.  After Russia joined the WTO in 2012, Congress passed legislation to  expand trade between our countries by eliminating tariffs on some of  these imports. But as easily as we granted PNTR, Congress can take it  away. Invading a sovereign nation, a democracy no less, is certainly  grounds for us to take away that privilege. And we have the right to  undo it under the WTO rules for national security reasons.   It would not be unprecedented. In 1992, Congress revoked market  access for Serbia and Montenegro as a result of their aggression in the  wake of the breakup of Yugoslavia.   Today, I will be introducing bipartisan legislation to revoke  unrestricted market access for countries who invade their neighbors,  period. I call upon our trading partners to invoke their own national  security rights at the WTO and similarly take away market access  Russia, until this point, has enjoyed in their economies.   This should be ended, this market access, unless and until Ukraine's  territorial integrity and sovereignty are as they were prior to the  Russian invasion.   I was also glad to see the Germans have reversed their policy of not  allowing arms that were originally produced in Germany to be sent to  Ukraine. This is a big deal. They are now joining our other allies that  have sent weapons in the past and are sending more now.   Germany is allowing another ally, the Netherlands, to send rocket- propelled grenades. I have been critical of Germany. I have been  critical of Germany on this very floor--also, when I was at the Munich  conference in Germany last week. I wish they had taken these steps  sooner, but I commend them for taking these steps now.   We also need to increase shipments of lethal military arms to  Ukraine, to the  [[Page S829]]  Baltics, to Poland, Romania--as well as increasing defense spending  here at home. This weekend, the administration authorized an additional  $350 million in lethal defensive arms for Ukraine. That is a positive  development, and we need to get those weapons there immediately. I  understand that some have gone. Others have not. These Javelins and  Stingers and other military equipment need to be in Ukraine as soon as  possible. The Ambassador told me today they need them badly, and there  is absolutely no time to lose.   I understand the administration has also recently requested $6.4  billion in aid for Ukraine in an emergency supplemental. I don't know  if that is enough. With hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian refugees  fleeing to Poland and other countries supporting Ukraine, we need to  provide these allies with help to deal with this crisis.   I also want to take a hard look at the amount we are spending on  arming Ukraine and our allies. Now is the time to provide them with  what they need. An aid package should increase our lethal defensive  assistance, provide critical support to combat enhanced cyber attacks  against Ukraine and disinformation, and prepare for a refugee flow out  of Ukraine into Europe.   By the way, we also need to enhance our own tools against cyber  security right here in this country. Russia's cyber warfare against  America continues, and it could increase. There is legislation actually  on the floor this week to do just that, the Cyber Incident Reporting  for Critical Infrastructure Act and two other pieces of legislation,  FedRAMP and FISMA, our legislation to help protect our  critical infrastructure on the private sector side but also protect our  sensitive government information, national security data. So we can do  something this week by passing that legislation.    Finally, Ukraine and Georgia should be allowed to begin the process  to become part of NATO. You may remember it has been 14 years since  NATO told Ukraine and Georgia they were in line for NATO membership. It  was back in 2008.   I do not believe this invasion would have happened had Ukraine been  part of NATO, period. I was told when I promoted this idea over the  last several years that we couldn't do it because it would make Russia  mad. I don't know what the reason is now.   These two countries, Ukraine and Georgia, along perhaps with Sweden  and Finland, if they are interested--I understand the Finnish  Parliament is going to take this up tomorrow--could join the so-called  MAP process, or Mutual Action Plan, in NATO, laying out the specific  roadmap for entry. It is time to put Ukraine on that final track toward  NATO membership.   Let me remind everyone that Ukraine is not asking us to fight their  wars for them. In fact, the world continues to watch and see images of  Ukrainian forces and regular civilians picking up arms and defending  their homeland. They are just asking for enough help to defend  themselves.   This is about the fight for freedom, and it is taking place right now  at this time in the country of Ukraine. It is taking place in places  all around the world. I am told that today there is a move toward more  authoritarianism; that more people live under authoritarian regimes  than under democratic regimes, based on some analysis; that it is  shifting in the wrong direction.   Well, why then would we not stand by Ukraine? Because Ukraine is  moving in the right direction. In 2014, they moved from being under the  Russian thumb, authoritarianism, to democracy, and now Russia is trying  to reverse that. We must stand for freedom. Why? Because it is in our  interests.   Ultimately, we are the beacon of hope for opportunity for the rest of  the world because of our freedoms here, but they are tenuous, and they  depend on the allies around the world who also treasure freedom.   There are two quotes from two U.S. Presidents that come to mind. One  is from a Republican and one is from a Democrat. The Democrat is John  F. Kennedy. And these are words that he actually never spoke, but he  wrote them. And it was from a speech that he was meant to give on the  afternoon that he was assassinated in Dallas. He was to say, at this  time:         [I]n this country, in this generation, [we] are--by destiny       rather than choice--the watchmen on the walls of world       freedom.    We are the watchmen on the walls of world freedom.   Senator Kennedy served in this Chamber. President Kennedy was right.  Just as he stood up to the Cuban Missile Crisis, he understood that by  destiny rather than choice, it is up to us.   Ronald Reagan famously said that you get ``[p]eace through  [s]trength.''   To me, that is one of the great truisms of our last couple of decades  in this country; that we have to have a strong military if we want to  have peace because only by the projection of force can we ensure that  we can keep peace around the world.   He also said:         We know only too well that war comes not when the forces of       freedom are strong, but when they are weak. It is then that       tyrants are tempted.    Think of the situation in Ukraine. It is then that tyrants are  tempted.   There is strong bipartisan support now for Ukraine. And this week, we  should work hard to ensure that we pass this supplemental  appropriations bill we talked about that includes the assistance for  Ukraine but also to strengthen our ability to protect against cyber  attacks; also to do what we can in terms of trade--cutting off the  normal trade status with Russia, tightening up the sanctions on the  central bank we talked about.   There is so much more we can and should do. But I find there is no  lack of resolve right now from this Congress in its support for Ukraine  and their people--their people who are just choosing a democratic and  free future, free from tyranny.   The Ukrainian dream is now under attack by a brutal dictator who  wants to remake Europe and disrupt the international order that has  kept the peace for nearly 80 years. It is time for this Congress to  speak with one voice. Freedom in Eastern Europe depends upon it, but so  does global freedom and our freedom. Our allies and our adversaries are  watching.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Renee  Sheehy, a Postal IG detailee from my staff, be granted floor privileges  for the remainder of this Congress.
