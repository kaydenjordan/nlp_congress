 Mr. Speaker, despite their united control of Congress,  my Republican friends seem to think there is nothing they can do when  Donald Trump acts in a matter that is contrary to our laws and our  values. Here is what they have been saying:   Congressman Ryan Costello: There is nothing we can do to stop the  President, let alone this President, from saying what he thinks or what  he wants to say.   Speaker Ryan on immigration policy: The last thing I want to do is  bring a bill out here that I know the President won't support.   Lastly, again, Speaker Ryan: Every morning I wake up in my office and  [[Page H7712]]  scroll through Twitter to see which tweets that I will have to pretend  I didn't see later on.    I yield to the gentleman.    But, Ted, did you know that there are actually concrete  steps the majority party can take to exercise its power over the  administration and hold it accountable for its actions?    That is right. When the U.S. Constitution was drafted in  1787, it included checks and balances that allow the legislative  branch, us, to oversee the executive branch, the President. It is part  of what makes our Nation great.    That is a great question. Maybe our friends in the  majority have forgotten how to use their power.    Great idea. So, let's start with a new class that we  call Welcome to Congressional Oversight 101 or, as I like to call it,  Congress for Dummies.    Isn't that hard?    What are some of the issues that Congress can pass  legislation on, Ted?    Ted, for example, could we actually be protecting the  Special Counsel from being fired by the President?    I believe there is an actual bill that has been  introduced, specifically, that Ryan could actually bring to the floor,  to protect the Special Counsel and not just talk about protecting the  Special Counsel.    So why hasn't Speaker Ryan or the Republicans actually  passed this bill?    We certainly have brought this up, and we will continue  to be pushing this bill until it comes to the floor.   Let's move on to lesson 2.    It is important to remember the congressional committee  chairman gets to decide what topics they hold hearings on.   So are you telling me the Judiciary Committee chairman is more  interested in Hillary Clinton's emails from 2015 or maybe 2016 than  currently dealing with attacks on our democracy from Russia, from  Putin, or trying to figure out how we have basically abandoned and  orphaned 2,600 families at the border?    So let's move on.   What is the third thing that we could be doing as Congress to  actually put the executive in check, Ted?    Subpoenas. What is a subpoena?   You are a former Federal prosecutor. Please enlighten us, since  somehow this Congress has forgotten that we could do subpoenas.    I don't know if you know this, Ted, but there is this  neat little House rule called House rule XI, clause 2. Have you heard  of this?    It is not. It is very simple. This clause allows House  committees to issue subpoenas, which are legal documents that force  somebody to do something, in this case either testify or give Congress  documents.    Or we could do something really crazy and subpoena all  the many administration officials and department heads who have gotten  rich and richer by exploiting their public offices for private gain.    Lesson number 4, requesting investigations.    Every committee has jurisdiction over a set of agencies.  Those agencies each have something called an inspector general. These  officials are responsible for investigating waste, fraud, and abuse at  each agency and reporting back to Congress.    Well, Ted, Congress can actually request an inspector  general report.    Exactly.    So what have we learned today?   Unfortunately, we have learned that our Republican colleagues are  unwilling or afraid, either-or, to use their power vested in them by  the Constitution on behalf of the American people to keep the executive  in check.                                time  1245     It is shameful that we are going on recess right now  while we know that there are foreign adversaries targeting our  elections, targeting our elected officials; we have a President that we  cannot get straight answers out of, and this Republican-led Congress  refuses to act.   So maybe it is time to turn control of this Chamber over to Members  who are willing to hold this administration accountable.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
