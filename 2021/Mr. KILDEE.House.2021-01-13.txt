 Madam Speaker, 1 week ago, the President of the United  States incited a deadly attack on the United States Capitol, while a  couple of dozen Members of this House and I covered ourselves in that  Gallery, away from the Trump mob. Five dead, including Capitol Police.  If inciting an insurrection does not warrant impeachment, nothing does.   I took an oath to uphold the Constitution against all enemies,  foreign and domestic.    Today, I uphold my oath.
