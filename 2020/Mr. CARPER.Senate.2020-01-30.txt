 Mr. Chief Justice, on behalf of our colleagues Senators  Booker, Cardin, Kaine, Markey, Menendez, Merkley, Murphy, and Shaheen,  I send a question to the desk for the House managers.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you.   The question from Senator Carper and the other Senators addressed to  the House managers:         The President's aides and defenders have claimed that it is       ``normal'' or ``usual'' to use U.S. foreign assistance as the       President did to achieve a desired outcome. How was the       President's act in withholding U.S. security assistance to       Ukraine different from how the U.S. uses foreign assistance       to achieve foreign policy goals and national security       objectives, and how should we evaluate the defense argument       that this is what is ``done all the time''?    Mr. Manager CROW. Mr. Chief Justice, Senators, thank you for the  question.   So to understand the answer to this, you don't have to look inside  the President's mind. You just have to look at recent history and then  what was done last year.   As I talked about earlier, and even yesterday, other Presidents have  held holds in aid for legitimate reasons, even this President. We  concede that. But there are a variety of legitimate policy reasons for  holding aid, whether it be corruption or burden-sharing.   See, even in the President's other holds--like Afghanistan, because  of concerns about terrorism, or Central America, because of immigration  concerns--even though some might disagree with that, that is a  legitimate policy debate.   The difference here is that every witness testified--these 17  witnesses that you hear about testified--that there was no reason  provided for the implementation of this hold. Right?   I talked about earlier how there is a process for doing this. Right?  There is a well-prescribed process for allocating the funds, like we  all did here in this Chamber and 87 of you agreed on it, and then an  interagency process to review it to make sure that it meets the  standards and criteria outlined by this body, anticorruption reforms.  And that was done in this case. That interagency process was followed.  That certification was made. The notification to Congress was  conducted. The train had left the station, just like the train had left  the station in 2018, in 2017, in 2016. And every element of the  agencies and the bureaucracy involved in that process in prior years  had been engaged and had signed off, except this year.   In 2019, rather, that all changed. A hold was implemented for no  known reason. There was no notification given to Congress, which  violated the Impoundment Control Act. DOD, Department of State,  Secretary Esper, Secretary Pompeo, even Vice President Pence, and the  entire National Security Council implored the President to release the  aid because it not only had met all of the certifications but it was in  the U.S. national interest and consistent with U.S. policy.   And yet, nobody knew why it happened, and, to this day, the  individual who could shed light on this, Mr. Bolton, is  being prohibited from coming forward to explain why the President told  him it happened.    So, yes, it is still a good time to subpoena Ambassador Bolton and  get that information.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, Mr. Manager.   The Senator from North Carolina.
