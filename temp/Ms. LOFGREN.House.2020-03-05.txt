 Mr. Speaker, it is my great honor to note that Father  Kevin O'Brien of the Society of Jesus was our guest this morning to  deliver this morning's opening prayer for this House.   Father O'Brien joined our Silicon Valley community 4 years ago, and  just last year he was named president of Santa Clara University. As an  alum of Santa Clara University Law School myself, I am glad to see  Father O'Brien focusing his presidency on college affordability and  access, as well as fostering a culture of respect on campus.   Now a religious leader in Silicon Valley, Father O'Brien speaks of  how disruption can lift people up instead of dividing people. Father  O'Brien is dedicated to serving something larger than himself, which is  a trait we deeply admire and value as Americans.   I am personally grateful to him for the leadership he has shown to  standing up for Dreamers and those who are vulnerable in our community  and across America.   It is my pleasure to welcome Father O'Brien to our Nation's Capital  today and to thank him for his service to our community, our country,  and to the University of Santa Clara.                            ____________________
