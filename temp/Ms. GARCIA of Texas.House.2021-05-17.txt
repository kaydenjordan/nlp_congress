 Madam Speaker, I rise today to express my strong  support for Israel's right to defend itself against rocket attacks from  Hamas and other terrorist groups in Gaza.   These attacks against Israel must be condemned. I applaud President  Biden for actively engaging across the region to help bring about peace  through diplomacy. Further conflict will certainly claim the lives of  Israeli and Palestinian civilians, including children, and that is  unacceptable.   As a Latina and a Catholic, it is my sincere prayer that Jerusalem  will be a city of peace for all faiths, all nationalities, and all  backgrounds. This lasting peace will only be possible if everyone,  Palestinians and Israelis alike, have the opportunity for freedom and  security promised by a two-state solution.   Those who plan for peace will have joy. Let it be so.                            ____________________
