 Madam Speaker, I thank our illustrious chair for her  great work.   Madam Speaker, later today, the Energy and Water bill will include  significant funding for a critical bipartisan environmental issue in my  home State of Florida.   Known as the River of Grass, the Everglades is a 100-mile-long  natural region of tropical wetlands that is the main source of water  for millions of Floridians and visitors. It contains one of Florida's  and America's most popular national parks. It is home to hundreds of  animal species.   The State of Florida and the Federal Government are engaged in a  long-term undertaking to restore its natural flow and improve water  quality. This bill, Madam Speaker, includes $200 million for Everglades  restoration, the largest allocation ever by the Federal Government for  this project. It will help protect south Florida's magnificent  ecosystem, keep our water safe, and drive our economy.
