 Mr. Speaker, I am pleased today to speak on Mr. Tipton's  bill, the TAILOR Act.   But first I would note, as always, in participating in these kind of  debates, any time you have a discussion led by Chairman Hensarling and  by Ranking Member Waters, it is always an exciting, stimulating debate,  and the intensity and the focus is always there.   But, today, we are focused on what I think is a very important piece  of legislation because too often we think of financial institutions as  the big guys, the truly massive entities. The truth is, however, that  institutions that accept deposits from Americans come in all shapes and  sizes. Thus, it is important that the regulators consider those many  shapes and sizes when requiring compliance. The TAILOR Act would  require that consideration by regulators.   My colleagues have already discussed that this provision has passed  the House and is supported by the administration, as well as several  industry groups. But I will note that for anyone in this body who  represents a rural area, I guarantee banks and credit unions in your  district are devoting a large portion of their budget to compliance.  That is money that could easily go toward providing credit to the many  Americans who need it.   Shouldn't the regulators consider the small institutions when forming  these regulations?   This bill will free up some ability for those institutions to lend  money to typical Americans and local businesses. I know my district  would see the benefits of this bill, and I would guess that many  districts nationwide would also benefit in the same ways.   I want to thank the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Tipton) for working  so diligently on this bill and bringing it through the committee  process, bringing it to the floor today, and giving us the opportunity  to vote for it. I urge that vote. I advocate support.
