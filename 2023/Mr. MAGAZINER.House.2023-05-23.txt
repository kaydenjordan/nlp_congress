 Mr. Speaker, there are a number of Members who have  come to express their gratitude to Congressman Cicilline.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Pelosi),  the Speaker Emerita.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from  Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro).    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to the time remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to Mr. Takano.    I yield to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Neguse).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Wisconsin  (Mr. Pocan).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Connecticut  (Mr. Larson).    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  on the topic of this Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the  distinguished congressional career of one of Rhode Island's finest  public servants and my good friend, Congressman   David Cicilline, who  will be retiring from the House this week.   A born and raised Rhode Islander from a proud Italian and Jewish  family, David served as a State representative before making history  being elected as the first openly gay American to be mayor of a major  city.   In his two terms as mayor of Providence, David restored ethics and  vitality to city hall, and he was then elected to represent the First  Congressional District in 2010.   For over a decade, David has served the people of Rhode Island with  honor, courage, and decency in the House of Representatives. Through  his work on the House Judiciary Committee, Representative Cicilline has  become a nationally recognized leader in the fights to prevent gun  violence and enforce antitrust laws to protect working Americans.   As chair of the Congressional Equality Caucus, David has helped lead  the charge for LGBTQ+ rights. David also served ably on the House  Foreign Affairs Committee, chairing the Middle East, North Africa and  Global Counterterrorism Subcommittee in the last Congress and he served  multiple leadership roles in the House Democratic Caucus.   Our Nation will always be indebted to   David Cicilline for his role  in holding former President Trump accountable for inciting the deadly  assault on the United States Capitol on January 6, 2021. David cowrote  the Articles of Impeachment as the attack was still in progress and  ably served as a House impeachment manager.   I know I speak for many of my colleagues when I say how much I will  miss David's energy and intellect in the House, but David's lifetime of  service is not yet complete. Come June, he will be taking on his new  role as president and CEO of the Rhode Island Foundation, one of the  Nation's foremost community foundations.   I look forward to working with him in his new role, and I join all of  Rhode Island in thanking him for his many years of dedicated public  service to our State.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 6 o'clock and 37 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Wednesday, May 24, 2023, at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
