 Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize an  individual who serves as a voice for Pennsylvania agriculture.   Dave Williams of Honesdale, Pennsylvania, has been a key voice in  agriculture for more than 20 years. A farmer himself, Mr. Williams  never expected to air on nearly 30 radio stations, three networks, and  weekly on PCN-TV.   This weekend, Dave will kick off his 25th year broadcasting from the  Pennsylvania Farm Show, the largest indoor agricultural expo in the  country.  [[Page H96]]    Dave got his start on Wayne County's oldest AM station reaching just  10,000 listeners. Today, he reaches nearly 6 million people a week on  both radio and television.   Mr. Speaker, Dave continues to be an important voice for  Pennsylvania's number one industry and uses his platform to advocate  for agriculture. His role allows him to highlight the important work of  our farmers, ranchers, and producers who supply this Nation and the  world with our food and our fiber.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Dave for being the voice of Pennsylvania  agriculture.                            ____________________
