 Mr. Speaker, 26 souls, including 20 babies massacred at  Sandy Hook Elementary School.   Parkland, Buffalo, Uvalde; the common denominator, an AR-15-style  assault weapon, the weapon of choice.   Eight of the 10 deadliest mass shootings involved an assault weapon.  We cannot be numb to this needless violence. It is long past time for  us to act.   In Connecticut, the tragedy at Sandy Hook changed our lives forever.  These are unspeakable tragedies. They are avoidable tragedies; and they  are happening in our schools, our grocery stores, our places of  worship.   The legislation before us today will reduce the prevalence of assault  weapons, ban the purchase of assault weapons, get them off of our  streets, make our communities safer, protect our children, save their  lives.   Is that not the noblest of goals, to save lives? We have the  opportunity to do that in this body today. Enough is enough.
