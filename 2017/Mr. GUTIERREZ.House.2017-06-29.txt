 Mr. Speaker, ever since Donald Trump descended the  golden escalators at Trump Tower to announce his candidacy by saying  Mexican immigrants are rapists, murderers, and drug dealers, the  Republican Party has had Mexican fever, and they have been working  feverishly to paint immigrants all as criminals. And when something  goes bad, they go back to their old favorite.   When Trump's Muslim ban was blocked in the courts, out came the  Attorney General to say they were doing everything they could to do  more roundups and that no immigrant was safe in America.   The Russia investigation not going well for the dear leader at the  White House? Hey, let's whip out that Mexican thing, as Vice-President  Pence said. Maybe it will keep our voters happy and distracted.   Healthcare not going well? Let's just hate some Mexicans today.   Listen, almost 8 out of 10 Latinos in the United States are citizens,  1 out of 10 are legal permanent residents. That leaves 1 in 10 who are  undocumented, but this policy is about going after all of us, whether  we are citizens or not of the United States of America.   These bills are nothing new, and they are not really about fighting  crime. They are about racial profiling and putting Latinos ``in their  place.'' Latinos, African Americans, Muslims, women, they know what it  is like to be targeted.   Ninety-nine percent of the votes for this bill today will come from  people who do not have to worry about racial profiling for themselves,  for their children, or the people who they represent, but let's be  clear. Sheriff Joe Arpaio in Arizona is the poster child for the kinds  of policies the Republicans want to impose on every city and county in  the country, and we know the results.   Sheriff Arpaio embodies racial profiling and rounding up people  because they are brown. Oh, we will sort out their papers later, he  says, whether they are citizens or legal permanent residents or  whatever.   I have talked to U.S. citizens who were detained by Sheriff Arpaio  because they didn't carry with them their birth certificate or a  passport at all times in the country in which they were born.   Let's be clear. Sheriff Arpaio has been sued successfully to stop his  racial profiling, and he has been charged criminally in Federal court  for his racial profiling tactics, and still the Republicans of the  House want to make  [[Page H5321]]  the law he is being sued for legal in the United States of America.   Sometimes Democrats have to stand up for justice, for what is right  when the chips are down. Well, the chips are down, and every immigrant  family and every immigrant in America is going to remember who stood up  for them when they needed Democrats to fight to keep families together  when the chips were down.    Mr. Speaker, for almost 100 percent of the people who  would go to jail if this bill is enacted, they are not criminals and  have no brush with the law. They were people who lived here for years,  who had no chance of coming legally in the first place, and no way to  get legal once they were here. Most have lived here for 10, 20, 30  years. They live in families with children, and their children are  citizens of the United States just like you and me and our children.  They have mortgages and car notes.   The problems these moms and dads are trying to solve is if they get  deported, how do I make sure my kids are safe in the country in which  they were born, the United States? How do I keep a roof over their head  and get them ready for school? How do I keep my business open or my  career continuing in the U.S. where I have lived, in some cases, for  decades?   That is the problem they have, and guess what, they come back after  they are deported. That person, to me, is not a felon, never committed  a crime. That person is not a hardened criminal, never killed anyone.                                time  1615    That is a parent fighting for their family.   So in painting a picture of all immigrants as resembling a career  criminal, like the guy who killed Kate Steinle, Republicans are doing  the old bait and switch.   The people we are hitting with this bill come back to the lives they  have built over decades by the only means we have made available, and  now we are going to add a felony and 15 years to that.   Let's give moms and dads different alternatives. The people who would  go to jail if this bill were enacted would rather have come with a  visa. They would get in line for hours to get legal if there were a  line to get in, but there isn't, and most Americans believe we should  create such a line for them. They would come back legally if they  could, but they can't.   We should be looking at how to solve that problem. We should be  looking at ways to eliminate illegal immigration, and stop hoping that  our strategy of the last 30 years of deportation, more restriction, and  more criminalization would somehow miraculously start working.   It hasn't. It won't. It is time for us to enact comprehensive  immigration reform in the Congress and to fulfill our responsibility to  the Nation.   Look, the question today isn't whether or not this bill is going to  pass. It is going to pass. The Republicans are making it a primary  purpose.   The question really, for me, is: Are Democrats going to participate?  Are Democrats going to participate in allowing this to pass?   I have just got to say that I know it is difficult.   Some people say: Well, I might not come back.   It will be difficult. My constituents demand this.   Well, let me just say that when I was elected in 1986 to the Chicago  City Council, I was there but a month and they had the human rights  bill for the gay and lesbian community. I remember the banner  headlines: ``Cardinal Says `No.' ''   Here I was a Catholic all my life, an altar boy, had three of the  seven Catholic rites: communion, baptism, and marriage. Ten years  later, I got to the Congress and was confronted here with the Defense  of Marriage Act. We passed it. There were only about 70 of us who voted  against it.   But guess what. Thirty years after I took that vote for gay rights in  the Chicago City Council, the Supreme Court said that marriage equality  was the law of the land and discriminating against them was against the  Constitution of the United States of America.   That is the way you create social justice, not by doing a poll and  not by trying to figure out what the next election consequences are  going to be.   I say to my Democratic colleagues: Stand up for social justice today.   It wasn't easy as a Democrat to stand up for reproductive rights for  women. I remember going to church and I remember being chastised by the  priest. I remember being booed by some of the congregants as I left  that church. But I stood up for what I believe are women's rights. My  children were chased down the street during Halloween by pro-choice  people who said I didn't deserve to be trick-or-treating with my  children, that I was a bad father and I was a murderer. We stood up,  and women have rights in this country.   That is the way we do that, Democrats. We stand up for what is right.  We don't take a poll, and we don't think of the next election. We do  what is right.   The immigrant community is looking for champions today, and it is my  hope that, as Democrats, we, too, will stand up. When hate visits you,  you need to repudiate it. You need to repudiate it because that hate  might visit you in some personal way and it might cause you to hate  yourself ultimately.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a statement in opposition to the  bill from the Tahirih Justice Center.                                         Tahirih Justice Center,                                    Falls Church, VA, June 27, 2017.                  Statement of the Tahirih Justice Center       Opposing the ``No Sanctuary for Criminals Act'' (H.R. 3003) and                         ``Kate's Law'' (H.R. 3004)         The Tahirih Justice Center (``Tahirih'') respectfully       submits this statement to the United States House of       Representatives as it considers ``The No Sanctuary for       Criminals Act'' (H.R. 3003; ``The Act'') and ``Kate's Law''       (H.R. 3004). The House Rules Committee is set to review these       bills today, followed by the full House in the near future.       Tahirih is a national, nonpartisan organization that has       assisted over 20,000 immigrant survivors of gender-based       violence over the past 20 years. Our clients include women       and girls who have endured horrific abuses such as rape and       human trafficking and are in dire need of humanitarian       relief.        Tahirih urges members of Congress to oppose H.R. 3003 and       3004: By further entangling federal and local immigration       enforcement, H.R. 3003 will not only put survivors of human       trafficking and domestic violence at greater risk of criminal       harm, but will embolden violent criminals who pose a danger       to us all. H.R. 3004 will unjustly punish asylum seekers who       sought safe haven in the U.S., but were improperly denied       access to the asylum process the first time around.        H.R. 3003: The No Sanctuary for Criminals Act: The Act       seeks to erase the distinction between federal and local       immigration enforcement. Such measures erode immigrant       community trust of police, who rely on victims and witnesses       to help get dangerous criminals off the streets. When       immigrants know they can call 911 without fear of       deportation, it is perpetrators--not victims or their       children--that are deterred and punished. Abusers and       traffickers deliberately manipulate and isolate victims to       limit their access to information about their legal rights.       Despite longstanding protections under the Violence Against       Women Act, even victims who hold lawful immigration status       succumb to intimidation, and remain afraid of deportation if       they come forward. For some survivors, deportation means       sentencing a US citizen child to the custody of a violent       abuser. Following the recent passage of a state law to       increase local immigration enforcement, a client aptly noted,       ``This is exactly what [my abuser] has been waiting for.'' We       are all less safe when we make it easier for perpetrators to       commit crimes.        The Act will also increase prolonged detention of       survivors, resulting in further traumatization, separation       from young children, and limited access to legal assistance       and due process. The Act also punishes localities that refuse       to comply, by revoking critical funding for core programs       that address gun violence, gang violence, and other criminal       activity. When local agencies must ``choose'' between       continuing these programs and compromising community trust,       it is the public that pays the steepest price.        H.R. 3004: Kate's Law: Tahirih and other advocates       routinely assist clients whose initial requests for asylum at       the border are met with hostility, intimidation, and       coercion. These individuals are unlawfully denied access to       the asylum process by U.S. officials. With their lives in       grave danger, women and girls in this situation have no       choice but to request safe haven in the U.S. a second or even       third time. They are not asking to appeal denial of their       claims; rather, they are merely seeking a threshold       determination that they may apply for asylum or related       protections. Our domestic laws and international humanitarian       obligations require that they have this opportunity. H.R.       3004 will punish women fleeing horrific abuse who persist in       their quest for asylum by limiting their ability to challenge       initial, unlawful removals, and by unnecessarily and unjustly       subjecting them to criminal prosecution.        We appreciate the opportunity to offer this statement in       opposition to H.R. 3003 and 3004, and we urge Congress to       unequivocally reject these harmful bills that undermine the       safety of survivors of gender-based violence.

[[Page H5348]]                                                Human Rights First,                                                      June 28, 2017.      Re H.R. 3004--115th Congress (2017-2018).       Hon. Paul D. Ryan,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: We write to urge you to oppose H.R.       3004 (``Kate's Law'') and any similar legislation that would       have severely negative consequences for asylum seekers and       refugees fleeing persecution.        H.R. 3004 seeks to expand the scope of immigrants who may       be prosecuted for unlawful reentry and further expands       penalties for those who are convicted. But the criminal       prosecution of asylum seekers for offenses such as illegal       entry, illegal reentry, and document fraud violates U.S.       treaty obligations and risks sending genuine refugees back to       their countries of persecution.        For one, many asylum seekers are forced to ``reenter'' the       United States because they were wrongfully deported in the       first place through the expedited removal system. The U.S.       Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF), as       well as Human Rights First and other groups, has long       documented deficiencies and flaws in the implementation of       the expedited removal process, a summary process which gives       immigration officers the authority to order non-citizens       deported without a hearing. In its 2005 report on expedited       removal, USCIRF found that in a significant number of cases,       border agents failed to follow U.S. law and refer asylum       seekers to the ``credible fear'' process, even when USCIRF       researchers were present during the secondary inspection       process.        Even when border agents make the proper referral for a       credible fear screening, asylum seekers are often traumatized       and exhausted by their experiences in their home countries,       their flight to the United States, and their arrest by U.S.       authorities. They are often interviewed by telephone by an       officer they cannot see and are at the mercy of       interpretation problems and other arbitrary factors that       hinder communication. As a result, some may incorrectly be       found to not have a credible fear, and may be deported as a       result. These asylum seekers must then ``reenter'' the United       States after facing continuing persecution in their home       countries to seek protection yet again.        Moreover, H.R. 3004 would redefine ``reentry'' to encompass       an even broader group of individuals, as it will define       reentry as including cases of individuals who had been       previously denied admission. Human Rights First release a       report in May 2017, titled Crossing the Line, which documents       cases of asylum seekers who have been turned back at U.S.       ports of entry, despite stating to border agents that they       had a fear of persecution or intended to seek asylum. While       DHS officials have acknowledged that border agents should be       following U.S. law and referring asylum seekers to the asylum       process, Human Rights First and other groups have found that       this practice continues. H.R. 3004 seeks to penalize an       overly broad group of individuals that would even include       those who were wrongfully turned away from our ports of entry       in violation of U.S. law.        Secondly, prosecuting asylum seekers for their illegal       entry or presence--even in the case of ``reentry''--is a       violation of U.S. treaty obligations under the Convention and       Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees. Article 31 of       the Refugee Convention requires that states refrain from       imposing ``penalties'' on refugees on account of their       illegal entry or presence in the country where they are       seeking asylum. For this reason, in 2015, the U.S. Department       of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General found that       prosecutions under ``Operation Streamline'' may place the       United States in violation of its treaty obligations.        If Congress passes H.R. 3004, more asylum seekers like       Maria will be subjected to wrongful criminal prosecutions.        ``Maria,'' a transgender woman from Honduras, who had been       raped and subjected to other sexual violence, fled to the       United States in 2014. U.S. immigration officials failed to       respond to her requests for asylum and she was deported back       to Honduras through expedited removal without ever seeing an       immigration judge or having her fear of persecution assessed       by an asylum officer. Facing ongoing persecution in Honduras,       she fled to the United States again in 2015, and was       apprehended upon entry. U.S. border agents referred her for       criminal prosecution and she was convicted of illegal       reentry. After she was transferred back to immigration       custody, she was determined to be a ``refugee'' who qualified       for withholding of removal. Yet, the United States had       already penalized her for ``illegal entry'' despite being a       refugee.        Please contact Olga Byrne at Human Rights First if you have       any questions regarding this letter. Thank you for your time       and consideration.            Sincerely,                                                      Eleanor Acer,                               Senior Director, Refugee Protection.     Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter opposing  the bill from Cities for Action.                                              Cities for Action,                                                      June 28, 2017.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker of the House, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Members of Congress: Cities for Action (C4A) is a       coalition of over 150 mayors and municipal leaders that       advocates for policies to promote the well-being of our       foreign born residents. Our coalition, representing over 50       million residents, has a considerable interest in protecting       all our residents and ensuring that immigrants are not       unjustly criminalized. We are writing to you today to urge       that you oppose Representative Goodlatte's bill, H.R. 3004,       Kate's Law.        Kate's Law expands already tough penalties for illegal       reentry and allows the government to detain immigrants       indefinitely without bond or a court hearing. It also       mistakenly implies that illegal reentry cases are under-      enforced. Indeed, illegal reentry prosecutions already       account for 52 percent of all federal prosecutions. H.R. 3004       would make the criminal sentences for reentry extremely       harsh. Additionally, it would impose severe sentencing       enhancements on people with minor offenses who reenter the       country.        H.R. 3004 would also limit the ability to challenge the       validity of any prior removal order that forms the basis for       a prosecution for illegal reentry, subjecting people to       prosecution even in cases where the prior order was issued       without due process or was otherwise flawed. In addition, the       bill does not provide adequate protections for people who       reenter the United States for humanitarian reasons or those       who seek protection at the border, putting asylum seekers and       families at risk.        Cities and counties are opposed to this bill because these       measures do not improve public safety and it is based on a       false premise that immigrants pose a threat to our       communities. Local governments have a strong interest in       protecting all residents and maintaining public safety.       Therefore, we urge you to oppose Kate's Law and stop its       passage into law at every possible turn.        Thank you for your time and consideration in this matter,                                                 Cities for Action.     Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter opposing  the bill from the Committee on Migration of the U.S. Conference of  Catholic Bishops and the Catholic Charities USA.                                                      June 26, 2017.        Dear Representative: We write on behalf of the Committee on       Migration of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB/      COM), and Catholic Charities USA (CCUSA) to express our       opposition to H.R. 3003 and H.R. 3004.        The Catholic Church holds a strong interest in the welfare       of migrants and how our nation welcomes and treats them. Our       parishes include those with and without immigration status,       unfortunately some who have witnessed or been victims of       crime in the United States, including domestic violence,       armed robbery, and assault. We understand the importance of       fostering cooperation and information-sharing between       immigrant communities and local law enforcement.        We oppose H.R. 3003 because it would impose obligations on       local governments that we fear--and that many of them have       warned--would undermine authority and discretion of local law       enforcement. This, in turn, would hamper the ability of local       law enforcement officials to apprehend criminals and ensure       public safety in all communities.        Furthermore, Section 2 of H.R. 3003 would deny to       jurisdictions vital federal funding related to law       enforcement, terrorism, national security, immigration, and       naturalization if those jurisdictions are deemed to be non-      compliant with H.R. 3003. The Catholic service network,       including Catholic Charities, works in partnership with the       federal government on a number of Department of Justice and       Department of Homeland Security initiatives, including       disaster response and recovery, naturalization and       citizenship services, and services for the immigrant,       including victims of human trafficking, and domestic       violence. These services are incredibly valuable to the       protection and promotion of the human person and in some       instances life-saving. Cutting grants related to these       important national objectives, or threat of such cuts, is not       humane or just, nor is it in our national interest.        Also, we oppose H.R. 3004 as it would lead to an expansion       of incarceration and does not include adequate protections       for people who re-enter the U.S. for humanitarian reasons or       seek protection at the border. While H.R. 3004 makes notable       efforts to protect us from those convicted of violent       criminal offenses, the legislation goes far beyond this goal       by expanding the government's ability to prosecute illegal       re-entry cases and heightening the criminal penalties in       these cases. In an era of fiscal austerity, it is vital that       important judicial resources are efficiently utilized to       prosecute and convict the most violent offenders of violent       crimes. Expanding who is eligible to be prosecuted for entry       or re-entry as well as enhancing sentencing requirements does       not advance the common good nor will it ensure that       communities are safer. Furthermore, we are concerned that, as       introduced, H.R. 3004 would also prevent vulnerable asylum       seekers and unaccompanied children, (who have presented       themselves repeatedly at the U.S. border in the flight from       violence), from being able to access protection, and instead       face fines, imprisonment or both.  [[Page H5349]]         We respectfully urge you to reject these bills in favor of       a more comprehensive and humane approach to immigration       reform; an approach that upholds human dignity and family       unity and places a greater emphasis on balancing the needs       and rights of immigrants with our nation's best interests and       security.        The United States has a long and proud history of       leadership in welcoming newcomers regardless of their       circumstances and promoting the common good. We stand ready       to work with you on legislation that more closely adheres to       this tradition and appreciate your serious consideration of       our views in this regard.            Sincerely,      Most Rev. Joe Vasquez,        Bishop of Austin, Chairman, USCCB Committee on Migration.      Sr. Donna Markham, OP, PhD,        President & CEO, Catholic Charities USA.     Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter opposing  the bill from Friends Committee on National Legislation: A Quaker Lobby  in the Public Interest.                                                Friends Committee on                                            National Legislation,                                                      June 27, 2017.   Friends Committee on National Legislation Statement in Opposition to    the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act (H.R. 3003) and Kate's Law (H.R.                                   3004)         The Friends Committee on National Legislation (FCNL) is a       Quaker lobby in the public interest committed to pursuing       policies that build just societies, peaceful communities, and       equitable relationships among all people. FCNL looks to       Congress to legislate on immigration in a manner that honors       the value of immigrants and American citizens alike and urges       congressional representatives to reject any legislation which       would undermine immigrant families and communities. Congress       is tasked with creating lasting solutions for our nation.       FCNL therefore urges members of Congress to oppose H.R. 3003       and H.R. 3004 which together further criminalize immigrants,       expand detention, undermine community well-being, and offer       no legislative remedy for a punitive and outdated immigration       system.        H.R. 3003 is an extreme interior enforcement proposal that       would affect over 600 cities, counties, and states and raises       serious fourth and tenth amendment concerns. Effective       policing depends on building authentic trust between police       officers and the communities they serve; blurring the lines       between federal immigration enforcement and local police       results in fewer reported crimes and makes communities with       large immigrant populations more vulnerable. Perpetrators of       crime, assault, and abuse know that these communities are       less likely to report the crime if they legitimately fear it       will result in the deportation or detention of an immigrant       neighbor, a loved one, or themselves. Law enforcement       officials and advocates for survivors of domestic violence       agree that the proposals included in this bill would be       damaging for the communities they serve. FCNL heeds this call       to ensure safety for the most vulnerable among us, and urges       members of Congress to oppose H.R. 3003.        H.R. 3004 would expand grounds for indefinite detention and       decrease legal opportunities for certain migrants challenging       their removal. Our call as Quakers to welcome the stranger       does not rest on the legal status of any individual.       Criminalizing entire immigrant communities based on the       senseless actions of a few individuals tears at the moral       fabric of our society and will not make our communities       safer. H.R. 3004 could prevent migrants from adequately       accessing asylum and would increase family hardship through       separation by offering no meaningful opportunity for family       members to pursue a legal route when seeking reunification       across borders. These provisions will only fuel the       brokenness of our system, which is already heavy-handed on       indefinite detention and dangerous deportations at great       expense to U.S. taxpayers and our collective moral       conscience. Thousands of faith leaders have urged members of       Congress to reject similar proposals in the past and live up       to our call to minister to all those in need, especially       those who have been marginalized. In keeping, FCNL urges       members of Congress to oppose H.R. 3004.        FCNL looks instead for legislation that proceeds from a       recognition of the inherent worth of all individuals, as       acknowledged in our Quaker faith, as well as in our shared       Constitution, laws, and American values. We call on Congress       to reform the U.S. immigration system so that it is in line       with the Quaker principle to answer to that of God in       everyone and ensures we live up to our legacy as a country       that thrives because we are a nation of diverse peoples and       immigrants. Congress has the opportunity to enact practical       solutions for comprehensive reform that includes clear and       workable processes for legal entry and eventual citizenship.       FCNL is eager to partner on such efforts, and seek the       fundamental policy changes we need to help U.S. communities       truly prosper.     Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter opposing  the bill from the NETWORK Lobby for Catholic Social Justice.                                                      June 27, 2017.        Dear Representative Conyers: NETWORK Lobby for Catholic       Social Justice stands in strong opposition to the ``No       Sanctuary for Criminals Act'' (H.R. 3003) and ``Kate's Law''       (H.R. 3004) to be considered this week by the House of       Representatives. We urge Congress to reject these bills. In a       county that prides itself on being the land of welcome and       opportunity, we must ensure that our immigration laws reflect       our shared values.        As Congress continues to delay comprehensive immigration       reform and a permanent solution for the nation's 11 million       undocumented immigrants, we are left with the status quo--an       enforcement-only approach that tears apart families and keeps       people in the shadows. Despite the gridlock in Congress,       localities across the country still have the responsibility       to uphold safety and peace in their communities. To fulfill       this goal, local police and residents have fostered mutual       trust to root out crime and promote public safety,       encouraging community members to cooperate with local       authorities. The ``No Sanctuary for Criminals Act'' (H.R.       3003) does nothing to promote public safety and instead will       make communities more dangerous while striking fear in the       hearts of our immigrant families.        Likewise, ``Kate's Law'' (H.R. 3004) would criminalize       immigrants who simply want an opportunity to succeed in the       United States, and often are simply trying to be reunited       with their family. Punishing immigrants for wanting to       provide for their families with fines and imprisonment is       harsh and cruel--we, as a nation, are called to be better       than that. Again, we ask Congress to abandon the       ``enforcement first'' policies that have been the de facto       U.S. strategy for nearly thirty years, yielding too many       costs and too few results. Our antiquated system that does       not accommodate the migration realities we face in our nation       today does not serve our national interests and does not       respect the basic human rights of migrants who come to this       nation fleeing persecution or in search of employment for       themselves and better living conditions for their children.        Pope Francis cautions that ``migrants and refugees are not       pawns on the chessboard of humanity'' and he asks political       leaders to create a new system, one that ``calls for       international cooperation and a spirit of profound solidarity       and compassion.'' This is a holy call to embrace hope over       fear. Congress should recognize the God-given humanity of all       individuals and uphold our sacred call to love our neighbor       and welcome the stranger in our midst. Any action that       further militarizes our borders, criminalizes assistance to       immigrant communities, or weakens legal protection of       refugees is neither just nor compatible with the values that       we, as Americans, strive to uphold.            Sincerely,                                       Sr. Simone Campbell, SSS,                                   Executive Director, NETWORK Lobby                                       for Catholic Social Justice.
