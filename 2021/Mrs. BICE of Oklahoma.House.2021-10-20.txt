 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address the  ongoing crisis at the southern border. The Biden administration has  actively opened the border, and it is directly harming our country by  dwindling resources, endangering communities, and emboldening terror  threats.   I recently visited the Del Rio, Texas, sector to hear straight from  our Customs and Border Patrol agents, Texas National Guard, and Texas  State troopers. In just one station within the sector, apprehensions  have multiplied at an alarming rate, going from 7,400 last year to more  than 94,000 in 2021, and agents have detained people from more than 90  countries.   While the humanitarian aspect of this crisis is disturbing, I am more  concerned with the growing national security threats to our country.  Nearly 10,000 individuals with criminal convictions have been arrested  in fiscal year 2021 attempting to illegally cross into the U.S.,  compared to just 2,400 last year.   Mr. Speaker, securing and regulating our border is crucial in keeping  our country secure, functioning, and, most importantly, safe from  external threats. I urge my colleagues to work toward creating  meaningful legislation to provide Customs and Border Patrol agents with  much-needed resources to firmly protect our border.                            ____________________
