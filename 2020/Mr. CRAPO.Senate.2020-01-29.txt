 Mr. Chief Justice, on behalf of myself and Senators Risch,  Cruz, Graham, Braun, Moran, and Boozman, I send a question to the desk  for the counsel for the President.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The question from Senator Crapo and the other  Senators for the counsel for the President:         Does the evidence in the record show that an investigation       into the Burisma-Biden matter is in the national interest of       the United States and its efforts to stop corruption?    Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Justice, Senators, thank you for that  question. And the straightforward answer is, yes, the evidence does  show that it would be in the interest of the United States. In fact,  the evidence on that point is abundant.   Here is what we know: Hunter Biden was appointed to the board of an  energy company in Ukraine without any apparent experience that would  qualify him for that position. He was appointed shortly after his  father, the Vice President, became the Obama administration's point man  for policy on Ukraine.   We know that his appointment raised several red flags at the time.  Chris Heinz, the stepson of the then-Secretary of State, severed his  business relationship with Hunter citing Hunter's lack of judgment in  joining the board of that company, Burisma, because Burisma was owned  by an oligarch who was repeatedly under investigation for corruption,  for money laundering, and other offenses.   Contemporaneous press reports speculated that Hunter's role with  Burisma might undermine U.S. efforts led by his father then, at that  time, to promote the U.S. anticorruption message in Ukraine.    The Washington Post said: ``The appointment of the Vice President's  son to a Ukrainian oil board looks nepotistic at best, nefarious at  worst.''   There were other articles. There was one that reported: ``The  credibility of the United States was not helped by the news that . . .  Hunter had been on the board of the directors of Burisma.''   There was another article saying: ``Sadly, the credibility of Mr.  Biden's  [[Page S674]]  message may be undermined by the association of his son with a  Ukrainian natural-gas company, Burisma Holdings, which is owned by a  former government official suspected of corrupt practices.''   And it went on: Reports from the Wall Street Journal said that  activists here--that is, in the Ukraine--say that the U.S.'s anti- corruption message is being undermined as his son receives money from a  former Ukrainian official who is being investigated for graft.   At the same time, within the Obama administration, officials raised  questions. The Special Envoy for Energy Policy, Amos Hochstein, raised  the matter with the Vice President. Similarly, Deputy Assistant  Secretary of State Kent testified that he, too, voiced concerns with  Vice President Biden's office.   Everyone who was asked in the proceedings before the House of  Representatives agreed that there was at least an appearance of a  conflict of interest when Mr. Biden's son was appointed to the board of  this company. That included Ambassador Yovanovitch, Deputy Assistant  Secretary Kent, Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, Jennifer Williams,  Ambassador Sondland, Dr. Fiona Hill, and Ambassador Taylor. They all  agreed there was an appearance of a conflict of interest.   Even in the transcript of the July 25 telephone call, President  Zelensky himself acknowledged the connection between the Biden and  Burisma incident, the firing of the prosecutor who reportedly had been  looking into Burisma, when Vice President Biden openly acknowledged he  leveraged a billion dollars in U.S. loan guarantees to make sure that  that particular prosecutor was fired. He openly acknowledged it was an  explicit quid pro quo: You don't get a billion dollars in loan  guarantees unless and until that prosecutor is fired. My plane is  leaving in 6 hours, he said on the tape.   And when the President, President Trump, raised this in the July 25  call, President Zelensky recognized that this related to corruption,  and he said: ``The issue of the investigation of the case''--and he's  referring to the case of Burisma--``is actually the issue of making  sure to restore the honesty, so we will take care of that . . .'' And  he later said in an interview that he recognized that President Trump  had been saying to him things are corrupt in Ukraine, and he was trying  to explain, no, we are going to change that; there is not going to be  corruption.   So that explicit exchange in the July 25 call shows that President  Zelensky recognized that that Biden-Burisma incident had an impact on  corruption and anti-corruption. And so it was definitely undermining  the U.S. message on anti-corruption, and it was a perfectly legitimate  issue for the President to raise with President Zelensky to make clear  that the United States did not condone anything that would seem to  interfere with legitimate investigations and to enforce the proper  anti-corruption message.   Thank you.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, counsel.   The Senator from Illinois.
