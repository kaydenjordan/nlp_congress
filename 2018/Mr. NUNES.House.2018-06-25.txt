 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the chairman and the ranking  member for allowing this bill to come up today.   I rise in support of H.R. 805, the Tulare Youth Recreation and  Women's History Enhancement Act.   This bill simply removes a Federal revisionary interest in two  parcels of land in my hometown of Tulare, California, and offers their  conveyance to the city.   This would allow the city to purchase this land from the Union  Pacific Railroad, which received the land from the Federal Government  by right-of-way in the 19th century. One parcel has long been home to a  historic Women's Club House which has served as an important community  center for more than 100 years.   The Women's Club House is in need of critical repairs, but the city  of Tulare has been reluctant to make repairs without clear title to the  land. If this bill were enacted, the city would be making needed  repairs to this historical landmark, preserving it for generations to  come.   The second parcel of land is home to the Rotary Skate Park, which is  a recreational park used by young and old residents alike. Both of  these community locations are extremely important to the people of the  San Joaquin Valley, and this bill will ensure their continued use for  many years to come.   I want to thank, again, the chair and ranking member for their  support, and urge my colleagues to support this bill.
