 Madam President.    Madam President, I have great respect for my distinguished  colleague from Alaska, and I appreciate his service to our country and  his thoughts today.   I stand in opposition to his amendment because, if there is one thing  we don't need right now, it is anything else that would give more  authority to the military-industrial complex to start and finish wars  without authorization from Congress.   Anytime we introduce additional ambiguity into a field that is  already ripe with ambiguity, given the inherent tension between  ambiguities surrounding the inherent article II Commander in Chief  power and the article I power that Congress has to declare war, we run  into problems. This would open up that ambiguity.   The legislation we are addressing here, this resolution, is  bipartisan. It has as its object to clarify that, for future, offensive  action, we need congressional authorization. We have been lied to by  the Pentagon for years regarding a war that has gone on for two  decades. That is long enough. We don't want to create additional  ambiguities. We don't want any more wars without the people's elected  representatives being able to debate it.    Madam President, I move to table the Sullivan amendment, and  I ask for the yeas and nays.
