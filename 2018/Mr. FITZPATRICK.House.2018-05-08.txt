 Mr. Speaker, May is Mental Health Awareness Month,  and I would like to take this opportunity to discuss the need for  increased mental health awareness and resources in our communities. I  would like to recognize an organization in my district, in Bucks  County, Pennsylvania, that does just that.   The Bucks County Crisis Intervention Team, founded in 2008, brings  together law enforcement, mental health professionals, and local  officials to reinforce the treatment of mental illness as a disorder  and not as a crime.   I am appreciative of the law enforcement officers who, last month,  became certified as members of the Bucks County Crisis Intervention  Team, the 18th class to do so.   I would also like to thank mental health advocate Sharon Curran,  whose involvement with this program and work with the Lenape Valley  Foundation makes Bucks County a safer and a more accommodating  community.   Mr. Speaker, working together with this group, we look forward to  expanded access to quality mental healthcare for anyone in our  community who is in need.                            ____________________
