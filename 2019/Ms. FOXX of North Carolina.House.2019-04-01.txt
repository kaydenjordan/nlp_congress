 Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize an  historic moment for North Carolina's Fifth District last week, when  Lincoln Heights School in Wilkesboro joined the National Register of  Historic Places.   From 1913 to 1927, Julius Rosenwald and Booker T. Washington built  nearly 5,000 schools in African American communities by matching seed  funds provided by public and private entities. Lincoln Heights is among  the few of these schools remaining. Constructed in 1924, students  attended from six surrounding counties after facing discrimination and  lacking educational opportunities near their homes.   As a National Historic Place, Lincoln Heights reminds us of the  disgraceful history of segregation in our country, but our country is  not defined by this injustice. Rather, as a nation, we are shaped by  brave men and women who stand for justice when society fails.                            ____________________
