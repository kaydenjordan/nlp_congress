 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong  opposition to the Republican plan to destroy our Nation's economy.  Right now hundreds of Republican Members of Congress have rushed out of  town to go on vacation with their friends and family. Democrats are  here ready to work.   Americans are facing the reality of losing their retirement savings,  jobs, and healthcare. Here are just some of the extreme demands that  House Republicans have made: They want to cut 100,000 jobs for  teachers; they want to put health insurance at risk for 21 million  Americans; they want to put food assistance at risk for 1 million  Americans.   This is cruel and shameful.   Let's be clear: House Republicans want to tank the economy and they  want to give tax cuts to billionaires and large corporations. We have a  default on our debt coming because House Republicans would rather be on  vacation than get to work.  [[Page H2618]]                                ____________________
