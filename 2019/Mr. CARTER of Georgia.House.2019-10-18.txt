 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember the life  of Mr. Marvin H. ``Mark'' Chesser who passed away at the age of 78 on  September 25, the mayor pro tem of Ludowici in Long County in the First  Congressional District of Georgia.   His friends and colleagues remember him as a valuable servant to the  community who served tirelessly and did a great job. Even before  becoming the mayor pro tem, Mr. Chesser spent countless hours dedicated  to his local community.   One important example of his work includes his time driving school  busses for the district there. In addition, he was very active within  his church, both in the men's ministry and driving the church van for  Wednesday night activities.   During his time as mayor pro tem, Mr. Chesser worked hard to promote  policies that boosted the economy, and increased jobs in Ludowici. I am  thankful that we had Mr. Chesser in the First Congressional District  where his passion made our area a better place to live.   Mr. Chesser's family and friends will be in my thoughts and prayers  during this most difficult time.                            ____________________
