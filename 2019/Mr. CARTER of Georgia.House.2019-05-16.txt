 Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Chair, I come before you today a very disappointed person; a  disappointed Member of Congress; a disappointed pharmacist. I am  disappointed that my Democratic colleagues have decided to prioritize  politics over patients by packaging together bipartisan bills to lower  drug costs with partisan bills to bail out ObamaCare. They are two  completely different subjects.   Republicans and Democrats have worked hard to create strong,  bipartisan bills that will increase the amount of generic drugs  entering the marketplace, bringing more affordable choices to patients.  Now, House Democrats have chosen to use these bipartisan bills to pay  for partisan ObamaCare bills.   This bill includes major drug pricing proposals like the CREATES Act,  and the pay for delay, which both seek to increase the ability of  lower-cost generic drugs getting to the market quickly, providing  patients with more affordable choices.   We had long, hard-fought negotiations with our Democratic  counterparts in multiple markups that ran until midnight over these two  proposals, but we were eventually able to come to an agreement.   The other drug-pricing bill in this package is a bill that I have  worked on with my friend, Representative Schrader from Oregon, the  BLOCKING Act. This bill mirrors the proposal from President Trump's  budget proposal to keep bad actors from clogging up our generic drug  pipeline.   Hear me, Mr. Chair, and hear me clearly. This bill is the picture- perfect definition of good bipartisan legislation. Democrats are  throwing that work away by prioritizing politics over patients. All  three of these bipartisan drug-pricing bills save money, so the  Democrats are choosing to use their hard-fought savings and wish lists  for partisan politics.   The bill before us today will throw hundreds of millions of dollars  at the failed ObamaCare marketplace and further restrict patient  choice. The bottom line is, there is no need for this course. Drug  pricing should not be a partisan issue.   In all of my years of being a pharmacist, I have seen patients  struggle with the high cost of prescription drugs. Now that I am in  Congress, I hear about it all the time from my constituents back home.  We all do.   Voters across the country sent us up here to work together on issues,  like drug pricing. The three drug-pricing bills in this package show  that we can, in fact, do that. We can work together on important  issues.   When we work together, we can achieve real results that help  patients. But once again, we are letting politics become the priority  instead of helping people. Republicans want to work together on drug  pricing. The people want us to work together on drug pricing.   I call on my colleagues to do the right thing. Let's put patients  before politics.   Mr. Chair, this is important. Strike these partisan poison pills in  this bill and send our excellent drug-pricing work over to the Senate  and on to the President's desk and have him sign them into law.    Mr. Chair, I thank the ranking member for  yielding and for the opportunity to speak on this bill.   Mr. Chair, first of all, let me begin by thanking the gentlewoman  from Georgia for proposing this amendment. Although I do find it  unnecessary in a lot of ways, I have to admit that I applaud her,  because educating our healthcare professionals and, therefore,  educating the public about what is available is extremely important.   I do have to tell you that I feel the pharmacy schools already do a  good job of this, and this might be somewhat redundant. However, the  underlying point is that more education is better even if it is  overkill, if you will.   Now, you ask me how I can say that. I have to say that I have to be  consistent, and I have been consistent throughout that we need to  educate the public.   In fact, if we look back at the debate that we have had in the  committee when we have been talking about the short-term plans, I made  the point that we need to educate the public as to what is available.  They need to know.   Therefore, I would be inconsistent if I didn't agree with the lady  that more education is better, because I have to tell you that these  short-term plans--I believe that the other side refers to them as the  junk plans. I have always said, if they are junk plans now, then they  were junk plans during the Obama administration, because they were  being offered then.   But those short-term plans, we need to let people know about them.  That is why I made an amendment in the committee to educate the public  about the availability of these plans. Unfortunately, my colleagues on  the other side of the aisle disagreed with that, feeling that, no, they  don't need to know about it.   Here we have an opportunity to let people know more, and I have to  admit that I would be in favor of that. I thank the gentlewoman for  offering this amendment. Where I might be a little bit ambivalent  toward which way to go, I have to admit that consistency is important.  Short-term plans, we need to let people know about them. I fought for  that. So I don't think I would be consistent if I went against this.   I thank the gentlewoman for offering this.    Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr.  Alex Kunda for becoming the first student in the history of the Glynn  County School System to have perfect attendance from kindergarten  through 12th grade.   When Mr. Kunda was 4 years old, his sister, Miranda, passed away from  a rare illness. At that time, his sister had maintained perfect  attendance through her time in elementary school and during her medical  treatment.   Receiving an award onstage on her behalf before her passing, Mr.  Kunda pledged to his sister that he would continue her streak for as  long as possible.   Madam Speaker, 13 years later, he has done it. He hasn't been tardy.  He hasn't been absent. He hasn't checked out one single time during his  entire primary and secondary education.   He and his family plan trips and appointments all around his ability  to go to school, while fighting the urge to occasionally skip or use a  sick day.   Keeping a promise as difficult as this one should be an inspiration  to us all.   Congratulations, Mr. Kunda. Good luck at the College of Coastal  Georgia.                            ____________________
