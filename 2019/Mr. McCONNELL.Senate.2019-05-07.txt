 Madam President, it has now been more than 6 weeks  since Special Counsel Bob Mueller, the former FBI Director, concluded  his investigation into Russia's interference in our 2016 election and  delivered his findings to the Justice Department. It has been 2 weeks  since Attorney General William Barr made the 450-page report public.  This investigation went on for 2 years. It is finally over.   Many Americans were waiting to see how their elected officials would  respond. With an exhaustive investigation complete, would the country  finally unify to confront the real challenges before us? Would we  finally be able to move on from partisan paralysis and breathless  conspiracy theorizing or would we remain consumed by unhinged  partisanship and keep dividing ourselves to the point that Putin and  his agents would need only to stand on the sidelines and watch us as  their job would actually be done for them? Regrettably, the answer is  pretty obvious.   So that is what I want to discuss this morning--Russia's interference  in American elections, the special counsel's and the Attorney General's  work, and how we can finally end this ``Groundhog Day'' spectacle, stop  endlessly relitigating a 2\1/2\-year-old election result, and move  forward for the American people.   Now, it bears remembering what this investigation was actually  supposed to be about--Russian interference in 2016. For many of the  President's opponents, it quickly morphed into something else--a last  hope that maybe they would never have to come to terms with the  American people's choice of a President. In some corners, Special  Counsel Mueller came to be regarded as a kind of secular saint who was  destined to rescue the country from the inconvenient truth that the  American people actually elected Donald Trump. For 2 years, many of the  President's opponents seemed to be hoping the worst conspiracy theories  would actually be true. They seemed to be hoping for a national crisis  for the sake of their own politics.   Look, I will say it was at least heartening to see many of my  Democratic colleagues and the media abruptly awaken to the dangers of  Russian aggression. Remember, not long ago, the Democrats mocked  Republicans like John McCain and Mitt Romney for warning about the  dangers posed by Putin's Russia.   Remember President Obama's quip back in 2012, when then-Governor  Romney emphasized his concerns with Russia? Here is what President  Obama said when Mitt Romney emphasized his concerns about Russia back  in 2012: ``The 1980s are now calling to ask for their foreign policy  back.'' That was President Obama in 2012. Well, I think many of us now  see that President Obama's approach to Russia could have used some more  of the 1980s--more Ronald Reagan and less Jimmy Carter.   We would have been better off if the Obama administration had not  swept Putin's invasion and occupation of Georgia under the rug or had  not looked away as Russia forced out Western NGOs and cracked down on  civil society; if President Obama had not let Assad trample his redline  on Syria or had not embraced Putin's fake deal on chemical weapons; if  the Obama administration had responded firmly to Putin's invasion and  occupation of Ukraine in 2014, to the assassination of Boris Nemtsov in  2015, and to Russia's intervention in Syria. Maybe stronger leadership  would have left the Kremlin less emboldened. Maybe tampering with our  democracy wouldn't have seemed so very tempting.   Instead, the previous administration sent the Kremlin the signal it  could get away with almost anything. So is it surprising that we got  the brazen interference detailed in Special Counsel Mueller's report or  a concerted effort to divide Americans through social media campaigns  or the hacking into the email accounts and networks of the Clinton  campaign and the Democratic Party?   Thanks to the investigation, we know more about these tactics. Thanks  to the investigation, 13 Russian nationals, 3 Russian companies, and 12  more  [[Page S2658]]  Russian intelligence officers have been indicted. These are the people  who really did seek to undermine our democracy. Yet, curiously, many of  our Democratic colleagues and most of the news media don't seem to care  about that. New insight into defending America? Russian nationals being  indicted? These don't seem to interest my colleagues across the aisle-- no interest--just like there has been little interest in the steps this  administration has taken to make Russia pay for its interference and  strengthen America's hand.   Election interference was just one part of Russia's strategy to  undercut the United States, and this administration has taken the  problem head-on. We have a new, coherent national security strategy and  national defense strategy that actually take the threat seriously.   We have new sanctions. We have provided Georgia and Ukraine with  weapons to better defend themselves--capabilities the previous  administration denied our partners--now listen to this--out of fear of  provoking Russia. We have worked against pipeline projects like Nord  Stream 2 that would further expand Putin's influence. We have  strengthened and reformed NATO so the alliance can present a united  front. We proved Russia's noncompliance with the INF and walked away  from a treaty that Moscow had turned into a sham. Over Russian  objections, the Trump administration has also twice enforced President  Obama's redline in Syria after Assad's use of chemical weapons.   With respect to election security, Congress appropriated hundreds of  millions of dollars to State governments to shore up their systems. The  administration increased information sharing from the Department of  Homeland Security in cooperation with the States. According to press  reports, the Department of Defense has expanded its capabilities and  authorities to thwart cyber threats to our democracy. No longer will we  just hope Moscow respects our sovereignty--we will now defend it. These  are just a few examples, and there is already evidence they are having  an effect.   We just had the 2018 midterm elections. Thanks to this  administration's leadership, all 50 States and more than 1,400 local  election jurisdictions focused on election security like never before.  The DHS provided resources to localities for better cybersecurity, and  private social media companies monitored their own platforms for  foreign interference. Thanks to efforts across the Federal Government  in 2018, we were ready. Clearly, that is progress. The Mueller report  will help us as will the upcoming report from the Select Committee on  Intelligence. These threats and challenges are real. Our responsibility  to strengthen America is serious, and it requires serious work.   Speaking of serious, seriousness is not what we have seen from the  Democratic Party in recent days. What we have seen is a meltdown--an  absolute meltdown. We have seen an inability to accept the bottom-line  conclusion on Russian interference from the special counsel's report,  which read that the investigation did not establish that members of the  Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian Government in  its election interference activities. That was the conclusion--2 years  of exhaustive investigation and nothing to establish the fanciful  conspiracy theory that the Democratic politicians and TV talking heads  had treated like a forgone conclusion. They told everyone there had  been a conspiracy between Russia and the Trump campaign. Yet, on this  central question, the special counsel's finding is clear--case closed.   This ought to be good news for everyone, but my Democratic colleagues  seem to be publicly working through the five stages of grief. The first  stage is denial. Remember what happened when the Attorney General  released his preliminary letter that described the special counsel's  bottom-line legal conclusion? Denial. Immediately, there was totally  baseless speculation that perhaps Attorney General Barr had not quoted  the report properly.   Then comes stage No. 2--anger. Welcome to Washington in recent days.  The Democrats are angry--angry that the facts have disappointed them,  angry that our legal system will not magically undo the 2016 election  for them. They have opted to channel all of their partisan anger onto  the Attorney General. They seem to be angrier at Bill Barr for doing  his job than they are at Vladimir Putin. This is a distinguished public  servant whose career stretches back almost 50 years. He is widely  respected. Nobody claims he has any prior personal allegiance to this  particular President.    Why are they angry? Why are they angry? Did the Attorney General fire  the special counsel or force him to wind down prematurely? No. Did he  sit on the Mueller report and keep it secret? No. He quickly reported  out his bottom-line legal conclusions and then released as much as  possible for the world to see. Did he use redactions? Did he use  redactions to mislead the public? No. Working with the special  counsel's team, he released as much as possible within standard-- standard--safeguards. So it is hard to see the source of the anger.   Maybe our Democratic colleagues are thinking of some strange new kind  of ``coverup'' where you take the entire thing you are supposedly  covering up and post it on the internet. The claims get more and more  utterly absurd. There are baseless accusations of perjury and laughable  threats of impeachment.   We all know what is going on here. This is the whole angry barrage  that Democrats had prepared to unleash on President Trump--except the  facts let them down. The facts let them down. So the left has swung all  these cannons around and fired them at the Attorney General. It is not  for any legitimate reason but just because he is a convenient target.   There is this ``outrage industrial complex'' that spans from Capitol  press conferences to cable news. They are grieving--grieving--that the  national crisis they spent 2 years wishing for did not materialize. But  for the rest of the country, this is good news. It is bad news for the  ``outrage industrial complex'' but good news for the country. So now  they are slandering a distinguished public servant because the real  world has disappointed them.   Instead of taking a deep breath and coming back to reality, our  colleagues across the aisle want to shoot the messenger and keep the  perpetual outrage machine right on going, even undermining the  institution of the Attorney General itself in the process.   Remember, Russia set out to sow discord, to create chaos in American  politics, and to undermine confidence in our democracy. But on that  front, given the left's total fixation on delegitimizing the President  Americans chose and shooting any messenger who tells them inconvenient  truths, I am afraid the Russians hardly need to lift a finger--hardly  need to lift a finger.   The last stage of grievance is acceptance. For the country's sake, I  hope my Democratic friends get there sometime soon. There are serious  issues the American people need us to tackle. There is more progress  for middle-class families we need to deliver.   For 2 years, the Democratic Party held out hope that the legal system  would undo their loss in 2016. They refused to make peace with the  American people's choice. But the American people elected this  President. They did. The American people voted for change. The American  people sent us here to deliver results for their families. That is what  Republicans have been doing for the past 2 years and counting. That is  what Republicans will continue to do. Whenever our Democratic friends  can regain their composure and come back to reality, we look forward to  their help.                            ____________________     Madam President, I understand there are two bills at  the desk due for a second reading en bloc.    In order to place the bills on the calendar under the  provisions of rule XIV, I object to further proceedings en bloc.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, on behalf of myself and the  distinguished Democratic leader, Mr. Schumer, I send to the desk a  resolution authorizing the production of testimony and representation  by the Senate Legal Counsel, and ask for its immediate consideration.   Mr. President, this resolution concerns a request for evidence in a  criminal action pending in Nevada State court. In this action the  defendant is charged with threatening or attempting to intimidate  public officials in voicemails he left with the Las Vegas office of  Senator Cortez Masto. A preliminary hearing is scheduled for May 8,  2019.   The prosecution is seeking testimony from one of the Senator's staff  assistants who listened to the voicemails at issue. Senator Cortez  Masto would like to cooperate with this request by providing relevant  employee testimony from her office.   The enclosed resolution would authorize that staffer, and any other  current or former employee of the Senator's office from whom relevant  testimony may be needed, to testify in this criminal action, with  representation by the Senate Legal Counsel.                            ____________________
