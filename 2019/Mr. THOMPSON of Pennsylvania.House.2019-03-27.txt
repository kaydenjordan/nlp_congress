 Madam Speaker, I rise today to  recognize the 28th Infantry Division of the United States Army National  Guard as it recently celebrated the anniversary of its 140th year of  serving this Nation.   Its roots in American history were planted long before our Nation's  founding. The 28th Infantry's lineage traces all the way back to when  Benjamin Franklin formed a militia known as the Pennsylvania  Associators. The first meeting of the Associators occurred on November  21, 1747. Franklin organized units to defend the city of Philadelphia  against the French and Spanish privateers.   The 28th Infantry Division is the oldest continuously serving  division in the United States Army. It wasn't until 1879 when the 28th  ID was officially established by Governor Henry Hoyt and designated a  red keystone as its symbol.   Throughout history, the 28th Infantry Division has answered our  country's call to serve in nearly every war. The 28th ID soldiers  fought side by side in the Spanish-American War. They earned the  nickname ``Iron Division'' in the First World War by General John  Pershing after a chivalrous stand in France. This decorated division  still goes by this storied nickname.   The infantrymen stepped ashore at Omaha Beach and were the first  American division to parade through Paris  [[Page H2839]]  after its liberation. They were also deployed for duty during the  Korean war. In present day, its operations have continued in places  like Bosnia, Kosovo, Kuwait, Iraq, and Afghanistan.   I had the distinct pleasure of meeting these members of the 28th  Division last November in Kuwait, joining them in the mess hall for  Thanksgiving dinner. The division stationed in Kuwait was part of  Operation Spartan Shield. This operation sought to strengthen U.S.  partnerships in the Middle East and support ongoing operations to  defeat ISIS.   Just a few weeks ago, I got to reunite with the 28th ID in Hershey,  Pennsylvania, to celebrate the 140th anniversary. The dinner and  ceremonies were a fitting tribute for a historic part of the United  States military.   Madam Speaker, these men and women continue to build upon the Iron  Division legacy. They are brave, resilient, and well-trained to support  each other in combat and defend our great Nation.   So I say to the men and women of the 28th Infantry Division: Roll on,  28th. Roll on.   Madam Speaker, I congratulate the 28th Infantry Division for 140  years of service, sacrifice, and valor.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, tomorrow is National  Vietnam War Veterans Day.   Madam Speaker, 46 years ago, March 29, 1973, the last combat troops  were ordered out of Vietnam; and just 2 years ago, we designated March  29 as a national day to honor our Vietnam veterans.   Madam Speaker, in many instances, our Vietnam veterans often did not  receive a warm welcome home when they returned from war. There were no  parades, no welcome back ceremonies.   Our Vietnam veterans, many of whom were drafted, answered the  Nation's call and served with honor and distinction.   Vietnam veterans constructed their own memorial here in Washington,  built entirely by private donations and dedicated to the 2.7 million  servicemembers who served during the Vietnam war.   Madam Speaker, we all know someone who served in Vietnam. These  veterans are our friends, our family, and neighbors. It is long overdue  to salute them for their service, but it is not too late. This weekend,  I will proudly be at the Cambria County War Memorial to mark this  special day.   May God bless our Vietnam war veterans today, tomorrow, and every  day.   Welcome home.                            ____________________
