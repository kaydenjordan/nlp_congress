 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to welcome an incredible  individual who is new to Minnesota's Sixth Congressional District.   John Graw, a World War II veteran, recently moved to Ramsey to be  closer to his daughters. Upon his arrival in Ramsey--which was,  coincidentally, the day before Veterans Day--the Ramsey City Council  awarded John with a key to the city and a letter welcoming him to the  community.   John was a master sergeant in the U.S. Army Air Force and served with  the Mediterranean Allied Air Force that fought in the North African  Campaign as well as the European theater in Italy and France during  World War II.   I am so glad that John received such a warm welcome to Ramsey,  especially because he came to the defense of our Nation during one of  its darkest times. It is inspiring to know that this hero lives among  us, and it is an honor to stand here today and welcome this member of  the Greatest Generation to our community.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, the American people's Fourth Amendment right  against unreasonable search and seizure by our government must always  be protected. Unfortunately, our privacy protections from government  intrusion have not kept pace with the way we communicate with each  other. It is long past time that we update our Nation's electronic  communication privacy laws.   The last time we updated these laws was 1986. That was 6 years after  the U.S. Olympic Hockey team's Miracle on Ice, 2 years after I  graduated from college, and 1 year before the Minnesota Twins won their  first World Series. Simply put, Mr. Speaker, that was a long time ago.   Today, more than 200 million Americans have access to a smartphone,  and many more use email and cloud technology. However, many Americans  may not realize that these antiquated laws allow law enforcement to  read every email that is more than 6 months old, without a warrant.   The Email Privacy Act would codify the reasonable expectation of  privacy Americans already have in their electronic communications by  requiring a search warrant for private digital communications.   I was pleased to support this legislation when it passed unanimously  in the House last Congress, and I look forward to its swift  consideration in both Chambers in the 115th. I urge all of my  [[Page H992]]  colleagues to support this long overdue modification of the law.
