 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, on Monday, no votes are expected in the House. On  Tuesday, the House will meet at noon for morning hour and 2 p.m. for  legislative business. Votes will be postponed until 6:30. On Wednesday  and Thursday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for morning hour and noon  for legislative business. On Friday, the House will meet at 9 a.m. for  legislative business. Last votes of the week are expected no later than  3 p.m.   Mr. Speaker, the House will consider a number of suspensions next  week, a complete list of which will be announced by close of business  today.   In addition, the House will consider several important bills from the  Veterans' Affairs Committee.   First, H.R. 1181, the Veterans Second Amendment Protection Act,  sponsored by Chairman Phil Roe, which ensures that the Second Amendment  rights of VA beneficiaries are not restricted without due process.   Next, H.R. 1259, the VA Accountability First Act, also sponsored by  Chairman Roe, which grants the VA Secretary increased discretion to  remove or suspend VA employees due to poor performance.   Finally, H.R. 1367, sponsored by Representative Brad Wenstrup, which  enhances the VA's ability to recruit and retain highly qualified  employees.   The failures of the VA are well-documented and completely  unacceptable. These bills are a step in the right direction towards  creating greater accountability at the VA, and keeping our promise to  Americans' veterans who have sacrificed so much for us.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I am pleased that we were able to pass the FY17 Defense  Appropriations bill on a bipartisan basis this week. It is my hope that  we can continue to pass the appropriation bills on a bipartisan basis  as well.   As for future legislation, I would refer my friend to the  Appropriations Committee, and, as always, I will keep Members posted of  any scheduling updates.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I have great trust in Chairman Frelinghuysen. I think you will  continue to see that behavior.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I always look forward to these discussions. I know they are about the  schedule, but I always look forward to what quotes you are going to  bring up next.   Let me see if I can answer all of those questions that you raised.   First, my friend did inform me, last week and again today, that the  Democrats have held 79 hearings over 2 years on ObamaCare. Well, we  have spent the last 6 years.   I promised you that I would see how many hearings we had. When I went  back and checked, the Republicans have held 113 hearings on the ways to  repeal and replace ObamaCare. We had expert witnesses on both sides of  the aisle on everything from the individual mandate and Medicaid  sustainability, to the medical device tax, and ObamaCare's failing co- ops.   We have been committed to repealing and replacing this law for years,  and I am sure you will find a lot of quotes from almost everybody on  this side of the aisle saying that same thing. We have done the work,  we have listened to the American people, and we believe now it is time  to act.   You did bring up about the committees. You brought up about reading  the bill. So what we put forth is we put a website together for the  patient-centered healthcare bill, and it is available online at  readthebill.gop. Now, this is only 123 pages. That is a difference from  your bill of 2,700 pages for ObamaCare.   Now, we remember what the Democrats said when they were passing  ObamaCare, that you had to pass the bill to see what is in it. So I  went back and checked how many people were unable to visit the website.  We had over 350,000 visitors visit our website in just 36 hours, and  100,000 downloaded the legislative text.                                time  1145    Now, when you talk about dead of night, I was on this floor, you were  on this floor, and I know people on both sides of the aisle have used  it before, but the dilatory activity on the other side of the aisle to  slow this process down put us into nighttime.   And then let's think about how this process went. It was an open  process. Why did it go so long? We debated hours of Democrats'  amendments because we weren't going to shut it down. We never called  the question. We kept going as long as people wanted to go. And we  spent hours on one amendment that just wanted to change it to a hashtag  of a different name. That was a Democratic amendment to somehow change  the bill. We didn't stop with that. We let everybody talk, and we let  everybody have their voice because we believe in regular order.   Yes, we spent 27 hours on it because we were not going to deny  anybody the ability to talk or offer their amendment. And that is  exactly what we did, and that is what the American people expect to  have happen.   So, 113 hearings, I congratulate you on your 79; 123 pages compared  to 2,700. I believe this is a great first step in three phases. For too  long this health care of ObamaCare has failed.   In that 2,700 pages they created 23 co-ops and provided more than $2  billion. In this short amount of time, 18 of them have collapsed. They  had the quote that, if you like your health care, you could keep it,  but millions of Americans found out that wasn't true. They said your  premiums would go down. Millions of Americans have found out that is  not true either.   Now, across this country, one-third of the entire country only has  one provider. And the very sad part of this, just within the last  month, Humana announced that they are going to pull out. That is  leaving 16 counties, and I see my good friends from Tennessee, with no  provider at all.   We can do so much better. That is why we spent the years; we spent  the hearings; we have had the witnesses.   And I know it is your right to come and ask to adjourn so somehow we  couldn't get to the bill, it is your right to continue to ask to  adjourn so Members can't offer their amendments, but you know what? If  we had to spend through the dead of night and stay up so we made sure,  even if it is on the other side of the aisle, a Democrat could offer an  amendment, just a hashtag to change the name, that is your right, and  we would spend the time and do it. And we spent hours at it.   If you ask me, personally, I didn't think that amendment changed  anybody's health care in America. But you have a right to do it, and we  made sure we kept that right, and we had regular order.   I thank the gentleman for his quotes.    I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I appreciate  the gentleman's comments.   Mr. Speaker, I do want to remind people, when you use reconciliation,  what is the process? Well, the process states you have the authorizing  committee post and they mark up. We did that. Budget Committee marks  up. They will do that next week. Rules Committee will meet, then it  comes to the House floor.   I will never apologize for having 113 hearings on repealing and  replacing ObamaCare. I will never apologize for having all the  witnesses in.   And I love that you bring a lot of quotes of people inside that are  elected, but I will be very frank. The quotes I love and the quotes I  care most about are the ones that come from my constituents.   For some reason, this idea that this is a complex issue but you had  hearings before so you are going to forget all about those hearings,  why do we have committees? Why do you keep Members on your own side of  the aisle on the same committees? To build expertise, to solve big  problems. So, no, they don't forget what they learned in those  hearings.   But let me read you quotes from a few constituents.   ``Dear Kevin, thank you for your diligence in these disruptive  political times. I have several concerns.   ``ObamaCare blew us out of the water. I retired early as an RN due to  health problems, so I have to pay for my entire health insurance. I am  not complaining about that, but I am tired of having premiums go  through the roof. I lost my doctor and my plan.   ``In 2017 there were few options without a $5,000 deductible. If I  have to pay that much first, then why pay for insurance? Our income is  not huge. We cannot afford this.''   Or from another constituent: ``Dear Kevin, I just wanted to convey  that I strongly feel legislative action is needed to fix the ACA.   ``My family deductible has increased over $3,000 a year--it used to  be $1,000 8 years ago--and I practically only have health insurance in  case a catastrophic accident were to occur.   ``Also, my sister-in-law can no longer work more than 29 hours a week  since her employer does not want to have to provide insurance. That is  ridiculous.''   Or: ``Dear Kevin, I just got my 2017 health insurance renewal notice,  $650 per month, up 20 percent. I am 60 years old, have worked and saved  all my life, so I don't qualify for subsidies. I can't go without  insurance, but I can't pay for it either. Something needs to be done. I  am so upset that I am crying right now.''   But my friend, Mr. Speaker, on the other side of the aisle says to  wait to help these people. Forget about the 113 hearings, even though  it is more than the 70-some that ObamaCare had, or 123 pages is too  much instead of 2,700.   I will never apologize for having the wisdom to listen and, now, the  courage to lead. But I will promise you this, Mr. Speaker, and my  friend on the other side of the aisle: I have never come to this floor  to offer to adjourn just to disrupt the process.   And, yes, I had Members on our side of the aisle that would get  frustrated that Democrats would offer an amendment that just dealt with  a hashtag. No, let's let them have their say. If they feel that is  important for American health care, to put a hashtag name change, then  let's spend hours on it. Because we believe in the process, we will  defend your right to have that process even though it will not help one  constituent of mine or yours.   But you want to spend your time doing that? We will do that. And we  did do that. That is why we worked through the night. But we will not  give up on the American people. That is why we are doing what we are  doing, and I thank the gentleman for yielding.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the  House adjourns today, it adjourn to meet on Tuesday, March 14, 2017,  when it shall convene at noon for morning-hour debate and 2 p.m. for  legislative business.
