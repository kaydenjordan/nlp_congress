 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of  the Civil Air Patrol and the contributions this civilian auxiliary  makes to our great nation. The Civil Air Patrol supports America's  communities with emergency response; diverse aviation and ground  services; youth development; and promotion of air, space, and cyber  power.   The Civil Air Patrol consists of 1,445 squadrons and approximately  58,000 volunteer youth and adult members nationwide. It is  congressionally chartered and operates as a nonprofit organization. It  is made up of 8 geographic regions, consisting of 52 wings throughout  the 50 States, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia.   Mr. Speaker, on Saturday evening, I had the honor of speaking at the  Pennsylvania Wing Civil Air Patrol's 2018 Conference in Grantville,  Pennsylvania. More than 400 Civil Air Patrol members and cadets  throughout the Commonwealth will gather there this weekend to celebrate  this outstanding civilian auxiliary. Colonel Gary L. Fleming is the  wing commander.   Mr. Speaker, this year, the Civil Air Patrol is celebrating its 70- year association with the U.S. Air Force. Congress passed a law on May  26, 1948, designating the Civil Air Patrol as the official Air Force  auxiliary. The Civil Air Patrol cadet program has been in existence for  more than 75 years. Cadet programs throughout the country are making  incredible impacts. Cadet programs attract more than 25,000 members,  ages 12 through 20.   The program educates youth in four main program areas: leadership,  aerospace, fitness, and character development. It enriches the school  curriculum through after-school programs. Programs offer orientation  flights in powered and glider aircraft, as well as flight training  scholarships. Activities and competitions are available for cadets at  local, State, regional, and national levels. Opportunities for  community development are available through the color guard and drill  team, as well as emergency services missions.   The Civil Air Patrol makes up about 10 percent of each of the U.S.  Air Force Academy's classes. The cadets who have earned the General  Billy Mitchell Award enlist in the Air Force, U.S. Army, and U.S. Coast  Guard at higher pay grades.   Mr. Speaker, the cadet program also offers college scholarships in  several different disciplines, as well as an international air cadet  exchange program.   The Civil Air Patrol cadet program truly encourages our youth to  reach great heights. They have been building leaders for more than 75  years, and I am so proud of the Pennsylvania Wing Civil Air Patrol  Cadet Advisory Council for its incredible commitment to our youth. I  wish them the best in advance of the annual conference later this week,  and I look forward to joining them at that celebration as well.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, today is tax day.  Typically, Americans dread this day--the deadline for filing Federal  income tax returns--thanks to a cumbersome, complex, and confusing Tax  Code.   But fear not. Thanks to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, this is the last  time Americans will file under the old system.   Next year, taxpayers will be able to keep more of their hard-earned  dollars. Approximately two-thirds of all households will see a lower  marginal income tax rate in 2018, according to a recent analysis by the  Tax Policy Center.   Thanks to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, American families can look  forward to lower individual tax rates; a nearly double standard  deduction, from $6,500 to $12,000 for individuals, and from $13,000 to  $24,000 for married couples; and a doubled child tax credit increase  from $1,000 to $2,000 per child.   Mr. Speaker, these are just some of the benefits. The average  American should be able to file their taxes without an army of  accountants. I look forward to next year when the majority of American  families will see a much easier tax process.   It is pro-growth, pro-family tax reform; fair and simple.                            ____________________
