 Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the COVID-19  Disinformation Research and Reporting Act. I thank Representative  Jennifer Wexton for working with me on this important piece of  legislation, which will help shine a light on the ways social media and  other online platforms amplify and spread misinformation and  disinformation about the coronavirus pandemic to the detriment of  public health.   Representative Wexton was able to get the substance of this bill  included in the HEROES Act, a bill passed four months ago by the House  of Representatives to provide much needed relief to those suffering  from the coronavirus pandemic and accompanying economic downturn.  Because the Senate failed in its duty to pass the HEROES Act, I am  introducing the COVID-19 Disinformation Research and Reporting Act with  my colleagues--Senators Booker, Blumenthal, Klobuchar, Warren, and  Reed.   As I stand here today nearly 7 million Americans have been diagnosed  with COVID-19 and over 200,000 have died from the virus.   The numbers alone are staggering. But when you hear and read the  personal stories of individuals and families who are suffering, it is  truly tragic. It makes you mournful that for many of the individuals  who died, they died alone in the absence of their loved ones.   While many things contributed to this massive loss of life, I am here  to talk about one in particular: the insidious spread of coronavirus- related misinformation and disinformation online. This ``infodemic''  has undercut the efforts of public health officials at every turn, and  threatens to prolong the virus's impact on the health of our people and  economy long after a safe and effective vaccine is available.   The online spread of misinformation about public health is nothing  new. Claims that the 2014 Ebola epidemic was a form of population  control spread across social media. Anti-vaccination groups have long  used Face book and YouTube to share junk science and recruit new  members.   However, social media platforms' response to coronavirus was supposed  to be different. Early in the pandemic, the major social media  platforms announced new measures to combat misinformation while making  sure users had access to accurate, authoritative information about the  virus. Facebook added a COVID-19 Information Center to the tops of  users' News Feeds and announced it would remove misinformation that  could contribute to imminent physical harm. Twitter verified accounts  that provided credible updates on the pandemic and committed to  removing false or misleading content that contradicted information from  health authorities. YouTube began directing users who searched for  COVID-related information to the WHO or other health authorities and  banned false information contradicting health authorities on treatment,  prevention, diagnosis, or transmission of COVID-19.   Unfortunately, these measures proved lacking and insufficient. The  conspiracy film Plandemic was viewed more than 8 million times across  social media platforms, and the sequel was viewed over 100,000 times on  YouTube during its first week alone. A study by advocacy group Avaaz  found that misinformation about vaccines and other health topics had  been viewed an estimated 3.8 billion times on Facebook in the past  year--four times more than factual, authoritative content from  institutions like the WHO and CDC. The study also found that only 16%  of previously fact-checked health misinformation on Facebook carried a  warning label.   Spend even a small amount of time on the internet or social media and  you will find rampant misinformation and conspiracy theories about  COVID-19. Some examples of these falsehoods include: Bill Gates created  the virus to use a vaccine as cover to implant microchips into  Americans. No, actually, Dr. Fauci created the coronavirus  [[Page S5875]]  to seize political power. You shouldn't wear a mask to protect against  the coronavirus, because wearing a mask actually weakens your immune  system. And do not worry if you catch the corona virus--you can treat  it by drinking bleach.   These claims might seem ridiculous, but they have real word  consequences. A study published in the American Journal of Tropical  Medicine and Hygiene found that 5,800 people had been hospitalized and  at least 800 people died in the first three months of this year alone  as a direct result of coronavirus-related misinformation. As recently  as August, the Georgia Department of Health and the Texas Poison  Control Center had to warn people not to drink bleach to treat COVID.  While more Americans regularly wear masks in public, a recent poll  found that 15% still do not. And, perhaps must troubling, polls suggest  that between 35% and 50% of the U.S. population will not get a COVID  vaccine when it is approved.    If we hope to get past the coronavirus and avoid similar public  health crises in the future, we must understand where misinformation  originates, how it spreads, and strategies to stop it.   This is exactly what the COVID-19 Disinformation Research and  Reporting Act will do. It directs the National Science Foundation to  partner with the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and  Medicine to conduct a study on the spread of COVID-19-related  disinformation and misinformation on the internet and social media  platforms. This study will provide critical information on the roles  disinformation and misinformation have played in the public response to  COVID-19; the sources of COVID-19-related disinformation and  misinformation and the ways it has influenced the public debate; the  role social media plays in the disseminating and promoting this  disinformation and misinformation; and potential strategies for  combatting misinformation and disinformation in the future.   This information will not stop the next pandemic from coming. And, it  will not force the next Administration to take it seriously and follow  the advice of doctors and scientists. But it can give us the knowledge  and tools necessary to avoid another infodemic and ensure the American  public receives accurate and authoritative information when it is most  needed.   I therefore encourage my colleagues to support the COVID-19  Disinformation Research and Reporting Act.                            ____________________
