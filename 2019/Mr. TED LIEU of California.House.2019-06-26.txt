 Mr. Speaker, I rise to give you some  facts about healthcare.   Right now, the Trump administration is suing to eliminate the law  that guarantees preexisting conditions healthcare coverage for  Americans.   You might wonder what constitutes a preexisting condition. Well, I am  going to give you some examples. Cancer, which affects over 22 million  people is a preexisting condition.   Depression, which affects over 16 million people has been deemed a  preexisting condition.   Alzheimer's, which affects over 5 million people has been deemed a  preexisting condition.   Epilepsy, which affects over 3.4 million people has been deemed a  preexisting condition.   If you, or a family member, or a friend have a preexisting condition,  you are in deep trouble if the Trump administration succeeds in their  lawsuit.                            ____________________
