 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the latest  COVID-19 relief package.   In my State of Michigan, the numbers are devastating. There are more  than 33,000 confirmed cases. I want to add another number today: over  2,800 deaths. I just got a phone call that another dear friend of mine  has passed. Nearly 1.2 million people have filed for unemployment.   That is why I am back here today.   We, however, have a lot more work to do. The package is not perfect.  More work must be done to provide assistance to our States and our  local governments, to ensure the continuous operation of the Postal  Service, where there is a statement that neither snow nor rain nor  gloom of night should stay the completion of mail delivery. The COVID  virus is devastating the Postal Service.   I want you to know that the $484 billion measure will provide  desperately needed financial support.   I stand here today with my heart broken in support of this bill.
