 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the  Pallone-Thune TRACED Act and to address the intrusive reality of  robocalls.   The jig is up for con artists who have time and time again deceived  the American people into answering fraudulent calls that put our  constituents on the hook for outrageous charges on their phone bills.   I am so proud to have my bill, H.R. 3264, the Ending One-Ring Scams  Act of 2019, included in the underlying bill to ensure that the  American people are protected from this harmful scam culture.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Pallone and Senator Thune for their  work on the TRACED Act and for holding these bad actors accountable for  their deceptive tactics.                                time  1315
