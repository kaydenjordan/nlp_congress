 Mr. Speaker, from a recent Investor's Business  Daily editorial, a Harvard University study found that ``During the  first 100 days of Trump's Presidency, TV networks CNN, NBC, and CBS  provided negative coverage 93 percent, 93 percent, and 91 percent of  the time.''   Meanwhile, ``The New York Times delivered 87 percent negative  coverage, while The Washington Post 83 percent and The Wall Street  Journal 70 percent were only a bit less negative.''   ``Trump's overall score of 80 percent negative coverage during the  start of his Presidency compares with Obama's 41 percent, Bush's 57  percent, and Bill Clinton's 60 percent.''   ``Both the Post and the Times, for instance, have used unnamed  sources and even the supposed content of documents that they have never  viewed as the basis for major revelations about Trump in recent days.  They have let their raw hatred get the better of them.   ``Such a media environment is dangerous for American democracy.''   Expecting basic professionalism from the media, sadly, seems to be  too much.                            ____________________
