 Mr. President, I am pleased to be introducing the Title VII  Health Care Workforce Act of 2019 with Senator Enzi. This critical  legislation would reauthorize funding for the Title VII health  professions programs to help strengthen the distribution, quality, and  diversity of the health professions workforce so it is better prepared  to meet the Nation's evolving and emerging health care needs.   The Title VII health professions programs have a longstanding history  of increasing the supply of primary care professionals, expanding  access to care in rural and urban underserved areas, and developing a  workforce that reflects the nation's diversity and the needs of  patients. At a time when the Country is facing health provider  shortages, it is critical that we continue to support the programs that  advance our health care workforce, such as: scholarships for  disadvantaged students, public health and preventive medicine,  geriatrics training, area health education centers, oral health  training, and primary care medicine.   These education and training programs guide current and aspiring  health professionals to high-demand careers in areas of greatest need,  and this legislation will take an important step in ensuring that these  programs can continue to serve students and patients for years to come.  I look forward to working with stakeholders supporting these efforts,  including the American Association of Medical Colleges, as well as my  colleague, Senator Enzi, to pass the Title VII Health Care Workforce  Act of 2019, in addition to the bipartisan Investment in Tomorrow's  Pediatric Health Care Workforce Act I introduced with Senator Cassidy,  as these bills proceed though the legislative process.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I am pleased to be introducing the Title VII  Health Care Workforce Act of 2019 with Senator Enzi.
