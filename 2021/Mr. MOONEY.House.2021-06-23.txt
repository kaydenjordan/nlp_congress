 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss our most fundamental  God-given right, our right to life.   Enshrined in our Declaration of Independence is life, liberty, and  the pursuit of happiness. Our government should reflect this commitment  to life, but the continued practice of abortion-on-demand across the  country runs contrary to this commitment. Abortion deprives innocent,  defenseless, unborn babies of their right to life.   Thankfully, there are certain legal protections, like the Hyde  amendment, in place to safeguard hardworking Americans' tax dollars and  save lives. The Hyde amendment simply prevents the taxpayer funding of  abortions. Since 1976, the Hyde amendment has saved 2.5 million lives.   According to a Marist poll taken this year, the vast majority of  Republicans and Independents, and nearly a third of Democrats, believe  that tax dollars should not be used to pay for abortions.   Since 1976, Republican and Democrat Members of Congress have found  agreement in keeping the Hyde amendment. President Biden himself  publicly supported the Hyde amendment for decades. In a 1977 letter to  constituents, which I have right here, Senator Biden wrote that voting  to support the Hyde amendment ``is the position which I have  consistently supported.''   He goes on to say: ``The Senate, however, passed a broader definition  of the circumstances under which Medicaid funds could be used to pay  for an abortion. I did not support this version.'' Those are Senator  Biden's words.   Furthermore, in 1994, in another letter to a constituent at the time,  Senator Biden upheld his support of Hyde protections, saying: ``Those  of us who are opposed to abortion should not be compelled to pay for  them.''   But today, President Biden has kowtowed to the radical left and has  removed Hyde protections from his budget proposal. President Biden is  turning his back on innocent life in their mother's womb.   The Hyde amendment has saved millions of lives and has stopped  Americans who are morally opposed to abortion from being forced to pay  for it.   I call on President Biden to return to his previous position, which  opposed the taxpayer funding of abortion, abide by the teaching of his  own self-professed Catholic faith, and follow the lead of his  predecessors from both sides of the aisle who preserved the Hyde  amendment in their Presidential budget proposals.                            ____________________
