 Madam Speaker, after years and years of prior  Congresses thinking that tax policy was giving cuts to the rich, this  bill uses our Tax Code for some good.   As the gentleman, my good friend from Pennsylvania, just said, we can  work together, we can walk and chew gum at the same time, we can have  oversight and have issues come up, and we join together for the  American people. Whoever thinks otherwise doesn't know history and is  not reading the papers every day.   Retirement should be about one thing: security. If you have spent  your life working your tail off, you have the right to be able to relax  without fear.   But, today, millions of Americans--millions--are afraid they are  entering or are in retirement and don't have the resources they need to  live. Many live on a Social Security check. They struggle to enjoy  their best years.  [[Page H4139]]    Employees deserve benefits, and employers need incentives to provide  them. This legislation does both. It provides flexibility to 401(k)s to  give employees and small businesses better access; it creates a tax  credit for employers; and it creates a tax credit for employers that  build automatic enrollment plans.    By passing this bill, we would finally repeal the  maximum age for IRA contributions, something I have worked on for many  years.   This bill cleared out of our committee unanimously. That is pretty  rare. It is as rare as a unicorn. That tells you how commonsense the  bill is.   I am glad that this bill eliminates an unfair tax, a tax increase on  the benefits of children and Gold Star military families that was  caused by the tax bill of 2017. This was a crushing blow to many  families.   Madam Speaker, it is fitting that the House will make this fix before  Memorial Day.   I encourage my colleagues to support the SECURE Act.
