 Mr. Speaker, the people live like paupers while the  mullahs live like gods.   For weeks, tens of thousands of brave Iranians have courageously  stood up in over 70 cities and chanted: ``The people live like paupers  while the mullahs live like gods.''   They challenge their failed government. They have done so in the face  of violent repression, imprisonment, torture, and even death.   Why?   They are fed up. They are fed up with poverty and unemployment; fed  up with economic depravation and rampant corruption; fed up with an  oppressive theocratic regime that mismanages their own country,  mistreats its own people, and spends billions of dollars sowing the  seeds of war and funding terrorists while its people suffer.   Ayatollahs recklessly pursued nuclear weapons instead of creating  jobs and building infrastructure for their own people. The regime's  apologists have long argued that these policies are popular and they  give Iranians a national sense of pride, restoring their place as a  regional power.   A regional power?   It is more like regional thugs.   In Iraq, Iranian-backed militias have executed and beat civilians,  looted homes, and destroyed people's lives. In  [[Page H54]]  Lebanon, Iranian-backed Hezbollah aims tens of thousands of rockets at  Israeli citizens. Syria backs Bashar al-Assad's vicious regime. Iran  sends weapons and money to militants in Yemen, Bahrain, and Gaza. It  has become the biggest purveyor of mayhem in the Middle East, pouring  billions of dollars into nefarious activities while their own people  are impoverished.   Today, I rise with my colleagues to support the Iranian protesters  and the bipartisan H. Res. 676. The United States and our allies should  use the menu of sanctions available to us to target human rights  violators and the Ayatollah's thugs who forcefully repress their fellow  citizens.   We must ensure the protesters have access to social media, and we  must let them know that we support them. Ayatollahs must know that the  free world is watching.   The people live like paupers while the mullahs live like gods. The  time has come for the people to rise up and change it.    Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. McCaul), the chairman of the Committee on Homeland  Security, as well as a senior member on the Committee on Foreign  Affairs.   Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of this  resolution condemning the Iranian regime's crackdown on legitimate  protests and to show the world that America stands with the Iranian  people who want peace, prosperity, and freedom.   For many years, we have known the regime in Iran has fueled  radicalism and violence across the Middle East as the world's leading  state sponsor of terror. But over the last few weeks, we have seen the  brutal tactics Iran's leaders are willing to take to silence protesters  who are fed up with extremism, corruption, and incompetence coming from  their capital. The protesters deserve to have their voices heard  without fear of retaliation.   Today, Iranians are not citizens who are free to choose their own  destinies. They are subject to a fanatical dictatorship that fears the  people it rules by denying their freedoms.   Sadly, the Obama administration believed that the Ayatollah and his  radical clerics would be willing partners for peace, naively rewarding  them with billions of dollars in sanction relief. It is clear, however,  that, since the signing of the flawed Iran deal, the regime's behavior  has only gotten worse by continuing its support for terror groups like  Hezbollah and its backing of Houthi rebels in Yemen, all in pursuit of  establishing a Shia crescent.   Fortunately, the current administration and this Congress will not be  so easily fooled or complicit in their foreign adventurism. Leaders of  rogue states will say whatever they must to bring unearned concessions  from great powers.   But if it is real change that is desired, we must apply more  pressure. We cannot trust a country's government to be peaceful with  other nations if it resorts to violence against its own people it is  supposed to protect.   That is why I will soon introduce legislation that requires the Trump  administration to determine whether senior members of the Government of  Iran are responsible or complicit in human rights abuses, corruption,  or censorship.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Texas an  additional 30 seconds.                                time  1445    Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, the bill also calls out the Iranian regime's  practice of taking American citizens and other foreign nationals  hostage, and lays out several steps the administration should take in  conjunction with our allies to put an end to this practice.   A time will come when the tyrants of Tehran are held accountable for  their actions. After many decades of authoritarian rule, Iranians  deserve to be free. When democracy finally does flourish in Iran, the  people will remember who stood by their side.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.
