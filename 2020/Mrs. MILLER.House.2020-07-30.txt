 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak on my amendment to  fund the border wall.   Our country has suffered this year. We have all experienced hardship  as a pandemic rapidly made its way onto our shores. Americans are  resilient. We are rebuilding our economy, and we will persevere.   However, we must not forget about the ongoing crisis on our southern  border. In their bill, my colleagues across the aisle want to strike  all funding for border wall construction. This is not the time. We need  to focus.   It was just months ago when nearly every Member of Congress joined  together to ban deadly fentanyl from our country. This was such a  strong statement to showcase our commitment to combating the opioid  epidemic. Thanks to our strong border wall and the heroic efforts of  the men and women who guard it, our border is currently more secure  than it has ever been. Defunding the wall will weaken enforcement  efforts and hurt our communities.   During the pandemic, overdoses in West Virginia alone have risen by  50 percent compared to a year ago. Now is not the time to turn a blind  eye toward the drug smugglers who are looking to capitalize on our  hardship.   We cannot abandon our vulnerable populations. We cannot stop  construction. We need to finish the wall. We need a strong and stable  border to show our commitment to stop crime and make sure that security  is available to every single American.   For these reasons, Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of my amendment and  the entire Republican en bloc.
