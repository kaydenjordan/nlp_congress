 Madam Speaker, this week marks the 11th  anniversary of the tragic crash of Continental flight 3407.   On February 12, 2009, flight 3407 crashed in Clarence Center, New  York, killing all passengers and crew members on board and one person  on the ground. The National Transportation Safety Board determined that  the crash was due to pilot error and inexperience.   Thanks to tireless advocacy of the families of flight 3407 who lost  loved ones in the crash, reforms like 1500 hours of flight training for  first officers have been enacted. However, more than a decade later, we  still anxiously await implementation of the pilot records database to  allow airlines to access records of pilots applying for jobs.   Madam Speaker, western New York will never forget flight 3407 and  neither should Congress. I urge my colleagues to continue to strive for  One Level of Safety and remain vigilant about aviation and safety  standards.                            ____________________
