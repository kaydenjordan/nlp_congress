 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the  life of Robert Bowles, Jr., a loving father, husband, and leader from  the great State of Georgia.   Robert was a proud graduate of the University of Georgia School of  Pharmacy. He was the owner and pharmacist at Big C Discount Drugs of  Thomaston until his retirement.   Robert devoted his professional life to God, his customers, his  community, his family, and to both the Georgia Pharmacy Association and  the National Community Pharmacists Association.   He was responsible for initiating one of the first successful  diabetic care programs in the community pharmacy area.   Robert is the past president of the Georgia Pharmacy Association,  where he served on almost every committee that existed.   He was the recipient of many State and national awards during his  career, including the Bowl of Hygeia and the Larry L. Braden  Meritorious Service Award.   Robert's impact on our State will be felt for generations to come. He  will be dearly missed.                    Honoring Brian Tuten and Ed Livingston     Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor Brian Tuten and  Ed Livingston. Brian and Ed are trainers for Benedictine Military  School in Savannah, Georgia.   In October, during a Benedictine football practice, a player  experienced a cardiac event. Brian and Ed jumped into action  immediately to save the young boy's life. They performed lifesaving CPR  and deployed an AED until the ambulance arrived.   Luckily for the player, he is now making a full recovery.   If it had not been for the quick action of both Brian and Ed, this  situation could have been much worse.   Thank you both for your service and dedication to our community and  our district. You are both heroes.                Celebrating the Camden County Sheriff's Office     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  Camden County Sheriff's Office for their hard work in finding a young  man who went missing in Camden County during a hunting trip.   Camden County Sheriff's Office did not act alone. They had the help  of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources, McIntosh Fire and  Rescue, and the McIntosh Sheriff's Office.   The sheriff's department found the man after he had been missing for  3 days. Authorities were worried because temperatures were dropping  into the low 30s overnight. Luckily for the hunter, law enforcement  worked quickly and efficiently to locate him. The hunter was evaluated  by medical personnel and then returned home to his family.   None of this would be possible without the quick action of our  wonderful law enforcement in the First Congressional District of  Georgia.                                time  1115                      Recognizing Terry College Students     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and  honor Terry College's first-place win at the National Black MBA  Association Undergraduate Business Case Competition.   Terry College is a premier business school located at my alma mater,  the University of Georgia, home of the national champions Georgia  Bulldogs.   Terry College students, Kevin Kamau, Sophia Ige, Lauryn Sanders, and  Phillip Ellington were a part of the team that won first place in the  competition.   The national case competition is a hands-on student consulting  experience that provides undergraduates early exposure to MBA-level  business case strategy. The program also allows students to be  considered for competitive summer internship opportunities.   Their team, the first to represent Terry College at the National  Black MBA Association Undergraduate Business Case Competition, was  tasked  [[Page H164]]  with developing a recruitment plan for Generation Z graduates.   This team beat out teams from Emory University, the University of  Southern California, and Purdue University to take home the first place  prize of $15,000.   This was the University of Georgia's first time competing, and  therefore, they were seen as the underdogs.   Congratulations to the team and to the Terry College of Business.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Rick  Deasy, the FLETC Associate Director for Training, who plans to retire  this coming February.   Rick has had a long and impressive career working for the Federal  Government. He served honorably for 22 years in the Armed Forces with  active and reserve special operations forces.   Before working at FLETC, Rick served as Chief of the U.S. Immigration  and Customs Enforcement and the Homeland Security Investigations  Training Academy.   During his tenure as the associate director, Rick was charged with  developing and executing FLETC's COVID-19 response, which he did  impeccably.   He also championed the need for a FLETC medical liaison officer to  service medical professionals and trainees.   While Rick may be retiring, his impact on FLETC, our district, and  our Nation will be felt for generations to come.   Congratulations, Rick, on a wonderful and successful career. We hope  you enjoy your retirement.                            ____________________
