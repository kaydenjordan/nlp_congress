 Mr. Speaker, Members of the 115th Congress, I am honored  to have this opportunity to serve our country.   Mr. Speaker, I chose tonight to be sworn in on our Constitution, a  document that begins with our uniquely American creed, ``We the  people,'' a charge and a challenge to faithfully represent the people  of my district and the entire country, a charge I promise to honor  every day with all of my might.   I am particularly honored to serve as the advance guard not just for  Madeleine Dean, Chrissy Houlahan, and Susan Wild, who will soon join me  and our brethren in the Pennsylvania delegation, but also as an advance  guard for the army of new Members who will join us for the 116th  Congress, a Congress that may look substantially different than the one  we see today.   I am eager to continue doing the work that we, the people, entrust to  the equal branches of this government:   To ensure that fairness, civility, and opportunity are available to  all and to right the wrongs that hold far too many back;   To make sure that the people get a fair shake, whether in their jobs,  in our classrooms, in the courts, or in the voting booth;   To treat others with civility, particularly here in our Nation's  capital, as we work in service to the people of this great country;   To ensure opportunity and safeguard the world we pass on to the next  generation.   I promise to continue fighting for the underserved, for children and  families, for seniors and veterans--to bend the arc of justice for  those in need; for students like those on my mock trial team from  Constitution High School in Philadelphia, who are the next generation  of civic leaders; for veterans like Bob in Media or Pixie in  Philadelphia, who want assurance that their benefits will not be  treated as simply a line item in our budgets; for families like  Malcolm's in Chester, whose lives have been forever changed by gun  violence; and for my friend Hawa Salah, a human rights activist from  Darfur who was forced to flee her homeland after her advocacy for  oppressed people led to her kidnapping and torture by her own  government.   I am eager to continue this work right here with all of you.   Finally, I am grateful to the voters, to my friends and family, and  particularly my husband, Mark, for believing in me, and I hope that I  make him proud.                            ____________________
