 Mr. Speaker, I also rise in support of this  continuing resolution.   As an appropriator, and you have heard it from all of us, this is not  the best choice--it is not our first choice--to do continuing  resolutions. But this short-term CR is necessary to give the Senate  time to move its appropriations bills through the process.   In the meantime, Mr. Speaker, this legislation is absolutely critical  for our men and women in uniform, for our first responders, for our air  traffic controllers, and so many other public servants who keep us safe  each and every day.                                time  1445    This legislation also has a limited number of provisions that are,  frankly, important to Members on both sides of the aisle. Let me just  give you a couple of examples. Disaster response tools are in this CR  and extension of flood insurance and relief for the men and women who  help put the food on our table, the American farmers.   Most importantly, Mr. Speaker, this legislation gives us the  opportunity to complete our full-year appropriations bills by November  21.   I am absolutely confident that we can finish our bills by this date  because we have a bipartisan budget deal that was signed by the  President. I am particularly looking forward to working with Chairman  Price to finalize a T-HUD bill to address the infrastructure, safety,  and housing needs of our great country.   I also know that because of Chairwoman Lowey and Ranking Member  Granger, they will lead us through this process in a transparent, clear  way, as they always have.   Mr. Speaker, again, we need to pass this bill. I urge a ``yes'' vote.
