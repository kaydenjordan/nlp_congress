 Madam Speaker, we have heard a lot of great comments  about John. I was not officially a mentee, but when I first got to the  Energy and Commerce Committee, he immediately started giving me  pointers and guidance. We would talk about issues, and we would talk  about how you do things and how sometimes it is frustrating around  here, as we all know.   I appreciate very much all the help that you gave me and the guidance  that you gave me through the years. I am going to miss you deeply on  the committee. I appreciate all of your service.   I could talk about all the things that all the other people have, but  I am going to point something out that I realized as I was sitting  here.   Every Member of Congress, by nature, is a political junkie, and,  unfortunately, the time to celebrate your service overlaps with a  Presidential debate. So it will get higher ratings in the reruns than  it will get in the prime time, first edition.   But when you stop to think about it, think about all the Members of  Congress who stayed here, who wanted to say something positive about  you, about your service, your commitment to your family, to your God,  and to your country, we are all here missing that big event because we  love   John Shimkus.   So, God bless you. Godspeed on the work that you have to do further.
