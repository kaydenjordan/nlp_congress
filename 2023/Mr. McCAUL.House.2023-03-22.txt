 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1093) to direct the Secretary of State to submit to Congress  a report on implementation of the advanced capabilities pillar of the  trilateral security partnership between Australia, the United Kingdom,  and the United States.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, as China continues its aggressive posture in the Indo- Pacific, strengthening partnerships to deter Chairman Xi are more  important now than ever. I thank my good friend, Ranking Member Meeks,  for standing with me in support of this bipartisan measure.  [[Page H1310]]    The Australia-United Kingdom-United States partnership known as AUKUS  is a long-term security pact to protect peace and stability in the  Indo-Pacific region.   The recent announcement on AUKUS implementation only addressed one  piece of this partnership--cooperation on conventionally-armed,  nuclear-powered submarines, but there is much more to this partnership.   The second pillar of AUKUS is cooperation on advanced capabilities.  The purpose is to collaborate on high-tech research and the application  of systems, such as hypersonics, undersea capabilities, quantum  technologies, artificial intelligence, and much more.   This legislation focuses on ensuring the State Department is  authorizing technology transfers quickly to fully support  implementation of this vital pillar.   We are facing a generational challenge from the Chinese Communist  Party. We must bring all tools to bear in our effort to counter  Chairman Xi's attempts to disrupt the global balance of power. With  AUKUS, our three nations can achieve the shared strategic goal of  defending the Indo-Pacific region while maintaining our technological  and military superiority.   This bill presses the State Department to take action and account for  our arms transfers with the U.K. and Australia so that we can address  any hurdles and act seamlessly now and not wait for a time of crisis or  even war.   For these reasons, I am proud of this bipartisan bill, which will  begin to address numerous long-standing challenges in our arms exports  to our closest allies and potentially serve as a roadmap for working  with other close allies and partners.   I, again, thank Ranking Member Meeks, his team, and our members for  working with my staff to ensure that this bill in support of a new  long-term security pact with our allies becomes a reality.   Mr. Speaker, this bill deserves our unanimous support, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   Mr. Speaker, with AUKUS, we seek peace through strength. The previous  administration laid the groundwork to collaborate with our closest  allies and partners in countering China's threat to peace. Our Nation  stood alongside Australia and U.K. for the launch of the AUKUS  trilateral partnership in September of 2021. Now, we are prepared to  best implement this important program.   Through AUKUS, we are declaring that we will not stand idly by for  Chairman Xi and other autocratic leaders to dictate when and under what  circumstances the strength of our resilience is to be tested.   This bipartisan measure is a commitment to our partners. The American  people stand with the U.K. and Australia in preserving freedom.  Together we will uphold the international rules-based order and protect  and preserve the right of sovereign nations to defend themselves.   In the Indo-Pacific, we have seen how one dictator, Chairman Xi, is  defying the free world and threatening the open navigation and the free  flow of trade. This week, Xi met with Putin in Moscow and afterwards  possibly Iran.   Chairman Xi chooses to closely partner with Russia, who launched an  unprovoked war of aggression with Ukraine, where they are committing  barbaric war crimes, as I just returned from Kyiv and Bucha, where I  saw the mass graves.   Mr. Putin also has a long track record of war crimes in Mali, Syria,  and Central African Republic.   Xi also chooses to associate with Iran, whose Revolutionary Guard  Corps is a designated foreign terrorist organization. These alliances  are a clear indication that Xi does not seek peace but chooses to work  with those who wish to destroy it.   Mr. Speaker, today I am proud to speak in a unified voice, as we do  so often on the Foreign Affairs Committee, with my dear friend Mr.  Meeks, in support of this great AUKUS partnership. Again, this measure  deserves our unanimous support.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1715     Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
