 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 655 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 655         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order without intervention of any point of order to       consider in the House the resolution (H. Res. 296) affirming       the United States record on the Armenian Genocide. The       resolution shall be considered as read. The previous question       shall be considered as ordered on the resolution and preamble       to adoption without intervening motion or demand for division       of the question except one hour of debate equally divided and       controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the       Committee on Foreign Affairs.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Burgess),  pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  be given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, on Monday, the Rules Committee met and  reported a rule, House Resolution 655, providing for consideration of  H. Res. 296 under a closed rule.   This resolution also provides 1 hour of general debate controlled by  the Chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Foreign  Affairs.   Mr. Speaker, this rule is about U.S. leadership, standing for human  rights, and whether we are going to turn a blind eye to atrocities,  even if they took place 100 years ago.   H. Res. 296 is a resolution formally recognizing and memorializing  the Armenian genocide. And let me say, it is about time. 1.5 million  Armenians died at the hands of the Ottoman Empire in the emerging  Nation of Turkey over a century ago. Tens of thousands of Armenians  were violently expelled from their ancestral homelands.   These truths are important. Acknowledging them is important. Yet, the  United States has only tinkered around the edges of recognizing this  reality. Some of our Nation's closest allies already have--31 nations,  in fact--countries like Canada, Italy, France, Poland, Sweden, Germany,  even Russia have recognized this genocide.   Mr. Speaker, here is a map of those nations, and you can tell that  the  [[Page H8553]]  United States stands out; and I say that with great sadness.   White House statements and Congressional resolutions over the years  have referred to mass atrocities and other euphemisms; but nothing in  recent times has fully recognized it by calling it what it actually  was, a genocide.   Mr. Speaker, we need to speak the truth. Forty-nine of our 50 States  have formally recognized the Armenian genocide, but the Federal  Government has not.   This is a dark stain on our human rights record. The United States  should stand foursquare for human rights. Anything short of that sends  exactly the wrong message to abusers around the globe.   Mr. Speaker, I represent a congressional district in central  Massachusetts. It is home to the oldest Armenian community in America.  The first Armenian orthodox church in America was built in Worcester,  Massachusetts, my hometown. People still worship in it today.   When I was first elected in 1996, we had rows and rows of pews filled  with survivors of the Armenian genocide sitting at the front of the  church during our annual April remembrance of the Armenian genocide.  Sadly, almost 2 years ago, the last of our survivors, Rose, passed  away.   I have learned so much from this community. And to those who insist  that now is not the time for us to recognize the Armenian genocide; I  have to ask in return, when will it be the right time? When the very  last survivor of the genocide has passed away?   Those who want the world to forget, those who want to deny genocide,  they believe that history will be erased with the last eyewitness to  genocide.   Mr. Speaker, I must be honest. As many political leaders have  proclaimed ``never again'' over the years, the Armenian American  community has been left to wonder when ``never again'' would finally  become ``enough is enough.''                                time  1245    With this resolution, the United States will join the ranks of the  many nations, parliaments, and institutions that have fully recognized  and commemorated the Armenian genocide. We will speak out clearly in  favor of human rights. Finally, we will say loud and clear that enough  is enough.   Mr. Speaker, as we acknowledge this genocide from 100 years ago, I am  glad this House is separately considering H.R. 4695 on suspension this  week. This bill recognizes the blood that is being spilled today in  northern Syria. Because of Turkey's ruthless aggression, hundreds of  civilians have been killed. Thousands more have been displaced.   Erdogan's government has targeted the Kurds, one of our strongest and  most courageous allies in the fight against ISIS. What is going on  there can only be described as ethnic cleansing.   Instead of standing up for the people who have fought alongside U.S.  troops in Syria, President Trump gave Turkey the green light to try and  wipe the Kurds off the map. The President even complimented President  Erdogan, calling him a friend, a tough man, a hell of a leader.   Just last week, 9 days after the President first announced sanctions  against Turkey, he unilaterally lifted all the sanctions against  Turkey--9 days. Are you kidding me?   Never in my life did I think I would see the day when a President of  the United States would pave the way for a nation to systematically  slaughter our allies, remove sanctions from a country engaging in  ethnic cleansing without holding anyone to account, or put U.S. troops  stationed abroad in harm's way all while giving Russia not only a PR  victory but control over territory that just days before had been safe,  secure, and free from the control of ISIS terrorists and Assad's  murderous regime.   Standing up for human rights is not a Democratic or Republican issue;  it is an American issue. Even in an age of heightened partisanship,  this Congress must still be capable of speaking with one voice against  genocide and crimes against humanity, no matter when they took place. I  urge all of my colleagues to support this rule and the underlying  resolution so we can show the world that we still are.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   My colleague from Texas talked about a lot of different subjects in  his opening remarks. I have to say that I am a little bit  disappointed--well, more than a little bit. I am disappointed and  somewhat offended at the implication that this is not an important  matter.   Let me remind him that 1.5 million Armenians died at the hands of the  Ottoman Empire and the emerging nation of Turkey. Let me remind him of  the countless hundreds of thousands of people who had to flee because  of that oppression. Let me also remind him that it is not the official  policy of the United States Government. If it were, that map that I  showed you would have included us as a nation formally recognizing the  Armenian genocide.   My friend may not think it is important, but as somebody who cares  deeply about human rights, it is important that we respect historical  accuracy and that we respect the truth.   I don't know if the gentleman was in the Rules Committee last night  when our colleague from California, Anna Eshoo, movingly and tearfully  talked about her family's experiences during that time, when she lost  ancestors and her parents came to the United States to try to have a  better life. But I don't know how we can just kind of brush this off as  not a big deal.   It is a big deal. It is a big deal to Armenian Americans, and it is a  big deal to anybody who cares about human rights in this country.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms.  Shalala), a distinguished member of the Rules Committee.                                time  1300     Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Sherman), who has been a leader on this issue for many  years.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Judy Chu).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  New Jersey (Mr. Pallone), the co-chair of the Congressional Caucus on  Armenian Issues.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I have to say to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Burgess)  that, again, it is frustrating to hear his comments. I mean, we are  talking about a resolution recognizing the Armenian genocide; 1.5  million people  [[Page H8556]]  were murdered. I think it is generally a bipartisan resolution.   Mr. Speaker, I want to commend not only Chairman Engel and Chairman  Smith, who is a Republican, for their testimony before the Rules  Committee; I want to thank Congressman Schiff, who is the main author  of this; but our colleague in the Rules Committee, Congresswoman Lesko,  came out very strongly in favor of this resolution.   It would be nice if there were a couple of moments here that didn't  always have to be politicized, and I think this resolution should be  one of those moments.   This is important; this is serious; and we shouldn't bring politics  into a resolution dealing with the recognition of a genocide. So I  obviously have a different opinion on how people should vote on the  previous question.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Sanchez).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, again, it really is frustrating to hear my colleague try  and dismiss this. There has not been a resolution calling this a  genocide and outlining all the facts before.   Mr. Speaker, I would again urge my colleagues, in a bipartisan way,  to support the underlying bill and to reject any attempts to try to  politicize this process.   And, again, we do this out of respect for those victims of the  genocide, for its survivors, for the Armenian American community, for  the Armenian community all over the world, and we do it because the  United States of America is supposed to be committed to a very high  standard of human rights.                                time  1315    If we stand for anything, we need to stand out loud and four square  for human rights.   To not appropriately acknowledge a genocide only paves the way for  future thugs, dictators, and authoritarians to commit similar  atrocities, believing that somehow the United States, the most powerful  country in the world, will just look the other way.   I hope that we have strong, bipartisan support on this resolution.   Mr. Speaker, I am happy to yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   The gentleman wonders why we didn't bring this legislation up under  suspension of the rules. To be honest with you, I think there was a  concern by Democrats and Republicans on the Foreign Affairs Committee  that we might not have all the votes that we needed to pass them under  suspension of the rules.   Mr. Speaker, the Government of Turkey employs very well-paid  lobbyists here in Washington, and they have been working quite  diligently trying to defeat this. So I hope we have a vote that is  overwhelming, but we don't know.   Secondly, I don't know why the gentleman would object to bringing  this up under a rule. It gives more time for Members on both sides of  the aisle to be able to speak on this, and a lot of Members do. We had  a lot of Democrats on our side who wanted to speak. We have others who  are going to speak when the underlying bill comes up. So I don't quite  get it.   Let me say, again, for the Record, this is not the official policy of  the United States. If it was, President Trump would publicly  acknowledge the Armenian genocide.   By the way, I am not picking on President Trump. The same could be  said for President Obama. I can go right down the list of Presidents.   The deal is, this is not the official policy. If it was, we wouldn't  be here.   It really is somewhat disappointing that the gentleman doesn't quite  appreciate how impactful this is and how important it is.   Mr. Speaker, the horrors of human rights abuses can be mind-numbing,  whether they occurred 100 years ago, like the Armenian genocide, or are  happening today in Syria at the hands of Erdogan's government.   I get it. It is easier to turn away than to see the impact of  brutality, the loss  [[Page H8557]]  of life, the maiming of civilians, including children, in the  devastated communities. It can turn your stomach and break your heart,  but we must not lose our capacity for outrage. That 1.5 million  Armenians died at the hands of the Ottoman Empire in the emerging  nation of Turkey should outrage all of us.   Formally recognizing this genocide is the right thing to do. I wish  we took this step long ago, but it is always the right time to do the  right thing.   I urge my colleagues: Let's speak with one voice. Let's join some of  our closest allies in recognizing the Armenian genocide. Let's finally  remove this dark stain on the record of the United States of America.   I say this all the time: The core of our being as a nation should be  upholding a high standard of human rights. We should always be counted  on to speak out when people's human rights are being denied. We  certainly should be counted on to adhere to historical accuracy.   This happened, and it is time that it become the official policy of  the United States of America to recognize that it did happen and call  it for what it was, and it was a genocide.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the previous  question, vote ``yes'' on the rule, and vote ``yes'' on the underlying  bill.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Burgess is as follows:                     Amendment to House Resolution 655         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 2. Upon adoption of this resolution, the Committees on       the Judiciary, Ways and Means, Financial Services, Oversight       and Reform, and Foreign Affairs and the Permanent Select       Committee on Intelligence shall suspend pursuing matters       referred to by the Speaker in her announcement of September       24, 2019, until such time as the United States achieves       operational control of the southern border.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.
