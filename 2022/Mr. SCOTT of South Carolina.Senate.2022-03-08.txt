 Madam President, for the last 4 years I  have worked hard with my friends across the aisle on antilynching  legislation, legislation that has failed in this body 200 times. We  passed it in 2019 under Republican leadership in this Senate, only for  it to fall apart in the House.   Well, after more than a century of failed attempts, both Chambers of  Congress have finally passed this historic piece of legislation. I am  proud to say we did the right thing not for Republicans or Democrats,  but for Americans who have watched their government fall short too many  times.   While we cannot erase our Nation's past, today, we have taken a  significant step toward a better future for all. This long overdue  piece of legislation sends a clear message: We will not tolerate hatred  and violence against our fellow Americans.                            ____________________
