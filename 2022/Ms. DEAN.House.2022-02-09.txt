 Mr. Speaker, in an important moment of bipartisanship on  Monday, this Chamber passed the Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual  Assault and Sexual Harassment Act of 2021.   Over 75 percent of Members voted to restore power to women, who far  too often have been at the mercy of powerful men and even more powerful  companies.   This bill is not simply about arbitration, but about ending forced  arbitration.   According to the EEOC, one in four women have been sexually harassed  at work.   For many, the fear of retaliation and being blackballed stops them  from coming forward.   And the women who do find the courage to come forward can be  challenged by the confidentiality clause so often tied to forced  arbitration clauses in employment contracts.   This legislation will give sexual harassment and assault survivors  the freedom to decide legal action.   This bill goes beyond recourse for the victim. It is about redress in  a court of law, not in a closed arbitration room.   Because that is justice. I look forward to Senate passage.                            ____________________
