 Mr. Speaker, the pandemic was a problem that led some  healthcare providers to close their doors. In a bipartisan way, in the  previous session of Congress, we made an effort to fix that problem.   Now, because of the Democrats' irresponsible spending bill,  healthcare providers who are struggling will see decreased payments,  which is the last thing they need right now, and it is the last thing  we need right now.   Medicare reimbursement rates are already low, only balanced out by  non-Medicare payments. The better way is to target the funding to those  who need it and are still working to come out of the pandemic. We can  fill the gaps without adding to the deficit.   Wasn't the idea of a rescue to improve access to care? Yet, 9 percent  of the $1.9 trillion really went to address the COVID crisis.   They bailed out failed pension funds without reform and ignored our  doctors and healthcare providers on the front lines of the pandemic.  They cut payments to caregivers. $1.9 trillion, yet cuts to healthcare  providers during a pandemic.   What Democrats are trying to do today is ignore the negative  consequences of the bill they passed earlier this month. The  consequences of the bill passed 2 weeks ago means there will be payment  cuts to providers.   $1.9 trillion? Someone should be helped in this measure, but we can  do better. We can do better, but we weren't talked to for our ideas.   Mr. Speaker, Members should ask themselves: What about all of this  today? Will the next several generations of Americans look to us and  say thank you as they get stuck with paying our bills?  [[Page H1593]]         Madam Speaker, I rise today in memory of Mitch Stone.  He was a University of Cincinnati football superfan, and he was an  inspirational young man who passed away years after his battle with  brain cancer.   In 2009, at age 11, Mitch Stone was diagnosed with a malignant brain  tumor. The Cincinnati Bearcats football team took Mitch in as one of  their own and  [[Page H1604]]  saw him through his treatments. Mitch found strength and support  through the UC Bearcats football team, and they found strength in him.   Mitch went on to attend the University of Cincinnati, where he earned  a bachelor's degree in 2020. He was a Kolodzik Business Scholar, an  honors program at the Carl H. Lindner College of Business. Mitch used  his experience to start his own foundation called Mitch's Mission,  which helped children overcome their own health challenges.   Mitch's death is a tragedy that we continue to mourn, but his life is  a testimony to the good in this world. His legacy and the positive  effects of his works will live on.   Rest in peace, Mitch.                            ____________________
