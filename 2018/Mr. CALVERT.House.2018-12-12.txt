 Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from North  Carolina (Mr. McHenry).                          Recognizing Parker Poling     Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California,  Kevin McCarthy, our Republican leader, our majority leader.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the leader.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr.  Hudson).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from North  Carolina (Mr. McHenry).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Maine (Mr.  Poliquin).    Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time, I yield to the  gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. McHenry).    Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight, along with my California  delegation colleagues, to express our thanks and appreciation for those  Members who are departing the House at the end of the session.   Collectively, these Californians have served for decades here in the  House of Representatives. During that time, they have made many  contributions that have benefitted their districts, our State, and  certainly this country. I am proud to join them on the House floor this  evening and pay tribute to their dedication to this institution.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. McCarthy),  the majority leader.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California  (Mr. Rohrabacher), the Dean of the California delegation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California  (Mr. Denham).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California  (Mr. Valadao).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California  (Mrs. Mimi Walters).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California  (Mr. McClintock).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for those remarks.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. LaMalfa).    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the invaluable  contributions made by my California Republican delegation colleagues  who are departing at the conclusion of this term.   I consider these individuals more than colleagues. I consider them my  friends, and I am deeply disappointed they will not be joining us in  the next session of Congress.   Every one of them has served in the House with distinction, making  this institution better for having them a part of it. They have  represented their constituents and our State well by understanding the  unique challenges they faced and effectively fighting for solutions.   The booming voice from Jeff Denham is as unmistakable as it is  effective advocating for California's Central Valley. He knows it is  pretty difficult to farm without a reliable water supply, so he helped  lead the charge for many sensible water policies that help our Nation's  fruit and vegetable farmers keep American-grown produce on the dining  room tables around the country.   Darrell Issa made a name for himself in the car alarm industry before  he came to Congress, where he sounded the alarm on the executive branch  misconduct. As a leader on the Oversight and Government Reform  Committee, Darrell held our fellow agencies to account for their  actions and was a staunch defender of American taxpayers.   Steve Knight comes from a family well known for public service. Steve  proudly carried on that tradition by serving in the Army for 8 years,  then the Los Angeles Police Department for 18 years. Steve then came to  Congress, bringing his tremendous experience to the House Armed  Services Committee, where he has made a big impact.   The dean of the California Republican delegation, Dana Rohrabacher,  always brings a unique perspective to any conversation. Since his days  in the Reagan White House, Dana has been a constant voice for the  defense of liberty and freedom. He has also been a gnarly champion for  California's legendary surfing community.   Ed Royce and I were both members of the incoming freshman class of  1993. As a longtime member and now chairman of the House Foreign  Affairs Committee, Ed has served as an effective advocate for American  interests and allies around the globe. I have seen firsthand how  especially tireless he is in being a voice for the safety and liberty  of people so desperate for someone to come to their aid. And to cap it  off, Ed's tribute video featured Bono singing his praises.    David Valadao is a Member of the House who truly understands what it  means to be a champion for his district. David has never been  interested in partisan politics. He just wants to deliver results for  the Central Valley of California. Working with David to solve  California's water challenges and serving with him on the  Appropriations Committee has been an absolute pleasure and honor.   Anyone who spends any time with Mimi Walters knows that she is the  toughest member of the California Republican delegation. I think you  have heard that a number of times. When our delegation needs to  get something done, you can always count on Mimi to be front and center  in the fight. Her tenacity in advancing worthwhile policies will be  sorely missed by our delegation, our conference, and the House.    Time and time again, our California Republican delegation has come  together to respond to the needs of our State, whether it was a serious  drought, a disease threatening to wipe out our citrus farmers, horrific  wildfires and the flooding and mudslides that follow them, there is no  group of representatives I would rather lock arms with to fight for  those solutions that our constituents need.   Mr. Speaker, Teddy Roosevelt so brilliantly said, ``It is not the  critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man  stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The  credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena.''   The departing members of the California delegation all leave with  pride of knowing they served in the arena and spent themselves in a  worthy cause.   Again, I am grateful for their service and especially for their  friendship.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
