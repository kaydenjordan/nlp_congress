 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight the Trump  administration's latest efforts to combat the skyrocketing housing  costs in the United States.   There is likely no State in the country feeling the ill effects of  unaffordable housing more so than my home State of California. That is  why I applaud the President's recent executive order establishing a  White House Council on Eliminating Regulatory Barriers to Affordable  Housing.   Over the past 20 years, there have been countless regulations  implemented in California that make building a home so expensive that  many people can no longer afford to buy them or even rent. The cost of  building a home is nearly six times higher per square foot than it was  30 years ago, due to uncompromising and often unnecessary environmental  and safety regulations.   I am glad there will now finally be a council tasked with looking  into the true reasons behind these costs instead of continuing to offer  Federal subsidies to simply mask the problem.   In my home area of the First District, housing is a critical issue,  with the loss of the town of Paradise and so many people displaced  there and the housing that needs to be put in place back in Paradise or  in surrounding communities to help these people. The mandates that are  put upon them make it almost impossible to afford.   I look forward to working with HUD Secretary Ben Carson and this  White House council to examine and, hopefully, alleviate the housing  crisis in California.                            ____________________
