 Mr. President, yesterday morning, senseless violence  struck the community of Benton in Western Kentucky. A shooting at  Marshall County High School has claimed two lives, left more than a  dozen injured, and thrust an entire community into shock and grief.  Such a tragedy is every parent's worst nightmare. School should be a  haven where students, faculty, and staff can learn and work without  fear of violence.   Elaine and I send our thoughts to the victims, their families and  friends, and the entire Marshall County High School community.   Last night, Kentuckians came together in more than 20 prayer vigils  and services across the region. Although few of us can begin to  understand their grief, an entire nation stands in solidarity at their  side.                            ____________________     Mr. President, yesterday the Senate took another  important step in confirming President Trump's qualified nominees. In  strong bipartisan fashion, we confirmed Jerome Powell to serve as  Chairman of the Federal Reserve by a vote of 84 to 13.   Mr. Powell was a fine choice to lead the Federal Reserve System. His  public service and private sector work alike have received accolades  from across the political spectrum.   He joined the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve in 2012. He  has demonstrated an expert grasp of monetary policy and a commitment to  improving the Fed's transparency and accountability to Congress and to  the public. I enjoyed meeting with him during the confirmation process  and look forward to his service in this new position.   The position of Fed Chairman is integral to the health of the U.S.  economy. Washington must empower the American people to create  prosperity through sound policy that gets the government out of the way  of workers and job creators. Jay Powell is up to the task. I was proud  to vote to confirm him yesterday.   The Senate also voted yesterday to advance the nomination of another  highly qualified nominee--Alex Azar, who will serve as Secretary of  Health and Human Services.   In his impressive testimony before the Finance Committee, Mr. Azar  discussed his intention to confront head-on the opioid crisis that is  hurting so many families across our country, including in my home State  of Kentucky. He made clear that he will place an important priority on  prevention, education, and enforcement to halt the advance of this  scourge.   But he recognizes we need effective, compassionate treatment options  for those who are seeking recovery, and for all Americans, he will work  to expand access to high-quality, affordable healthcare options.   His distinguished record, including prior HHS service as Deputy  Secretary and private sector work, shows he is the right man for the  job. It is vital that this Department be headed by a  [[Page S478]]  leader with Mr. Azar's extensive qualifications and excellent  reputation. He will be responsible for overseeing $1.13 trillion in  Department spending, supervising critical research, and administering  and reforming programs that touch millions of American lives, such as  Medicare and Medicaid.   I look forward to voting soon in support of his confirmation.                            ____________________     Mr. President, the rising tide of economic optimism I  have been highlighting on the floor is not showing any signs of  subsiding.   Yesterday alone, three of the Nation's largest companies announced  major new investments in the U.S. economy and workforce. Each said that  their decisions were made possible by the improved business climate  created by the landmark Tax Code overhaul that Congress passed last  year.   First, Verizon announced plans to invest a chunk of its tax reform  savings right back into its employees. Next month, about 155,000  Verizon workers, including senior management, will receive stock  bonuses valued around $2,500. Additional savings will also go to  expanded philanthropy and infrastructure investments right here in  America.   Further, the Walt Disney Company announced a new investment of at  least $175 million in its U.S. workforce. Over 125,000 employees will  receive cash bonuses, and Disney will invest $50 million in an employee  education program designed to help hourly employees access higher  education and vocational training.   JPMorgan Chase announced a $20 billion, 5-year comprehensive  investment plan to support economic growth and American workers. That  plan includes permanent raises for 22,000 employees, hundreds of new  bank branches across the country, thousands of new jobs, expanded  philanthropy, and an increase in loans for affordable housing and small  business development.   Just this morning, Starbucks has announced it is permanently raising  pay and conferring new benefits, like one-time stock bonuses and  expanded paid leave. This major investment in its U.S. workforce will  affect more than 150,000 employees.   So the good news about tax reform and its benefits is rolling in  almost faster than I can keep up with it. In retrospect, the surprise  here is not that this tax relief has boosted the American economy; the  real surprise is that those who opposed tax reform didn't see it  coming.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The VICE PRESIDENT. The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 5 p.m.  today, all postcloture time on the Brownback nomination be considered  expired and that, if confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered  made and laid upon the table and the President be immediately notified  of the Senate's action.   I further ask unanimous consent that the vote on the James nomination  occur at 1:45 p.m. on Thursday, January 25, with all other provisions  of the previous order in effect.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to Calendar No. 294,  S. 2311.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session  to consider Calendar No. 622, David Stras.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  mandatory quorum calls for the cloture motions be waived.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 552, R.D. James.    Mr. President, last week Americans from all across the  country--including many from Kentucky--came here to Washington to speak  up for unborn children whom our legal system has denied the right to  life. Now Congress has an opportunity to take a step forward.    The United States is currently one of just seven countries--just  seven--including China and North Korea, that permits elective abortions  after 20 weeks. It is time we began to remedy this obvious and tragic  moral wrong. The long-overdue legislation that we will be voting on  soon would do just that.   I am pleased to have filed cloture on this bill to protect unborn  children who are capable of feeling pain. I am proud to cosponsor it,  along with many of my colleagues, and I look forward to voting for it  early next week.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session for a period of morning business, with  Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m.,  Thursday, January 25; further, that following the prayer and pledge,  the morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be  approved to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their  use later in the day, and morning business be closed; finally, that  following leader remarks, the Senate proceed to executive session and  resume consideration of the James nomination.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 6:02 p.m., adjourned until  Thursday, January 25, 2018, at 10 a.m.                            ____________________
