 Mr. President, today I have introduced the Encouraging  Americans to Save Act (EASA). This legislation makes common sense  reforms to the saver's tax credit by making the credit refundable and  restructuring it as a government matching contribution that is directly  deposited into a taxpayer's retirement savings account. This bill would  offer matching contributions for the first time to millions of middle  and low income individuals not covered by an employer-sponsored  retirement plan, including those who save through an IRA under a state  or local government savings program--such as workers in my home State  of Oregon under the OregonSaves program. The government match is also  available to middle and lower income savers who participate in an  employer-sponsored plan. The government match provided by the bill  would both encourage saving and help middle and low income earners  build assets by providing an immediate, meaningful return on their  personal contributions. The legislation would also establish a  coronavirus bonus recovery credit that would provide an additional  government match of up to $5,000 to workers on their retirement saving  for a five year period. I urge my colleagues to support this  legislation.                                  ______                                         By Mr. PADILLA (for himself, Mrs. Feinstein, and Mr. Ossoff):   S. 2454. A bill to amend the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to  reauthorize the pilot program for alternative water source projects,  and for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public  Works.
