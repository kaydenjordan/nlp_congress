 Mr. President, what has happened in the years since  Democrats forced ObamaCare on our country? Health choices have  plummeted downward year after year. Health costs have skyrocketed  higher year after year. And what have Democrats, who promised the  opposite, done all these years since, as Republicans repeatedly warned  we had to act before ObamaCare hurt more Americans on its inevitable  path to collapse? Well, they have done basically nothing. They said we  were exaggerating. They were wrong. They said things would get better.  They got even worse. Rather than work with us to fix healthcare, they  pretended things were fine, while more Americans got hurt.   So you can imagine my surprise when Democrats recently sent a letter  that essentially conceded that the status quo of ObamaCare is  unsustainable. Was it because they actually wanted to work together on  reform? I sure wish that were the case, but so far it seems part of a  new strategy to--get this--blame someone other than themselves for the  failures of ObamaCare. Did they actually think anyone was going to buy  this? Come on.   Just the other day, a bombshell report came out that reminded us  exactly where the blame for ObamaCare's failures has always belonged.  The blame belongs with ObamaCare. The official report said that since  ObamaCare's full enactment in 2013, premiums had, on average, doubled  in the vast majority of States that use ObamaCare's Federal exchange,  and premiums even tripled in a handful of others. Think about that.  Premiums doubled in the vast majority of these States, and premiums  tripled in a handful of others. There is no serious way to now try to  spin away these years and years of ObamaCare's failures on cost.   By the same token, there is no serious way to try to spin away or  ignore the years and years of ObamaCare's failures on choice. Just take  a look at the chart behind me. It shows that 49 percent of the counties  in my State have just one insurer. Half of the counties--one choice.  And when you have one choice, you have no choice at all. That is the  latest in a long-term trend we have seen under ObamaCare. To add insult  to injury, predictions show that next year could be even worse for  families when it comes to their choices under this law.   Unfortunately, my State is not alone either. This year, there are 26  States with at least 1 county where residents have just 1 insurance  option under ObamaCare. That means millions of Americans living in more  than 1,000 counties across our country really have no choice at all.   Thanks to ObamaCare, things could again get even worse next year.  Just yesterday, tens of thousands of Missourians across 25 counties-- from small towns to Kansas City--learned that they may join the ranks  of Americans without a single insurance option to choose from next  year--not one--thanks to ObamaCare and its years-long trend of fewer  and fewer choices.   Does any of that sound like what Americans were promised?   A mother in Louisville recently wrote to my office begging for  Members of Congress to address the failures.  [[Page S3160]]  ``Middle class Kentuckians are hurting because of ObamaCare,'' she  said. ``Residents [have] little choice for health plans'' and ``our  family is not the only one suffering from the high costs of health  insurance.'' She concluded, ``I hope you will push hard to fix our  healthcare system.''   I know many of my colleagues have received letters like this one from  their constituents as well.   ObamaCare has caused so much pain for families across our country,  and it is not going to just magically somehow get better on its own. I  know that, like so many families across the country, I am not satisfied  with the ObamaCare status quo, and I don't think it is acceptable for  its failures to be considered the new normal. As the people of Kentucky  have shown in election after election, they don't either.   Senate Republicans are working together to move past the problems of  ObamaCare and to help those who have been hurt by it. We would love for  Democrats to join us. Democrats have already effectively conceded that  ObamaCare has failed. Now the question is, Will they work with us to  actually fix this mess, or will they waste more time in some futile  attempt to now redirect blame? The ObamaCare status quo is  unsustainable. It is indefensible, and we have to move beyond it before  more Americans get hurt.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on another matter, later today Senators  will vote to confirm Judge Amul Thapar of Kentucky to the U.S. Appeals  Court for the Sixth Circuit. Judge Thapar will make an outstanding  addition to the U.S. Appeals Court for the Sixth Circuit. He has a  reputation as a qualified judge with an impressive legal mind. He will  fairly apply the law to all those who enter his courtroom because, in  Judge Thapar's own words, ``the most important attribute of a judge is  to be open-minded and not to prejudice a case without reading the  briefs, researching the law, and hearing from the parties.''   In 2007, President Bush nominated him to be a U.S. district judge for  the Eastern District of Kentucky. At that time, the Senate confirmed  his nomination on a voice vote, and Judge Thapar became the first South  Asian American Federal judge in the history of our country. When we  confirm him to the Sixth Circuit later today, he will be the second  South Asian American judge ever to serve on a Federal circuit court.   Judge Thapar has been recognized for his work on the bench. The most  recent edition of the Almanac of the Federal Judiciary quoted attorneys  who ``agreed that Thapar has excellent legal ability.'' Additionally,  the American Bar Association, which prominent Senate Democrats have  called ``the gold standard'' for evaluating judges, awarded him its  highest rating--unanimously ``well qualified.'' In other words, the  people involved in rating him couldn't find anybody who didn't say he  was well qualified. That is the highest rating one can achieve.   Judge Thapar has the necessary credentials, integrity, and respect  from his colleagues to join the Sixth Circuit. I am proud to support  him, and I urge all Senators to vote to confirm Judge Thapar's  nomination later today.                            ____________________     Mr. President, as we approach the Memorial Day  weekend, we are reminded of the great sacrifices so many men and women  in uniform have made on our behalf throughout the years. The  servicemembers whose memory we honor paid the ultimate price in  defending our Nation, our families, and our freedom. We are forever  indebted to them. But as we reflect upon the fallen soldiers, sailors,  airmen, and marines, we are also reminded of the responsibility we have  to the heroes who have returned home--our veterans.   I don't have to tell colleagues how important keeping our commitment  to our veterans is. We have an All-Volunteer Force. We cannot break  faith with the Americans who bravely and willingly fight on our behalf.  One way we can honor them is by working to ensure that they receive the  quality, timely care they need through the Department of Veterans  Affairs. That is why, after the State work period, we will be taking up  a bipartisan bill reported out of committee just yesterday that will  enhance accountability at the VA, improve the care veterans receive,  and empower the VA with the tools necessary to remove employees who are  failing to perform at the high-quality level our Nation's heroes richly  deserve. Importantly, this bill--the Department of Veterans Affairs  Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act--will build on progress  we have already made with the 2014 Veterans Access, Choice, and  Accountability Act.   We know that many challenges remain in ensuring that veterans have  access to the care they need and deserve at the VA, but this  legislation will further improve our ability to meet our commitment to  them. I appreciate Chairman Isakson for his continued efficacy on  behalf of our veterans, as well as Senator Rubio for his leadership on  this critical legislation. I look forward to the full Senate taking up  the bill and passing it soon.                            ____________________     One final matter, Mr. President. Next week on June 1,  the Commonwealth of Kentucky will celebrate the 225th anniversary of  its admittance as a State into the Union. Originally part of Virginia  known as the Kentucky County, it became the 15th State of this Nation  in 1792. So today I rise to celebrate my home State of Kentucky, the  Commonwealth of Kentucky, a place the Native American Wyandot Nation  called the ``land of tomorrow.''   Once considered the far western frontier, Kentucky has developed into  a State with diverse industries, a strong heritage, and international  prominence.   When you think about my home State, many things follow as distinctly  Kentuckian. The natural beauty of our mountains, farmlands, and  riverways foster deep love. Blessed with fertile land and an abundance  of coal, Kentucky's cultural heritage has developed in both the fields  and the mines. The proud tradition of the Commonwealth includes bourbon  and basketball, but also pioneers, statesmen, artists, scholars, and  athletes.   From the days of Daniel Boone's heroic exploration through the  Cumberland Gap, Kentucky has been home to numerous courageous men and  women. The trailblazing spirit has animated Kentuckians from all walks  of life throughout the generations. A pioneer of abdominal surgery,  Ephraim McDowell expanded the boundaries of medical science. Tori  Murden McClure rowed across the Atlantic Ocean as the first American  and first woman to brave the waters alone. Responsible for a world  famous fried chicken recipe, Colonel Harland Sanders franchised his  store at the age of 62 and taught us all that it is never too late to  chase our passion. Acclaimed news anchor Diane Sawyer, born in Glasgow,  began her career as a weather forecaster in Louisville. Muhammad Ali,  an international sports legend, became a global ambassador for peace.   The Commonwealth has given rise to statesmen who have defended the  Union, protected our liberties, and represented Kentucky values.  Leaders like Henry Clay, Abraham Lincoln, and Alben Barkley each left  an indelible imprint on the history of our Nation. Civil rights icon  Georgia Powers fought against racial injustice in our State, inspired  Kentucky to open public accommodations, and was the first African  American to serve in the Kentucky State Senate.   Kentucky's poets, musicians, and actors have garnered international  acclaim for their craft. Jesse Stuart's poems and short stories  captured the beauty of Kentucky's mountains, and Pulitzer Prize winning  author Robert Penn Warren described the unbreakable link between poetry  and democracy. The National Quilt Museum in Paducah is a global center  of creativity and tourism. Kentucky is also home to music legends and  Grammy Award winners like Loretta Lynn and Chris Stapleton and the  birthplace of entertainment stars such as Jennifer Lawrence, George  Clooney, and Johnny Depp.   In the world's greatest college basketball rivalry between the  University  [[Page S3161]]  of Louisville and the University of Kentucky, legendary coaches and  unforgettable players have, for decades, kept fans on the edges of  their seats until the final buzzer. For over 140 years, the Kentucky  Derby has been known as a mile and a quarter that makes champions and  brings the eyes of the world to Louisville.   I am exceptionally proud to represent Kentucky in the U.S. Senate,  and I am forever grateful to the people of my home State for giving me  the opportunity to do just that. Kentucky has a distinguished history,  and I am confident that trailblazers and pioneers from across the  Bluegrass State will continue to make it the land of tomorrow. It is my  honor to call the Commonwealth my home, and I look forward to  celebrating this 225th anniversary next week.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following  leader remarks on Monday, June 5, the Senate proceed to the  consideration of Calendar No. 107, S.
