 President, today I wish to pay tribute to MG Mark  Berry for his exemplary dedication to duty and service as the adjutant  general for the Arkansas National Guard. General Berry is retiring from  his position on August 10, 2019.   A Texas native, General Berry enlisted in the Air Force in August  1974. He also furthered his education while serving, receiving a  bachelor of aeronautics from Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University and  earning a masters of public administration from Golden Gate University.   Major General Berry has served the United States in a broad capacity  during his 45-year career with the Armed Forces. Upon completion of  basic training, he began technical training as an air traffic  controller. In 1985, he attended officer training school with follow-on  training as an air traffic control officer. General Berry separated  from his Active-Duty role in September 1992 to join the Arkansas Air  National Guard as a public affairs officer.   During his time in the National Guard, he served as a communication  flight commander, mission support group commander, and maintenance  group commander. In the State of Arkansas, Berry served as the vice- chairman of the Air National Guard A-10 Aircraft Maintenance Council  until receiving the honor of becoming the president of the National  Guard Association of Arkansas. In 2015, General Berry was given his  most distinguished assignment when he was appointed adjutant general  for the Arkansas National Guard.   Throughout his time in Arkansas, I have worked closely with General  Berry to ensure our National Guard not only meets but exceeds the  standards needed to protect our State and country. During times of  crisis or disaster in the State, General Berry made certain the  National Guard was prepared and able to respond quickly and  effectively. He has represented himself, the Arkansas Guard, and our  Armed Forces with consistent professionalism, diligence, and  commitment. I have nothing but respect and gratitude for the job he has  done as the leader of our State's National Guard.  [[Page S4905]]    Major General Berry has received numerous awards and recognitions for  his service to the United States during his career, including the  Legion of Merit for exceptional conduct in the performance of his  services to our Nation, and has had a positive impact on the lives of  many servicemembers, peers, and superiors. His accomplishments reflect  highly not only on himself, but also on the men and women of our  Nation's military. As his time in uniform comes to an end, we honor his  dedication to our country and his invaluable service to the U.S. Air  Force and Arkansas National Guard.   It was a genuine pleasure to have worked with MG Mark Berry  throughout his years serving his country and our State. I commend  General Berry for his exceptional service and decorated career and  greatly appreciate his friendship of many years. We wish him all the  best as he begins his retirement from the U.S. Armed Forces.                            ____________________
