 Mr. President, I came here mostly to support my colleagues  and to actually listen for an objection to a bill like this. For the  short time I have been here, what a rude awakening as to what can  happen.   Everything I have heard here makes sense, and I would just ask for  the citizens across this country and for Hoosiers to weigh in. Let your  Senators know that this is a step too far when something like this  occurs in this Chamber, when it is crystallized so simply. You are  either for or against infanticide, and I never imagined I would be  seeing this so early in my tenure here. I ask for the folks across this  country to make their voices heard because this is a tragedy that has  happened.   I yield the floor.
