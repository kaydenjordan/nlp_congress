 Reserving the right to object.    Madam President, I respect the views of my colleagues. I  respect the views of this colleague especially, and he knows that. We  don't always agree on everything or even, maybe, most things, but I  think it is important we be able to find ways to disagree without being  disagreeable.   I understand that the senior Senator from Utah is here today because  he disagrees with a particular policy. That is certainly his right, his  prerogative. He is welcome to register his views, as we all are.   For instance, we have heard our friend from Utah defend the  principles of limited government and our system of federalism on this  floor many times. I have heard him and other colleagues of ours argue  with passion that the Federal Government should not be in the business  of interfering in State or local matters.   Yet here we are, as our Republican colleagues try to tell a local  government, once again, what it can and cannot do. The Senator from  Utah has introduced a resolution that seeks to overturn a law passed by  the duly elected council of the District of Columbia.   I am not here to debate the merits of this law. After all, I was not  elected by the people living in the District of Columbia. In fact, no  one, as far as I know, in this room was elected by the people of the  District of Columbia.   But the reason that these Senators have the ability to try to  overturn a law passed by the local DC government is that the over  700,000 individuals who call the District of Columbia home continue to  be denied full representation in Congress--in fact, any representation  here in the U.S. Senate.   Under current law, Congress reviews all legislation passed by the DC  Council before it can become law. The District of Columbia is not  allowed to even control its own budget. The Mayor of DC cannot even  deploy the men and women of the National Guard in case of emergency, a  right every other State executive can utilize. If this were the case  for any other State or local government, there would rightfully be an  outcry from the citizens of that State or local government.   I don't believe that our colleague from Utah would take kindly to me  or any of us in this body telling the city council in, say, Salt Lake  City--a city with just under 200,000 residents--what laws they could or  could not pass, and he would be right. He would be right. Luckily, the  people of Salt Lake City have a Senator who has come to Washington,  speaks his mind on the Senate floor, and votes to advance the interests  of not just Salt Lake City citizens but the rest of Utah as well. I  think that is really, in its essence, all that the people of  Washington, DC, are looking for.   For me, the issue of DC statehood is not a Democratic or Republican  issue; it is a simple issue of basic fairness. For a Nation whose  founding mantra--``no taxation without representation''--inspired the  longest running experiment in democracy, we should all be concerned  that today more than 700,000 tax-paying Americans, over two-thirds of  whom are people of color, continue to be denied a vote here in this  body.   Our Nation's Capital is home to more than just monuments and museums.  It is a home to American families who go to work, to Americans who  start businesses, to Americans who pay their taxes, to Americans who  serve our country in times of war and peace, and to Americans who are  still denied representation. Again, it is home to veterans and  servicemembers who have signed up to protect our freedoms, who have  risked their lives for our country and are still denied the ability to  have a say in our Nation's future. It is home to the hundreds of  Capitol Police officers who come to work every day in the Nation's  Capital to keep us safe and are still denied a vote in the very  institution they protect.   For generations, those who call the District of Columbia home have  been denied the right to fully participate in our democracy, and that  is why we are here today. That is why our Republican colleagues can  call this vote to silence the decisions made by local leaders that DC  residents have voted into office. That is why they can exercise this  Federal overreach here today.   I said at the beginning of my remarks that my colleagues and I don't  always agree on everything, but we do agree on quite a bit. But I  strongly agree and want to associate myself with the words of Senator  Mike Lee in, I think it was 2018, just a couple of years ago. He said  then:         We should allow each unique community to develop unique       solutions according to the unique local preferences, and       leave it at that.    Let me just repeat that.         We should allow each unique community to develop unique       solutions according to unique local preferences, and leave it       at that.    I could not agree more. I think it is incumbent upon all of us who  care deeply for our democracy and the rights of all Americans to take  up the cause of our fellow citizens in the District of Columbia and use  our voices to call out this historic injustice and finally right this  wrong.   With that, I stand opposed to Senator Lee's joint resolution   I yield the floor.    Objection.
