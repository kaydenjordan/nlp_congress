 Mr. President, this is a classic example of everything has  been said but not everybody has said it yet. One of the great  traditions of the Senate is to be sure everybody says it. We are going  to say it now, and we will  [[Page S6076]]  continue to say it until the House finally has that vote.   It has been pointed out that this agreement was signed well over a  year ago. It has been pointed out that our two biggest trading partners  are Mexico and Canada, in that order. It has been pointed out that  there is lots of focus on agriculture. Every State is an agriculture  State. Every State has that as a significant part of their economy.  Nobody in the world does that part of the economy more efficiently or  more effectively than we do. So that is important. It is important to  realize that lots of other things are in trade, as well, but  agriculture has to be mentioned a lot until we get this done.   Whether I was at the Missouri State Fair in August or the roundtable  meetings I was at in our State in October, cost comes up--$88 billion  is the agricultural economy in Missouri. We are about the same amount.  I think Senator Hoeven said his State is in the top 10. Ours is too. We  export about $4 billion worth of ag products. We also export pickup  trucks and airplanes and lots of technology from our State. We export  our fair share of beer cans and other things that go all over the  world. We are going to continue to make that happen.   Opening markets make a big difference. It also makes a big difference  in how you look at the world. If you have strong trading relationships,  you are pretty careful with how you deal with all those other  relationships. We need to do that. We need to have this vote. The votes  are in the House. The votes are in the Senate. It is up to the Speaker  to bring this up.   I think the U.S. Trade Representative is working as hard with  Democrats in the House as he could possibly be expected to do to maybe  look at those last few things that might make this a better deal.   Senator Portman did a great job talking about why the choice here is  if you want to continue to have NAFTA--which has been great for all  three partners, Canada, Mexico, and us--or do you want to have USMCA,  which in area after area has the 20-year update it needs.   We need to get on with this. We need to get on with the activities of  the day.                           Remembering Ted Stevens    Mr. President, I am going to start off by saying one of the things we  are going to do today is accept the official portrait of Ted Stevens,  President pro tempore of the Senate--the highest office that the Senate  can possibly give to anybody. It is the highest office in the Senate.   He was the chairman one time of the Commerce Committee, chairman of  the appropriating committee, and a guy who flew those tough planes in  the toughest areas in World War II.   He was a person who always did his best to try to figure out the  Senate and then be sure that the Senate worked for America and the  Senate worked for Alaska. When it came to both of those things, it was  hard to beat Ted Stevens' best. He knew how to make this place work.   He would be disappointed in the dysfunction we see right now, but he  would be optimistic that in the greatest country in the world, we will  figure this out. All of us who had a chance to serve with him--I had a  great relationship with him when I was a House Member. I learned a lot.  I think of him often. I miss the way he represented his State and our  country so uniquely and so dynamically and so effectively.   I look forward to not only the recognition here on the floor that he  will receive today but the permanent recognition he will receive as we  today hang his portrait in the U.S. Capitol.   I yield the floor.
