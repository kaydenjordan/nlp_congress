 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 5, the  Equality Act, a critical piece of civil rights legislation.   Half a century ago, the Fair Housing Act and the Equal Credit  Opportunity Act became law. But we know that housing and lending  discrimination remains a widespread problem. Former President Trump and  his administration were shameful and cruel adversaries to justice and  civil rights and worked to gut protections against housing and lending  discrimination.   According to the National Fair Housing Alliance, sex discrimination  made up the fourth greatest basis for complaints in 2019. As housing  discrimination continues to harm an estimated 6 to 8 million people in  the U.S., LGBTQ-plus youth, in particular, remain at greater risk of  homelessness compared to non-LGBTQ-plus youth, and same-sex couples are  more likely to be denied a mortgage loan compared to hetero-sex  couples.   This legislation takes key steps to codify existing protections for  our LGBTQ-plus neighbors under civil rights statutes, including the  Fair Housing Act and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, and is similar  to provisions included in H.R. 166, a fair lending proposal by  Representative Al Green. My committee has convened several hearings on  this topic, including one this week, about ongoing lending  discrimination.   I thank Representative Cicilline for authoring this bill and Chair  Nadler for his leadership. I urge my colleagues to please support this  important bill that will ensure equal access to housing and wealth- building opportunities for generations to come by expressly prohibiting  discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity.
