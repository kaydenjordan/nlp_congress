 Mr. President, I rise to urge my colleagues to support  passage of H.R. 1799, the PPP Extension Act of 2021. It is imperative  that we act immediately to pass this bill because we are just days away  from the PPP being closed to applications for assistance. This bill  mirrors legislation I introduced with my colleagues, Senators Cardin  and Shaheen, which is cosponsored by Senators Marshall, Sullivan,  Rosen, Murkowski, Leahy, Wyden, Tillis, Ossoff, Capito, Merkley,  Heinrich, Portman, Klobuchar, and Manchin.   Last March, Senators Rubio, Cardin, Shaheen, and I crafted the  Paycheck Protection Program, PPP--a forgivable loan program designed to  help keep small employers afloat and their employees paid during the  pandemic.   The bipartisan bill we are considering today would simply extend the  current application deadline for new PPP loans from March 31 to May 31  of this year and then provide an additional 30-day period during which  time the Small Business Administration may continue processing  applications received prior to the new May 31 deadline. This bipartisan  bill passed the House last week by an overwhelming margin of 415 to 3.   The PPP has been a lifeline for small businesses in Maine and across  the country, providing the support they need to survive the pandemic  and continue paying their employees. In 2020, more than 5 million small  employers received forgivable PPP loans, helping to sustain upwards of  50 million American jobs. This included more than 28,000 Maine small  businesses, which received nearly $2.3 billion in forgivable PPP loans.  The average loan size in Maine during this time was $80,000.   Recognizing the importance of this program for our Nation's small  employers, the bipartisan December 2020 COVID-relief law provided an  additional $284.5 billion to reopen the Paycheck Protection Program and  allow the hardest hit small employers to receive a second forgivable  loan. The December law also made other improvements to the PPP, such as  expanding forgivable overhead expenses to include supplier costs and  investments in facility modifications and personal protective equipment  needed to operate safely.   Since reopening in January, more than 3.1 million additional  forgivable loans--totaling nearly $196 billion--have been approved for  small businesses across the country. In Maine, more than 12,700 small  employers have  [[Page S1798]]  been approved for $797 million in forgivable loans since PPP's  reopening. In total, Maine small employers have been approved for  upwards of $3 billion in forgivable loans since the program was created  last year.   I have heard from numerous small employers about the impact this  program has had on them and their employees. The PPP has helped the  owners of Pottle Transportation in Hermon, Anglers Restaurants in  Hampden, and the Harraseeket Inn in Freeport keep their businesses  alive and their employees paid. Hodgdon, America's oldest boat builder,  was able to keep its family-owned East Boothbay business in operation  with the help of two forgivable PPP loans. The owner of Channel X Radio  in Aroostook County told me that two forgivable PPP loans kept his  business going. The Boys & Girls Clubs of Southern Maine and the Y in  Bangor have been able to provide childcare and other services to  children due to support from the PPP.   With the ongoing distribution of COVID-19 vaccines and reopening of  our Nation's economy, I am hopeful that better times will soon be  ahead. We are not there yet, which is why we need to extend the  deadline to apply for new PPP loans. Extending the deadline would  provide more time for the Small Business Administration to resolve  error messages generated by its computer systems that prevented  eligible small businesses from receiving approval for a PPP Loan. It  would also give us more time to address an inequity facing certain sole  proprietors who received their PPP loans before the Biden  administration unexpectedly announced a change in the maximum loan  amount calculation for these types of businesses.   By extending the PPP for another 2 months and then providing an  additional 30 days after that time for the SBA to process applications  that are still pending, the bill before us today would help our  Nation's small employers retain access to forgivable PPP loans.   This bill has been endorsed by more than 90 organizations, including  the National Federation of Independent Business, U.S. Chamber of  Commerce, American Hotel & Lodging Association, International Franchise  Association, National Restaurant Association, the U.S. Travel  Association, and the Independent Community Bankers of America. I would  ask unanimous consent that these letters of support be printed in the  Record at the conclusion of my statement.   I would like to once again thank my colleagues, Senators Cardin and  Shaheen, for partnering with me on this legislation, and Senator Rubio  for working to craft the PPP and oversee its implementation. I look  forward to working with them and the new administrator of the Small  Business Administration to ensure that the PPP is implemented according  to Congressional intent.   I urge my colleagues to support passage of this bill.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                   Consumer Bankers Association,                                     Washington, DC, March 15, 2021.      Hon. Susan Collins,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.      Hon. Ben Cardin,      Chairman, U.S. Senate Committee on Small Business,           Washington, DC.      Hon. Jeanne Shaheen,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.        Dear Senator Collins, Chairman Cardin, and Senator Shaheen:       On behalf of the Consumer Bankers Association (CBA), I write       to express our support of S. 723, The PPP Extension Act of       2021. I thank you for your continued leadership as our nation       rises to meet the challenges posed by the COVID-19 crisis.       CBA commends the work of Congress, the Small Business       Administration (SBA), and all the lenders across the country       who together worked dutifully to make the Paycheck Protection       Program (PPP) a reality and provide much needed relief to       millions of small businesses.        Lenders remain committed to serve their small business       customers and have engaged considerable resources to process       PPP loan applications so they can ensure our nation's small       businesses have the support they need to endure these       challenging economic times. Unfortunately, operational       changes made by SBA during this current round of PPP lending       has slowed the funding of PPP loan applications.        With just weeks before the program sunsets, our members are       working tirelessly to resolve complications with the       processing and approval of PPP applications. Issues flagged       during SBA's processing of applications, such as loan hold       and error codes, continue to be major hurdles for successful       PPP funding. Despite lenders' efforts to work with their       customers and the SBA to quickly resolve them, these issues       continue to significantly delay the funding of requests to       businesses that have very pressing financial concerns. This,       coupled with the recent changes by the SBA allowing Schedule       C borrowers to qualify for more PPP relief, makes it       imperative that more time is provided.        Extending the PPP and providing a window for lenders and       the SBA to process received applications will ensure any       small business that wants access to the program is able to do       so. The PPP Extension Act of 2021 will provide the SBA,       lenders, and small businesses the critical time that is       needed to properly implement recent alterations to the       program and resolve any outstanding processing issues,       ultimately allowing small businesses to fully realize the       benefits of the PPP.        Again, thank you for your time and consideration on these       important matters. CBA and our members remain eager to work       with Congress and the SBA to help small businesses in these       uncertain economic times.            Sincerely,                                                   Richard Hunt,                                                  President and CEO,      Consumer Bankers Association.                                   ____                                                     March 15, 2021.      Hon. Ben Cardin,      Chair, Senate Small Business Committee,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Susan Collins,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.      Hon. Jeanne Shaheen,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.      Hon. Carolyn Bourdeaux,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Nydia Velazquez,      Chair, House Small Business Committee, Washington, DC.      Hon. Blaine Luetkemeyer,      Ranking Member, House Small Business Committee, Washington,           DC.      Hon. Young Kim,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Senators Cardin, Collins and Shaheen and       Representatives Velazquez, Luetkemeyer, Bourdeaux and Kim:       The undersigned organizations are writing to thank you for       your bicameral leadership and swift bipartisan action to       provide relief to America's small businesses through this       economic emergency. We strongly support the PPP Extension Act       of 2021, which will extend the Small Business       Administration's (SBA) Paycheck Protection Program (PPP)       application period beyond the March 31, 2021 sunset date.        While we realize the Small Business Administration (SBA) is       under tremendous time constraints and is struggling with       internal resource issues, our members are highly concerned by       the lack of progress on major Paycheck Protection Program       (PPP) processing issues, including hold/error codes and       application rejections due to Taxpayer Identification Number       (``TIN'') issues or mismatches, in addition to many       unresolved technical problems with the current PPP process.       These delays and denials may put many applicants in danger of       not making the March 31st authorization deadline.        Nearly one year into the COVID-19 pandemic, the continued       liquidity challenges of the small business sector are acute,       especially for those business limited by dramatic capacity       restrictions and other critical health and safety protocols       in place to protect the public, consumers and workers from       COVID-19. Thank you for extending the window of opportunity       for pandemic programs to effectively impact the affected       small business sector, especially those traditionally under-      invested and underserved groups which must also be given the       chance to succeed.        We stand ready to work with you during this critical       moment, and thank you for considering our views.

Hon. Ben Cardin,      Chairman, Committee on Small Business & Entrepreneurship,           U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.      Hon. Susan Collins,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.      Hon. Jeanne Shaheen,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Cardin and Senators Collins and Shaheen: On       behalf of community banks across the country, with more than       50,000 locations, I write to thank you for introducing the       PPP Extension Act of 2021 (S. 723). This legislation is       needed to ensure that thousands of Paycheck Protection       Program applicants--small businesses, churches, and other       non-profit employers--are not stranded by an abrupt shutdown       of the Program and would do so using funds that have already       been appropriated.        Community banks are doing everything in their power to       complete and submit PPP applications to the SBA before the       March 31 deadline. Unfortunately, they have no assurances       that qualified applications submitted timely will be       approved. The CARES Act does not allow for approval of       applications after March 31, regardless of when they were       submitted and the quality of the applications. Unless a       statutory change is made, thousands of applications will be       rejected simply because the clock has run out.        This outcome would be especially unfair because of the       thousands of applications have been in limbo at the SBA for       weeks because they were flagged and put on hold by an       automated program for possible waste, fraud, or abuse. These       applications require SBA review in order to be cleared of       holds and approved for funding. If they cannot be cleared by       March 31, cash starved applicants and the people they employ       will be denied access to funds they had anticipated and       planned for. We do not believe this outcome was intended by       Congress.        The PPP Extension Act would resolve this problem by       extending the application deadline until May 31 and creating       a second deadline of June 30 for SBA approval. This will give       applicants more time, and the two-tiered deadline will ensure       the Program does not end abruptly.   additional changes needed to ensure equitable distribution of ppp funds         Any extension of the deadline will give Congress the       opportunity to refine and improve the Program rules and       formulas to ensure equitable distribution of funds to those       borrowers that can make the best use of them. ICBA urges       Congress and the SBA to make fixes to resolve the problems       identified below.        First Draw Increase Eligibility. Certain borrowers who have       not yet filed for and received forgiveness of their first       draw 2020 PPP loan may apply for an increase in that loan.       However, borrowers whose first draw 2020 loans have already       been forgiven cannot apply for a first draw loan increase,       even if they otherwise meet the criteria for an increase.       This is unfair because it punishes borrowers who filed       forgiveness applications early. The statute should be amended       to allow borrowers who have received first draw loan       forgiveness to be eligible to receive a first draw loan       increase.        Second Draw Eligibility. Those applying for a first draw in       2021 should be allowed access to a second draw. Community       bankers have solicited and received numerous applications for       first draw loans in 2021. In many cases, these applicants       would have applied for first draw loans in 2020, if they had       the benefit of better information and advice, and would now       be eligible for second draw loans. They have effectively left       money on the table that could be used for critical       expenditures.        Second Draw Use of Proceeds Requirement. Borrowers with a       modest shortfall in using first draw dollars for eligible       purposes shouldn't be shut out from second draw loans,       especially if they've already repaid the remaining balance on       the first draw loan. Congress should consider creating a       percentage-based de minimis test to define a level of       spending on ineligible expenses that would not disqualify a       borrower for a second draw loan.        Farm Partnerships. Current law allows self-employed farmers       and ranchers that report farm income on Schedule F to use the       gross income method, rather than the net income method, to       calculate their maximum loan amount and owner's compensation.       However, SBA has limited this treatment to 1040 Schedule F       filers. It is not available to thousands of self-employed       farmers and ranchers whose businesses are organized as       partnerships or S corporations. Congress should direct the       SBA to make the gross income method available to these       farmers and ranchers.        Schedule C Borrowers. Schedule C filers should be able to       apply for an increase under new SBA rules that allow Schedule       C borrowers with no employees to use gross income rather than       net profit to determine the loan amount. This is a welcome       change, but those borrowers who have already obtained loans       have no opportunity to apply for an increase based on the new       rules. They may qualify for significantly larger loans but       are effectively being punished for submitting their       applications early.        Save Our Stages Applicants. Live action venues eligible for       Save Our Stages grants should be allowed to apply for PPP       loans while waiting to find out if they will receive a grant.       If such a venue eventually does receive a grant, the amount       of the grant could be reduced by the amount of the PPP loan,       thereby avoiding the double dipping prohibited by the       statute.        Thank you again for introducing the PPP Extension Act. We       look forward to working with you to advance this important       legislation. We urge you to use this opportunity to address       the problems with the Program discussed above.            Sincerely,                                              Rebeca Romero Rainey,      President & CEO.                                   ____                                                             NFIB,                                                     March 25, 2021.        Dear Senator: On behalf of NFIB, the nation's leading small       business advocacy organization, I write in support of H.R.       1799, the PPP Extension Act of 2021, which will extend       authorization for the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP)       beyond March 31, 2021. H.R. 1799 will be considered an NFIB       Key Vote for the 117th Congress.        NFIB research indicates economic conditions remain       challenging for our nation's small businesses. According to       NFIB's latest monthly survey, small business optimism remains       below its historic 47-year average. Small business owners       expecting better business conditions over the next six months       remains at a net negative 19%, a poor reading. Moreover, the       economic recovery continues to be uneven for small       businesses, especially those still managing state and local       regulations and restrictions, with 15% recently reporting       that they will have to close their doors if current economic       conditions do not improve over the next six months.        Many small business owners are continuing to evaluate their       financial needs as they assess the future of government       restrictions on their businesses as well as progress in       controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. Unfortunately, the       timeframe for making decisions regarding a first or second       draw PPP loan after passage of the Consolidated       Appropriations Act of 2021 has been short, particularly as       Congress and the Administration have recently made additional       changes to the program.        For these reasons and given the high level of uncertainty       over future economic conditions, it makes sense to extend the       authorization of the PPP program through May 31, 2021 to give       small businesses additional time to consider their needs and       apply. NFIB is also pleased that this legislation will       provide an additional 30 days for SBA to process pending       applications, which will help to ensure small businesses are       not unfairly harmed by PPP processing delays, which continue       to pose a challenge to the program.  [[Page S1800]]         NFIB supports H.R. 1799, the PPP Extension Act of 2021 and       will consider final passage of the legislation as an NFIB Key       Vote for the 117th Congress.            Sincerely,                                                  Kevin Kuhlman,                                                     Vice President,                                Federal Government Relations, NFIB.     Mr. President, I urge all of our colleagues to vote yes  on this bill, which will provide a crucial 2-month extension for the  Paycheck Protection Program.   This program has been a lifeline to countless small businesses and  has saved more than 50 million jobs in this country.   I salute my colleagues Senator Cardin and Senator Shaheen for their  work on this extension, which was overwhelmingly passed by the House.   Let's talk about briefly what would happen if we do not act. If we do  not act, there are approximately 190,000 loans still under review,  which prevents any of these businesses from receiving a second PPP  loan. These small businesses need this assistance now in order to pay  their employees and stay afloat during this pandemic.   We cannot wait. The House has gone home. We cannot allow an  interruption of this vital program that has made such a difference to  our small businesses and their employees.   I urge all of my colleagues to support this 2-month extension, with  an additional month for SBA to review the applications.                              Vote on H.R. 1799     Mr. President.    Mr. President, I rise today to support the Shaheen- Collins substitute to prevent a cut in Medicare reimbursements for  hospitals, nursing homes, home health agencies and other healthcare  providers who continue to care for their patients in this era of COVID.  Congress twice last year suspended the 2-percent Medicare sequester in  bipartisan COVID relief packages, and I hope we can do so once again.   At a time when our country is relying so heavily on our healthcare  providers to help get us back to normal, we cannot ignore the financial  realities they face. Almost half--17 out of 36--of Maine hospitals  finished last year with a negative operating margin. According to  Northern Light Health in Maine, relief from the Medicare sequester  amounts to $1 million per month.   The Shaheen-Collins amendment will extend the current sequester  moratorium until the end of the year. This financial certainty is  needed in these uncertain times.   I urge my colleagues to support the Shaheen-Collins substitute.   Thank you.                          Vote on Amendment No. 1410
