 Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce, along  with the Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. Casey, the Junior Senator from  Delaware, Mr. Coons, the Senator from New Jersey, Mr. Booker, the  Senator from New Jersey, Mr. Menendez, and the Senator from New York,  Mr. Schumer, the Delaware River Basin Conservation Reauthorization Act  of 2022.   The Delaware River Basin Conservation Act became law as part of the  Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act of 2016. This  legislation, which I was proud to lead, responded to the need for  Federal, State, and local governments and regional partners to come  together to identify, prioritize, and implement restoration activities  within the Delaware River Basin. The legislation also created a  nonregulatory grant program for which appropriations have flowed  through the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The National Fish and  Wildlife Foundation has done an excellent job of working with the Fish  and Wildlife Service to administer the Delaware Watershed Conservation  Fund under the authority of this act.   In just a few short years, this program has grown tremendously. To  date, the Delaware Watershed Conservation Fund has awarded more than  $25 million to projects that support recreation, water quality, water  management, and habitat. Grantees have matched that investment by a  ratio of nearly 2 to 1--an impressive total conservation impact of over  $70 million.   This program is a great example of how when the government--at all  levels--works with diverse suites of nongovernment stakeholders, we can  achieve meaningful results on the ground that improve the lives of  people and wildlife alike.   For example, the program has funded several diverse projects in  Delaware, including installing pollinator gardens at places of worship,  removing a dam in White Clay Creek, improving fish passage in the  Brandywine River, and restoring wetlands at our national wildlife  refuges. These restoration efforts protect the species we love, clean  up our drinking water, and provide a boost to local tourism.   The legislation I am introducing today would reauthorize the Delaware  River Basin Conservation Act and make some minor improvements to allow  even better results on the ground throughout the Delaware River  Watershed. This reauthorization has clear benefits for our environment  and economy--a win-win for Delaware and our region.   I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact this important  legislation this Congress. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the  bill I am introducing today appear in the Record following my  statement.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 3767         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.
