 DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I thank the chair for  yielding me time.   I rise in strong support of H.R. 5314, Protecting Our Democracy Act.   Democracy generates the notion and the idea that people will get and  be engaged, involved, heard, and have their wishes met.   I agree with my colleague from Illinois when he said voters all over  the country vote for us and they send us here. They vote for our  colleagues in the Senate and send them there. We make laws. Then they  expect those laws to be adhered to. No one is above them. No President.   And we are not obsessed with the former President, but we are  obsessed with the idea and the hope that we will never have another  administration like that one. And that is what this legislation is  designed to do.   Madam Speaker, I urge support of this legislation.    DAVIS of Illinois (for himself and Mr.               Burgess):        H.R. 6216.
