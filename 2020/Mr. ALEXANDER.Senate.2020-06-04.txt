 Mr. President, I want to thank the Senator from Alaska  for her eloquent remarks, and I am glad I was here to have a chance to  listen to them, both on equal rights, really, for all Americans. It is  not possible for us to speak on any subject today without recognizing  what is going on in the country.   A couple of comments that come to my mind as I think what happened as  a result of the incident with George Floyd in Minneapolis were, first,  the comment of the leader of the peaceful protest in Nashville. There  were more than 1,000 there. She said, the next day, that she was  disappointed by the rioters and looters because they dishonored the  memory of George Floyd and dishonored the peaceful protest against  racial discrimination. I thought she said that well and expressed the  feeling of most Tennesseans.   The other comment I thought about was that of our colleague Senator  Tim  [[Page S2721]]  Scott of South Carolina, who is one of three African-American Members  of the U.S. Senate. He told us a couple of years ago in a private Bible  study--and I asked him later if I could mention it--that he was stopped  7 times--an African-American man--in his hometown, Charleston, SC, for  being a Black man in the wrong place, even while he was the vice mayor  of his hometown.   I asked him about that again this week. He said: Yes, it happened  again last month. I think most of us don't know that. We don't think  about that--those of us who aren't African American, aren't Black. To  think about that, I think, helps us begin the process of understanding  the feelings that are going on in the country right now, most of which  can't be solved by laws. They will have to be changed by attitudes.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I come to the floor today to make  comments on two other subjects. The first is about a subject that is  concerning about 70, 75 million American families; that is, going back  to college and going back to school. The question is on the minds of  many Americans: Will we be going back to college? Will our children be  going back to school?   We finished a hearing today--the Presiding Officer was present; the  Senator from Alaska was present--on going back to college safely. The  question is not whether we are going back to college in the United  States of America; the question is how to go back safely. We all  understand that when 70, 75 million students go back to college and go  back to school, that is the surest sign that American life is regaining  its rhythm--not just for the students themselves but, especially with  the children, for their parents, most of whom work outside the home.   Today's subject was about college. We had excellent witnesses. We had  Mitch Daniels, the president of Purdue University. He was introduced by  the Senator from Indiana. We had the president of Brown University,  Christina Paxson. We had Logan Hampton, who was president of a small  historically Black college in Jackson, TN, Lane College. And we had the  President of American Public Health Association, Dr. Benjamin. They  talked with us about the various strategies and concerns that existed.   I will, in a few minutes, ask consent to put my opening statement in  the Record, but if I can summarize it, it would be this. Most of our  6,000 public colleges and universities--some public, some private, some  church schools--will be open in August for in-person students but not  all of them. The University of California State system has said so far  that it expects only to offer online courses. But at Purdue, for  example--an institution of 55,000 students--President Daniels has  decided, with the approval of his board, and President Paxson of  Brown--a different kind of institution in the Northeast, different from  Purdue--they both decided it is their obligation to open up and to  create a safe environment for the students to come back.   There are several reasons for this. There is some health risk in  coming back. Of course, wise leadership can address that. But I think,  as all of us have looked at our colleges, wise leadership can make  colleges among the safest communities to live and work in America over  the next year because colleges have certain advantages. In the first  place, most of the campus community is young. While we can't be  cavalier about the effect of COVID-19 on young people, as Dr. Fauci has  warned us, the fact is that COVID-19 seems to hurt the young much less.   The second reason it would be easier to go back to college is that  there is a lot of space in colleges that isn't used. Colleges are the  most notorious wasters of space in our society. It is rare that a class  is taught in the early morning or late evening or on Saturdays or in  the summers. There is plenty of time and plenty of space to spread out  on most college campuses.    As we learn more and more about COVID-19, it looks like there are  three things we really need to do: Keep 6 feet apart, wash our hands,  and wear a mask. Do those three things, and we can probably go back to  school, back to work, out to eat, and do most of the things we would  like to do.   At a college, as President Daniels says, he intends to develop a  culture of masks. Vanderbilt University is going to require a mask to  be worn in all indoor situations. Then they are taking a number of  other steps. Concerts and parties and large gatherings are out. Flu  shots and grab-and-go meals are in.   There will be systematic testing, and testing will be done in  different ways. The president of Brown would like to test every  student, she said in an article in the New York Times a few weeks ago.   The president of Purdue said: Well, maybe systematic testing. There  will be different strategies for testing, but the goal of testing is  two things. One is containing the disease; that is, identifying the  sick and the exposed so that they can be quarantined so the rest of us  don't have to be, and the other is to build confidence.   I know that when I took a test last week after I was exposed to  COVID-19, I went home for 2 weeks of self-isolation, as the attending  physician said I should do. That should have been it, but I went to my  local public health department and took a test, which turned out to be  negative, for peace of mind. It gave me more confidence to go back home  and be with my family.   The anticipation is that there will be plenty of testing. Admiral  Giroir, the Assistant Secretary of Public Health, has told our  committee, we are, in the United States, doing about 10 million tests a  month now. States are submitting to the Federal Government a plan each  month about their testing needs. The Federal Government is helping fill  in any gaps. Over the next 2, 3 months, the number of tests will go  from about 10 million a month to 40 or 50 million tests a month. That  is a lot of tests. We are already testing more than any country in the  world.   My guess is that colleges and universities--even though there are  6,000 of them, 127 different institutions in Tennessee--if they will be  in touch with their Governor and be a part of the State testing plan,  they can have adequate tests, not only to contain the disease and  isolate those who should be isolated but to give peace of mind to other  students and faculty and members of the community who come onboard.   Finally, we talked a little bit about the role of the Federal  Government. We have a classic discussion about that here. Some want to  say Washington should do it; some want to say the State should do it.  Generally, our friends on the Democratic side trust Washington, DC;  generally, we on the Republican side trust the States. But there is a  role for both. The Federal Government, through the Centers for Disease  Control, can provide advice. The Federal Government, as it is doing  through the Shark Tank, as we call it, at the National Institutes of  Health, can accelerate the number of rapid tests that are available at  a low cost for campuses.   The Federal Government can provide additional funding for campuses,  as we did in the CARES Act. Those are some of the things we can do from  here. But the things we ought not to try to do from here are to order  California to open its campuses if California doesn't want to or to  tell Purdue and Notre Dame and Brown and the University of Tennessee  and Vanderbilt that they cannot open their campuses if they do want to  and think they can do it safely. We should not be trying to tell each  of those campuses exactly how many tests they have, what kind of tests  they have, any more than we try to tell them what the faculty ought to  be paid or what student admissions policies ought to be or what the  curriculum ought to be.   While the Federal Government needs to create an umbrella in which  individual campuses can go back to school safely, we need to be careful  about telling everybody exactly what to do.   We had a very big event here 4, 5 years ago when we fixed No Child  Left Behind. Everybody wanted it fixed--Democrats, Republicans, labor  unions, Governors, teachers. Why? Because after a while, everybody got  tired of Washington, DC, telling 100,000 public schools exactly what to  do, what teachers to hire, what curriculum to have--all of these  things. The same is true with our colleges.   Our system of colleges and universities is the best in the world.  Everyone concedes that. It has not gotten  [[Page S2722]]  there by Washington ordering what it should do, and Washington  shouldn't order what it should do about this disease. It should advise;  it should help; it can help send money. But the autonomy of each campus  ought to be respected.   One other thing about the colleges and universities have asked for  from us is liability protection.   I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record following my  remarks a letter from the American Council on Education, with a number  of things in it they ask of Congress. This is the umbrella organization  for hiring education, and it includes liability protection.    Next week in our committee we will take a look at  going back to school safely, K-12. That is a lot more families--20  million college students, 75 million children in K-12. And in every one  of those families, in every one of those homes, I can tell you those  families are worried about whether those children can go back to school  and whether they can go safely. I believe they can, and all across the  country, Governors, classroom teachers, mayors, principals are working,  just as we heard today from the college presidents, to make sure they  go back safely.                            ____________________     Mr. President, if I may switch gears to another  subject, briefly--on Monday, the Senate will be casting the most  important vote on conservation legislation, outdoors legislation, that  we have had in 50 years. That is quite a statement to make because we  do lots of legislation in the U.S. Senate. I am not exaggerating when I  say that. This is a piece of legislation that will do more for our  public Federal lands--our national parks, our fish and wildlife lands,  our Bureau of Reclamation Lands, the lands that hunters and fishermen  use--than any piece of legislation we have passed in at least 60 years.  In addition, it will create permanent funding for the Land and Water  Conservation Fund, which  [[Page S2724]]  has been a goal of Congress since it was passed first in 1964 and  reaffirmed by Reagan's Commission on American Outdoors, which I chaired  in 1985 and 1986. Finally, we are getting around to doing both of those  things.   This piece of legislation that I am describing has the strong support  of President Trump. In fact, it couldn't happen without President Trump  because the Office of Management and Budget has to approve the method  of funding we are using. They have approved it, and it is in the  President's budget. It has the support of 59 cosponsors in this body-- Democrats and Republicans--who are working together on it in a  remarkable way.   People say that we are divided. Well, we are in lots of ways, but in  other ways we are not. Ask Senators Burr, Cantwell, Daines, Gardner,  Heinrich, King, Manchin, Portman, and Warner. They are all in the  middle of this. They will all take credit for it, and I will give them  credit for it. But everyone recognizes it takes all of us.   Why are we all in the middle of it? We have more than 800 sportsmen  and outdoors groups who have endorsed this bill--more than 800. You  tell me the last time you saw President Trump, 800 outdoors  environmental groups, and 59 U.S. Senators on both sides of the aisle  in favor of a piece of legislation that has a policy of what I believe  is the most important piece of outdoors legislation in a half century.   Here is what we are talking about. We are talking about leaky roofs.  We are talking about access roads with potholes. We are talking about  trails that are worn out so you slip and fall down when you go to hike.  We are talking about sewage systems that are broken, shutting down  whole campgrounds like the Chilhowee Mountain Campground, which was  shut for 2 years. Five hundred families usually use it every summer and  can't go because the sewage system is shut down. We are talking about  dilapidated visitors centers, from Washington, DC, to Pearl Harbor. We  are talking about the Mall in Washington, DC. We are talking about our  national treasures. We are talking about where we like to go.    One of the organizations supporting this--or a group of them-- represents 55 million fishermen and hunters. They would like to have  roads in order to get to the fishing holes. They would like not to  break the axles on their tires along the way. Families would like to be  able to go to Pearl Harbor and see a good visitors' center, and they  would like to be able to camp in the Smoky Mountains and find that it  is not shut down because the bathrooms don't work. That is what we are  talking about here. This isn't exotic stuff, but it is what creates an  environment for us to use this great American outdoors that we all  love.   Now, briefly, exactly how does it do that? Well, one part simply says  that we are going to take the 419 national park properties--the  national forests, the National Wildlife Refuges, the Bureau of Land  Management, and the Bureau of Indian Education--that is the Indian  schools--and we are going to take the deferred maintenance, which is  all of those things I talked about that are broken, and over the next 5  years, we are going to pay for half of it. We have about $12 billion in  deferred maintenance, and over the next 5 years, we will reduce it to  half of that.   In the Great Smoky Mountains, for example, which is next to where I  live, we have $235 million worth of deferred maintenance, and the park  has a $20 million-a-year budget. Now, how long do you think it is going  to take, with a $20 million annual budget, to deal with $230 million  worth of deferred maintenance? It is never going to happen. It is never  going to happen without this piece of legislation or something like it.  That is the first part.   President Trump, to his credit, said to go ahead and put in the bill  the national forests, the National Wildlife Refuges, the Bureau of Land  Management, and the Bureau of Indian Education. We have a lot of Indian  schools in this country that are broken down and need to be fixed. He  said to put that in there. There are also a lot of Tribal nations and a  lot of hunters and fishermen who appreciate that support, which is why  we have 800 different outdoor groups that are supporting it.   Then there is a second part of the bill--the smaller part--which is  the Land and Water Conservation Fund. It is a very simple idea that was  recommended by President Johnson's Rockefeller division in 1964. It  said this: Let's set aside a certain amount of money every year--$900  million. Half will go to the States, and half will go to the Federal  Government and buy land that ought to be protected. It might be a city  park or it might be an inholding in a national park. It could be either  of those things. This has been going on all that time. Yet what the  agreement was in 1964 was that we would get the money from offshore  drilling in order to pay for it. We would create an environmental  burden--that is, allow offshore drilling--and we would use it for an  environmental benefit, which is the Land and Water Conservation Fund.  That made a lot of sense.   So, every year, Congress has appropriated a certain amount of money  for that, but the idea was that the amount would be certain. It would  be $900 million every year, and that has never happened. In 1985 and  1986, President Reagan appointed a commission to look at the American  outdoors. I was the chairman of it. The principal recommendation was to  make the Land and Water Conservation Fund permanent and have permanent  funding. So, for 60 years, Presidents and Congresses have been trying  to do this, but it hasn't gotten done. Monday is the day to get it  done.   My hope is that all Members of the U.S. Senate will be back here for  votes on Monday. Some of us have been a little delinquent in our  attendance on the Monday votes, but we need 60 votes on Monday to  advance the bill. Then we will need 60 votes a couple of more times to  pass the bill. Then it can go to the House of Representatives where an  identical bill has been introduced.   To me, it would seem that a bill like this, at a time like this,  would be something we would all welcome and want to support. There is  nothing any of us wants to do more than to get outside of our homes and  get in the fresh air, and these lands are where we go. Some of them are  city parks, and some of them are big parks, like Yellowstone and  Yosemite and the Great Smokies. Yet they are our treasures, and they  are run down. They are run down. The bathrooms leak. The sewage systems  have closed camp grounds. In some cases, the visitors' centers are  embarrassing. The roads have potholes, and the access roads aren't  built for the fishermen. This is a chance for us to take care of that.   I look forward to the vote on cloture on Monday. I hope we get a big  vote and send a strong signal to the American people that we in  Congress have heard them and that, even in a time of crisis like this,  we can work together and do important work.   There is one more aspect to it. This is an infrastructure bill, and  infrastructure means lots of jobs. There are various numbers that have  been thrown around--40,000, 100,000--but anytime you spend $14 billion  over 5 years on projects that are ready to go in locations all over the  country, especially in rural areas, it is going to help a country that  has such a high unemployment rate. This is the most important  conservation and outdoors legislation in 50 years. In addition to that,  it is an infrastructure bill. That sounds like a pretty good vote for  Monday.   I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record after my speech  my opening statement from the hearing this morning on Going Back to  College Safely as well as the letter from the American Council on  Education.
