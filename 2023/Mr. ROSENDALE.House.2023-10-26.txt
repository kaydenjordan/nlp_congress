 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, my amendment No. 58 would reduce the  total appropriations for the Department of the Interior, Environment,  and Related Agencies by $1.55 billion, bringing the total cost of the  bill down from nearly $58 billion to $56.4 billion.   I submitted this amendment to get the total cost of this year's  appropriation bills closer to the fiscal year 2022 levels.   I have been traveling around the State of Montana for quite extensive  periods of time over the last several months and I have yet to find a  single person that feels like we didn't have enough spending or  government in fiscal year 2022.  [[Page H5141]]    As a matter of fact, most of them truly believe that we had far too  much government and it was engaged in trying to run their lives and  they did not want to see it anymore.   I believe that the Federal Government had more than enough funding in  FY22 and that it is time to rein in the out-of-control spending. To get  their spending under control, the Federal agencies must begin operating  at the same levels, or at very least, receive only modest increases.   The American people are sick and tired of the D.C. cartel running up  the tab on the American people while our constituents are struggling to  make ends meet.   To be clear, my amendment still allows for modest increases in the  fiscal year 2022 spending for energy and water. I am not trying to  slash funding or cripple necessary infrastructure. I am trying to  ensure that taxpayer dollars are used efficiently and that we get the  government off the path to financial ruin.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio.                            Parliamentary Inquiry     Mr. Chair, I misspoke. This is for Interior. This is  for Interior. Excuse me. Mr. Chair, this is for Energy.    Mr. Chair, under Secretary Granholm, we have seen  America's energy prices skyrocket with no clear plan to help Americans  other than to further deplete our Strategic Petroleum Reserves.   The Department of Energy has done nothing to show they deserve an  increase in funding from last year. Secretary Granholm routinely speaks  about how her intention is to quickly move away from traditional energy  industries. Many Americans rely on these industries for their  livelihoods. This administration shows a lack of clear consideration of  these people and industries, even as they are necessary during our  transition to clean energy.   Furthermore, the very people that get hurt the most by this reckless  administration's actions are the ones at the lowest end of the income  scale. Quite frankly, if you just look at one section of this  legislation, we don't want to compromise our national defense. One  section, $1.2 billion, the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable  Energy is where the Federal Government is picking winners and losers to  try and develop different types of fuel, including biofuels and  batteries and the Federal Government should not be involved in that.   The free market knows how to do it. They know how to do it the best.  They have demonstrated they know how to do it the most efficiently.   Further, Mr. Chair, I would just like to say that there is no reason  that we cannot remove a meager $1.55 billion from this total bill.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, my amendment No. 59 reduces spending;  specifically, it cuts funding for the Army Corps of Engineers back to  the FY22 levels.   This year's appropriation would increase Army Corps' funding by $910  million from last year. My amendment would reduce funding for the Army  Corps by $620 million in order to bring it back to FY22 levels. That  still leaves in place a $290 million increase.   Unfortunately, the Army Corps of Engineers has a long history of  running over budget and out of schedule. The solution to the Army Corps  wasting taxpayers' money is not to reward them with more money.  Instead, we must demand that the Army Corps of Engineers be more  responsible and more efficient.   In Montana alone, there are multiple instances of the Army Corps'  projects running well beyond their budgets and then turning to State  and local governments to make up the costs.   The Army Corps has shown a complete dereliction of duty by trying to  transfer costs, operation, and maintenance of the Fish Bypass Channel,  which is part of the Lower Yellowstone Irrigation Project.   The Army Corps is shifting operating costs that they agreed to take  on to the farmers and ranchers who are already facing increased costs.  In fact, before the Army Corps of Engineers even cut the ribbon on this  project, it was in need of repairs. I witnessed it myself.   The Lower Yellowstone Irrigation Project was created as the Newlands  Reclamation Act, signed into law in 1902. The purpose of the Lower  Yellowstone Irrigation Project is to divert water from the Yellowstone  River to irrigators in eastern Montana and western North Dakota.   Currently, the Lower Yellowstone Irrigation Project is a dependable,  reliable source of irrigation water for approximately 58,000 acres of  land in four irrigation districts across Montana.   The Army Corps of Engineers proposed a fish bypass channel in Montana  to address the pallid sturgeon populations in the Lower Missouri River  because it was cheaper, not out of the goodness of their heart.   The farmers did not ask for nor did they receive more water or a  better system. No, as a matter of fact, just quite the opposite has  happened. The system doesn't function as well and it costs them more to  operate.   The Army Corps now wants to wash its hands of this project and pass  the cost to 350 families and communities that rely upon this irrigation  to provide for their livelihoods. This burden from the lack of planning  by the Corps of Engineers should only be transferred on to a third  party that is at fault.   The government is the only one who decided to place the pallid  sturgeon on the Endangered Species List and should pay for the  consequences and costs resulting from that action, not the small  community that has relied upon this irrigation for over the past  century.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, FY 2022, Corps of Engineers, $8.34  billion. FY 2023, $8.66 billion. FY24, $5.57 billion.   We cannot continue to reward bad behavior.   A recent project in Texas, the Ike Dike coastal barrier project, is  currently projected to cost $57 billion, representing the largest civil  engineering project in United States history, which is 68 percent  higher than the recent estimate of $34 billion.   There is not a contractor that has built a home that would have a  homeowner abide by those types of terms and conditions.   How can the Army Corps of Engineers be allowed to receive such a  massive amount of funds when their project estimates are so routinely  off base? Their time frames with which they are estimating to complete  them are just as bad.   A project in Michigan for the New Lock at the Soo is currently  projected  [[Page H5143]]  to cost $394 million more than the Biden administration's proposed  funding.   The list goes on and on and on. We cannot continue to reward this bad  behavior.   Mr. Chairman, once again, we have seen these projects go over budget  and over time. The Corps of Engineers should not be rewarded, and I  urge my colleagues to support this amendment.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I rise as the designee of the gentleman  form Texas (Mr. Roy), and I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment prohibits any of the  funding in the Energy and Water Appropriations bill from being used to  carry out President Biden's executive orders on climate change.   These executive orders served as the catalyst for some of the  Department of Energy's most radical actions, including the Justice40  Initiative, a radical environmental justice initiative that directs 40  percent of Federal clean energy and energy efficiency spending based on  race, migrant status, and other characteristics.   A moment ago, you heard me speaking about relying upon the  marketplace and the free market to develop the most effective,  efficient, and technologically advanced methods with which we can fuel  everything that we have now, whether that is electric turbines or motor  vehicles. To base it upon race, migrant status, and other  characteristics demonstrates why exactly the Federal Government should  not be involved in this type of action.   The Department of Energy's transition to carbon pollution-free energy  sources, a zero-emissions fleet, and a net-zero building portfolio--the  power grid from Canada to Mexico around the country cannot sustain  pushing everything to renewable energies when they are only operating  at solar about 18 percent and wind energy at the very most efficient,  40 percent of full power when we happen to have wind blowing.   This is not the way for us to go, and I would ask that we prohibit  those funds from being used for such purposes.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, building on the coast does not cause  climate change, but it certainly exposes you to incredible risk of  having your house washed away. Now, I am not a genius, nor am I  climatologist or a weatherman, but even I know that simple fact.   In 2021, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve had a total of 610 million  barrels of crude oil in it.   Here is what our Department of Energy has done: reduced it down to  347 million barrels of crude, the lowest level since 1983.   The emissions in our country have gone down. It is demonstrated very  clearly that by placing us more obligated to purchase our energy  overseas, all we are doing is creating more pollution problems around  the Earth. We do it cleaner. We do it safer. We do it with the  strongest environmental standards, and we do it with the best labor  practices around the world.   Mr. Chairman, I hope my colleagues can support this. There is no  reason for the Federal Government to be involved in directing what type  of energies we should develop.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1500     Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
