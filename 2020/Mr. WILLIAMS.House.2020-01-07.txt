 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate  the 2019 Blum High School Bobcats football team on winning their first  ever six-man State championship title.   For Texans, high school football is not just a sport; it is a way of  life. Each week in the fall, we gather under Friday night lights and  cheer our team on to victory.  [[Page H7]]    The young men and coaches on our teams spend countless hours running  drills, watching film, and getting ready for their moment in history.  During the 2019 season, Blum High School's dedication paid off as they  rose from behind and secured a 58-52 win over the McLean Tigers at AT&T  Stadium.   On behalf of the 25th District of Texas, I congratulate the Bobcats  on their first State championship victory, and I wish them the very  best in their bright futures.   In God we trust.   Bless our troops.   Go Bobcats.                            ____________________
