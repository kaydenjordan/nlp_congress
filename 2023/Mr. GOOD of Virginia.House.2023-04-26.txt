 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of reducing  Federal spending, at long last. Democrats would never willingly agree  to cut spending as evidenced by--what did the President just propose--a  record $7 trillion budget with a record $2 trillion deficit, if that  plan were ever to see the light of day.   We are going to utilize this opportunity, this debt ceiling limit  being reached, to negotiate or to force, finally, some fiscal  responsibility and some cuts to our spending.   President Biden and my friends across the aisle want to continue to  exceed America's credit card limit without any consideration of how or  why we got here.   If an individual spent the way this Federal Government spends, they  would be in jail. Think about it. Spending money that is not yours.  Writing checks when you know the funds aren't there. What would you  call that?   The Limit, Save, Grow Act is the solution to shrink Washington and  grow America. Immediate up-front cuts and spending reforms saving over  $500 billion in 2 years and nearly $5 trillion over 10 years;  rescinding the unspent COVID funds; eliminating the student loan  transfer scheme; eliminating the $80 billion for the weaponized IRS;  eliminating climate reckless environmental funding, and capping growth  at 1 percent each year.   I urge all of my colleagues to vote in favor of this proposal to put  us on a path to fiscal stability.
