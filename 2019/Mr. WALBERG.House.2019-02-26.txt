 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Lenawee County  Sheriff Jack Welsh as he retires after 43\1/2\ years of service to  Lenawee County, Michigan.   Sheriff Welsh has served in many roles during his law enforcement  career, beginning as a volunteer reserve deputy and eventually working  his way up to captain.   After his initial retirement from the sheriff's department in 2007,  he went on to become an emergency management regional planner.   Then, in 2008, he accepted the call to run for sheriff, where he has  served ever since.   Law enforcement officers like Sheriff Welsh are the fabric of our  community. Day in and day out, they answer the call to serve and  protect.   Over the years, Sheriff Welsh has been one of the very best. He is a  man of integrity, a dedicated public servant, and a trusted friend to  many. He has been instrumental in making Lenawee County a better and  safer place to call home.   I thank Sheriff Welsh for his decades of distinguished service, and I  wish him nothing but the best as he begins his retirement.
