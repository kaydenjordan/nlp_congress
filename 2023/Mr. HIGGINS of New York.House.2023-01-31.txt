 Madam Speaker, on May 14, 2022, a racist  mass shooting took place at a supermarket in my home community of  Buffalo, New York.   Armed with an assault weapon, the shooter killed 10 people and  injured three more in just 2 minutes and 3 seconds; one shooter.   We continue to mourn, and we continue to struggle to move on. Sadly,  we are not the only community facing this challenge. Horrific mass  shootings have taken place in Uvalde, Texas; Highland Park, Illinois;  Colorado Springs; Raleigh, North Carolina; Monterey Bay and Half Moon  Bay, California.   Last year we passed the bipartisan Safe Communities Act. This was an  important step, but more needs to be done. As we mark National Gun  Violence Survivors' week, we must honor those impacted by shootings by  continuing to deliver legislation that will save lives.   I am proud to support a Federal assault weapons ban, and I urge my  colleagues to do the same.                            ____________________
