 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R.  1164, the bipartisan Taylor Force Act. I want to thank Chairman Royce  and Ranking Member Eliot Engel, who is my friend and colleague and a  real leader for our party and for this issue, for all of their hard  work and leadership to bring this legislation to the floor. All of us  in Congress could learn from and emulate their friendship and  bipartisan working relationship, especially when it comes to our  foreign policy and support for our vital ally Israel, and in our fight  against terror around the world.   I commend the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Lamborn) for introducing  this important legislation, and I am proud that Ranking Member Engel  and I were the very first Democrats in the House to cosponsor this  measure.   Mr. Speaker, I serve on the House Financial Services Committee's  Subcommittee on Terrorism and Illicit Finance, where, day in and day  out, my colleagues and I track the flow of money to terrorist groups  like Hamas, Hezbollah, and ISIS through illicit financial networks.   For years, the Palestinian Authority has shamelessly engaged in an  equally heinous practice out in the open: the awarding of official  payments to terrorists it inspires to go out and kill innocent  civilians, including American citizens like U.S. Army veteran Taylor  Force.   Israeli citizens live under the constant threats of stabbings,  suicide bombings, and vicious terrorist attacks. Palestinian leaders,  including President Abbas, have not just refused to call for an end to  these attacks or to speak out against those who promote hate and  violence, rather, they celebrate, defend, and promote terrorism through  an elaborate system whereby the Palestinian Authority literally ``pays  to slay.''  [[Page H9652]]                                     time  1515    That is because for decades the PLO and the PA have provided payments  in some form or another to terrorists and their families, as well as  various other awards and titles and honorifics, but the practice is  especially heinous because today it is enshrined into Palestinian law.  The deadlier attacks of terrorism will be rewarded with even more  money.   I know because I have read the laws and seen the accompanying payment  charts. There is literally a payment schedule based on the severity of  the terrorist attack, which encourages more severe and gratuitous  violence and terrorist activity.   For instance, a terrorist who slayed three people in 2015, including  an 18-year-old American citizen, Ezra Schwartz, who was spending his  gap year in Israel and planned to attend business school at Rutgers  University in New Jersey, would be rewarded by the PA with a monthly  salary--the terrorist--of more than $3,000.   In sum, these payments total hundreds of millions of dollars that the  PA redirects from its own budget to pay off the murderers of Jews,  Israelis, and foreigners. The Taylor Force Act will eliminate U.S.  foreign aid to the West Bank and Gaza that directly benefits the  Palestinian Authority until the Secretary of State can guarantee that  they have ended these payments. This legislation is carefully targeted  to achieve maximum leverage over the PA to end the funding of terror.   Mr. Speaker, this legislation stands in stark contrast to a partisan,  one-sided, offensive, and harmful bill recently introduced in Congress  under the guise of promoting human rights that would cut aid to Israel  for cracking down on terrorism. Israel has the right and obligation to  defend itself and its civilians who have been the targeted victims of  brutal attacks and murders while going about their daily lives. The  United States ought to stand with them by condemning Palestinian  incitement.   Members of both parties have been working together to do just that.  Since fiscal year 2015, Congress has reduced, dollar for dollar, the  amount of money that the PA and PLO pay to terrorists and their  families from the Economic Support Fund aid that the U.S. provides.  While this has resulted in the reduction of our foreign aid, it has not  yet brought an end to this practice.   In May, I joined Representatives Claudia Tenney and Tom Suozzi and 33  of our colleagues who demanded that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson  address these terror payments directly with Palestinian President Abbas  during his visit to Washington, D.C.   It has been suggested that the PA may be more receptive to  international pressure. I am glad that this bill urges the Secretary of  State and the U.S. Permanent Representative to the United Nations to  highlight this issue with the international community to condemn these  horrific acts of violence. But that is simply not enough.   The United States must use every tool at our disposal to counter  violence and terrorism. The PLO and the PA may well continue down the  path of more hatred, violence, and terror without regard for the damage  inflicted or for their role in diminishing the prospects for peace. But  so long as they pay citizens to murder civilians, then they will do so  without benefiting from the support of the United States taxpayer.  There is no question that should be asked about that.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in standing in solidarity  with the families of the victims of terror to bring an end to this  appalling system of paid violence, and I urge support for this bill.
