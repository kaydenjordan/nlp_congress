 Mr. President, over the last few days, three Republican  Senators have publicly stated that they  [[Page S6098]]  will vote against the healthcare repeal bill that may come to the  Senate this week.   In announcing his opposition, one Republican Senator, John McCain of  Arizona, issued the following statement: ``As I have repeatedly  stressed, healthcare reform legislation ought to be the product of  regular order in the Senate.''   Last night, Republican Senator Susan Collins of Maine stated: ``This  is simply not the way that we should be approaching an important and  complex issue.''   She went on to say: ``The fact that a new version of this bill was  released the very week we are supposed to vote compounds the problem.''   This should be the end of the Graham-Cassidy repeal debate.  Republican leadership should finally scrap this one-sided effort to  literally change the healthcare system for America.   There was a hearing yesterday--the only hearing on the bill we are  about to vote on. It was a lengthy hearing, but it, frankly, did not  entertain all of the witnesses or any amendment process so that Members  could really have input into the bill we are going to face.   The Congressional Budget Office is supposed to tell us what this  critical legislation will do for America. It issued a preliminary  finding yesterday that millions of Americans would lose their health  insurance and that those with preexisting conditions, as well as their  families, if they could buy insurance, would find it very, very  expensive.   At the end of this week, funding for our Nation's community  healthcare centers will run out, as will funding for the Children's  Health Insurance Program. Shouldn't we be focused on reauthorizing  those programs appropriately in a timely way? Let's allow the HELP  Committee, which is the committee of jurisdiction when it comes to  healthcare, to do its work. I have faith in two Senators--one  Republican and one Democrat--to do the right thing on this. Senator  Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, a Republican, and Senator Patty Murray of  Washington, a Democrat, have proven before that they can take complex  issues such as Federal funding for education and find a bipartisan  compromise.   What would America say if we announced at the end of next week or  even this week that we have a bipartisan compromise to make healthcare  stronger in the United States, that it is going to pass the Senate,  that we are going to send to it the House, and that we are going to get  something done this year in the Senate?   First, most Americans would be amazed and skeptical, as they should  be, but if we can prove that we are going to do it, they would applaud  us for finally reaching a point at which we do something on a  bipartisan basis.   That was the process that was underway until last week. Senator  Alexander was given orders by the leadership: Step back. Let's vote on  Graham-Cassidy. Don't do anything more on a bipartisan basis.   Well, this is the week for that vote, and I hope it is the week in  which that vote ends in the basic defeat of the approach and a return  to bipartisan compromise and bipartisan negotiation.   I don't know what it will take for the Republicans in the Senate and  the House to end this never-ending crusade against so-called ObamaCare.  They have voted 50, 60, 70 times. We know how they feel about it, but  the American people have said to them: It is not enough to oppose  ObamaCare; give us a better alternative. And that is where they have  stumbled each time.   Over the weekend, rather than making improvements to fix what is  wrong with their bill, many Republicans doubled down in secret  meetings, negotiations, and with incentives that were built into the  newest version of the bill.   The latest Graham-Cassidy repeal measure would slash funding to the  States, decimate the Medicaid Program, eliminate protections for people  with preexisting conditions, and basically throw our entire healthcare  system into chaos. A few special changes were made for special States,  but the changes that have come to Graham-Cassidy in the closing days  have not really changed the fundamental problem with the bill in that  it diminishes Medicaid coverage.   Medicaid is the health insurance program about which most people say:  Well, that is for the poor people of America. To some extent, that is  true, but it has reached far beyond that. Two out of three senior  citizens in nursing homes and other institutional settings rely on  Medicaid for basic healthcare. If the cutbacks in Medicaid take place  that Graham-Cassidy calls for, what will these seniors do? What will  you do for Mom, for your grandmother, or for your grandfather when it  reaches a point at which they cannot any longer count on Medicaid to  help them pay their medical bills? Will American families have to step  up with their own savings? Will they have to look for alternative  settings to those in which their parents and grandparents are today?  That is the stark choice Graham-Cassidy will create for many families  across America.   No one has had time to properly review this latest proposal, in large  part because it was drafted behind closed doors--no input from experts,  no support from the medical community. You would think, after saying it  over and over again, that the Republicans would challenge the following  statement: There is no medical advocacy group in the United States of  America who supports the Graham-Cassidy bill. That is the case in my  State. The Illinois Hospital Association, doctors, nurses, surgeons,  pediatricians, and community health are all opposed to this bill, every  single one of them, as they were to the previous versions. It says  something when the bill to change America's healthcare system is  opposed by the people who provide healthcare to America. All of them  oppose it. It is that bad.    Republican leaders want to force a vote this week. If that is what it  takes, then we have to move to that vote, but I wish they would save  some time. I wish they would move to this bipartisan negotiation I  referred to earlier.   The Congressional Budget Office is a nonpartisan agency that is  supposed to measure the impact of legislation so that, before we vote  on it, we know if it is good or bad for the Nation and for the people  we represent. Here is what it told us last night in a preliminary  review, but it has not had time to review this bill in detail.   In a preliminary review, the CBO told us: ``The number of people with  comprehensive health insurance . . . would be reduced by millions each  year.''   How in the world can we as Senators make a proposal for the United  States of America which we know will take health insurance coverage  away from millions of Americans--exactly the opposite of what our goal  should be?   The CBO went on to write: ``Federal spending on Medicaid would be  reduced by about $1 trillion.''   There are some Republicans, fiscal conservatives who say that we have  to stop the growth of this program, but none of them--not one of them-- can address the fundamental issue: Who will then take care in paying  for the delivery of babies to low-income families? Half of the children  who are born in my State of Illinois are paid for by Medicaid. Their  moms are taken care of by Medicaid until the moment of birth. What will  you replace that with if you eliminate Medicaid funding?   What about the disabled who count on Medicaid as their health  insurance? If you are blind or face a serious disability, Medicaid is  the answer for basic health insurance for you. If you are going to cut  $1 trillion out of Medicaid, what will you say to those disabled  Americans who want the same peace of mind that we all want in having  health insurance?   School districts all over Illinois and all over the Nation receive  Medicaid funds to care for special ed students--counselors,  transportation, even feeding tubes. If you take the money out of  Medicaid, what will we do for those school districts that are trying  their best to give kids a fighting chance, even those with serious  disabilities? That is the reality.   The CBO went on to write: ``Coverage for people with preexisting  conditions would be much more expensive . . . and could become  unavailable for many more people.''   This Republican proposal takes us back to that moment in history when  health insurance was so expensive and so hard to find--almost  impossible for those with preexisting conditions. Why would we ever  want to go back to that? There is hardly a family in America  [[Page S6099]]  who does not have someone they love, who is part of the family, who has  a preexisting condition.   Let me remind those who do not have that circumstance that you are  one accident or one diagnosis away from being part of this class of  Americans who wants health insurance even though the health of those  Americans has not been perfect.   In sum, this bill does not do what its authors say it will. They like  to tell the American public that States will magically be able to cover  the same number of people and provide the same level of benefits with  billions of dollars less in funding. The Governors--Democrats and  Republicans--have stepped up and said: This is ridiculous. We cannot be  asked to accept the burden of health insurance for generations to come,  while the Federal Government continues to cut the money that is  necessary to provide that protection.   The CBO rejected the claims that are the basis for this Republican  bill. Since the Republicans refuse to wait for the CBO to complete its  full analysis, we have asked outside health experts what they think the  impact would be of this legislation which is before us this week.   Here is what they say: Within a few years, this bill would likely rip  health insurance away from more than 20 million Americans, including 1  million people in the State of Illinois. In a State of 12\1/2\ million  people, which I represent, 1 million people would lose health insurance  because of this Republican proposal that is before us this week.   The average 60-year-old person in Illinois would see his health  insurance premiums increase by $11,700 a year. Almost by $1,000 a month  his health insurance would go up. Why? Because they change a basic  formula. In the Affordable Care Act, we see that the disparity in  premiums charged between the highest and lowest will be no more than 3  to 1. They change the ratio in their Republican bill to 5 to 1. It  means that those over the age of 50 and under 65 are going to see  premium increases estimated to be almost $1,000 a month.   By 2026, Illinois would see its healthcare funding slashed by $8  billion. By 2036, this number would soar to $153 billion.   Medicaid, which covers half of all children in Illinois and two out  of three seniors in nursing homes, would be decimated. Also, the  Medicaid expansion in Illinois, which helps us to combat the opioid  epidemic, provide coverage for 650,000 Illinoisans, and bring stability  to our hospitals all across the State, would be shut down.   Here is what the Illinois Hospital Association said about this bill:         Illinois cannot absorb additional financial burdens and       would be forced to reduce eligibility, covered services, and       payments to providers. The magnitude of these cuts and       changes to Medicaid is staggering.    Let's also review what this does to people with preexisting  conditions. The Republicans say that this is all about giving  flexibility to States. We hear that over and over again. It sure sounds  nice until you realize that it is a code word for there being massive  funding cuts and the elimination of basic health protection.   In the name of ``State flexibility,'' this bill would allow insurers  to charge those with preexisting conditions sky-high premiums the  moment they get sick.   Under this bill, ``State flexibility'' means reimposing annual and  lifetime limits on patients, including infants who are born with  serious medical problems.   Under TrumpCare, ``State flexibility'' means charging Americans over  the age of 50 up to five times more than younger people. That is  exactly why the American Association of Retired Persons, the AARP, has  steadfastly opposed these Republican changes.   To my Republican friends, ``State flexibility'' means tossing out  essential health benefits, which is the guarantee that your insurance  will cover the basic services your family may need--prescription drugs,  maternity care, mental health and addiction treatment.   I spoke to one of my Republican colleagues the other day and asked:  What are you driving at here? Are you saying that we can reduce the  cost of health insurance if we give people the option of saying that  they will not buy coverage for mental illness and substance abuse  treatment?   He said: Yes, that is one thing they can do.   I said: Then what happens next month when you discover that your  daughter, a sophomore in high school, is now taking opioids and may  move to heroin next? You want to intervene. You want to do it, but now  you have to pay out of pocket because you didn't buy the essential  coverage of mental illness and substance abuse treatment.   It is a shortsighted game to reduce premiums and give up basic  essential benefits, but that is what Republicans propose. That is why  this measure is opposed by every major medical provider and patient  organization nationwide: AARP, the American Hospital Association, the  American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics,  nurses, disability groups, the American Heart Association, the American  Lung Association, the American Diabetes Association, and the  Alzheimer's Association--the list goes on and on. But guess who also  came out in opposition to this bill? Insurance commissioners and  Medicaid directors. These are the officials who would actually have to  implement these cuts. They agree with the Congressional Budget Office  that you can't slash the healthcare budget by 20 to 30 percent and  expect that States will have ``flexibility'' to make up the difference.  The bipartisan association representing every Medicaid director in the  country--every one of them--stated that Medicaid cuts would  ``constitute the largest transfer of financial risk from the federal  government to the states in our country's history.''   Show me a State that can cover as many people with the same benefits  if one-third of the money is taken away. That is what the Republican  bill does.   Here is what Governor Sandoval, a Republican Governor in Nevada,  said:         Flexibility with reduced funding is a false choice. . . . I       will not pit seniors, children, families, the mentally ill,       hospitals, care providers, or any other Nevadan against each       other because of cuts to Nevada's health system proposed by       Graham-Cassidy.    This is a Governor speaking in the same clear terms as Governors of  both political parties about the impossible dilemma that would be  created by this bill.   Enough is enough. The law that we passed, the Affordable Care Act,  helped 20 million people get health coverage. People with preexisting  conditions were finally protected. Women are no longer discriminated  against when it comes to health insurance. Americans get free  preventive healthcare, such as cancer screenings. Is it a perfect law?  Not by any means, but at 3 percent of the individual market, we need to  do better, and we can. We need to improve that market.   First, the Trump administration must do its best to help us, not hurt  healthcare in America. If they are setting out to sabotage this  healthcare system, they can do it, but I hope they will not. The  President will not suffer if they do, but a lot of innocent American  families will. It will make it harder for people to enroll in insurance  groups. It will slash funding for outreach. It will actively discourage  insurers to offer health plans to individuals.   Mr. President, I am going to yield the floor to the Democratic  leader.   In closing, I ask unanimous consent that the September 22, 2017,  article in the New Yorker by Dr. Atul Gawande be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                   [From the New Yorker, Sept. 22, 2017]  If the U.S. Adopts the G.O.P.'s Health-Care Bill, It Would Be an Act of                                Mass Suicide                             (By Atul Gawande)         The fundamental thing to understand about Senate       Republicans' latest attempt to repeal Obamacare is that the       bill under consideration would not just undo the Affordable       Care Act--it would also end Medicaid as we know it and our       federal government's half-century commitment to closing the       country's yawning gaps in health coverage. And it would do so       without putting in place any credible resources or policies       to replace the system it is overturning. If our country       enacts this bill, it would be an act of mass suicide.        In my surgery practice in Boston, I see primarily cancer       patients. When I started out, in 2003, at least one in ten of       my patients was uninsured. Others, who had insurance, would       discover in the course of their treatment that their policies       had annual or lifetime caps that wouldn't cover their costs,       or that  [[Page S6100]]       they would face unaffordable premiums going forward because       they now had a pre-existing condition. When he was governor       of Massachusetts, it was Mitt Romney, a conservative, who       brought Republicans and Democrats together to make a viable       state system of near-universal coverage. That system then       served as a model for the A.C.A. The results have been clear:       increases in coverage have markedly improved people's access       to care and their health. For the last four years, health-      care costs in Massachusetts have risen more slowly than the       national average--while the national numbers themselves have       been at historic lows. I have not seen a single uninsured       patient--zero--in a decade. And now comes an utterly reckless       piece of legislation that would destroy these gains.        To review how we got to this point: last spring, the House       passed a health-care-reform bill that proposed to hollow out       the A.C.A.'s funding, insurance mandates, and protections for       people with pre-existing conditions. It was immensely       unpopular with the public. The problem was not just that       twenty-three million Americans would lose their health       insurance if the bill becomes law but also the Republicans'       vision of a health system where insurance with deductibles of       five thousand dollars and more, and little or no primary-care       coverage, would become the norm.        This summer, Senate Republicans failed to secure enough       votes to pass a modified version of the House bill. Later, in       a dramatic late-night session, the Senate also rejected, by a       single vote, a ``skinny'' repeal bill. That bill would have       repealed only the parts of the A.C.A. that required large       businesses to insure their workers and all Americans to carry       coverage. It would have resulted in a mere sixteen million       more uninsured people, according to estimates.        The Republican bill currently being rushed to a vote was       put forward by a group of senators led by Lindsey Graham, of       South Carolina, and Bill Cassidy, of Louisiana. As has become       the apparent rule for Republican health-care bills, there       have been no hearings or committee reviews of the Graham-      Cassidy bill. And, this time, lawmakers and the public do not       even have a Congressional Budget Office analysis of the       effects the bill would have on the budget, insurance costs,       or the uninsured rate.        This is unprecedented: senators are moving ahead with a       vote on a bill that would alter the health care of every       American family and the condition of a sixth of our entire       economy, without waiting to hear any official, independent       estimates of the consequences. The irresponsibility is as       blithe as it is breathtaking. Before becoming a senator,       Cassidy spent twenty-five years working as a physician in       hospitals devoted to the uninsured. I find it baffling that a       person with his experience would not recognize the danger of       this bill. But here we are.        The Graham-Cassidy bill goes even further than the bill       passed by the House. It would bring to a virtually immediate       end not only the individual and employer mandates but also       the whole edifice of the Medicaid expansion, insurance       exchanges, and income-based coverage subsidies set up under       the A.C.A. Graham-Cassidy expects all fifty states to then       pass, and implement, alternative health systems for tens of       millions of people within two years--with drastically less       money, in most states, than the current law provides. This is       not just impossible. It is delusional.        Like the House bill, Graham-Cassidy would cut Medicaid       payments for traditional enrollees--the elderly in nursing       homes, pregnant women in poverty, disabled children, etc.--by       a third by 2026. A portion of the money saved would go into a       short-term fund for states to use for health-care costs. The       rationale is that this would give states ``flexibility'' to       design coverage for their residents as they see fit. But the       amount of funding provided is, by multiple estimates,       hundreds of billions of dollars below what the A.C.A.       provides.        The bill also nakedly shifts funds from Democratic-leaning       states that expanded Medicaid under the A.C.A. to Republican-      leaning states that didn't. Analyses indicate that states       like California, Massachusetts, and New York will receive       block-grant funding anywhere from thirty-five to almost sixty       per cent below the health-care funding their residents would       receive under current law. Much of those missing funds would       be transferred to states like Texas, Mississippi, and       Wisconsin. And special deals to make further shifts from blue       states to red states such as Alaska are being negotiated to       win votes.        As for what states can do with the funds they do receive,       they would not be allowed to use them to enroll people in       Medicaid, or able to establish a single-payer system. And       states would not be receiving enough to continue Obamacare on       their own. The only options for spending are for commercial       coverage. States will be permitted to let insurers bring back       higher costs for people with pre-existing conditions and to       reinstate annual and lifetime limits on coverage. And then,       starting in 2026, the funding turns out to only be temporary.       Under the bill's provisions, unless further action is taken       then, four trillion dollars will be removed from health-care       systems over twenty years.        With these massive sums being flung around, it is easy to       forget that this is about our health as human beings. The       evidence is that health-care programs like the A.C.A. save       lives. The way they do so is by increasing the number of       people who have affordable access to a regular source of care       and needed medications. Such coverage has been shown to       produce a substantial and increasing reduction in mortality--      especially among those with chronic illnesses, such as heart       disease, cancer, or H.I.V.--in as little as five years.        Virtually all of us, as we age, will develop serious health       conditions. A critical test of any health reform, therefore,       is whether it improves or reduces our prospects of having the       continuous care and medicines we need when we come to have a       chronic illness. The Graham-Cassidy bill fails this test. It       will terminate Medicaid coverage and insurance subsidies for       some twenty million people. The entire individual-insurance       market will be thrown into a tailspin. Federal protections       for insurance coverage will be gone.        Every major group representing patients, health-care       professionals, health-care institutions, and insurers has       come out vociferously against this plan. Governors from       Alaska to Ohio to Virginia have opposed the bill. In a highly       unusual, bipartisan statement, the national association       representing the Medicaid directors of all fifty states has       also opposed the bill. The top health official in Louisiana,       Cassidy's home state, has opposed the new plan. There is not       a single metric of health or health care that the Graham-      Cassidy plan makes better. This bill is a national calamity.       It should not even come to a vote.     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the statement  of A.J. Wilhelmi, president and CEO of the Illinois Health and Hospital  Association also be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:    [From the Illinois Health and Hospital Association, Sept. 21, 2017]           The Graham-Cassidy-Heller-Johnson ACA Repeal Proposal                             (By A.J. Wilhelmi)         The Illinois Health and Hospital Association opposes the       latest Senate proposal to repeal the Affordable Care Act,       which would do great harm to patients, hospitals, the       healthcare delivery system, and our state budget and economy.       The Graham-Cassidy-Heller-Johnson bill is even more damaging       than the previous Senate and House repeal proposals. Not only       will it result in the loss of healthcare coverage for up to       one million Illinoisans, but it will erode key protections       for patients and consumers and will cut federal healthcare       resources to Illinois by more than $150 Billion.        IHA also opposes changing Medicaid to a capped funding       model. Illinois already ranks 50th in the country in federal       funding support per Medicaid beneficiary. Capped funding       would lock Illinois into low, insufficient federal funding       levels and shift costs to the state.        Illinois cannot absorb additional financial burdens that       would be imposed on the state and would be forced to reduce       eligibility, covered services, and payments to providers. The       magnitude of these cuts and changes to Medicaid is       staggering.        We were encouraged by recent bi-partisan negotiations to       stabilize the individual marketplace. The Graham-Cassidy-      Heller-Johnson bill will do nothing in the short or long term       to create marketplace stability.        We urge the Senate to reject this proposal, and we implore       the members of the Illinois House Delegation to oppose the       bill if it passes the Senate. There is a great deal at stake       for the health and well-being of the people of Illinois.     Finally, I ask unanimous consent that the statement by  the National Association of Medicaid Directors, to which I referred, be  printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:   [From the National Association of Medicaid Directors, Sept. 21, 2017]                      NAMD Statement on Graham-Cassidy         The Board of Directors of the National Association of       Medicaid Directors (NAMD) urges Congress to carefully       consider the significant challenges posed by the Graham-      Cassidy legislation. State Medicaid Directors are strong       proponents of state innovation in the drive towards health       care system transformation. Our members are committed to       ensuring that the programs we operate improve health outcomes       while also being fiscally responsible to state and federal       taxpayers. In order to succeed, however, these efforts must       be undertaken in a thoughtful, deliberative, and responsible       way. We are concerned that this legislation would undermine       these efforts in many states and fail to deliver on our       collective goal of an improved health care system.        1. Graham-Cassidy would completely restructure the Medicaid       program's financing, which by itself is three percent of the       nation's Gross Domestic Product and 25 percent of the average       state budget. Like BCRA, the legislation would convert the       traditional Medicaid program into a per-capita cap financing       system. All states will be impacted by this change,       regardless of their decisions to leverage the Medicaid       expansion option under the ACA. It would also incorporate  [[Page S6101]]       Medicaid expansion funding and other ACA health funds into a       block grant, made available to all states. How these block       grants will be utilized, what programs they may fund, and the       overall impact they will have on state budgets, operations,       and citizens are all uncertain. Taken together, the per-      capita caps and the envisioned block grant would constitute       the largest intergovernmental transfer of financial risk from       the federal government to the states in our country's       history. While the block grant portion is intended to create       maximum flexibility, the legislation does not provide clear       and powerful statutory reforms within the underlying Medicaid       program commensurate with proposed funding reductions of the       per capita cap.        2. The Graham-Cassidy legislation would require states to       operationalize the block grant component by January 1, 2020.       The scope of this work, and the resources required to support       state planning and implementation activities, cannot be       overstated. States will need to develop overall strategies,       invest in infrastructure development, systems changes,       provider and managed care plan contracting, and perform a       host of other activities. The vast majority of states will       not be able to do so within the two-year timeframe envisioned       here, especially considering the apparent lack of federal       funding in the bill to support these critical activities.        3. Any effort of this magnitude needs thorough discussion,       examination and analysis, and should not be rushed through       without proper deliberation. The legislative proposal would       not even have a full CBO score until after its scheduled       passage, which should be the bare minimum required for       beginning consideration. With only a few legislative days       left for the entire process to conclude, there clearly is not       sufficient time for policymakers, Governors, Medicaid       Directors, or other critical stakeholders to engage in the       thoughtful deliberation necessary to ensure successful long-      term reforms.        For these reasons, we encourage Congress to revisit the       topic of comprehensive Medicaid reform when it can be       addressed with the careful consideration merited by such a       complex undertaking--as we articulated in our June 26       statement on BCRA.     Mr. President, what America wants is to solve problems,  not create them. The Graham-Cassidy bill will create problems for every  American family. Let's do something right. On a bipartisan basis, let's  sit down and work out improvements to our healthcare system. Let's stop  the partisanship when it comes to healthcare. Let's come together now.   We each have our grievances against one another, one party or the  other. The American people are tired of our grievances. They are  expecting us to do something positive. We can do it. Let's return to  the bipartisan negotiation process.   I think that Senators Lamar Alexander and Patty Murray, Republican  and Democrat, can lead us to a good path to strengthen our healthcare  system.   I yield the floor.                      Recognition of the Minority Leader     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 1864         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Affordable College Textbook       Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) The high cost of college textbooks continues to be a       barrier for many students in achieving higher education.        (2) According to the College Board, during the 2016-2017       academic year, the average student budget for college books       and supplies at 4-year public institutions of higher       education was $1,250.        (3) The Government Accountability Office found that new       textbook prices increased 82 percent between 2002 and 2012       and that although Federal efforts to increase price       transparency have provided students and families with more       and better information, more must be done to address rising       costs.        (4) The growth of the Internet has enabled the creation and       sharing of digital content, including open educational       resources that can be freely used by students, teachers, and       members of the public.        (5) According to the Student PIRGs, expanded use of open       educational resources has the potential to save students more       than a billion dollars annually.        (6) Federal investment in expanding the use of open       educational resources could significantly lower college       textbook costs and reduce financial barriers to higher       education, while making efficient use of taxpayer funds.
