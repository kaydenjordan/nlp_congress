 ROSE of Tennessee asked and was given permission to  address the House for 1 minute.)    ROSE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call  attention to the national coin shortage occurring as a result of COVID- 19.  [[Page H2995]]    I brought this issue to center stage 2 weeks ago during the hearing  with Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, and we are starting to  feel the effects back in Tennessee.   This week I saw a flier from a business in Tennessee pleading with  its customers to use exact change due to the coin shortage. I, along  with fellow Members, have sent a letter to Chairman Powell asking for  additional guidance and best practices for business, but we can all  play a role, an important part, to combat this shortage and help  Americans who need to make every penny count.   It is just my 2 cents, but I urge my fellow Americans to literally  contribute their 2 cents by putting their spare change back into  circulation.                            ____________________
