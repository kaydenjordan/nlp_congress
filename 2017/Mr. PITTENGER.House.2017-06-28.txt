 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Charlotte's  Providence Presbyterian Church and in celebration of their 250th  anniversary.   Founded by Ulster Scots in 1767, the church was named ``Providence''  to express the founders' firm trust in the faithfulness of God to work  all things for His purpose.   Members of Providence Presbyterian were part of the combative North  Carolina militia, the Hornet's Nest, which courageously opposed Lord  Cornwallis during the Revolutionary War.   For over 140 years, the church sponsored all schools in the community  and, in the late 1850s, established Providence Female Academy, which  was one of the few schools for women in the South.   The church remains committed to service today. Part of the 250th  anniversary celebration included making 250 dresses for young girls in  Africa. Their motto is ``Rooted in Christ, growing in the Spirit.''   To Pastor Walt McCanless and the entire congregation,  congratulations, and God bless this wonderful community of believers.                            ____________________
