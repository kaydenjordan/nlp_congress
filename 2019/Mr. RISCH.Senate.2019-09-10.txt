POLICY JUSTIFICATION         Denmark--Airborne Low Frequency Sonar System and Sonobuoys         The Government of Denmark has requested to buy nine (9) AN/      AQS-22 Airborne Low Frequency Sonar (ALFS) systems; six       hundred (600) AN/SSQ-36/53/62 Sonobuoys; spare and repair       parts; support and test equipment; communication equipment;       publications and technical documentation; personnel training       and training equipment; U.S. Government and contractor       engineering, technical, and logistics support services; and       other related elements of logistical and program support. The       total estimated program cost is $200 million.        This proposed sale will support the foreign policy and       national security objectives of the United States by helping       to improve the military capability of Denmark, a NATO ally       that is an important force for ensuring political stability       and economic progress within Europe.        The proposed sale will improve Denmark's capability to meet       current and future threats from enemy weapon systems. The       ALFS and Sonobuoys will provide the capability to perform       anti-submarine warfare missions. Denmark will use the       enhanced capability as a deterrent to regional threats and to       strengthen its homeland defense. Denmark will have no       difficulty absorbing this equipment into its armed forces.        The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not       alter the basic military balance in the region.        The principal contractor will be Lockheed Martin Rotary and       Mission Systems in Oswego, New York. There are no known       offset agreements in connection with this potential sale.        Implementation of this proposed sale will not require the       assignment of additional U.S. Government or contractor       representatives to Denmark.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.                            Transmittal No. 19-44       Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to           Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act                             Annex Item No. vii         (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:        1. The AN/AQS-22 Airborne Low Frequency Sonar (ALFS) is the       primary undersea warfare sensor of the MH-60R multi-mission       helicopter. This integrated dipping sonar system enables the       MH-60R to accomplish the assigned Anti-Submarine Warfare       missions of submarine detection, tracking, localization, and       classification. It also performs missions relating to       acoustic intercept, underwater communications, and       environmental data acquisition. Acoustics algorithms are used       to process dipping sonar and sonobuoy data for target       tracking and for the Acoustics Mission Planner (AMP), which       is a tactical aid employed to optimize the deployment of the       sonobuoy and the dipping sonar. Acoustics hardware is       Unclassified. The acoustics system is classified up to Secret       when environmental and threat databases are loaded and/or the       system is processing acoustic data. ALFS hardware and support       equipment, test equipment, and maintenance spares are       unclassified. Technical data and documentation for the ALFS       weapon system is classified up to Secret.        2. The AN/SSQ-36 Bathythermograph (BT) sonobuoy is an A-      size, expendable and non-repairable sonobuoy. The BT sonobuoy       is an expendable thermal gradient measurement sonobuoy that       operates over Radio Frequency (RF) channels. It consists of a       thermistor temperature probe that descends through the bottom       of the sonobuoy canister, producing a continuous reading of       temperature versus depth, and transmits the readings to an       aircraft or nearby vessel. The thermistor temperature probe       can descend up to 2625 feet.        3. The AN/SSQ-53 Directional Frequency Analysis and       Recording (DIFAR) sonobuoy is an A-size, expendable and non-      repairable directional passive sonobuoy. Basic capabilities       include four hydrophone depth selections up to 1000 feet with       five time duration selections up to eight hours.        4. The AN/SSQ-62 Directional Command Activated Sonobuoy       System (DICASS) sonobuoy is an A-size, expendable, non-      repairable, directional active sonobuoy. The DICASS, in       conjunction with the monitoring unit's signal processing       equipment, provides active sonar range, bearing, and Doppler       information on a submerged contact. The DICASS sonobuoy is       designed to develop and maintain attack criteria. While often       employed in multiple sonobuoy patterns; the DICASS sonobuoy       is designed to permit single buoy attack criteria. The       flexibility inherent in the monitoring unit's control over       the various sonobuoy functions enables optimum sonobuoy       employment over a wide range of environmental and target       conditions.        5. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain       knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements, the       information could be used to develop countermeasures, which       might reduce weapon system effectiveness or be used in the       development of a system with similar or advanced       capabilities.        6. A determination has been made that the recipient country       can provide substantially the same degree of protection for       the sensitive technology being released as the U.S.       Government. This sale is necessary in furtherance of the U.S.       foreign policy and national security objectives outlined in       the Policy Justification.        7. All defense articles and services listed in this       transmittal have been authorized for release and export to       Denmark.                            ____________________     Madam President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute.

AIM-120C Advance Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile       (AMRAAM) is a radar guided missile featuring digital       technology and micro-miniature solid-state electronics.       AMRAAM capabilities include look-down/shoot-down, multiple       launches against multiple targets, resistance to electronic       counter measures, and interception of high flying and low       flying and maneuvering targets. AIM-120 Captive Air Training       Missiles are non-functioning, inert missile rounds used for       armament load training, and which also simulate the correct       weight and balance of live missiles during captive carry on       training sorties. Although designed as an air-to-air missile,       the AMRAAM can also be employed in a surface-launch mode when       integrated on systems such as the National Advanced Surface-      to-Air System (NASAMS). The AIM-120C7, as employed on NASAMS,       protects national assets from imminent hostile air threats.       The AMRAAM All Up Round is classified CONFIDENTIAL, major       components and subsystems range from UNCLASSIFIED to       CONFIDENTIAL, and technology data and other documentation are       classified up to SECRET.        2. The classified radar operational software utilized with       the exportable AN/MPQ-4F1 Sentinel Radar contains specific       Electronic Counter-Counter Measures (ECCM) capability, but it       does not contain Non-Cooperative Target Recognition (NCTR)/      classification capabilities. This software will only be       released for export in an executable format with no source       code. Without source code, the ability of a foreign entity to       analyze the operating software, its processes, and its       algorithms is slowed. The highest classification of this       software is SECRET.        3. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain       knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements, the       information could be used to develop countermeasures or       equivalent systems which might reduce weapon system       effectiveness or be used in the development of a system with       similar or advanced capabilities.        4. This sale is necessary in furtherance of the U.S.       foreign policy and national security objectives outlined in       the enclosed Policy Justification. A determination has been       made that Hungary can provide the same degree of protection       for the sensitive technology being released as the U.S.       Government.        5. All defense articles and services listed in this       transmittal have been authorized for release and export to       Hungary.                            ____________________     Madam President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute.

The MK 54 Torpedo is a conventional torpedo that can be       launched from surface ships and rotary and fixed wing       aircraft. The MK 54 is an upgrade to the MK 46 Torpedo. The       upgrade to the MK 54 entails replacement of the torpedo's       sonar and guidance and control systems with more modern       technology. The new guidance and control system uses a       mixture of commercial-off-the-shelf and custom-built       electronics. The warhead, fuel tank and propulsion system       from the MK 46 torpedo are re-used in the MK 54 configuration       with minor modifications.
