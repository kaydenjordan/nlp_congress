 Mr. President, we might as well hear clearly what the  ruling of the Chair was, so if you would repeat that, sir.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Of course, I will. And pursuant to S. Res.  47, section 4, the party's presentations are not limited to the record  provided for in section 1 of that resolution.   The Senator from Utah has appealed that ruling; is that correct?    What is the question? Is it, Shall the ruling of the  Chair be sustained? Is that the question?   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Yes.
