 Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman Nadler for his  leadership and thank him for working with me on this effort. I also  thank Congressman Pascrell for his extraordinary leadership in this  regard.   I stand in strong support of our bill, the Public Safety Officer  Pandemic Response Act, because when this pandemic came to the United  States, one thing that was never, ever in doubt was that our first  responders would put on their uniforms and they would risk their lives  to keep us safe.   It was never in doubt because whenever there has been a crisis,  whether it came to my city or to our country, they have always rushed  to be our first line of defense. On 9/11, they rushed into the towers.  During Hurricane Sandy, they braved a superstorm. And now, during the  pandemic, they are on the front lines against an invisible enemy that  has claimed more than 100,000 lives nationwide.   Think of the toll this pandemic has taken on our Nation's heroes.  Think of all those who have gone months without seeing their kids,  their spouses, their own parents. Think of those who have gotten sick.  Think of those who have lost their lives.   The very least that Congress can do right now is give our police  officers, our EMTs, our corrections officers, our firefighters, our  public safety officers the peace of mind that, if the worst shall  happen, we will be there for them and their families.                                time  2045    When this bill becomes law--and it will become law--the family of an  officer who was catastrophically injured or lost their life will not  have to jump through hoops or prove that it was because of the  coronavirus. They won't have to spend 10 years litigating, trying to  convince the government that their sacrifice actually meant something.   Today, we are not cutting red tape; we are stopping the red tape from  happening in the first place. This effort has bipartisan support. And,  nonetheless--and only in Washington, D.C., is this possible--it has yet  to cross the finish line. Our officers cannot afford to wait, cannot  afford to wait for politics. We can't use our cops and our firefighters  as political pawns.   My city has lost nearly a dozen FDNY heroes, over 40 NYPD officers,  and so many more of our brave officers across the United States of  America.   Every Member of Congress loves to take pictures with our first  responders. We love to thank them. We love to rely on them. They  protect our families when we go to Washington, D.C. Well, today is the  day we see who is willing to do more than offer them pretty words on  Facebook. Who is willing to do more than take a selfie?   Today, we see who is willing to help our first responders, like they  wouldn't hesitate to be there for us. God bless you and God bless the  United States of America. Let's be there for our first responders.
