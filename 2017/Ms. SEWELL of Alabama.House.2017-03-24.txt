 Mr. Speaker, for 7 years, our Republican  colleagues have railed against the Affordable Care Act, but is this the  best they can offer now: TrumpCare? The Republican bill, TrumpCare, is  a bad deal for Americans, and it is a bad deal for Alabamians.   By every matrix, cost, coverage, and care, it is a bad deal. On cost,  TrumpCare will cost more and give us less. For Alabama hospitals,  TrumpCare will mean a $97 million increase in uncompensated cost care,  and it is an age tax for seniors. Seniors will pay five times more than  the young for their health insurance.   On coverage, TrumpCare will mean 24 million Americans and 243,000  Alabamians will lose their healthcare coverage. On quality of care,  TrumpCare will mean that essential benefits will be lost: essential  benefits like rehabilitative care, mental health, and preventive  services.   Mr. Speaker, what is clear, TrumpCare is not a healthcare bill. It is  a tax-cut-for-the-wealthy bill--$600 billion in tax cuts. So I say to  you, my Republican colleagues know what they are against, the  Affordable Care Act. But what are they for? What are they for? I ask  all of you.
