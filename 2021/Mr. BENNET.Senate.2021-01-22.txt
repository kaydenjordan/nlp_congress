 Mr. President, yesterday, I voted for H.R. 335, which  waived the requirement that a commissioned officer be retired from the  military for at least 7 years before serving as Secretary of Defense. I  believe civilian control and strong civilian-military relations  strengthens our democracy. Congress designed the waiver process to  guarantee that someone dedicated to the principle of civilian control  can lead our military and to prevent the politicization of the officer  corps. I continue to believe that the waiver should only be granted in  unique cases. Secretary Austin is uniquely qualified to lead at this  moment in our country's history, which is why I voted for his waiver. I  believe Secretary Austin will work to maintain the safety and integrity  of our institutions and further our Nation's interests at home and  abroad. In the future, I will review any waiver that comes before this  body with the care and consideration befitting this process and  subject.                            ____________________
