 Madam Speaker, I thank my very good friend, Dr.   John  Joyce from Pennsylvania.   Madam Speaker, we are witnessing horrible brutality by Vladimir  Putin. He is killing civilians and committing war crimes while Zelensky  has ordered his troops to ``not cross the line between humanity and  animals.''   Zelensky requested aircraft, military supplies, and for credit card  processing to be cut off. Mastercard and Visa stepped up and cut off  their services the day that he asked, on Saturday. And I hope the  aircraft is on its way, as was planned. He also asked for the U.S. to  impose an embargo on Russian oil. Finally, the Biden administration is  taking this important step.   Madam Speaker, 14 months ago, this would have been a simple ask as  we, the United States, were in fact energy independent. Because of the  Biden administration's reckless anti-domestic fuel energy policies, it  is far more complicated. At a time when we should be ramping up  domestic production, the Biden administration is sending officials to  Venezuela and Iran in a desperate attempt to buy oil from these rogue  nations.   The historic gas prices we are all facing are a direct result of the  Biden administration's foolish domestic energy policy. Producing oil  and gas here at home doesn't just keep prices low but serves as a  strategic global advantage.   Madam Speaker, regarding Ukraine, we must lay out our own terms to  Putin: Get out of Ukraine or be subject to war crimes and every  crippling sanction imaginable, as well as to fortify the Ukrainians.   This war is about tyranny versus freedom, oppression versus liberty,  totalitarianism versus democracy, and injustice versus justice. The  rest of the world is watching. This is a pivotal moment. Glory to  Ukraine.
