 Before my friend leaves, I just want him to know that I  relished the opportunity to be here for his, what, 400th or however  long it has been--but his final speech. And I am excited about the  final speech because I have got it pretty well memorized now. And while  I have to say this--I say this about another person who has been on the  committee with me for a long period of time--that while I don't agree  with very much of what you say, you say it so well. That goes with you,  I say to the Senator from Massachusetts, because we cover a lot of  issues in that committee.   I think it was--we have a new majority now. We will see some things  that you will seize upon as opportunities that may make some changes.  And I will be there to try to keep that from happening, but,  nonetheless, we will enjoy it. There are so many issues right now in  the committee, I say this to my friend from Massachusetts, that we are  involved in. You know, one of them is an issue we discussed in some  detail about the Western Sahara and some things that have gone on  there. We find so many things that we can agree on. And I look forward  to being in the new position of being in the minority and combating  from a different perspective.   So congratulations on the commitment that you have made to your cause  and the time and the effort and the eloquence that you have used over  the years.    Madam President, there are many other areas, I recall so  many times, during a long period of time when Democrats were in the  majority, Barbara Boxer was the chairman of our committee; and when  Republicans were in the majority, I would be the chairman and then she  would be the ranking member. But I have to say this, in that committee,  we got things done.   You overlooked the infrastructure thing and how important that was.  And I have a confession that is good for the soul. I have to admit,  every time we had a new infrastructure bill, I started off on the  Democratic side because they seemed to be more interested in some of  the things that I was interested in. Anyway, that is the way it works  around here, and we all love each other. All right?    I will yield, yes.    Don't forget Cal Ripken, the Cal Ripken of climate. That  is pretty good.   Well, Madam President, that is not what I came to talk about. I came  to listen.    Madam President, one of the best presentations I have  heard in a long time was just a couple of hours ago by James Lankford.  What he was talking about, I have never heard a presentation more  heartfelt  [[Page S174]]  and compassionate than he did on the unborn, and I couldn't touch that.  But there are a couple of things I wanted to add that perhaps were not  on his--he didn't have time to get around to.   It is really important that we recognize celebrating this March for  Life that is taking place. It is something that has happened each year  for a long time now. I have always enjoyed being a part of it. We have  large groups of people coming up from Oklahoma.   However, it is virtual this year as everything else is. It is more  important than ever under this new administration and its radical  abortion practices and the personnel that have been suggested to be  part of the administration. So it is going to be maybe a greater fight  than it has been in the past.   In light of that, I am introducing a bill I have introduced before,  but we have never been able to get it passed. It is called Protecting  Individuals with Down Syndrome Act, which will prohibit abortions being  sought because the unborn baby has Down syndrome.   All abortion is tragic, but this population has been specifically  targeted. In the United States--it just turned out this way, and there  is no law that influences it--in the United States, approximately 67  percent of the unborn babies diagnosed with Down syndrome are aborted.  All lives have inherent worth regardless of their chromosome count. I  think we all understand that.   But my fight does not stop there. I am also joining my colleagues in  introducing several pro-life bills as we prepare for March for Life,  including Senator Sasse's. He has a bill that is the Born-Alive  Abortion Survivors Protection Act. His bill ensures that a baby who  survives an abortion will receive the same treatment as any child  naturally born at the same age.   People don't realize this, but babies who have been in an attempted  abortion and they survive the abortion, they don't get the medical  treatment that they normally would get, which this bill directly  addresses. This has been going on for a long time. I have a feeling  that we have an opportunity. The numbers are changing in our direction  in terms of the unborn and have been for some time.   Now, my wife Kay and I have been married 60 years. We have 20 kids  and grandkids, so I know something about babies. I know something about  babies who are born. And I looked up and I saw--because of the great  presentation that Senator Lankford gave, I was looking for some  material I had used in the past.   It was 28 years ago that I came down here to tell the story about Ana  Rosa Rodriguez. This is what I said. I was in the House at that time.  This was in the House Record, and this is what I said at that time. I  said:         Mr. Chairman, there is a big misconception regarding       abortion and the issue of women and their right to protect       their bodies. It is not that right that I object to, but the       right that is given them to kill an unborn fetus--an unborn       [baby].        I want to share with you a story that my colleague, Chris       Smith told some time ago on this very floor. Ana Rosa       Rodriguez is an abortion survivor. At birth she was a healthy       3 pound baby girl except for her injury--she was missing an       arm.        Ana survived a botched abortion. Her mother attempted to       get an abortion in her 32nd week of pregnancy when she was       perfectly healthy--8 weeks past what New York State law       legally allows. In the unsuccessful abortion attempt the       baby's right arm was ripped off [from her body], however they       failed to kill Ana Rosa. She lived.    And I got to know her after that.         Pro-life supporters agreed that nightmare situations like       the Rodriguez case are probably not [all that] common, but       abortion related deaths and serious injuries occur more       [often] than most people are aware.        It is amazing that we can pay so much attention to issues       such as human rights abroad and can allow the violent       destruction of over 26 million children here at home. We are       fortunate that Ana was not one of those children--she       survived.    That was in 1992. I was in the House at that time. But today we still  don't have explicit Federal protections for babies who survive the  brutal abortion process.   Now, as I said, this issue is not about abortion but about caring for  a baby outside the womb. These kids are--they failed an abortion, so  they are alive. In most cases, they are in a hospital setting--in many  cases, anyway--and yet they don't get the same care. They don't look at  them as someone you can save. You don't want to use lifesaving talents  on these babies.   The need for these protections become even clearer as we see States  like New York and Illinois that allow abortion for virtually any reason  up to the point of birth and support infanticide by removing  protectants for infants born alive after a failed abortion.   Just a few years after that speech I gave in 1997, I was on the floor  with my good friend former Senator Rick Santorum to try to pass a  partial-birth abortion ban and end the horrific practice of late-term  abortions. Fortunately, we won the battle against partial-birth  abortions and finally ended that practice in 2003. That ban was upheld  by the Supreme Court in 2007.   But we have yet to pass legislation banning late-term abortions. Only  seven countries allow abortion after 20 weeks, including the United  States and North Korea. Now, that is horrific. The United States is  supposed to be an example in regards to global human rights. Yet we are  on par with North Korea when it comes to protecting the unborn.   Senator Graham's Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act would help  roll back this horrific practice by prohibiting abortions after 20  weeks post-fertilization. That is when we know that babies can feel. It  is not even debatable; they can feel pain at that time.   It is another commonsense bill that should not divide us along party  lines. A baby is a baby whether in or outside of the womb, and each  baby deserves a chance to live as an individual created in the image of  God.   There is still much more we need to do to end the abortion-on-demand  culture. Under the last administration, we protected the Hyde  amendment, reinstated and expanded the Mexico City policy, and stripped  abortion providers like Planned Parenthood from using title X funding  for abortions. Unfortunately, President Biden is trying to undo all  those accomplishments that we made in the last administration.   The need to stand up for our babies is as important today as it has  ever been--certainly in 1992 and 1997 when I quoted from talks I made  back at that time. We will overcome evil with good by upholding and  affirming the dignity and inherent worth of every human being. We will  just keep fighting, and we are going to win this one.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
