 Mr. Speaker, I thank my dear friend from  Louisiana for yielding. We are here this evening to recognize, but most  importantly, to defend the sanctity of human life, something that once  again is under attack in this House.   In response to the left's adamant desire for abortion legislation,  Speaker Pelosi is demanding that we vote on H.R. 3755 to allow abortion  at any time during a pregnancy. The left wants to, in addition, strip  away the rights of States to protect the lives of unborn children. This  is abortion on demand, and quite frankly, the Democrats don't care if  the unborn child has a fully developed heart. They don't care if it has  arms or legs or fingers or toes. They don't care if it feels pain. They  want abortion, period, and they want to finance it with your tax  dollars.   Time and time again, the Democrats in Congress stand in the way of  those of us who are trying to protect the lives of those who cannot  protect themselves. Eliminating innocent human life is despicable. It  is outright evil. And I for one am tired of the left continually  sacrificing the lives of the unborn on the altar of their progressive  ideals.    We cannot give up this fight. We cannot turn a blind eye. We must  defend the sanctity of life and the unborn. Never, and I mean never,  will we falter in this duty.   I stand in strong opposition along with my colleagues to H.R. 3755.  Life is sacred. It is a fundamental and divine right that is gifted to  every single human being, and we will always stand against the abortion  industry and fight. Life and the right to life is something that only  God almighty gives, and it is something that our Constitution  guarantees. So help us God to stand for it.
