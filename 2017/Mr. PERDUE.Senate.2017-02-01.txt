 Mr. President, during the Presidential campaign last  year, President Donald J. Trump promised the American people he would  nominate an unwavering supporter of the U.S. Constitution to the  Supreme Court. He has now kept that promise.   I personally applaud the President for nominating Judge Neil Gorsuch  to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court. He is an outstanding choice.  Throughout his career, Judge Gorsuch has been a stalwart, standing  strong in support of the U.S. Constitution. He has repeatedly shown his  commitment to our country's founding principles of economic  opportunity, fiscal responsibility, limited government, and individual  liberty. These principles have served to  [[Page S570]]  make our Nation exceptional throughout our history. Each branch of  government has the shared charge of preserving and protecting those  rights for all Americans. Judge Gorsuch has had a remarkable career in  both the public and private sectors and has demonstrated a keen  understanding and appreciation of the law.   He has an outstanding academic record. He is an outsider to the  political nonsense here in this town. He has an impeccable judicial  record, and he is actually called a ``judge's judge'' in the Scalia  mold. He is a mainstream judge.   Actually, when he was confirmed in his current position, he was  confirmed by 11 Democrats who are still in this body today, including  Senators Lee, Feinstein, Schumer, and Durbin. Clearly, Judge Gorsuch  will honor the formidable and impressive legacy of defending the  Constitution left by Justice Scalia.   Throughout last year, I and other Members in the Senate held our  ground in saying that no nominee to the Supreme Court should be  confirmed until after the Presidential election. We believed the  American people deserved a voice in the process. We also knew that the  hyper-partisanship and politics of a Presidential election cycle should  never have any place in the nomination and confirmation of a Supreme  Court Justice, which we all know is a lifetime appointment. The  integrity of the advice and consent process, clearly spelled out in  Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution, was at stake. In protecting  the integrity of the sacred constitutional process, we did our job.   Our position was exactly the same, ironically, as held by former Vice  President Biden, former Minority Leader Harry Reid, and others in  earlier times and earlier debates.   Now that President Trump has announced his nomination, it is time to  continue doing our job. I hope the minority leader and Members of the  minority party will walk away from the hypocrisy they are already  demonstrating this year.   Last June, the current minority leader tweeted: ``In order for  justice to remain a pillar of this nation, we must have a functioning  judicial branch. The [Supreme Court of the United States] must have  nine [sitting Justices].'' Later that same month, the minority leader  said before the U.S. Senate: ``Every day that goes by without a ninth  Justice is another day the American people's business is not getting  done.'' So why would the current minority leader and some of the  Democrats in this body now say they will filibuster any nominee to the  Supreme Court before even knowing who would be nominated?   The minority leader railed on the Senate floor. Yet last month he  went on CNN and said: ``We absolutely would keep the seat open . . . we  will fight it tooth and nail, as long as we have to.''   Again, this was before a nominee was even announced.   The political theater of 2016 has no place in the confirmation  process this year. Now is the time to govern, not to engage in the far- off political theater of 2018 and 2020. As we move forward in this  process, I hope the minority leader and my colleagues across the aisle  will remember that. I hope they will put the integrity of the  Constitution before the scope of their political ambition and their  bitterness about last year's election outcome.   I would remind my colleagues across the aisle that Republicans put  aside political theater to confirm two Justices to the Supreme Court  under both President Obama and President Clinton. Now President Trump  has nominated Neil Gorsuch, who is a principled judge who will put the  Constitution of the United States and the rights of all Americans at  the forefront of any decision he takes. Judge Gorsuch's record of  service and his commitment to the Constitution is quite clear. I am  looking forward to voting to confirm his nomination and to ensure that  we have a fully functioning High Court.   I strongly urge my colleagues across the aisle to put aside their  partisan self-interest and do what is right for our country. Our  children and our children's children deserve nothing less.                                  Travel Ban    Mr. President, I also would like to speak momentarily to the  President's recent Executive order to strengthen our refugee screening  process that he thinks will protect America, and I agree with him.   The minority leader's tear-jerking performance over the past weekend  belongs at the Screen Actors Guild awards, not in a serious discussion  of what it takes to keep America safe. Folks back home are fed up with  Members of this body stirring up global hysteria to score political  points.   Let's be clear. This temporary action is not a so-called Muslim ban,  and no Muslim ban has been put into place. As a matter of fact, the  five countries most heavily populated with Muslims around the world  were not included in this temporary pause on movement. In fact, almost  90 percent of the world's Muslim population is not even remotely  affected by this temporary pause.   The seven countries that were included in President Trump's Executive  order--Iraq, Iran, Syria, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen--were  included for specific reasons. Each of these nations was previously  identified by President Obama as posing national security threats to  the United States.   This is not a target at any religion; it is simply a temporary pause  in the movement of individuals from nations of concern in order to  assess whether our current screening system is in the best possible  shape to protect Americans. I am apoplectic that Members of the  minority party and the former President of the United States would  actually say or imply otherwise. Their comments encouraging civil  unrest and disobedience are both deplorable and unacceptable.   The failed foreign policy of President Obama in Syria and the broader  Middle East has made the world more dangerous than at any time in my  lifetime and has helped to create the current refugee crisis around the  world. We are at war with ISIS, and we know they have identified and  targeted our refugee system as a point of weakness. They have already  exploited the refugee systems of nations in Europe, carrying out  terrorist attacks and killing innocent people.   It would be malfeasance for our President not to take action and  immediately review our current screening process to ensure we are  helping those in need and keeping terrorists out. This temporary pause  will allow us to assess our current screening process and strengthen it  as needed. Moving forward, the implementation of this temporary pause  must be efficient and effective.   During this screening review period, we should avoid overreacting to  the responsible steps that have been taken to prioritize the protection  of all Americans. It is totally irresponsible and ridiculous for the  minority leader, Members of this body, the former President, President  Obama, and others to suggest that it is anything other than a rational,  responsible step to keep America safe and deal with the ISIS threat  once and for all.   I yield my time.
