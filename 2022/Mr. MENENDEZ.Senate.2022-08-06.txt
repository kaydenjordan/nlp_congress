 Mr. President, I rise to engage in a colloquy with my  colleague, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Senator Wyden.   In the corporate alternative minimum tax, there is some question as  to whether companies that operate in foreign countries with standard  tax years that are different from the U.S. could lose foreign tax  credits strictly because of these non-conforming years. This may  especially be an issue in the very first year of the corporate  alternative minimum tax's application.   Does Treasury have authority to issue regulations dealing with  potential issues with foreign income taxes relating to nonconforming  foreign tax years and how that impacts foreign tax credits in the  corporate alternative minimum tax? This would include fair rules for  the utilization of foreign tax credits in the law's first year.    I thank the chairman for this clarification of the  provision.
