 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to join my colleagues in considering H.R.  7293, which will designate the facility of the United States Postal  Service located at 770 Ayrault Road in Fairport, New York, as the  Louise and Bob Slaughter Post Office.   Representative Slaughter was a pioneering, ebullient, and  groundbreaking Member of this body whose energetic service on the Rules  Committee changed the dynamics and the culture of the House of  Representatives.   She served here for 31 years, was the first woman ever to chair the  Rules Committee, and coauthored the landmark Violence Against Women  Act.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Morelle) for a further brief statement on her remarkable life and  career.    Mr. Speaker, as the former majority leader of the New  York Assembly, Representative Morelle is a fitting and worthy successor  to Representative Slaughter, whom we all miss. I thank the gentleman  for bringing this legislation forward.   I urge passage of H.R. 7293.   Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers at this time, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   The Foundations of Evidence-Based Policymaking Act, as amended, would  establish a framework to support greater access and use of government  data.   I thank Speaker Ryan, Senator Murray, and Representative Kilmer for  their constructive and collaborative bipartisan work on this issue.   The goal of the bill is to ensure that Congress and the executive  branch are able to make important policy decisions based on evidence,  facts, and science.  [[Page H10526]]    We are in very strong support of this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I support the bill, which is designed to promote the  transparency and accountability of Federal agencies. It would require  agencies to include in their budget justifications to Congress a  summary of the recommendations made by GAO or the agency's inspector  general in the prior year.   Agencies also would be required to explain what steps they are  actually taking to address these recommendations by GAO or their IG or,  if they disagree with those recommendations, why.   The GAO and inspectors general provide critical oversight of the  executive branch of government and provide Congress with invaluable  assistance in helping hold any Presidential administration accountable  for its actions and policies.   Knowing what agencies are doing or not doing to address GAO and IG  recommendations will definitely assist us in Congress in conducting our  constitutional oversight responsibilities.   This is a commonsense measure that all Members should support. I am  delighted to advance it on a bipartisan basis.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am rising in support of the Federal Personal Property  Management Act, which would improve the accountability of unneeded  equipment, furniture, and information technology resources at Federal  agencies.   It may be an appropriate time for us to take up this bill, given all  the furniture strewn throughout the floors of the House of  Representatives.   The GAO recently found that most agencies do not have procedures in  place to identify unneeded personal property on a regular basis. The  GSA has issued regulations establishing a governmentwide excess  property disposal process, but it lacks the authority to tell agencies  how or when to identify excess property. As a result, agencies retain  unneeded property that could be used elsewhere in the Federal  Government, at State or local governments, or in the private sector.                                time  0930    The report also found there is a wide variation in how Federal  agencies classify according to value, which makes it difficult to  measure the total value of the government's personal property holdings.   The Federal Personal Property Management Act would direct Federal  agencies to assess and inventory more valuable property assets once a  year and assets of lower value on a regular basis, according to  guidance issued by GSA.   Requiring agencies to regularly inventory their excess property  should spur agencies to declare excess property more often, allowing  for its disposal.   The bill also would give the GSA authority to establish a uniform  standard for how agencies assess their most valuable property, allowing  for a better understanding and use of its value.   Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support the bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I support S. 3191, the Civil Rights Cold Case Records  Collection Act, which represents an important step toward finally  solving more than 100 unresolved court cases in the civil rights field.   The bill will establish a new civil rights cold case records  collection and review board, so the public can review records related  to these unsolved cases, with appropriate security and privacy  safeguards.   The bill will allow the expertise of outside investigators to help  bring justice to the families and descendants and victims of these  crimes.   The bill also will provide a role for Congress in the appointments to  this review board, to ensure proper expertise and accountability in the  process.   It is imperative that Congress appropriate sufficient funding to the  National Archives and other agencies to carry out the important mission  of this legislation. I urge all Members to support this bill and future  funding measures for this endeavor.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
