 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise today to talk about legislation to  give our economy a shot in the arm and to help raise wages for  Americans all across our country.   When I am back home, whether it is at a small auto body shop or  whether it is at a big steel plant or whether it is at a soybean farm,  I hear the same thing, which is people coming up to me and saying: Hey,  Rob, with all of these regulations coming from Washington, I would love  to hire more people, but I am spending too much time and money trying  to keep up with these regulations.   I think that is true with every Member here, whether you are a  Democrat or a Republican, when you are back home talking to people.  They get frustrated. Sometimes it is local and State regulations as  well, but a lot of them are coming from the Federal Government.   One example would be the Whitacre Greer Company, which makes bricks.  It is a small family-owned business in Alliance, OH, just outside of  Youngstown. They told me recently that complying with just one  regulation is now costing this small company almost a million bucks a  year that they don't have. They have had to go out and borrow the  money, and that has been difficult for them. The cost of just complying  with this one new regulation is about 10 percent of their annual  revenue. Otherwise, that roughly million bucks would have been  invested, they say, in plant, equipment and people. In other words,  they would be able to create more jobs and modernize their facility if  not for that compliance cost.   They are not alone. It is happening all over Ohio and across the  country. Costly regulations are causing companies to pull back on  expanding jobs and creating more opportunity for the people we  represent.   Look, regulation has its place. There is no question about it. We  need regulations. I think everybody acknowledges that. It has a proper  role. We need reasonable laws that protect our health and the  environment and prevent dishonest business practices. But let's make  sure that, as we regulate more and more and more, we have smart  regulations--regulations that make sense and that don't affect these  small businesses, as I talked about with this brick company in  Alliance, OH.   The reality today is that a lot of Federal regulations are more  extensive in scope, more expensive to these companies--and, therefore,  these workers--more unpredictable than they have to be to meet whatever  the policy objectives are.   So Congress writes a law, and we have certain policy objectives, but  then the regulators take that and they change the spirit of the  congressional law instead of meeting that objective in the most cost- effective way possible. So I get that from my constituents, and the  question is this: What do we do about it?   The other thing I hear about is the fact that regulators aren't  accessible. People don't feel like they have any influence over it.   By keeping new businesses from starting and small businesses from  growing, regulations are just making it harder for people to be able to  make a living.   So how did we get here? Why are regulations so expensive and so  burdensome on workers and jobs? I think a big reason is the way the  Federal Government goes about writing regulations. Too often the  process is unaccountable to the people. Too often it is based on sloppy  or even bad information.   The current law that gives us the basic framework for all this  process is called the Administrative Procedure Act. This has been  around for a long time. But guess what. It has not been reformed in any  significant way in 70 years.   The APA, or the Administrative Procedure Act, is something I have  studied  [[Page S2583]]  in law school, as did other people here in this Chamber. It is  something that you would expect to sort of change with the times, but  it simply hasn't. That doesn't make sense.   Imagine if we didn't update our healthcare laws for 70 years. We are  talking right now about updating the healthcare laws that were passed 7  years ago. Imagine if we didn't update our immigration laws for 70  years. Imagine if we didn't update our criminal laws for 70 years. You  know, the world changes. It just doesn't make any sense not to update  our regulation policy because we live in a growing and dynamic economy.  Things are changing, and we have changed a lot in the last 70 years.   We didn't have things like microwave ovens or color TVs, and our  economy was 10 percent the size of what it is today. Yet we are still  using the same regulatory process that was put in place for a totally  different kind of economy.   By the way, in 70 years, we have also learned a lot about how to  regulate in a way that it is more cost effective and more efficient,  and we need to put that into practice. So a reform of our regulatory  process, in my view, is long overdue.   So far this year, we have taken some steps here in the Congress to  give small businesses very specific regulatory relief by rescinding  some of the recent regulations that the Obama administration had  promulgated. We have done this about 10 times now with what is called  the congressional review process. It is estimated that this has saved  the economy a total of $65 billion in regulatory costs and about 45  million hours of paperwork.   I have supported most of these Congressional Review Act bills because  I think they make sense. But this is just a handful of recent  regulations. We have only addressed a few of the symptoms, not the  underlying cause. We still have to deal with the underlying problem of  the way regulations get made. If we don't do that, the regulatory  burden will just continue to increase.   By the way, this should be true whether it is a Republican  administration or a Democratic administration. The same rules ought to  apply.   All of this is why yesterday Senator Heidi Heitkamp from North Dakota  and I introduced bipartisan legislation called the Regulatory  Accountability Act, or the RAA, which would put in place some really  important and very reasonable safeguards on the regulatory process to  get better outcomes.   Every President since Ronald Reagan--Republican and Democrat alike-- has agreed with the idea that regulatory agencies should estimate the  costs and the benefits of something that we all accept. So they put  this into what are called Executive orders saying that they have to go  through the cost-benefit analysis the same way that your family does  and that families in Ohio do when they make a decision as to whether to  buy that car or whether they can afford to send their kids to college.  They figure out what it will cost and what the benefit will be. That  has to go into regulations. Although every President from Ronald Reagan  to Barack Obama has agreed on the need for that, it has never been put  into law.   The first thing this legislation does is very simple. The Regulatory  Accountability Act--the RAA--says that there should be a law, we should  codify the practice so that businesses have the predictability of  knowing that regulations are going to continue to use that commonsense  cost-benefit practice.   The Regulatory Accountability Act would then take the next step of  requiring regulatory agencies, once they have figured out the costs and  benefits of these proposals, to choose the most cost-effective way to  achieve their policy objectives. That is common sense, right? It is not  done now. This is a big change and an important part of the  legislation. Again, it is the same thing people do every day with their  families. When they are deciding where they are going to go to school  or what brand of milk they are going to choose, they go through that  kind of analysis. Let's find the most cost-effective way to accomplish  the goal, one that costs less and has the least impact on the ability  to create jobs.   As I said before, a lot of regulations are expensive. According to  the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, from 2009 to 2014, in  those 5 years, the Federal Government published more than 80 major  rules a year, every year. A major rule costs the economy more than $100  million a year, and there have been 80 a year.   For these major rules, the RAA would let stakeholders ask a court to  review the cost-benefit analysis used by the regulators, so that we  ensure that agencies are using the best information available, not  relying on faulty information or making mistakes. That seems fair to  me, that we should have some process to make sure they are doing the  right thing. This is going to have a huge impact on regulations.   The RAA makes regulators more accountable by bringing the public into  the process. When folks talk about regulations, a lot of the time,  their concern is that they feel they are cut off from the process.  Although they can come to me or their other elected officials and state  their concerns about this or that law, they have no access to the  regulators. They are not elected; they don't feel as if they are  accountable. They can't complain to them, and there is no influence if  they do.   So under the RAA, agencies would have to listen to public comments  and proposals before making a decision. Again, this is an important  change. Instead of waiting until after the decision has been made and  potentially triggering years of litigation, the RAA would move up that  process. An ounce of prevention, my colleagues, is worth at least a  pound of cure. It is a lot better for our companies and for job  creation to put some time into the effort upfront to get it right than  to have to fix it later. I think it is better for the regulatory  process and better for a smart regulatory process in terms of taking  our laws and putting them into practice.   So the RAA requires agencies to choose the most cost-effective  regulations, creates more accountability by involving the public,  ensures we are using better information, and takes existing practice  and puts it into law. Ultimately, this is going to make smarter rules  with better outcomes and will give us a better environment for creating  more jobs with better wages. The RAA will free up more resources for  small businesses to hire more people, raise wages, and purchase more  equipment. That will boost economic growth and benefit all of us.   There are some critics who have suggested that this bill will kill  the regulatory process and prevent new regulations from being issued,  but clearly they have not read the bill. The reason this bill is  bipartisan is because it gives the American people a voice in the  regulatory process and it makes it more effective for both our economy  and for our health and safety. That is the kind of commonsense  regulatory process that hard-working taxpayers expect and deserve from  their government.   We have a lot of support for this bill from workers all over the  country and from a wide variety of industries, including organizations  representing truckers, farmers, electricians, and manufacturers. It is  a bipartisan bill because it is a common-ground bill. It is a middle- ground bill.   I first introduced the RAA 6 years ago, and it has passed the House  of Representatives five times. By the way, on one of those stand-alone  votes, 19 Democrats in the House supported it. Some Democrats who serve  in the Senate today have supported it in the past; they were House  Members then. By the way, that was when the regulatory burden was less  of a problem than it is today. I have always had Democratic cosponsors  of the RAA when I have introduced it here in the Senate.   I am happy to have Senator Heitkamp, Senator Manchin, and Senator  Hatch as the original cosponsors to this legislation because this idea  is needed now more than ever. It is a great opportunity to break  through the partisan gridlock and get something that creates more jobs,  raises wages, and makes a difference in people's lives. I think that is  what the American people are looking for. That is what my neighbors in  Ohio tell me. They want us to get stuff done to help families. I urge  my colleagues to join Senator Heitkamp, Senator Hatch, Senator Manchin,  and me in supporting this legislation that will create  [[Page S2584]]  a more stable and reliable regulatory process and give the people we  represent more opportunity.   Thank you, Mr. President.   I yield back my time.    Mr. President, I wish to honor 374 high school seniors  in eight northeast Ohio counties for their decision to enlist in the  U.S. Armed Forces. Of these 374 seniors from 118 high schools in 98  towns and cities, 86 will enter the Army, 98 will enter the Marine  Corps, 55 will enter the Navy, 26 will enter the Air Force, 3 will  enter the Coast Guard, 95 will enter our Ohio Army National Guard, and  11 will enter the Ohio Air National Guard. In the presence of their  parents/guardians, high school counselors, military leaders, and city  and business leaders, all 374 will be recognized on May 10, 2017, at  the Northeast Ohio Foundation for Patriotism ``Our Community Salutes''  event.   In a few short weeks, these young men and women will join with many  of their classmates in celebration of their high school graduation. At  a time when many of their peers are looking forward to pursuing  vocational training or college degrees or are uncertain about their  future, these young men  [[Page S2610]]  and women instead have chosen to dedicate themselves to military  service in defense of our rights, our freedoms, and our country. They  should know that they have the full support of this Senate Chamber and  the American people, who are with them in whatever challenges may lie  ahead.   It is thanks to their dedication and the dedication of an untold  number of patriots just like them that we are able to meet here today  in the U.S. Senate and openly debate the best solutions to the problems  that confront our country. It is thanks to their sacrifices that the  United States of America remains a beacon of hope and freedom in a  dangerous world. We are grateful to them, and we are grateful to their  parents and their communities for instilling in them not only the  mental and physical abilities our Armed Forces require, but also the  character, the values, and the discipline that leads someone to put  service to our Nation over self.   I would like to personally thank these 374 graduating seniors for  volunteering to risk their lives in defense of our Nation. We owe them,  along with all those who serve our country, a deep debt of gratitude.   I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the names of  the 374 high school seniors.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                            united states army--86         Allan-Berea; Anderson-Medina; Ashford-Maple Heights;       Barnes-Cleveland; Bartoe-Medina; Bonzcek-Fairport Harbor;       Brogan-Brunswick; Brown-Eastlake; Burhoe-Fairlawn; Carey-      Cleveland; Cawrse-Mentor; Clark-Warrensville Heights;       Clements-Maple Heights; Copen-Cleveland; Dachtler-Parma;       Daugherty-Madison; Davis E.-North Royalton; Davis T.-Mentor;       DeGeorge-Mentor; Dohar-Strongsville; Dolan-Willoughby Hills;       Dorsey-Akron; Dunn-Maple Heights; Eakin-Tallmadge; Flanders-      Akron; Frazier-Lorain; Gamble-Euclid; Gatrell-Lorain;       Grissom-LaGrange; Hagan-Perry; Hayes T.-Euclid; Hayes E.-      Strongsville; Hochenberry-Brook Park; Horvat-Medina; Jackson-      North Ridgeville; Johnson-Hudson; Karl-Elyria; Kelly-North       Ridgeville; Kincer-Amherst; Kline-Rootstown; Kurtz-Elyria;       Lebron-Lorain; Lee-Conneaut; Lin-Lakewood; Major-Tallmadge.

This is a big deal. Steve is one of the highest ranking National  Guard officers ever to serve simultaneously in Congress. I think that  is really important because it gives him a unique perspective as a  legislator and puts him in an unique position to advocate on behalf of  our troops.   The title is a great honor, but what is more important, in my view,  is the fact that he earned it. Steve has been serving Ohio as a soldier  for 30 years. He deployed to the Middle East during Operation Iraqi  Freedom, while simultaneously serving as a State senator in Columbus,  and he even earned a Bronze Star for his accomplishments.   Since he came home, he has been serving his neighbors in central and  southern Ohio as a legislator for more  [[Page S2611]]  than a decade. We are really grateful for that because he has been a  faithful Representative in speaking up for his constituents.   I want to congratulate Steve, Karen, and the kids on this exciting  time for them. On behalf of the people of Ohio, I want to thank Steve  and all of our troops for their service.   Thank you.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the  contributions of Dr. Candace Kendle, recipient of the 2017 Lifetime  Achievement Award from the Association for Corporate Growth,  Cincinnati.
