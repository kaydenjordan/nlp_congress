 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 6531, directs the Office of Management and Budget  to lead a government-wide effort to review the share of Federal funds  addressing poverty across agencies. Specifically, OMB must issue  guidance to Federal agencies to increase the share of Federal  investments targeting to areas of high and persistent poverty.   Additionally, the bill directs the Census Bureau to annually publish  a list of all persistent poverty areas. The legislation intends to  produce a consistent listing of areas of persistent poverty for  agencies to use in determining funding allocations.   The Federal Government currently spends an enormous amount of  taxpayer funds on low-income populations. You may ask: Exactly how much  taxpayer funds does the Government spend on low-income populations?  Well, I can tell you from being a minority member of the House  Oversight and Reform Committee that I can't get you that answer because  the Democrats on the Oversight and Reform Committee have produced  absolutely zero oversight during the entire Biden administration.   Despite the excessive spending on that side of the aisle, Madam  Speaker, we have had basically zero oversight of taxpayer funds on the  House Oversight and Reform Committee.                                time  2100    That is important that such funding decisions appropriately balance  the needs of rural communities across America that have been left  behind and are experiencing prolonged struggles with poverty.   Again, I want to remind my friends across the aisle that those of us  on this side of the aisle believe that the best way to get out of  poverty is to create an environment where people living in poverty have  access to good-paying jobs.   But the old model that is the government model that continues to be  espoused by my friends on the other side of the aisle is more  government programs to help those who currently reside in poverty.   Madam Speaker, that is a summary of the bill, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from  New Mexico (Ms. Herrell).    Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers. I have pretty  much summarized the bill in my opening statement, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, today, I rise with a heavy heart to  commemorate the life of the late Jody Cash, a Calloway County Sheriff's  deputy and former Kentucky State Police officer who died in the line of  duty yesterday.   Mr. Cash was a distinguished law enforcement officer in west  Kentucky. His high-level accomplishments and rise through the police  ranks were a testament to his tremendous leadership abilities. But even  more importantly, he truly cared about everyone.   When the nearby town of Mayfield was hit by a devastating tornado  last December, he made daily visits to the scene to help out other  first responders with whatever they needed. No job was too big or too  small.   That was Jody Cash. Even though it wasn't his patrol area, he wanted  to help. He cared about his friends and his neighbors.   On behalf of Kentucky's First Congressional District, my condolences  are with Mr. Cash's family, and we mourn the loss of a brave public  servant gone far too soon.                            ____________________
