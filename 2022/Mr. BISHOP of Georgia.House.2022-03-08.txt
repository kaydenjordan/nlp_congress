 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding and for bringing this resolution to the floor.   Today, I rise in strong support of this resolution condemning threats  of violence against historically Black colleges and universities, or  HBCUs, and reaffirming the important role that HBCUs play in our  country's education, innovation, and leadership.   I am a proud graduate of Morehouse College, one of 107 HBCUs across  this country. My district, in middle and southwest Georgia, is home to  two distinguished HBCUs, Fort Valley State University and Albany State  University, both of which were targeted during last month's bomb  threats.   The incitement of fear and hatred is utterly unacceptable, should be  intolerable, and has no place anywhere, let alone at our sacred places  of learning.   These threats came on the cusp of Black History Month, and they  remind us that we still have not achieved the colorblind world that was  dreamed of by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and of the important  educational mission and empowering roles that HBCUs play for the  African-American community and our Nation.   Today, I urge my colleagues to support this resolution condemning  these dangerous threats to our Nation's HBCUs and the African-American  community and demand that those responsible be brought to justice for  their heinous actions.
