 Mr. Speaker, war criminal Putin is  betraying the young soldiers of Russia to death. 18- to 20-year-old  conscripts are mercilessly sent to Ukraine on a training mission not  knowing they were going to murder Ukrainian families of children,  women, and men. Russian mothers and fathers are lied to by Putin that  this is a ``special mission.''   I especially understand foreign service. My father served in the  Flying Tigers with the Chinese military in Kunming, Chengdu, and Xi'an  to stop aggression in World War II. As a parent, I am grateful my son  Alan served in Iraq, my son Add in Iraq, my son Julian in Egypt, and my  son Hunter in Afghanistan.   I know Russian families are concerned for their sons who are being  sacrificed by Putin, murdering for oil, money, and power in Putin's  war.   That is why I have offered bipartisan legislation to Russian military  defectors for expedited refugee status to America. Defectors who turn  over equipment to Ukraine will receive a payment of up to $100,000.   God bless Ukraine. God save Ukraine. Long live President Volodymyr  Zelenskyy.                            ____________________
