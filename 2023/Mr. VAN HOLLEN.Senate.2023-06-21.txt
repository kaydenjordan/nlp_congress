 Madam President, I rise today to honor the  career of Kurt Newman, M.D., president and chief executive officer of  Children's National Hospital on the occasion of his retirement. For  nearly four decades, Dr. Kurt Newman has made outstanding contributions  to pediatric healthcare for children and families in Maryland, the  greater DC metropolitan region, nationally, and internationally.   Dr. Newman joined Children's National Hospital as a surgical fellow  in 1984 and became surgeon-in-chief and senior vice president for  Joseph E. Robert, Jr. Center for Surgical Care in 2003. Inspired by the  bold vision of making surgery for children minimally invasive and pain- free, Dr. Newman was instrumental in developing the vision for the  Sheikh Zayed Institute for Pediatric Surgical Innovation at Children's  National where he served as founding vice president in 2009.   In 2011, Dr. Newman became president and chief executive officer of  Children's National Hospital, a 323-bed pediatric acute care hospital.  Under his exemplary leadership, Children's National has risen in the  ranks of U.S. News & World Report to be consistently ranked among the  very best children's hospitals in the Nation. Under Dr. Newman's  leadership, Children's National led the critical COVID-19 response by  opening one of the Nation's first drive-thru and walk-up COVID testing  center for children, offering a critical resource for children in the  region and beyond.   Through a culture of patient-centered care, Dr. Newman has championed  innovation in research, operations, and clinical care. He has  strengthened and diversified the economy of the region by growing  pediatric medical research at Children's National and the high-wage  jobs that support that field by turning Children's National into one of  the top-funded pediatric institutions in terms of National Institutes  of Health funding. Additionally, Dr. Newman has worked tirelessly to  draw more funding and attention to the youth mental health crisis  through robust advocacy efforts.   As the majority of Children's National Hospital's patient population  hails from Maryland, Dr. Newman has continuously expanded care into our  State, including the opening of Children's National Prince George's  County on July 23, 2020. This facility, among more than 20 care  locations throughout the State, makes it easier for Maryland patients  and families to receive high-quality care. I want to personally thank  Dr. Newman for keeping members of Congress, especially those of us in  the Washington, DC, metropolitan area, informed about critical  healthcare needs in our region and throughout the country.   Children's National and its many supporters will celebrate Dr. Newman  on his retirement on June 30, 2023, and Children's National will  continue to build upon his legacy to provide high-quality pediatric  healthcare across the Washington, DC, metropolitan region.   As a nationally recognized leader in pediatric health, I commend Dr.  Kurt Newman for his exemplary leadership and dedication to Children's  National over nearly four decades. I congratulate him and wish him a  well-earned, enjoyable, and fulfilling retirement.                            ____________________
