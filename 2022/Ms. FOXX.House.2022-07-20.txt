 Madam Speaker, you don't need to be an economics guru to  understand that President Biden's inflation catastrophe continues to  kneecap our country.   But if you ask the President, the White House press secretary, or  anyone in the administration, for that matter, they would tell you that  the United States is ``stronger economically'' than ever.   How dense does one have to be to claim that, unless this  administration is trying to cover up its ultimate end goal of turning  the United States into Venezuela by taking on so much debt that we  implode? That doesn't seem farfetched in the slightest.   Madam Speaker, inflation is the pickpocket that Americans run into  every day, from the gas pump to the grocery store, and it is only  growing worse.   Since the administration and the President haven't figured this out  yet, let me put this in terms that they understand: 9.1 percent. End of  quote. Repeat the line. 9.1 percent. 9.1 percent.      A Woman's Health Decisions End When the Life of an Unborn Becomes                                  Involved     Madam Speaker, our colleagues keep talking about the issue  of women's health and women's reproductive freedom.   In ``The Merchant of Venice,'' Shylock thought he had won a great  victory when he thought he was going to get his pound of flesh. But  Portia, the attorney, said to the judge: You may have your pound of  flesh but not one drop of blood. I think that is a good analogy for  what our colleagues are saying.   No one is opposed to women protecting their health. But those of us  in the pro-life movement are concerned about when that woman's health  decision destroys an unborn life. So, a woman's health decisions end  when the life of an unborn becomes involved.                            ____________________
