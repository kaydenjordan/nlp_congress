 Mr. Speaker, I rise to take a moment to honor the life of  Samantha Woll, as our neighbors across Michigan and throughout the  country mourn Samantha's tragic murder. She was a deeply loved member  of our social justice community. She was a friend of mine.   Our mutual friend, Dan, reminded me how she showed up to my swearing- in ceremony with that beautiful, sweet smile and the warmest eyes that  greet you. She embraced him in a hug, saying she was so happy that he  showed up and how important it was. That is who she was. She showed up  for others always.   Her organizing work, from progressive politics to interfaith work  between Jewish and Muslim communities, has built bridges and made our  communities stronger.   Please keep her loved ones and our community in your prayers as her  family seeks justice and healing during this difficult time.                            ____________________
