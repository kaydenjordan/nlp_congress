 Madam President, I thank the vice chairman of the  committee, Senator Warner.   I think what we have seen is a process that has tried to take into  account concerns that not just Members but the American people have had  with programs that operate in a degree of secrecy, and I think most  Americans understand why.   The assurance I have tried to make and the vice chairman has tried to  make to our colleagues and to the American people is that we are  vigilant in the rigorous oversight of not just this program but of the  entire complex of intelligence in the United States. It is our job as  committee members, and we do it without the clarity that most members  would like to have on issues. I respect the fact that some still  disagree with us, though the number is small. I also feel extremely  proud today that we are getting ready to, in the next few minutes,  reauthorize the single most important intelligence tool that exists for  us to keep the American people safe.   I think we will look back on this as a needed tool. Today, the threat  landscape looks worse than it probably ever has. The reason Americans  can safely go to bed at night is that there are a lot of dedicated  folks to whom we provide tools in order to keep them safe. It starts  with a vote in this body, and I encourage all of my colleagues to vote,  when given the opportunity shortly, to reauthorize the 702 program.               Vote on Motion to Concur with Amendment No. 1870    Madam President, I move to table the motion to concur with amendment.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion.   The motion was agreed to.                           Vote on Motion to Concur    The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question now occurs on agreeing to the  motion to concur in the House amendment to accompany S. 139.    Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?   There is a sufficient second.   The clerk will call the roll.   The bill clerk called the roll.
