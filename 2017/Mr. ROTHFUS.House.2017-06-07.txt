 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this rule and  the underlying legislation, the Financial CHOICE Act. The acronym  CHOICE stands for Creating Hope and Opportunity for Investors,  Consumers, and Entrepreneurs. This legislation could be very well  entitled the ``Make America Grow Again Act.''   I cannot, Mr. Speaker, understate the importance of economic growth  and what that means to this country: jobs, better jobs; wages, higher  wages; and revenues, more revenues coming into the Federal Treasury as  a result of healthy economic growth that will allow us to pay for the  critical programs that people in this country depend on, whether  seniors, veterans, infrastructure.   You pay for your government with a healthy growing economy. That is  not what we have today. We must grow again, especially as we think of  these individuals.   Opponents of this legislation are defending a stagnant status quo.  They are defending a status quo that has given us the slowest economy  since the Great Depression, a status quo responsible for the loss of  1,400 community banks, a status quo that has a community bank or credit  union closing every single day, a status quo that has resulted in the  noncreation of 650,000 small businesses--that would mean 6.5 million  jobs. Six and a half million people who would be paying taxes, paying  Social Security taxes, paying Medicare taxes, allowing us to meet the  commitments that we have--a status quo that has eliminated free  checking, a status quo that is closing branch office banks in small  towns in my district, a status quo that allows unaccountable agencies  in this town to continue to have too much power and taking away choices  from individuals.   This legislation will end too big to fail and will end too small to  succeed. Regardless of who you are or where you come from, you should  have access to affordable reliable financial services.
