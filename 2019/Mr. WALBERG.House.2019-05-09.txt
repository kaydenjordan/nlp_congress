 Mr. Chair, I thank the lead Republican for yielding.   Mr. Chair, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 986. I would give its  titled name, but it is yet another misleading effort that has nothing  to do with the title of the bill.   House Republicans fully support protections--and I will make it  clear--for patients with preexisting conditions.   I know that my Democratic colleagues and friends want to continue  using the mantra that works so well politically without fact, truth, or  reality during the election. We have gone beyond that now.   Republicans support protections for patients with preexisting  conditions. These patients deserve peace of mind and safeguards from  being treated unfairly. That has always been a priority of ours, and it  will continue to be, but that is not what the bill before us today  would do.   H.R. 986 can be summed up in 3 words: Washington knows best. The bill  eliminates flexibility at the State level, taking away options for  States  [[Page H3522]]  to innovate and bring down healthcare premiums.   The high and rising cost of healthcare is a significant concern for  patients and families in my district. We need to focus on solutions,  not politics. We need to focus on solutions to provide relief from  increasing costs, encourage choice and competition, expand access to  quality care, and maintain--and I will make it very clear here again-- important protections for patients with preexisting conditions.   We have the ideas to do that. We have the amendments that would put  that forward and make this bill something important to people with  preexisting conditions, but that is not being allowed today.   Let's stop playing political games with a bill title and a title like  this and, instead, focus on patient-centered solutions.
