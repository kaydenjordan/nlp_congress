 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, a little over 2 years ago, President Trump stood on the  west front of this Capitol and pledged to dedicate his administration  to taking care of the forgotten men and women of this country. This  bill does not take seriously the plight of those forgotten men and  women. It does take seriously the plight of protecting Democratic  incumbents and candidates.   This bill can't become law. It is never going to pass in the Senate.  It is never going to be signed by the President. But it is important to  talk about it because it reveals the agenda of the Democratic majority  here in the House of Representatives.   This bill, things like the Green New Deal, things like a massive  single-payer healthcare system, and it is pretty clear that Democrats  don't care about the economy. They don't care about the middle class.  Every election I have been in, people talk about rebuilding the middle  class.   My gosh, Donald Trump has rebuilt the middle class, but you don't  care  [[Page H2385]]  about that. You don't care about jobs. You don't care about what people  earn in those jobs, otherwise you wouldn't be opening the borders the  way you are. You care about your own power. You care about maintaining  your own power. It is our job to notify and magnify what is going on  with the Democratic leadership of this House of Representatives. That  is why I am speaking out about it today.
