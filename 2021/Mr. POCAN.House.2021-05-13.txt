 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that Members have 5  legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the subject of this Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, today's Special Order hour is not just about  the violence that has occurred in the last week in Israel and  Palestine. It is not about the activities of the last month, including  the displacement of Palestinian families in Sheikh Jarrah, that have  been largely overlooked in this region. But, in many ways, it is about  what has happened over the last year, the last decade, the last several  decades that has dehumanized and violated the human rights of too many  people in this important region.   No one should have to face the reality of missiles shot at them.  Hamas is causing great danger to the very people it purports to want to  protect in Gaza by doing so, and those missile attacks should be  condemned.   But that doesn't make it a ``both sides'' issue. We must acknowledge  and condemn the disproportionate discrimination and treatment that  Palestinians face versus others in this region.   No one should suffer the loss of life, liberty, or dignity that the  Palestinian people have suffered under the Netanyahu and previous  administrations in Israel during the 50-year occupation of the West  Bank.   When serious human rights abuses compound, such as the recent attacks  on places of worship, like the Al-Aqsa Mosque, the forced removal of  people from their homes, most recently in East Jerusalem, but ongoing  in the West Bank for way too long, the jailing and military court  trials for Palestinian children, the dehumanization of the lives of the  Palestinians by having roads and entrances that are separate for some  people--which all too often looks like a former South Africa, the  blockade and open-air prison conditions for the people in Gaza, where  food and clean water is often scarce.   When those types of human rights abuses occur, we are not just  putting the lives of Palestinians and Israelis at risk, but we are also  putting the United States at greater jeopardy, and eventually, that  could mean the lives of men and women from the United States getting  involved in a greater escalation of violence in the region, which none  of us want to see.   Today, we want to talk about the very long-term problems that have  been, for too long, ignored by U.S. policies in the region.  Fortunately, now more and more Members of Congress  [[Page H2304]]  are wanting to address peace in this region in a more forthright way.   As human rights giant South African Desmond Tutu said, ``If you are  neutral in situations of injustice, you have chosen the side of the  oppressor.''   We must treat everyone in Israel and Palestine with equal respect and  dignity. That is the U.S. policy that we are speaking out for.   I am pleased to be joined by a number of my colleagues tonight who  have taken leadership positions in talking about peace in the Middle  East for all people.   I now yield to my colleague from Michigan (Ms. Tlaib), the first  Palestinian American to serve in Congress.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her very personal  words about the situation in Palestine.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Minnesota (Ms. Omar).    Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Omar for those words.   As we speak, it was just announced a little while ago that the  Israeli military was going into Gaza. It is not clear if it is going  after rocket attacks or Hamas leaders or what is happening. But that is  happening at this very moment.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Minnesota (Ms.  McCollum), a senior, a very powerful Member of this Congress, the chair  of the Subcommittee on Defense of the Committee on Appropriations, and  a lifelong advocate for equality for Palestinians and for Israelis.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative McCollum very much for  those words.   Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time is remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Massachusetts  (Ms. Pressley), my colleague.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for those remarks.   Mr. Speaker, I am going to ask the rest of my colleagues if we can  try to keep it to 3 to 4 minutes each. The good news is there are many  people who are very passionate about human rights in the Mid-East, the  problem is we have an hour total, and I would appreciate that  consideration.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Ocasio- Cortez).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for those words.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Missouri (Ms. Bush).    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time we have  remaining?  [[Page H2308]]     Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms.  Schakowsky), a great colleague and mentor of mine.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for those words.                                time  1900     Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr.  Garcia).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for those words.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from the State of Indiana (Mr.  Carson). He is extremely patient because he has been here nearly an  hour to speak.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his words.   I know we are short on time.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Castro).    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
