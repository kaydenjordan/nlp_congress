 Mr. Speaker, while I was out campaigning, I had the  opportunity to meet with Sheriff Janis Mangum of Jackson County,  Georgia.   She was very open about her concerns to protect her citizens out  there with the defund the police, the disrespect, and just the disdain  for law in general.   There was also an internal concern. I saw a grief where she was  expressing concern for a fellow deputy who had paid the ultimate price  some 6 months earlier.   That is leadership, Mr. Speaker. That is pure leadership.   Anthony D'Esposito is quoted several times from the National Police  Memorial this week: It is not how they died, but it is how they lived.   Sheriff Janis Mangum is a shining example of that quote.                            ____________________
