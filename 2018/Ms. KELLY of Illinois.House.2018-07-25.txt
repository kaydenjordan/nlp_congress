 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to mark Minority  Mental Health Awareness Month.   Mental health challenges do not discriminate. They affect Americans  of all ages, races, backgrounds, and genders. It doesn't matter if you  are from a blue State, a red State, or a swing State. Mental illness is  in your community. It affects your family and exists in your friend  group and with your coworkers.   Tragically, while mental health challenges impact so many people  across the board, too many never see or get treatment because of the  stigma associated with mental healthcare. It shames them into silence.   So it is fitting that this year's theme is ``CureStigma.'' While  stigma keeps far too many from seeking and receiving the care that they  need, the silence of stigma plagues African American populations and  other ethnic groups.   It is a sad and staggering statistic that African Americans are 20  percent more likely to report serious psychological distress than their  White counterparts but just 25 percent will seek care. There is a  tragic inequity in that figure, given that 40 percent of their White  counterparts will seek care.   Is this a matter of stigma? Of access to care, culturally competent  care, and associated resources? Or perhaps a combination of them all.   Mr. Speaker, it is past time that we tackle the stigma associated  with mental health that keeps too many trapped without hope, recourse,  or recovery.   As for access to care, thanks to the Affordable Care Act, all health  insurance plans are required to cover mental health services, just as  they would cover cancer screenings and tetanus shots. Still, this  administration, either through cruelty or willful ignorance, has  actively attacked the mental health requirement and sought to push bad  or, as I call them, junk insurance plans that neglect mental health  services.   We must do better. Congress must be better. Too many, especially in  vulnerable populations, are still in desperate need of this care.   That is why I am proud to be cosponsoring the Mental Health in  Schools Act offered by my good friend, Congresswoman Grace Napolitano.  This bill will provide comprehensive mental health programs to students  in schools, with a special focus on dealing with trauma and violence.  Congress can make a world of difference today, if we pass this bill.   I am also proud to be cosponsoring the Veterans Mental Health  Accessibility Act introduced by my colleague from Pennsylvania,  Congressman Matt Cartwright. His bill would make veterans who serve in  combat zones eligible for more mental health services through the VA.   This is really commonsense legislation. With more than 20 of our  brave veterans committing suicide daily, it is of critical importance  that we pass this bill.  [[Page H7162]]    In closing, I want to remind everyone, my colleagues, and those  watching at home on C-SPAN that mental health is something that we can  all work on. Simple, small, everyday things can make a huge difference.  Here is my personal top five.   First, take care of your body. It is all connected. Even a little bit  of exercise or even a little more sleep can improve mood, reduce  stress, and improve your health all around.   Second, find a stress management strategy that works for you. For  some, it is reading or running, while for others, it is coffee with  friends or takeout and a movie. Do whatever works for you.   Third, surround yourself with good people, be it family, friends, or  someone you can trust in your community.   Fourth, volunteerism is a great way to get out of your own head and  give back to your community. It is good for you and great for your  community.   Finally, if you or someone you love needs help, please get it. Don't  let stigma hold you back.   Mr. Speaker, as Minority Mental Health Awareness Month comes to a  close, let's cure stigma.                            ____________________
