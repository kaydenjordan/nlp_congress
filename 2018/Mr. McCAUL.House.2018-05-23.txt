 Mr. Chairman, I thank Chairman Thornberry for yielding me  time.   Mr. Chairman, protecting U.S. Government communication networks from  foreign adversaries such as China is vital to our national security. I  share the concerns of FBI Director Wray, who testified before the  Senate. He was deeply concerned about the risk of allowing any company  or entity that is beholden to foreign governments that don't share our  values to gain positions of power inside our telecommunications  networks.   Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to see that section 880 of the NDAA of  FY19 addresses this concern by prohibiting Federal departments and  agencies from procuring equipment and services from foreign firms such  as ZTE and Huawei. Specifically, ZTE violated U.S. sanctions and then  got caught lying about it. After agreeing to discipline their  employees, they lied again and, instead, gave those employees a bonus.   Now it appears that we are offering them the same kind of deal. They  clearly do not have a record built on trust with the United States  Government. This poses significant risks to our Nation's security.   However, this prohibition does not apply to State and local  governments, who often rely on Federal grant dollars and play a major  role in the protection of our Nations' security, and that is why I have  offered this amendment.   My amendment simply extends the prohibition on purchasing ZTE and  Huawei products and services to Federal grant money and loans to better  safeguard State and local communications networks.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to protect our Nation's  communications networks from foreign adversaries and support this  amendment.
