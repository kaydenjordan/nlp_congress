 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a resident in  Bucks County, Pennsylvania, who celebrated his 99th birthday last  month.   Morrisville resident Sam Snipes has lived a life defined by service  and community. Following in his father's footsteps in the legal  community, Sam founded the Yardley firm, Snipes & Collins, after  graduating from Temple Law School and Haverford College.   Sam served as a dedicated public servant for nearly three decades as  a Falls Township solicitor. For his community service, Sam was honored  with the United Way of Bucks County Founders Award and the Mark E.  Goldberg Award from the Bucks County Bar Association, among other  distinctions.   Sam truly embodies dedication to our home of Bucks County. He still  lives on Snipes Farm, where he grew up, makes frequent appearances in  parades and other community events, and serves on several boards.   Sam is truly a legend, and we wish him a very happy 99th birthday and  thank him for brightening our community.             Recognizing Baby Bureau in Warminster, Pennsylvania     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a nonprofit  organization in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, that is actively working to  assist underserved new mothers in our community.   The Baby Bureau, based in Warminster, distributes baby bundles to new  mothers shortly after delivery in the hospital. These baby bundles  contain toddler clothes for all seasons, generously donated by  thoughtful parents throughout Bucks County and beyond. To date, The  Baby Bureau has assisted over 2,500 babies and their families.   I extend my gratitude to founder Fran Wasserman for her dedication to  our community's children and families. I applaud her leadership, which  has led to The Baby Bureau's partnership with dozens of community  organizations and local businesses, and I encourage all of our  constituents to follow her lead.                           Recognizing Bill Soloway     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an individual  in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, who embodies resilience, tenacity, and  grit.   Last month, Lower Mayfield resident Bill Soloway took the gold medal  in the 2018 Transplant Games of America, held in Salt Lake City, Utah.  Open to individuals who have received organ, marrow, and tissue  transplants, the Transplant Games offer competitions in a wide variety  of sports, including basketball, track and field, and swimming.   Bill took the gold in badminton singles while earning bronze medals  in badminton doubles and cycling. Bill's successes are made even more  remarkable due to the fact that he was the recipient of a heart  transplant a mere 3 years ago.   After being diagnosed with congestive heart failure, it became  evident that Bill needed a new heart. Despite such an intense medical  procedure, Bill, who is an avid cyclist, was back on his bike only 10  weeks after receiving his new heart.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to call Bill my constituent, and I  congratulate him on his success in the Transplant Games.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R.  5576, the Cyber Deterrence and Response Act of 2018.   Mr. Speaker, our adversaries continually engage in sophisticated  cyber attacks designed to disrupt our critical infrastructure, harm our  economy, and undermine our elections. As has been said time and time  again, our Nation's electoral process is sacred, and it must be  protected at all costs from interference from all hostile foreign  actors.   In February, the Director of National Intelligence stated that  Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea will pose the greatest cyber  threats to the United States during the course of the next year.   We have seen continued hostility from state actors like Russia to  undermine our democratic institutions and  [[Page H7848]]  trigger instability in Europe by weakening key partners like Ukraine  and Georgia.   Mr. Speaker, I saw this firsthand during my time as an FBI agent  working both here domestically and overseas. We must make it clear to  these hostile states that they will face harsh consequences for their  cyber attacks.   That is exactly what this bipartisan bill accomplishes. The Cyber  Deterrence and Response Act establishes a clear framework to deter and  respond to state-sponsored cyber threats. It provides harsh sanctions  through suspension of developmental assistance and credit allotment to  nations engaged in malicious state-sponsored cyber activities against  our United States.    We must hold these foreign actors accountable while strengthening the  integrity of our intelligence community. I commend my colleague from  Florida (Mr. Yoho) for introducing this bill, along with Chairman Royce  and Ranking Member Engel for bringing this vital matter to the floor. I  urge my colleagues, Democrat and Republican alike, to support this  critical legislation that is necessary to protect our national  security.
