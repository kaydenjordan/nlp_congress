 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend  their remarks and include extraneous material on the subject of this  Special Order.    Madam Speaker, I yield the remainder of my  time to the Honorable Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick, and I yield back the  balance of my time.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today in the Chamber  of this hallowed institution to raise my voice, echoing the deep  concerns that reverberate from the hardworking, dedicated, and  patriotic citizens of this great Nation.   Specifically, I stand before you to amplify the anxieties of Black  Americans, who for far too long have been subjected to the harshest  winds of economic hardship.   Today, we find ourselves on the precipice of a financial abyss. I  must underscore the severe impact that the failure to lift the debt  ceiling would have on the lives and livelihoods of Black Americans and  their families across this country.   Our Nation stands on the brink of a financial crisis, our coffers  threatening to run dry as soon as June 1. The hard truth, my  colleagues, is that we have already reached our debt limit of $31.4  trillion, yet we have not reached an agreement to raise the ceiling.  This failure to act is not just a legislative oversight. It threatens  the very fabric of our economy, our society, and, most importantly, our  people's lives.   The debt ceiling, for those unfamiliar, is the total amount the  Federal Government can borrow to meet existing obligations, ranging  from Medicare and Social Security to loan repayments. If we fail to  raise this debt limit, we risk default on our national loans, leading  to a catastrophic fallout for our credit rating and potentially  triggering a deep recession. The ripple effect of such a financial  debacle would not only be felt within our borders but would also  potentially destabilize the global economy.                                time  1945    Now, you may ask, why should Black Americans be particularly  concerned?   The answer lies in the cruel and persistent reality of our  socioeconomic landscape. A deep recession does not impact all  demographics equally. Black Americans are typically among the first to  feel the brunt of economic downturns, often being laid off first and,  tragically, the last to recover.   A default would strike an even harsher blow to the backbone of Black  communities: our elderly. As of 2017, 35 percent of elderly married  Black couples and 58 percent of unmarried Black older adults depend on  Social Security for 90 percent or more of their income. If the debt  ceiling is not lifted, and we default on our obligations, the fallout  would disproportionately harm the Black community and shred the already  thin safety net many rely upon.   The current crisis we face extends beyond Social Security, Medicare,  and essential Federal services. It reaches into the realm of higher  education, ensnaring young Black Americans in the tightening grip of  student loan debt.   The bill that my colleagues across the aisle have brought to the  floor would effectively dismantle President Biden's student loan debt  relief, a plan that promises to lift the yoke of debt from those  earning less than $125,000 annually, forgiving up to $10,000 in student  loan debt, and even more for lower-income borrowers. The Republican  argument that this plan misuses taxpayer dollars to pardon the debts of  some Americans is not just misguided, it is a grievous  misrepresentation of the realities faced by our young citizens,  particularly those of color.   Black college graduates bear the brunt of this student debt crisis.  Over 80 percent of Black bachelor's degree recipients are shackled with  an average debt of over $34,000, according to The Institute for College  Access and Success. Not only are they borrowing more, but they are also  defaulting at higher rates because they are not able to go into higher- paying jobs. These are not merely statistics, Madam Speaker. These are  the dreams of our youth being crushed under the weight of financial  obligations.   In the shadow of this impending catastrophe, we ask: Why has Congress  not acted?   It is the same answer that has plagued institutions for centuries:  politics.   While the Republican-controlled House has passed a bill to raise the  debt limit, it is fraught with spending cuts and new work requirements  for those receiving government benefits, making it an untenable  solution.   Over 85 percent of those persons who are receiving these benefits now  have an elderly person or child or are unable to find public or private  transportation to meet these work requirements. We must think of the  whole continuum in order to fix the problem and not lay blame on the  backs of the poor.   During the Presidency of Donald Trump, Congress raised the debt limit  three times--in 2017, 2018, and 2019--with bipartisan support, and no  precondition on budget cuts. Since 1959, the debt ceiling has been  raised 89 times. A financial crisis was averted because both sides of  the aisle recognized the need to act swiftly and responsibly to protect  the interests of the American people.   Now, as we face a similar situation, the Biden-Harris administration  has drawn a clear line in the sand. They have rightly insisted that  fiscal budgets and the debt ceiling should be separate issues. Again,  fiscal budgets and the debt ceiling should be separate issues. The  former is a debate about the future. The latter is a commitment to  paying our bills for debts we have already incurred. Mixing these two  distinct aspects would be akin to confusing our aspirations with our  responsibilities.   A default would wreak havoc on Federal services that Black and Brown  communities disproportionately rely upon, such as food assistance and  Social Security. It would cause the government to prioritize debt  payments over the well-being of its citizens, leading to a potential  halt on these critical services. The impacts of a default are largely  unknown and could be far-reaching, potentially exacerbating existing  racial disparities in healthcare, veteran services, and the labor  market.   A default would also have a chilling effect on consumer borrowing  costs, with interest rates likely to skyrocket for home, auto, and  personal loans. Furthermore, the increased credit risk of the Federal  Government could significantly hinder credit access for communities of  color, who are already more likely to have weaker credit profiles and  also the history of redlining.   Our Nation is at a crossroads. We cannot allow political brinkmanship  to lead us into an economic downturn that would disproportionately  devastate our most vulnerable communities. A failure to lift the debt  ceiling is not just an economic misstep, it is a failure of our  collective moral responsibilities to all Americans, especially those  who have historically been marginalized and disadvantaged.   Black unemployment has been decreasing, and we have made strides  toward a stronger, more equitable economy. Yet, if a recession were to  happen due to our failure to raise the debt limit, the unemployment  rate for Black Americans would rise again, faster than for other  demographics. This potential economic downturn threatens to wipe away  the progress we have made and plunge us back into inequality and  hardship.   We must not allow a crisis of our own making to unravel the hard- earned progress of our people. We must raise the debt ceiling, not just  because it is economically prudent, but because it is morally right.   The dignity and welfare of our people, especially Black families who  have far too long borne the brunt of economic hardship, hang in the  balance. Let us act not out of fear but out of hope; not out of  division but out of unity; and not out of despair but out of the belief  in the promise of a more equitable and prosperous America for all.   Mrs. CHERFILUS-McCORMICK. Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman  from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).  [[Page H2336]]
