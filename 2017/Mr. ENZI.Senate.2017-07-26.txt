 Mr. President, I have 12 requests for committees to meet  during today's session of the Senate. They do not have the approval of  the Democratic leader; therefore, they will not be permitted to meet  past 11:30 this morning, but I ask unanimous consent that a list of  committees requesting authority to meet be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:         Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation,        Committee on Environment and Public Works,        Committee on Foreign Relations,        Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs,        Committee on Indian Affairs,        Committee on the Judiciary,        Committee on Veterans' Affairs,        Committee on Aging,        Subcommittee on Public Lands, Forests, and Mining,        Subcommittee on Africa and Global Healthy Policy,        Subcommittee on Investigations.     Mr. President, I listened with a lot of interest to the  Democratic leader's comments this morning and his proposal that there  would be cooperation if we went to a system of putting it back through  committees and doing that, but I have to say that we would have a lot  more confidence in getting a solution if there were a single positive  suggestion from the other side for a change. Until that happens, there  isn't much confidence on our side that the promise of bipartisanship is  going to happen.   They keep saying that it isn't perfect, but they don't put forward  ideas for any of the changes. We have been suggesting changes for  several years, and we have been told each time that it just needed a  little more time, that it was a perfect bill.   Soon we will be trying to do a budget. It would be nice if we had  some suggestions on budget items that were positive things. I put out  that offer as well.   The reason we are having this is that more than 7 years ago,  President Obama and congressional Democrats imposed a risky, partisan  healthcare experiment on America that ultimately led to skyrocketing  healthcare costs and collapsing insurance markets for millions of  Americans across the country. This riverboat gamble has caused a stark  and dramatic outcome. Currently, there are projected to be 50 counties  across the Nation that will not have a single insurer participating in  the ObamaCare exchange.   To add further insult, Americans seeking affordable coverage in these  almost 50 counties will still be fined under the ObamaCare mandate for  not having health insurance. In other words, many Americans will either  be forced to pay for insurance they cannot afford or pay a penalty for  not having health insurance under this so-called Affordable Care Act,  which they can't even access. Where are these people supposed to go?  What can we do to help? Again, we are looking for some positive  suggestions.   My colleagues on both sides of the aisle know that this healthcare  experiment has failed and that we must work together to free Americans  from these mandates and put healthcare decisions back in people's  control.   Today, Senate Republicans are taking an important step to rescue the  millions of hard-working families trapped by ObamaCare's taxes and  [[Page S4230]]  mandates. We are trying to repair the Nation's broken healthcare system  because we now have a President in the White House who shares our  commitment to improve America's healthcare system and make better care  available to all Americans.   One of our top priorities in Congress has been to provide relief for  hard-working Americans from ObamaCare, which has pushed insurance  markets to the brink of collapse. In Wyoming and across the country,  premiums for hard-working families are soaring while choices for  patients have dwindled. As I travel across Wyoming, I have a lot of  people who tell me that their health insurance costs more than their  mortgage and, if they ever need healthcare, they have a deductible that  is bigger than that.   Simply put, ObamaCare stumbled out of the starting gate on the very  first date the healthcare.gov website launched. You might remember how  you couldn't get on the website or how you got kicked off after you had  done a lot to put in information. Yes, ObamaCare stumbled out of the  starting gate on the very first day that the healthcare.gov website was  launched, and it has consistently failed to deliver on its core  promises while hurting far more Americans than it is helping.   One thing both parties should agree on is that an accessible and  affordable healthcare system should be available to each and every  American family, and I truly hope my colleagues on both sides of the  aisle will work with us to find common ground on healthcare that truly  delivers better care.   Millions of Americans have been suffering under President Obama's  healthcare law, and this past fall our Nation voted for a change. These  hard-working Americans made it clear that fixing our healthcare must be  a top priority for Congress and the President. This week, we are  delivering on that promise of relief from ObamaCare.   Making America's healthcare system more efficient and effective has  always been an important and challenging endeavor for the public and  private sector alike. President Obama and his congressional Democrats  pushed Washington into the healthcare market, inflicting far greater  uncertainty, cost, and disruption into the healthcare landscape than  anyone ever imagined. By taking the important steps necessary to  untangle Americans from this unworkable, unpopular, and unaffordable  law, hard-working families can expect to see stability in the  skyrocketing healthcare costs and egregious penalties imposed on them  by the ill-named ObamaCare concept of ``affordable care.''   If you are young and healthy, ObamaCare has made it an easy choice to  opt out of health coverage. But for those not so fortunate, for those  who must have coverage, soaring healthcare costs are becoming a  stunning reality. I have constituents in Wyoming who have written to me  with worry and concern about their surging health insurance premiums.   I assume that my 99 other colleagues have received many letters like  one I received from a family in Gillette, WY. They recently wrote me  that under ObamaCare they are paying more than $2,400 a month-- essentially taking on more than another mortgage.   In their letter to me, they write:         Mike, we are small business owners in Gillette, WY. Between       Obama trying to kill the coal, oil and gas industries and his       insurance fraud, we are stuck between a rock and a hard       place. I just paid a $2400 Blue Cross Blue Shield of Wyoming       Health insurance bill. I can't keep doing that. I am a real       person with real problems created by my own government. HELP       MIKE HELP.    That last line of this letter is especially moving: ``HELP MIKE  HELP.'' This is why Republicans in Congress and the President have  focused on doing just that--helping hard-working Americans like this  family in Wyoming. They are looking to us to provide real leadership  and rescue them from the failed ObamaCare law.   The previous administration seemed to focus only on protecting their  self-described signature legislative achievement. Our focus must be to  address ObamaCare's tangled and expensive web of regulations. For  families like my constituents, the situation is grim and only getting  worse by the day.   One of the most disturbing parts of this law is that Americans are  now essentially double-charged by having to pay more in taxes to fund  the very healthcare law that is driving up the cost of their insurance  premiums. Let me explain further. ObamaCare taxes have increased  insurance premiums and limited options for patients and healthcare  providers, including taxes on prescription drugs, over-the-counter  medications, health insurance premiums, and medical devices.   Unless Congress acts, American households will be forced to pay  nearly $1 trillion in new taxes and penalties over the next 10 years.  Individual and employer mandate penalties forced millions of hard- working families into expensive and terribly inadequate ObamaCare plans  that they did not want and could not afford. ObamaCare's crushing  regulations mean smaller paychecks for families and prevent small  businesses from expanding and hiring new workers.   For every American, ObamaCare has meant more government, more  bureaucracy, and more rules and regulations, along with soaring  healthcare costs and few choices. Working together, we can begin to  lift these burdens and higher costs this law has imposed on all  Americans. The bill we are debating this week will begin to provide  relief from ObamaCare that millions of hard-working Americans have long  demanded.   Fortunately, America now has a Congress and a President committed to  helping stabilize the collapsing insurance markets that have left  millions of Americans with no options.   The goal of the Republican healthcare bill will be to improve the  affordability of health insurance, preserve access to care for  Americans with preexisting conditions--yes, to preserve access to care  for Americans with preexisting conditions--and to safeguard and  strengthen Medicaid for those who truly need it. This will be  accomplished by giving States more flexibility and ensuring that those  who rely on this program won't have the rug pulled out from under them.  Most importantly, we will free the American people from the onerous  ObamaCare mandates to purchase insurance that they don't want and can't  afford.   The American people have endured a lot under ObamaCare--including  every broken promise. We all remember President Obama's promise to each  and every American that if they liked their health plan, they could  keep it. Well, Americans soon learned they couldn't keep their plan or  their doctor or any extra money in their wallet. The main reason for  this is because ObamaCare invaded the insurance marketplace and  drastically reduced Americans' choice of healthcare plans and with it  the competition necessary to contain the costs of health insurance. It  was no surprise that the President's promise--if you like your plan,  you can keep it--became the ultimate example of the unfulfilled and  unattainable promises of ObamaCare.   For many Senators, especially from rural States like mine, the real  impact of ObamaCare on our health insurance market is much more  disturbing. Wyoming currently only has one health insurer in the  individual market, both on and off the ObamaCare exchange. Let me say  that again so there is no mistake. There is only one health insurer  either on or off the ObamaCare exchange for all of Wyoming. One health  insurer for all of Wyoming. Many States are experiencing a similar  crisis, with only one insurer left standing since others have entirely  abandoned the exchanges.   For residents of Wyoming and millions of other Americans, the Obama  administration's public relations campaign--on which it spent millions  of taxpayer dollars--touted choice that ultimately became false  advertising. This is the actual ``choice'' for millions of Americans:  one and none--but the ``none'' will cost you because of the mandate  penalty. You can't afford it, so you don't get it, and then it costs  you because of the mandate penalty.   What about the promise of lower healthcare costs that provided the  foundation for my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to pass  this flawed bill? Even President Obama's administration admitted that  ObamaCare is failing to address costs, with average premiums rising by  25 percent for silver-level plans on the Federal exchange. That means  families have to decide whether to purchase unaffordable insurance or  pay a fine. In most cases, they are literally paying  [[Page S4231]]  more money for less control of their healthcare.   Last October's dramatic premium increase was clearly on the minds of  voters when they cast their ballots in the November election. Let me  say that again. Last October's dramatic premium increase was clearly on  the minds of voters when they cast their ballots in the November  election. There is trying to be some blame put on us for those  increases, but that was before last November's election.   This is a crucial time for healthcare in America. We do not have the  luxury of ignoring the crisis in health insurance markets and the  crushing premiums faced by families across the country. Healthcare  costs for my constituents in Wyoming continue to be among the highest  in the Nation, with other States not far behind.   We must act now to rescue the millions of Americans who are suffering  under ObamaCare in order to provide relief to those who have been  harmed by this law. Unwinding this failed law to make meaningful  changes has not been easy, but Americans are relying on us to  accomplish this task and keep the promise to rescue them from  ObamaCare. Our goal is to create a healthcare system where Washington  gets out of the way and families are again empowered to control their  own healthcare, with more choices and lower costs.   So this is where we find ourselves today. Congress and the President  are fulfilling their promise to provide relief for millions of hard- working Americans trapped by Obamacare's taxes and mandates. We are not  tied to any single idea. We hope our Democratic colleagues will  ultimately join us in this worthy endeavor. The American people are  expecting us to act. We must not let them down.   I yield the floor.    What is the time situation?    Mr. President, I yield such time as the Senator from  Kentucky needs.    Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    I object.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the actions  scheduled to take place at 11:30 this morning occur at 3:30 p.m. today  and that all other provisions of the previous unanimous consent  agreement remain in place.    Mr. President, Senator Blumenthal, the Senator from  Connecticut--I ask for 3 minutes from our time, and we will allot that  as long as we preserve the full time for the Senator from Wisconsin.    Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Wisconsin, my  fellow accountant, for doing a good job of accounting there and  providing some charts that very explicitly show what he has been  working on, what he has been encouraging people to do, and  [[Page S4251]]  some solutions. That is what we keep looking for within the criticism  that we are getting from the other side of the aisle--some solutions.   Earlier this year, Congress took an important first step in  fulfilling the promise of repealing ObamaCare by passing a budget  resolution that paved the way for this debate that we are having right  now and paved the way for some real healthcare reforms that we are  currently debating. These reforms are focused on rescuing the millions  of hardworking families who are trapped by ObamaCare's taxes and  mandates.   You heard one example from the Senator from Wisconsin of a family who  is paying excruciatingly high prices for their healthcare only to find  out that they have $16,000 in deductibles, which makes it very  difficult to utilize it at all. Is that insurance, if you have to pay  $16,000 before the rest kicks in?   What we are doing here is working to stabilize collapsing insurance  markets that have left millions of Americans with no options. We  improve the affordability of health insurance. We preserve access to  care for Americans who have preexisting conditions while we safeguard  Medicaid for those who need it the most by giving States more  flexibility. We ensure that those who rely on this program will not  have the rug pulled out from under them. Most importantly, we liberate  the American people from the onerous ObamaCare mandates of purchasing  insurance they do not want and/or cannot afford.   Additionally, these bills can reduce the Federal deficit, the amount  the Federal Government overspends each year, by billions of dollars.  They can also end up saving taxpayers billions more by improving and  reforming the way Medicaid operates. These aspects of the bill are  enormously important. This will be the first time in a generation that  we will have even attempted to rein in any of these programs and put  them on a sustainable path--the ones that are threatening to bankrupt  our country--without pulling the rug out from under people, as you saw  from the charts by the Senator from Wisconsin.   By reducing spending, lowering the tax burden on hard-working  families, and curbing our national debt, which now stands at almost $20  trillion and is on its way rapidly to $29 trillion, we will be ensuring  a brighter and stable fiscal future for our children and our  grandchildren. Actually, with that kind of debt, we are almost ensuring  a brighter and stable future for ourselves. We are in trouble.   While my colleagues complain about using the reconciliation process  to untangle the country from this unworkable, unpopular, and  unaffordable law, they should remember that they actually employed the  exact same procedure to secure the passage of ObamaCare, without having  any input or assistance from Republicans, and rushed it through both  Houses of Congress in less than a week. Senate Republicans are  responsibly utilizing this reconciliation process to address the  healthcare crisis that has been thrust upon America by former President  Obama and congressional Democrats.   There is also the common misconception that some of my friends across  the aisle have promoted--the idea that ObamaCare is a runaway success  and that repeal will be tearing down a functioning program. This is,  simply, not true. My Democratic colleagues know it is not true. Former  President Obama knows that it is not true, and the American people,  certainly, know it is not true.   Here is the reality. ObamaCare has put our health insurance markets  on the brink of collapse in many parts of the country. As I pointed out  in an earlier speech, that began in October of last year, which was  before the elections. It has nothing to do with what has transpired  since the elections. ObamaCare put our health insurance markets on the  brink of collapse in many parts of the country, and what the  Republicans are tackling now is what President Obama and congressional  Democrats simply could not bring themselves to do when they had  control, which was to fix the problems they had created. This may be  because ObamaCare has enshrined their idea that bigger government is  better and that any changes, unless done by Executive action under the  President, were out of the question.   In their zeal to protect this flawed program, they may have missed it  when President Obama himself admitted last year that the law had real  problems.   He said:         There are going to be people who are hurt by premium       increases or lack of competition and choice.    He went on to say that these problems are simply called ``growing  pains.''   Now, these growing pains have forced millions of Americans across the  country to grapple with impossibly high health insurance premiums for  plans they do not want, out-of-reach deductibles to help with common  prescriptions, and disappearing insurance providers to even be allowed  to shop for better coverage.   As I noted earlier, for more and more Americans, there is only a  single insurer from which they can select health plans, and they may  soon not have a single ObamaCare insurer, as 50 counties already do not  have one, and others are threatened. Thousands only have one choice. In  fact, on the Federal exchanges, one in five consumers will only be able  to select plans from a single insurer. Many residents across the  country will have only one choice of health insurer. This includes my  home State of Wyoming, as well as the entire State of Alaska.   What does this lack of competition mean? Premiums are surging for  hard-working families, who now have to choose between unreasonable  insurance rates or an unreasonable fine. If my colleagues wanted yet  further evidence that competition lowers prices, they need look no  further than their constituent mail.   In Wyoming, some families will be forced to pay more than 30 percent  of their total income on premiums in order to obtain healthcare  coverage, which often includes deductibles of over $1,000. One family  faced premiums of more than $1,600 a month. As an alternative, their  tax penalty for not carrying coverage was only $1,700 for the year.  That is a $1,600-a-month premium charge or a $1,700 penalty for not  covering it for the whole year.   So guess what they did? They paid the fine because they could not  afford the insurance premium, let alone the deductible. I think $5.3  million in fines were collected in Wyoming from the people who could  not afford the insurance. They took the lesser alternative of paying a  tax penalty, which gave them nothing.   For those who are lucky enough to be able to afford insurance,  particularly in the individual market, under the new health law,  premiums are expected to increase faster in 2017 than in previous  years. Some States will see insurance premiums rise by as much as 53  percent. That is in 1 year. We are talking about a 4-year doubling of  cost. This will be a 50-percent cost increase in 1 year. That is truly  a healthcare emergency. Not doing anything and accepting the status quo  is simply unacceptable to millions of Americans suffering under this  law.    Now that we have discussed why we are doing this, it is important to  also ask how we hope to help these suffering Americans. It is vital  that we stabilize collapsing insurance markets that have left millions  of Americans with no options, while reestablishing the affordability of  health insurance.   Our bill will also preserve access to care for Americans with  preexisting conditions, and it will safeguard Medicaid for those who  need it most by giving States more flexibility, yet ensuring that those  who rely on this program will not have the rug pulled out from under  them--contrary to the scare tactics being put forth by ObamaCare's  defenders.   Most importantly, Congress is working to free the American people  from the onerous mandates to purchase insurance they don't want or  can't afford.   Congressional Republicans and our President are focused on securing  the future of Americans' healthcare system and truly understand the  importance of restoring the trust of hard-working taxpayers.   What we are doing here under reconciliation, which is a budget  process, will not solve all the problems. There will be an opportunity  for bipartisan investigation, support, and changes if the other side is  willing to do that. There are some things that need to be  [[Page S4252]]  done immediately to protect the American taxpayers and the people who  want to have healthcare.   So I ask everyone to focus on securing the future of America's  healthcare system and to try to understand the importance of restoring  the trust of hard-working taxpayers.   Thank you, Mr. President.   I yield the floor.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Enzi or  his designee be recognized to offer the Heller amendment No. 288 and  that the time until 6:10 p.m. be equally divided in the usual form on  the Casey motion to commit and the Heller amendment. I further ask that  at 6:10 p.m., the Senate vote in relation to the Casey motion, followed  by a vote in relation to the Heller amendment, with 2 minutes of debate  equally divided in the usual form between the votes.    Mr. President, I call up the Heller amendment No. 288.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of  the amendment be dispensed with.    I thank the Senator for yielding.    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate be  in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak  therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Madam President, section 3001 of S. Con. Res. 3, the  concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2017, allows the  chairman of the Senate Budget Committee to revise the allocations,  aggregates and levels in the budget resolution for legislation related  to healthcare reform. The authority to adjust is contingent on the  legislation not increasing the deficit over the period of the total of  fiscal years 2017 to 2026.   I find that amendment No. 271 fulfills the conditions of deficit  neutrality found in sec. 3001 of S. Con. Res. 3. Accordingly, I am  revising the allocations to the Committee on Finance, the Committee on  Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, HELP and the budgetary  aggregates to account for the budget effects of the amendment. I am  also adjusting the unassigned to committee savings levels in the budget  resolution to reflect that while there are savings in the amendment  attributable to both the HELP and Finance committees, the Congressional  Budget Office and Joint Committee on Taxation are unable to produce  unique estimates for each provision due to interactions and other  effects that are estimated simultaneously.   This adjustment supersedes the adjustment I previously made for the  processing of S. Amdt. 267. This adjustment applies while this  amendment is under consideration. Should the amendment be withdrawn,  fail, or lose its pending status, this adjustment will be null and void  and the adjustment for amendment No. 267 shall remain active.   I ask unanimous consent that the accompanying tables, which provide  details about the adjustment, be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:               BUDGET AGGREGATES BUDGET AUTHORITY AND OUTLAYS   (Pursuant to Section 311 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and  Section 3001 of S.
