 Mr. Speaker, there are 4 legislative days left in 2023.   Yesterday, I spoke from the well about the need to provide critical  aid to Ukraine and Israel--just as I did the week before, just as I did  the month before, just as I will continue to do until we act.   All Congress has to show for it is a failed vote in the Senate  yesterday.   Representative Dusty Johnson recently said that there is ``a strong  majority of lawmakers in both the House and the Senate that understand  this world is a lot more dangerous when America recedes from  leadership. Clearly, we want to help our allies like Israel and  Ukraine.''   The Speaker should heed the words of his Republican colleague. He  refuses to give us a clean vote. The world becomes more dangerous. It  must stop.   Mr. Speaker, I will continue until we act.   There are 300 votes on this floor for Ukraine and over 400 votes for  Israel, yet we are unable to vote. That is a shame for our country.                            ____________________
