 Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Chairman, I want to go off script for a little bit and echo the  comments the gentleman was making.   He talked about the Reagan tax cuts and what they did to stimulate  the economy and to grow tax revenues and to allow hardworking American  families to keep more of their paychecks.   I would also go on to remind the gentleman from Kentucky, to disabuse  him about his views of tax reform, and remind him that President John  F. Kennedy, a Democrat, reduced the top marginal rates from 93 percent  to 73 percent. The economy grew, more jobs were created, and more  revenue was created for the Federal Government.   Mr. Chairman, the Federal Government doesn't have a revenue problem.  It has a spending problem. That is what we tackle with the Republican  Study Committee budget.   I thank Mr. McClintock for his incredible and insightful leadership  in generating the FY 2018 RSC budget that we are now considering.   The House Budget Committee's budget proposals continue to benefit  from the framework of the RSC budget by including meaningful,  enforceable reconciliation targets, as our budget does. The House  budget will begin the essential task of implementing these policies  into law.   Other instances where the RSC-led budget proposals have historically  wound up being adopted in the larger House budget include the  following:   First, balancing the budget within a 10-year budget window.   Two, including policies to ensure the solvency of entitlement  programs, such as Social Security, Medicare, and also Medicaid.   Number three, providing the necessary funding and resources for a  robust national security.   Number four, fully repealing ObamaCare.   Number five, establishing a pathway to progrowth tax reform that will  jump-start our economy and help hardworking American families take home  more of their paychecks.   I was humbled to serve as the chairman of the RSC during the 114th  Congress. At that time, we generated a new budget for fiscal year 2017,  called the Blueprint for a Balanced Budget 2.0. It was written and  released in the spring of 2016.   Like the current RSC budget, it provided a robust agenda of  conservative policies to show the American people our vision for this  Nation.   The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.   Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Texas.    In the tradition of The Heritage Foundation's 1980  mandate for leadership that provided a policy agenda for the incoming  Reagan administration, our Blueprint for a Balanced Budget 2.0 for the  new President and his administration set forth an agenda for governing  in 2017.                                time  0930    By all accounts, the RSC budget has proven successful in achieving  this goal, with President Trump basing many of the policies for his  fiscal 2018 budget request on the RSC's fiscal 2017 budget.   I am pleased to see that many RSC-led proposals are included in both  the President's budget and the House budget that we will consider later  today.   In the coming years, I look forward to continuing to see the RSC  putting forth and leading on many conservative, sound policy ideas for  our budgetary process.  [[Page H7860]]    Mr. Chairman, I urge all our colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the RSC  budget and to vote ``yes'' on the House GOP budget.
