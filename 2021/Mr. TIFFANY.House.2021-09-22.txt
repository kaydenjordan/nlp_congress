 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of the Omar family.   On Labor Day, Kelly and Jay Omar ran out to pick up dinner for their  family while their oldest child, Briar, looked after his four siblings.   It wasn't long after they left that the kids started smelling smoke.  Briar and his sister Peyton began looking around and noticed that the  playpen was on fire.   The 13-year-old immediately sprang into action, getting his four  sisters, the youngest of whom is just 6 months old, out of the house.   After Briar got his sisters to safety, he went back into the house in  hopes of putting out the flames with a nearby fire extinguisher, but  the blaze had grown too large to contain. Smoke surrounded him, making  it nearly impossible to breathe or see the way out. Luckily, their  family dog, Mandy, nudged Briar before guiding him out of the house and  back to safety.   Kelly and Jay Omar returned to find their house engulfed in flames  but felt a sigh of relief as they counted each of their children  outside and out of harm's way.   Although they are devastated by what they lost, they remain fortunate  for what they still have.   Thank you for the heroic efforts of Briar to save his sisters.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   The ramifications of this amendment could be dangerous and far- reaching. Quite frankly, we should not be looking outside of the United  States for such scientists and researchers. We should cultivate our own  talent. Unfortunately, this bill does nothing to develop that talent.   We must ask, which foreign nationals would be eligible for the  program? Most likely, those from China.   China is so intent on using our U.S. immigration system to steal our  sensitive technologies that the Trump administration had to issue a  proclamation suspending entry of certain Chinese students and  researchers.   The Trump administration proclamation stated: ``The People's Republic  of China is engaged in a wide-ranging and heavily resourced campaign to  acquire sensitive United States technologies . . . to bolster the  modernization and capability of its military.''   The proclamation went on to state that ``students or researchers from  the PRC studying beyond the undergraduate level . . . are at high risk  of being exploited or co-opted by the PRC.''   Because of the brutal nature of the Chinese Communist Party, the same  is true for virtually any Chinese national who comes to the United  States to study or research, or to otherwise work in sensitive  technologies like those contemplated under this amendment.   In fact, the Department of Homeland Security told us last year that  the Chinese government requires its nationals to ``support, assist, and  cooperate with State intelligence work.''   The idea for this amendment came, at least in part, from the  Commission on Artificial Intelligence, which called for ``increasing  China brain drain.'' So clearly, the green cards contemplated under  this amendment would go to Chinese nationals.   The last thing we should do is make it easy for the Chinese Communist  Party to gain access to our National Security Innovation Base work,  Department of Defense research, or other critical technologies.   I would also note that, sadly, the Department of Defense does not  have a great track record regarding immigrant programs. Many of you may  remember that the Department of Defense supported and encouraged the  Military Accessions Vital to the National Interest program through  which foreign nationals were able to enlist in the U.S. military. Once  enlisted, they were eligible to naturalize.   The Department of Defense was not living up to its promise to  adequately vet and perform high-level background checks on the MAVNI  participants. The program was halted by the Obama administration when  it was discovered that the Department had allowed some Chinese spies to  enlist in the military.   Let that sink in. The Department of Defense let Chinese spies enlist  in the U.S. military. So I am not comfortable with several aspects of  the program created by this amendment. I urge my colleagues to oppose  the amendment.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, so once again, we hear that this will be a  small number of people that are coming in. All we have to do is look at  our southern border and other places for hearing about how small  numbers of people are going to come into our country.   We also hear, trust the Secretary of Defense. As I cited in my  opening remarks, we had a real problem with the MAVNI program, where  the Obama administration discovered Chinese spies in our military. This  is a serious, serious situation.   And here is the thing that I find frustrating, Mr. Speaker. We have  so many people that project our freedoms and how we view them on other  countries, including China, that they treat their people the same way.  They simply do not, and it is fully proven that the Chinese Communist  Party demands complete fealty of anyone, whether they are in China, or  they come to our country to go back and give all information to the  Chinese Communist Party. They do not protect intellectual property  rights, which are a foundation of our freedoms here in America. We  should not be sanguine about what this amendment will do.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this amendment, and I  thank the gentleman from Alabama for the time.   The amendment I speak of comes after many years of experiencing well- documented U.S. Navy maintenance backlogs and deficiencies and much- needed naval upgrades. These backlogs and deficiencies seriously  inhibit our force-in-readiness and operational capabilities.   Our military needs to be the readiest it can be in order to meet the  challenges of the future, and this amendment will help do that.   Shipyards across the country are ready, willing, and able to support  the maintenance and upgrade requirements needed by our naval assets,  including one in Superior, Wisconsin, in my congressional district.   These non-homeport shipyards can support vital surge capacity,  addressing maintenance needs that cannot always be addressed in a  timely fashion at homeports. This change will also support good family- wage jobs across the country.   Mr. Speaker, I am really pleased to have worked with Representative  Stauber just across the border on this amendment. It is so important.  By utilizing those people who work in the twin ports of Superior and  Duluth, with their exceptional workmanship that they provide for  shipbuilding on the Great Lakes, I think this makes this amendment very  worthy.
