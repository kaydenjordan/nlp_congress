 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, last Friday, I went with a group of  Senate Democrats to visit several detention centers at our southern  border, including the Border Patrol facility in McAllen and processing  centers at Donna and Ursula, TX. The searing accounts about the  conditions endured by the migrant families are true. We saw  overcrowding. We heard migrants tell us they are unable to brush their  teeth, shower, call their families, or access feminine hygiene  products. We saw children in soiled clothing, caged and expressionless.  It is heartbreaking--the thousand-smile stares on the faces of toddlers  where smiles and laughter should have been. It breaks your heart and  makes your blood boil all at once.   But we saw something else. I am always looking for the positive. We  saw a much better model employed by a nonprofit Catholic Charities  center, run by Sister Norma Pimentel. There, families had access to  medicine, food, and showers as their asylum cases were being processed  in an orderly fashion. These people were being treated humanely, and  they were following the law.   Sister Norma told us that the government could replicate this model.  She explained that if ICE reinstated the Family Case Management  Program, we could see as high as 99-percent compliance with immigration  court orders without the need for expanded detention and overcrowding.  What a difference that could make.   Sister Norma showed us that we can treat these migrants with respect  and decency without sacrificing border security or law and order. The  two are not mutually exclusive. That is such an important point. You  can have both humane treatment and rule of law. Anyone who says that we  must choose between treating these people humanely and enforcing our  laws is offering a false choice. We can do both, and we can follow the  model of Catholic Charities all along the border.   That is why Democrats have been pushing to restart and infuse more  dollars into alternatives to detention despite Republican objections.  The Family Case Management Program, coupled with a Democratic bill to  address the treatment of children--a bill that Senators Merkley,  Feinstein, Durbin, and I have sponsored, as well as many others--over  30 other Democrats, I believe--would both improve the conditions at the  detention centers and ensure that families comply with our immigration  laws.   I would say one more thing about these kids and the parents. They are  not criminals. I asked Mark Morgan, who is certainly known as a hard- liner on immigration: What percentage of these kids and parents are  criminals? It is a very small percentage. At one point, it was said  that 96 percent--and at another point 98 percent--are not criminals.  They are the same people our grandparents or our great-grandparents or  our great-great-grandparents were, who sought safety and a decent life  in America. Their children and their grandchildren--on my father's side  I am one of the grandchildren, and on my mother's side I am one of the  great-great-grandchildren--have done good things for America throughout  the country. That is what America is all about. These people are not  fleeing to break the law. They are not fleeing to traffic drugs. They  are fleeing because the gangs down there have told the parents: We will  rape your daughter, we will murder your son, and we will burn your  house if you don't do what we want. They are fleeing for the safety,  the beauty, and the opportunity of America, which generations since the  1600s have done and have made this country great.    We need to return to a rational discussion about the reality on the  ground, and that includes a discussion about the root causes of  immigration. Again, when the President says Americans should know that  all of these people arriving at our borders are criminals trying to  game the law, he should know who they are. As I said, Mark Morgan, his  own CBP Commissioner, admitted as much to our congressional delegation  on Friday when we questioned him. The vast majority of families are  fleeing unimaginable violence and degradation in their countries. So  let's get at the root causes of this, instead of just tweeting and  going on TV and ranting, which people have done.   First, allow migrants to apply for asylum inside their own countries.  Second, hire more immigration judges to reduce the backlog in cases at  the border. Third, provide security assistance to these Central  American countries to help them crack down on the vicious gangs and  drug cartels that cause so many to flee in the first place.   This is a rational thing to do. I think most Americans, regardless of  their ideology, regardless of their party, regardless of their  political position, would support this. But the Trump administration  has now pledged to end the security assistance to Central American  countries. That is counterproductive. It is boneheaded because it is  going to cause more people to flee. Unfortunately, it is been typical  of the President's approach. This morning, the President tweeted and  bragged about how he has cut off funding to Guatemala 9 months ago. It  is counterproductive. That means more--not fewer--people at our  borders, plain and simple.   In my experience, I have not seen the President be serious about  dealing with immigration. He has used the issue; he riles up his base  without telling them the truth, making them think they are all  criminals--I see this on FOX News all the time as well--demeaning  immigrants, who are what America is all about, inflaming racial  tensions, and stoking fear.   So we in Congress, Democrats and Republicans, should take the lead  and develop a way forward, a real way that will solve the problems at  the border in a way that complies with humanity, the American way, and  the rule of law.                            ____________________     Madam President, finally, there is something we can vote  on today at long, long last--the 9/11 Victim Compensation Fund for  those brave heroes who rushed to the Towers on 9/11. The light at the  end of the tunnel of what has been a very long and sometimes very dark  time is now only a few hours away. We have waited too long to settle  this matter. Too many people have put up bipartisan roadblocks along  the road.   Now we are here, about to exit the tunnel and guarantee once and for  all that the heroes who rushed to the Towers 18 years ago will no  longer have to worry about compensation for their families when they  are gone. These men and women, many of them sick, some of them gravely  so, will not have to return to Congress anymore to fight for the  compensation they always should have been given. They will be able to  go home, tend to their illnesses, their family members, and their  friends. That is what they always wanted to do--just take care of  themselves, their families, and their friends who got sick from the  poisonous stuff that was in the air right after 9/11, when, bravely,  these men and women rushed to the Towers. That is what we want. We have  waited too long.   Now, we are going to have a few amendment votes first, and I warn my  colleagues on both sides of the aisle: If you vote for these  amendments, you will, at best, delay the bill but, at worst, kill it.  Neither is a good choice, neither is a palatable choice, and neither is  an acceptable choice. Let's defeat these amendments. I believe they  will be defeated. Then, let's pass the bill overwhelmingly.   This body has come together to help veterans time and again. These  people are just like veterans, and 9/11 seemed like a war. I was there.  I was there the next day. I was in Washington the day it happened. In a  time of war, these brave people selflessly risked their lives and  rushed to the Towers to defend our freedom, just like our soldiers do  and just like our armed services do. So we should sign this bill into  law.   Now, I will have more to say on the matter before and after the vote,  about what this means, and thanking the many people, particularly the  first responders--names like Zadroga, Pfeifer, and Alvarez--who made  this happen. Until then, let me just say it is hard for me to express  how much I am looking forward to passing this bill here today.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I am speaking on the bill as well as  the amendments. In a short time, the Senate will vote on and pass a  permanent reauthorization of the 9/11 Victim Compensation Fund.   In my short time on the floor, I can't do justice to the years upon  years of work by the first responders, by labor leaders, by advocates  that led to this moment. Suffice it to say, this is not a day of joy  for them or for this bill's authors; rather, it is a day of relief.   For 18 years, those first responders, some of whom are in the  Gallery, have watched their brothers and sisters get sick because they  rushed bravely to the Towers at Ground Zero. At first, they were told  by the government the air was safe.   It was not safe. We began hearing of cancers that people never got  when they were 38 or 40 or 42 occurring all of a sudden in  firefighters, in police officers, and they only had one thing in  common: They had all rushed to the Towers.   They had to persuade people this was real because they saw their  brothers and sisters dying. Then, they endured folks telling them they  were crazy for thinking they had sicknesses they suffered that had  anything to do with 9/11.   They were not crazy, and the people who told them they were, shame on  them, including government agencies and others. Then, once it was  confirmed beyond a shadow of a doubt that these cancers and respiratory  illnesses were linked to the toxic dust and ash around the pile, it  became an exhausting struggle to get Congress to provide the care they  needed but they couldn't afford.   There were numerous false dawns and delays, temporary  reauthorizations. We were forced to wait and wait, ``compromise'' with  people's lives. Excuse after excuse. Some Senators voted proudly for  tax cuts, unpaid for, to the wealthiest of Americans but demanded  offsets for these folks who had served us, like our soldiers have  served us, like our armed services.   Thank God those excuses, those delays end today for good, and our  first responders can go home and do what they want to do--tend to their  own health, their families' health, the health of their brothers and  sisters who were suffering and ailing, and tend to the families who  have lost loved ones but are still part of their families.   The 9/11 health program is already permanent. Soon we will make the  Victim Compensation Fund virtually permanent as well, and the twilight  struggle of nearly two decades to get these brave men and women what  they deserve will be, hopefully and finally, complete.   Once we defeat the few amendments before us--amendments that will  delay the bill further, if not kill it--we should pass this bill  overwhelmingly so we can send the first responders--those here and  everywhere--home where they belong, with their family and their  friends.   These are the same soldiers of valor who have selflessly risked their  lives in our wars and conflicts overseas. There was a war right in the  city I love, and these were our bravest soldiers. They rushed to the  Towers. Maybe some people were alive. Maybe there were people who could  be saved. We didn't know that then. We saw families holding signs: Have  you seen my sister Mary? Have you seen my son Jim? These people rushed  to the Towers to see if the Jim or Mary or the others were alive and  didn't ask about themselves.   Now we are asking America to stand by them, every American, every  Senator--Democrat, Republican, liberal, conservative--that shouldn't  matter on an issue like this.   We are now at the very end of a long struggle. The struggle may end  for the people in this Chamber, including those of us, like Senator  Gillibrand and myself, who worked so hard through the years for this  legislation. The struggle does not end for those who are sick or who  may get sick and for their families. At least we are giving them some  degree of help because they gave us so much help on that horrible day,  9/11, and those that ensued just afterward.   Let's pass this bill once and for all. Let's do our duty to them, to  America, and to our ideals.   I yield the floor.
