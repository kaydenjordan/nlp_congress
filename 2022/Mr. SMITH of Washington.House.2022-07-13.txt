 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution  1224, I call up the bill (H.R. 7900) to authorize appropriations for  fiscal year 2023 for military activities of the Department of Defense  and for military construction, to prescribe military personnel  strengths for such fiscal year, and for other purposes, and ask for its  immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend  their remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 7900.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 4 minutes.   Mr. Speaker, we have before us today the National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023. As most people know, we have  passed the National Defense Authorization Act every year for 62  straight years, and I urge Members to do it again this year.   I will start by thanking Ranking Member Rogers and the minority. We  have once again managed to work together in a bipartisan fashion to  craft this bill in committee during a roughly 16-, 16\1/2\-hour markup  in which we entertained roughly a thousand amendments and a whole bunch  of different ideas and proposals to create this product.   I think the legislative process is enormously important. We continue  it here with 1,200 amendments submitted to the Rules Committee, 650,  roughly, in order. I am told that is actually a new record for a piece  of House legislation, a record we weren't necessarily looking to set,  but it does reflect the participation in this process of this entire  body of an incredibly important piece of legislation, and we can't lose  track of that fact.   This is the bill that enables the Congress to exercise oversight of  the Pentagon. In this year's budget, we authorize $850 billion. It is  usually somewhere, by the time we are done, around a 3,000-page bill.   It is an incredibly important piece of legislation that gives us the  power and the ability to exercise that important oversight authority of  the Pentagon and Department of Defense.   We have done a lot of good work in this year's bill. I think the  focus, as we go forward, is obviously the men and women who serve and  making sure that they have the tools they need to do the jobs that we  have given them to do.   We could have a robust debate about what those jobs should be, but I  think we can all agree that once that debate is settled and the tasks  are assigned, the men and women who serve must have the tools and the  support from us that they need to do that job.   This year, it has been particularly challenging, given the rate of  inflation. Our bill reflects that, giving some additional support to  our servicemembers and their families to deal with housing costs and  also additional bonus pay to deal with that inflation. So, we support  the servicemen and -women through our financial support and through  making sure that their needs are met.   The other big issue is making sure that the Pentagon is spending the  money wisely. As many of you have heard, I have argued frequently that  the amount of money is not as important as how we spend it. Over the  course of the last couple of decades, we have struggled with the number  of programs that have been over budget and underperforming. We have,  over the course of the last 6 years, put in place critical acquisition  reform and procurement reform to put the Pentagon in a better position  to take advantage of innovative new technologies and, crucially,  competition to make sure that we get a better product.   We are beginning to see the fruits of that success. In programs like  the B-21 and the GBSD, whatever one thinks of those programs, they are  on time, on budget, and actually meeting their requirements, which is a  significant change. That is due, in large part, to a lot of the  legislation that we passed here.   I think we have put together an excellent product. In particular, I  thank my staff and also the Rules Committee staff. The Rules Committee  staff had to sift through those 1,200 amendments, give them the  attention that they are due, and make sure that the process worked.  They did an amazing job working with our staff.   I thank my staff on the Armed Services Committee, both on the  Republican side and the Democratic side, and our bipartisan staff for  doing an outstanding job.   I recognize one of our staff members not able to be with us today who  is normally here. Sharma gave birth to her second child yesterday. She  wishes she were here, but she is also, I think, pretty happy where she  is. So, I want to pass along that congratulations.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

Adam Smith,      Chairman, Committee on Armed Services,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Smith: I am writing to you concerning H.R.       7900, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year       2023. There are certain provisions in the legislation that       fall within the Rule X jurisdiction of the Committee on       Agriculture.        In the interest of permitting your committee to proceed       expeditiously to floor consideration of this important bill,       I am willing to waive this committee's right to sequential       referral. I do so with the understanding that by waiving       consideration of the bill, the Committee on Agriculture does       not waive any future jurisdictional claim over the subject       matters contained in the bill that fall within its Rule X       jurisdiction. I request that you urge the Speaker to name       members of this committee to any conference committee that is       named to consider such provisions.        Please place this letter into the committee report on H.R.       7900 and into the Congressional Record during consideration       of the measure on the House floor. Thank you for the       cooperative spirit in which you have worked regarding this       matter and others between our respective committees.

Hon. Adam Smith,      Chair, Committee on Armed Services,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chair Smith: I write to confirm our mutual       understanding regarding H.R. 7900, the National Defense       Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023. H.R. 7900 contains       provisions that fall within the rule X jurisdiction of the       Committee on the Budget. However, the committee agrees to       waive formal consideration of the bill.        The Committee on the Budget takes this action with the       mutual understanding that we do not waive any jurisdiction       over the subject matter contained in this or similar       legislation, and the committee will be appropriately       consulted and involved as the bill or similar legislation       moves forward so that we may address any remaining issues       within our jurisdiction. The committee also reserves the       right to seek appointment to any House-Senate conference       convened on this legislation or similar legislation and       requests your support if such a request is made.        Finally, I would appreciate your response to this letter       confirming this understanding, and I ask that a copy of our       exchange of letters on this matter be included in the       Congressional Record during floor consideration of the bill.       I look forward to continuing to work with you as this measure       moves through the legislative process.

Hon. Adam Smith,      Chairman, Committee on Armed Services,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Smith: I am writing to you concerning H.R.       7900, the ``National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal       Year 2023.'' There are certain provisions in the legislation       that fall within the Rule X jurisdiction of the Committee on       Energy and Commerce.        In the interest of permitting your committee to proceed       expeditiously to floor consideration of this important bill,       I am willing to waive this committee's right to sequential       referral.

Please place this letter into the committee report on H.R.       7900 and into the Congressional Record during consideration       of the measure on the House floor. Thank you for the       cooperative spirit in which you have worked regarding this       matter and others between our respective committees.            Sincerely,                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Cooper), the chairman of the Subcommittee  on Strategic Forces.  [[Page H6223]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Courtney), the chairman of the Seapower  and Projection Forces Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Garamendi), the chairman of the  Readiness Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Norcross), the chair of the Tactical Air  and Land Forces Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Langevin), who chairs the Subcommittee  on Cyber, Innovative Technologies, and Information Systems.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Escobar), a member of the committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Gallego), who is the chair of the  Subcommittee on Intelligence and Special Operations.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Virginia (Mrs. Luria), the vice chair of the  committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of  my time.   Substantively, I reiterate my initial remarks. I think this is a good  bill that was put together. You have heard a lot of comments from the  individual subcommittee chairs. Many other Members also contributed  significant and important policy to this piece of legislation that  gives us the opportunity to properly exercise oversight of the  Pentagon, which is our job. This bill does an excellent job of that,  and I think, as I mentioned, we have made some progress in recent  years.   The one big point I did not emphasize sufficiently at the start of my  remarks is how important innovation and new technologies are right now.  I don't think there has been a time in the history of warfare where  things have been changing as rapidly. We have certainly seen that play  out on the battlefield in Ukraine but also in other fights that have  happened in smaller conflicts in Armenia and Azerbaijan in the Middle  East.    You have to develop the new, best innovative technology, and as  anyone would recognize, the Pentagon is not typically good at moving  fast. It is a large bureaucracy. It takes them time to process ideas.  What we have done is we have put forth innovative legislation to move  that along faster so that we can develop the better technologies, take  advantage of drone technology, take advantage of AI, and make sure that  our systems are secure. That has really made a huge difference to make  sure that we get the most out of the money we spend and that we are in  the best position to have the technologies that we need. So, a number  of these policies have made a huge difference.   I will use the balance of my time to thank six members of our  committee on the Democratic side who are retiring at the end of this  Congress: Congress Members Langevin, Cooper, Speier, Brown, Murphy, and  Kahele. I thank them very much for their service. As you have heard  many times, the cornerstone of this committee is our bipartisan  approach and our commitment to regular order, to sending our bills  through the normal process in committee, having markups, debates, and  then doing the same on the floor in a bipartisan way, which makes an  enormous difference. These Members have contributed to that. I will  especially recognize a couple of Members because a number have served  for a long time on the committee.    Jim Langevin is the chairman of the subcommittee with the really  complicated name that I have to have written down to remember, but it  has to do with cyber and intelligence matters. Jim has dove into these  issues. When I talk, as I did, about innovative technologies, it is his  subcommittee that focuses on putting us in the best position to deal  with artificial intelligence, to figure out how to use directed-energy  weapons and drones, to do the innovation that is crucial. Jim's  knowledge level on this is above anybody in Congress. He has done an  outstanding job over, I guess it is, 22 years as a Member of Congress  and now a subcommittee chair. His leadership has been invaluable in  those crucial issues.     Jim Cooper, also retiring, is a subcommittee chair. He is very  responsible for getting us to properly focus on space. There is a lot  of talk about the Space Force. Certainly, that is part of it, but that  was never really the entire point. The point was that space has become  crucial in modern warfare. Literally, everything we do gets shut down  if we don't have robust access to our space assets. Recognize the  importance of that and how much that has changed, certainly in the last  50 years but even in the last 10. Chairman Cooper has worked with now- Ranking Member Rogers, also a past chairman of that subcommittee, to  make this happen. Jim's intelligence and leadership have made a huge  difference in those issues.   Jackie Speier is retiring as the chair of the Military Personnel  Subcommittee. It is impossible to overstate the work she has done to  look after the men and women who serve in our forces, most notably, of  course, with her commitment to battling sexual assault and to getting  the major sexual assault reform passed, which we passed last year, to  set up a special prosecutor who will focus on sexual assault cases.  That was a 10-year effort.   A lot of people, when they get involved in politics, they get  frustrated  [[Page H6228]]  that things aren't happening. They don't happen quickly. They get  frustrated by the whole process. I have come up with the saying that,  in politics and public policy, you have to be patient and persistent.  Nobody personifies that better than Jackie Speier. She was absolutely  doggedly persistent in getting the changes necessary to help improve  the way we handle sexual assault and on a wide range of other issues  that have helped protect the personnel who serve in our military.   Lastly, I specifically thank Anthony Brown, a past vice chair of the  committee who has worked so hard on diversity issues. We were able, 2  years ago now, to finally get passed and put in place a commission to  change the names of the military bases in this country and facilities,  as well--not just base names, but those buildings, streets, and a whole  bunch of other things that had been named after white supremacist  Confederate traitors. He did the work to get that through the entire  process, all the way to the point of having to override the President's  veto to get that done.   Now we have a commission that is working on this issue. Certainly, it  is crucial that they change the names, but what the commission is doing  is they have held hearings all across the country in the communities  where these bases are named to talk about the history, about how we got  to this point, what is it that we are actually talking about, how these  bases weren't actually named immediately after the Civil War--they were  named at the turn of the 20th century when there was an effort to  reestablish white supremacy--to really educate and include the  community in the process and, ultimately, in the names that were  selected. That never would have happened without Anthony's hard work.   We have some outstanding members of the committee leading us this  year. I appreciate their service. Again, I thank Ranking Member Rogers  and the Republican staff. We have worked well together--not that we  don't disagree. We absolutely disagree frequently, but we do so in a  way that allows us to resolve those differences, which is the essence  of how a representative democracy is not just supposed to work but how  it must work if it is to survive. I appreciate the opportunity to be  part of that process.   Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support this bill. It is an  outstanding product. Please vote ``yes.'' I yield back the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution  1224, I offer amendments en bloc.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Auchincloss).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.  [[Page H6264]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. Strickland).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I too urge adoption of the en  bloc amendments and yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I think we need to get to a  reasonable defense budget. Full disclosure: I don't support the effort  to cut $100 billion from the defense budget. I think we have clearly  articulated needs. But I think the President and the Department of  Defense, when they put forward this budget, took that into account.   One of the things I have always been worried about on the Armed  Services Committee is if we just give them more and more money, they  won't spend it as well as they should. They will not have the fiscal  discipline to go in there and make sure that the money is being spent  wisely, which I have said many, many times is as important and, in many  cases, more important than how much is spent.   Over the course of the last 20 years, we have not had a good record.  Many programs have gone over budget and underperformed. We are getting  better, but I think we need to live within our means.   The President put forward his budget. We ought to respect that budget  and support it. It is more than enough to defend the country.   If we go back to the President's number, it is $813 billion, which is  a significant 4 percent increase over last year's budget. It is not  like we aren't spending money if we stick to the President's budget. I  think that number should work, and I think that is the number we should  stick to.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for offering that amendment and  making the arguments she has.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  offering this amendment. I think it is incredibly important.   Mr. Garamendi outlined it quite well. There was a process to go  through at DOD to determine what the budget should be. Once that  process is done, we should respect that process, not allow everybody in  the institution to say, ``Well, I would like to have more money.'' I  can assure you that there would be unfunded requirements in every  single aspect of government.   You have to make choices. That is what DOD does. That is what the  budgeting process does.   What the unfunded requirements list does is it simply perpetuates the  notion that you can never spend enough money. I submit that that  attitude toward the defense budget--that whatever it is, it has to be  higher--has a lot to do with all the inefficiencies, the lack of an  audit, the number of programs that have gone overbudget and have  underperformed, the number of programs that have never worked out the  way we envisioned them.   If there was fiscal discipline in place, we would get a better  result.   Allowing people to always ask for more, no matter what, undermines  fiscal discipline. I also submit it undermines the effectiveness of the  Department of Defense.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly support this amendment.    Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at the  desk.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes.   This amendment has to do with the retirement of nine littoral combat  ships.   The Department of the Navy, the Department of Defense, wants to  retire those nine ships. An amendment was added in our committee that  does not allow them to retire five of those ships. My amendment would  strip that and would allow the Department of the Navy to retire the  ships they want to retire.   We just heard a lengthy speech about the wisdom of our various  service Secretaries and how they know what they need. Well, the service  Secretary and the Department of Defense know that they no longer need  these nine littoral combat ships. We should not be blocking their  effort to save money and retire them.   The biggest reason we have a problem with this is these ships are not  that old. But they have also not turned out to perform the way they  were expected.   In particular, they were supposed to have antisubmarine capability,  and they were supposed to have demining capability. They have neither  of those. They have also turned out to have significant maintenance  problems and costs associated with simply operating them.   The Navy has determined that it is better to invest in newer, more  modern, more capable platforms, and we are blocking their ability to do  that. The littoral combat ship has not lived up to its expectations.   Now, let me be clear, it is an extraordinarily difficult time to  figure out how you build the right systems. But throwing good money  after bad doesn't make sense, and that is the primary argument for not  allowing the Navy to do this. ``Well, they just built them,'' almost  whether they work or not, ``why would we retire them after 3 or 4  years?'' Because they are not working as expected, and they are not  cost-effective.   Mr. Speaker, I urge that we adopt this amendment to allow the  Department of Defense to do what they want to do: retire these ships  and build a better, stronger, more capable Navy.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Maine (Mr. Golden).    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close. I  understand the gentleman has the right to ultimately close the debate,  so I will reserve the balance of my time, unless he is prepared to  close.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of  my time.   Mr. Speaker, in that time I will attempt to make three quick points.   Number one, in response to Mr. Gallagher, as he well knows, the LCS  has literally no role in the counter China fight. It has no capability  that will help us in dealing with China. So whatever your concern about  China, LCS ain't going to deal with it. It may have capabilities  elsewhere, but it wouldn't survive 2 seconds in a fight against China-- and we all know that--which leads to my second point.   The number of ships isn't the point, it is the capability of our  overall systems. This amendment takes the money out of this and puts it  into more munitions, which we desperately need, and puts money into  more operation and maintenance within the Department of the Navy, which  Congressman Waltz has correctly pointed out we also desperately need.  This money is put someplace that is vastly better.   Lastly--I will come back to that first argument--the Department of  the Navy is determined this is not where they should spend their money.  But understand, we are hearing all these arguments about China, China,  China, China--this is the point--build the capabilities and build the  systems that can deal with the fight we face with China. The one thing  you have to understand is the LCS is 100 percent not it.   Mr. Speaker, we can spend this money better and this amendment does  that. I urge its support, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution  1224, I offer amendments en bloc.
