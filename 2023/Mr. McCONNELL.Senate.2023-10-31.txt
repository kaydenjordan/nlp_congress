 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, the brutal terrorist attacks of October  7 poured gasoline on the flames of anti-Semitic hatred around the  world. Take the alarming reports this weekend out of Russia, a country  with a long, troubled history of anti-Semitism. After weeks of pro- Hamas propaganda spewed from the Kremlin, an angry mob overran a  provincial airport and surrounded a plane that had just arrived  [[Page S5237]]  from Israel. Chillingly, the mob went person to person, checking  passports and asking if they were Muslim or Jew--a modern-day pogrom in  Southern Russia.   Vladimir Putin is usually quick to accuse other countries of imagined  atrocities, but he has issued no such condemnation of Hamas for the  very real savagery inflicted on innocent Israelis. In fact, as this  latest despicable episode of anti-Semitism unfolded on Russian soil,  Putin's regime welcomed a delegation of Hamas terrorists to the  Kremlin.   The Russian Government's policy is to demand that Israel agree to a  cease-fire--a de facto amnesty for the terrorist aggressors who  slaughtered children in their homes a few weeks ago. In that regard,  street protestors across the West have found common cause with a  Russian dictator.   No major power has done more to turbocharge Iran's terrorist network  in the Middle East than Putin's Russia. The Kremlin's intervention in  Syria allowed Tehran to establish a massive corridor of resources to  terrorist proxies like Hezbollah and Hamas. So it should surprise no  one that Iran has happily provided Russia with a kamikaze drone to fire  at Ukrainian cities.   Russia, Iran, and China do not share an ideology, but they do share  interests. They see themselves in conflict with the West and especially  with America. Russia would love to see Iranian-backed terrorists in the  Middle East weaken America and our allies. Iran would love to see a  Russian victory against Ukraine that divides the West and deepens its  own defense cooperation with Moscow. China, for its part, would love to  see America's resolve to stand with European and Israeli allies and  reestablish actual deterrence against Russia and Iran crumble.   So at the risk of repeating myself, the threats facing America and  our allies are serious, and they are intertwined. If we ignore that  fact, we do so at our own peril.                            ____________________     Mr. President, the Biden administration's defense  budget requests have systemically ignored these growing threats. The  President's supplemental request to address multiple crises that have  unfolded on his watch is a recognition of this failure. So our  colleagues on the Appropriations Committee now have a chance to provide  critical resources that our military and defense industrial base needs  to keep pace with growing threats and support our partners.                            ____________________     Mr. President, Congress also has an opportunity to  force the administration to start treating our southern border like the  sovereign, legal boundary that it is. The southern border crisis is not  a problem of insufficient resources. It is not the zero-sum alternative  to deterring our adversaries overseas. It is the direct result of  misguided policies that have incentivized record illegal migration.   It doesn't take tens of billions of dollars to fix this problem; it  just takes common sense. I would urge our Democratic colleagues to show  some common sense by working with Republicans to stop the border  crisis, rebuild American military strength, and stand with our friends  in Ukraine, Israel, and Asia.                            ____________________     Mr. President, now on a related matter, I spoke  recently about alarming reactions to the October 7 attacks coming from  America's top universities. We have seen student radicals spew outright  hate and campus leaders respond with agonizing, equivocating  statements. But it appears that neither thick-headed, young activists  nor mealy-mouthed administrators can hold a candle to university  faculty when it comes to moral obtuseness. Here are a few examples:   After a student group at Columbia published a letter describing  Hamas's savage attacks as the--listen to this--``struggle for freedom''  of ``occupied peoples [who] have the right to resist occupation,'' over  100 faculty members signed a letter of their own expressing a desire to  ``preserve Columbia University as a beacon for fostering critical  thinking and opening minds to different points of view.''   Needless to say, I am a staunch supporter of the First Amendment.  People are entitled to different points of view, but they aren't  entitled to different facts, and the only group that has occupied Gaza  since 2007 is Hamas.   Besides, America's higher education system has a long way to go when  it comes to protecting free speech and fostering diverse viewpoints.  Just ask any right-of-center academic. But, of all places to start on  their journey toward freedom of expression, they choose to celebrate  terrorism--terrorism?   Meanwhile, the University of Pennsylvania is facing a donor revolt  over campus protests and an anti-Semitic literary festival that  predated October 7, but that didn't stop the local chapter of,  essentially, its professors' union from issuing a six-page letter  denouncing the university administration's pro-Israel views.   The school's painfully nuanced attempts at moral equivalency are,  apparently, an ``erasure'' of Palestinian voices. Donors' outrage at  radical calls for a pogrom are ``coercive threats'' that demand their  removal from all university boards.   Let us remember who is doing the aggressing here. There is an open  FBI investigation into online threats encouraging the murder--the  murder--of Jewish students at Cornell. The university has had to bring  in police to help protect the kosher dining hall on campus, and many  Jewish students are opting to stay in their rooms for safety.   Until recently, the tenured leftwing apparatchiks of America's elite  universities might have expected donors to keep on writing checks no  matter which sort of unhinged, post-modern hate they ginned up. Well,  not anymore.   At Penn, one alumnus's call to boycott the school has spread like  wildfire, precipitating a crisis that, by one account, could put a $1  billion hole in the university's books. At least a dozen CEOs have  pledged not to hire any members of the Harvard student groups who  blamed Israel for the murders of its children. And elite law firms have  started rescinding job offers from law students who regurgitate  terrorist talking points. Some are even competing with each other to  fund relief efforts in Israel.   So activist professors are entitled to their own opinions. But money  is also protected speech, and they aren't entitled to donors'  pocketbooks. That is not how the real world works.   America and our allies have woken up from a ``holiday from history.''  American business and philanthropists are starting to do the very same  thing. Let's hope it continues.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
