 Madam President, today, I am honored to recognize  in the Record a gentleman from whom I have had the opportunity to learn  and to work with through a great company located in my great home State  of Georgia. Mark Alagna is the vice president of UPS global public  affairs and has announced he will retire in June after having served  the company for 35 years.   The world headquarters for United Parcel Service, called UPS, has  been based in Georgia since 1991. It is the second-largest company in  Georgia, and in 2018, UPS earned $72 billion in revenue with locations  worldwide. This company means a lot to my State.   In addition to that, UPS is a leader in delivering workforce training  and mentorship programs that emphasize the development of professional  skills, safety, and efficiency.   As the chairman of the Subcommittee on Employment and the Workplace,  I am always looking out for Georgia companies and workers, especially  the ones that set the bar high. Mark Alagna has been an important  member of that company who has provided me and my staff with needed  information and assistance for many years.   Mark's service to UPS is long and distinguished, rising through the  ranks as a loyal employee serving a company that reciprocated that  sense of loyalty and development for a good staff member. He has been  with the company since 1984 when he was hired as a package car driver,  delivering packages directly to customers who depended upon this  service. For the last 24 years, he has worked in the company's public  affairs department, looking out for the company's interests by working  effectively with Members of Congress in Washington, with a particular  policy focus on labor issues.   Mark also serves as liaison to the board of the National Coalition of  Multiemployer Pension Plans, is vice chair of the Labor Policy  Coalition, and sits on the labor and pension advisory committee. Prior  to joining the global public affairs team, Mark also managed several  staff and operational assignments in the mid-Atlantic area for UPS.   I will miss the opportunity to work with Mark, who has been a trusted  associate, and his absence will be felt at UPS and by all those who  have had the opportunity to work alongside him. We all wish Mark and  his family the very best in a long and happy retirement.                            ____________________
