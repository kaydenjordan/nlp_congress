 Madam President, I rise today to honor an exceptional  member of the Air National Guard. I would like to recognize Lt. Col.  Laurie Rodriguez's distinguished service and dedication to enhancing  the relationship between the National Guard and my office as a  legislative liaison.   A native of Brandon, SD, Lieutenant Colonel Rodriguez enlisted in the  South Dakota Air National Guard and was later commissioned as a force  support officer. She has served 25 years in both the South Dakota and  Mississippi National Guard in a broad range of drill status and Active- Duty assignments, including a deployment to Afghanistan in support of  Operation Enduring Freedom. Currently, she is excelling in not one, but  two, demanding positions as the 186th Force Support Squadron commander  and as the joint team lead for the National Guard Bureau Office of  Legislative Liaison. Additionally, she has served Active-Duty tours at  Headquarters Air Force, the Executive Office of the President's Office  of National Drug Control Policy, and several offices within the  National Guard Bureau.   Lieutenant Colonel Rodriguez has served as a legislative liaison  officer since October of 2018. Her attention to detail and  responsiveness strengthened the relationship between my office and the  National Guard immeasurably. Additionally, she formulated the  congressional engagement plan and prepared National Guard leadership  for over 71 meetings and hearings, informing congressional members on  the National Guard Bureau's legislative priorities. Her efforts played  a pivotal role in securing $129 million in appropriations in support of  counter drug operations helping deter the opioid epidemic. Laurie also  served as lead action officer on the impacts the creation of the Space  Force had on 13 National Guard units with space missions. Finally, she  answered hundreds of congressional inquiries, which provided critical  information necessary for the consideration of three National Defense  Authorization Acts. She did all of this while taking care of the men  and women under her command at the 186th Force Support Squadron.   After concluding this challenging assignment in August, Lieutenant  Colonel Rodriguez will take on another challenging role as a deputy  division chief within the National Guard Bureau Operations Directorate.  She embodies the qualities that the Nation expects from our officer  corps and has a promising career ahead in continued service to our  Nation. In closing, I express my gratitude and appreciation to  Lieutenant Colonel Rodriguez for her excellent support of my office in  furtherance of National Guard missions and my appreciation to her  supportive husband, Angello Rodriguez. I wish this National Guard  family all the best in their next chapter of service to our Nation.                            ____________________
