 Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the bill in  its current form but there are some really good things in this  legislation, and I will talk about why I can't support it at this time.   But first, I thank my dear friend, Chairman Price, for his work on  the T-HUD portion of the bill, and, most importantly, as the chairwoman  said, for his lifetime of honorable service to this country.   I know that the committee and Congress will miss Mr. Price. He has  been, frankly, a privilege to work with. Not that we don't have  disagreements, but we always work through those disagreements in a  respectful, open process.   Evidence of his life and his service can be found in this bill as  well as other past T-HUD bills. One example, Mr. Chairman, is the  manufactured housing initiative that will, frankly, help revitalize  communities across the Nation. Chairman Price listened to stakeholders  and developed this innovative program with his characteristic deep  understanding of policy.   I have said--and I know he doesn't feel it is a negative thing, on  the contrary, I say it with great compliment--that he is a total policy  wand, Mr. Chairman. And this is one of those areas where you see his  policy involvement.   Some of you may not know that the Committee on Appropriations  unanimously voted to name this efficiently the Preservation and  Reinvestment Initiative for Community Enhancement, PRICE, after  Chairman Price. And I thank the chairman for including the funding that  he did for port infrastructure. I would also mention that he and I, and  the entire T-HUD Committee, have always made safety a priority, and  this bill continues in that tradition.   The bill modernizes air traffic control systems to make sure that  they are the safest in the world, as well as it makes progress in road  and rail safety.   We share a priority of supporting American innovation, whether it is  automated vehicles to unmanned aircraft to commercial space, this bill  makes key investments in those areas as well. And it provides over $3  billion above last year, just to maintain HUD's current rental  assistance programs. And that is something that, obviously, we all  support, but I want to mention that those are things that once we do,  we have to continue to fund every single year. Obviously, I support  renewing this assistance, especially to the elderly, our disabled, and  our veterans.   Again, much of the HUD spending in this bill will create new  liabilities for future years. For example, the bill expands Section 8-- a program that obviously we all know about--by $1.1 billion.   This new spending would, in essence, require several billion dollars  for renewals in future years. So, in essence, it becomes a de facto  mandatory requirement which creates many, many issues.                                time  1400    Let me be clear. I cannot support the bill at its current spending  level. The bill was written under unrealistic top-line numbers, set by  the majority. As a result, this bill has an overall increase of 12  percent above last year, which is, again, not acceptable. Inflation is  at a 40-year high.    Mr. Chair, inflation is at a 40-year high. Contrary  to what some say, we cannot address inflation by spending more money-- by continuing to spend more and more money. Instead, we need an  agreement that reduces excessive spending that balances defense and  nondefense spending, and, again, removes all of the controversial  riders.   Once that happens, Mr. Chair, I am confident that we will be able to  reach an agreement that this House and the majority and the minority  can live with.   Again, I thank Chairman Price for his leadership, his friendship, and  openness. He will be missed. I would be remiss if I didn't thank the  chairwoman  [[Page H6737]]  and the ranking member of the full committee for their leadership.   I am confident that we will eventually be able to have numbers that  we can live with and have a bipartisan bill, but until then, I have to  oppose the bill.
