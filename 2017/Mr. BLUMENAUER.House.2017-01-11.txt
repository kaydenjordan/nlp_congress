 Mr. Speaker, there is lots of incredible news out  there. The Trump press conference just makes your head spin, but we  have seen that the public's voice does matter.   Because of public outcry, within minutes after the late-night closed  meetings, the Republican plan to gut the independent Office of  Congressional Ethics was reversed. In response to outrage about  jeopardizing health care for millions of Americans, some Republicans  now admit that repealing the Affordable Care Act is not quite so simple  and maybe they should come up with a replacement, even if they don't  yet know how to do it. Senate Republicans even delayed some of the  Cabinet confirmation hearings to allow a more orderly review and  scrutiny.   Your voice does matter.   The President said last night that change only happens when ordinary  people get involved, get engaged, and come together to demand it.  Obviously, these fights are just beginning, but the last 10 days shows  that together we can and will protect the values and programs so vital  to America.                            ____________________
