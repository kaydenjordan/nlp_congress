 Well, first, to Senator Corker. There is a reason Members  want to serve on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. We had a long  list of Members who wanted to join our committee in this Congress.  Quite frankly, I think the reason they want to join is not only the  challenges we have globally but the fact that this is a committee that  works bipartisanly and respects the views of every single Member, both  Democratic and Republican, on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.   The bill we have before us reflects that--in the best tradition of  the U.S. Senate and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. That is  due, in large part, because of the talent, leadership, and commitment  of our chairman. I thank Senator Corker for allowing us to reach this  very important moment in the U.S. Senate, to be able to vote on a bill  that is consequential for America's national security.   I believe this is the first major bill we have had on the floor of  the U.S. Senate, the first bill we have had amendments to, and I concur  in the Senator's observations that our leaders allowed us to let the  process work in the best traditions of the U.S. Senate.   It is difficult for many of us to explain how the Senate operates at  times. It really is difficult, but it is a body which respects the  rights of each Member, and they have certain abilities to slow things  down or bring us to a stop, and the process doesn't work the way it is  supposed to work, but this bill has been handled very quickly on a  major subject because we respected the rights of every single Member of  the U.S. Senate. It doesn't mean we reach total agreement. We didn't,  but we have a bill that accomplishes three very important things:   First, it stands up to the aggression of Russia and Iran. Yes, we  have been talking about this--and I am glad Senator McCain is on the  floor. Senator McCain has been one of the most ardent crusaders to  point out the risk factors of Russia to our national security and that  of our allies.   I started with Senator McCain in January. We sat down, and he  informed me why we had to do certain things and make it very clear and  not have any ambiguity because Russia would run right through that  ambiguity. Thanks to that initial leadership, we have those provisions  in the underlying bill. There will be no ambiguity as to what Congress  is saying in regard to Russia's behavior.   I also acknowledge we have a review process in here. Senator Graham  brought that to our attention very early in the process in January so  Congress can insert itself.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional minutes.    That review process will give Congress the right role to  review executive actions so we are stronger, working together. It also  gives the President a stronger hand in negotiating with Mr. Putin and  Russia because Congress has said: You must accomplish certain  objectives, such as getting Russia's aggression to end in Ukraine or  get Russia to stop supporting war crimes in Syria, to stop interfering  with our democratic election systems. That is what we say, and we are  very clear about that.   Then we take the third step, which I think is very important; that  is, provide the wherewithal of U.S. leadership, working with our  European allies, to protect our democratic institutions.   All of that is included in the bill that we are going to have a  chance to vote on in a few minutes, and I want to thank all who were  involved. I am going to include staff who worked so hard on this.   They were here 24/7 putting this bill together--Damian Murphy, in my  office; Margaret Taylor; and Jessica Lewis, Dana Stroul, Lowell  Schwartz, Sean Bartlett, Chris Barr, John Ryan, Leslie Bull, Danny  Ricchetti, as well as Todd Womack, Rob Strayer, David Kinzler, and Ben  Purser.   They were extraordinary in helping us reach this day.    Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, April was National Minority Health Month.  I point that out because I have worked with many of my colleagues in  order to advance minority health.   We have done some very important things in recent years that I am  very proud of, and many of those are included in the Affordable Care  Act. I know that Senator Carper and Senator Blumenthal will be on the  floor; Senator Carper is here now. They have been instrumental in  advancing quality healthcare for all Americans, but we do recognize  that we have a special role in regard to historic discrimination on  minority health. I was pleased that the Affordable Care Act included  the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities so  that we could have a focal point at NIH to deal with the historic  problems and have a game plan to advance that.   I was also pleased that the Affordable Care Act provided coverage for  minorities in greater numbers because when we looked at the number of  uninsured, the number of minorities were a much higher percentage than  the general population of uninsured. When we looked at inadequate  coverage, we saw the same numbers. So we have made advancements.   In April, historically, I had filed a resolution in order to  acknowledge the progress we made and to continue our commitment to make  sure that all Americans have access to affordable, quality healthcare  and that we do not discriminate. That resolution had always cleared  without any difficulty until 2017. For reasons I cannot explain, there  were Republican objections, and we were not able to adopt the  resolution commemorating minority health month.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of that  resolution be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:         Promoting minority health awareness and supporting the       goals and ideals of National Minority Health Month in April       2017, which include bringing attention to the health       disparities faced by minority populations of the United       States such as American Indians, Alaskan Natives, Asian       Americans, African Americans, Latino Americans, and Native       Hawaiians or other Pacific Islanders.        Whereas the origin of National Minority Health Month is       National Negro Health Week, established in 1915 by Dr. Booker       T. Washington;        Whereas the theme for National Minority Health Month in       2017 is ``Bridging Health Equity Across Communities'';        Whereas, through the National Stakeholder Strategy for       Achieving Health Equity and the HHS Action Plan to Reduce       Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities, the Department of       Health and Human Services has set goals and strategies to       advance the safety, health, and well-being of the people of       the United States;        Whereas a study by the Joint Center for Political and       Economic Studies, entitled ``The Economic Burden of Health       Inequalities in the United States'', concludes that, between       2003 and 2006, the combined cost of health inequalities and       premature death in the United States was $1,240,000,000,000;        Whereas the Department of Health and Human Services has       identified 6 main categories in which racial and ethnic       minorities experience the most disparate access to health       care and health outcomes, including infant mortality, cancer       screening and management, cardiovascular disease, diabetes,       HIV/AIDS, and immunizations;        Whereas, in 2012, African American women were as likely to       have been diagnosed with breast cancer as non-Latina White       women, but African American women were almost 40 percent more       likely to die from breast cancer than non-Latina White women;        Whereas African American women are twice as likely to lose       their lives to cervical cancer as non-Latina White women;        Whereas African American men are 60 percent more likely to       die from a stroke than non-Latino White men;        Whereas Latinos are 1.7 times more likely to be diagnosed       with diabetes by a physician, and are 40 percent more likely       to die of diabetes, than non-Latino Whites;        Whereas Latino men are 3 times more likely to have HIV       infections or AIDS than non-Latino White men;        Whereas Latina women are 4 times more likely to have AIDS       than non-Latina White women;        Whereas, in 2014, although African Americans represented       only 13 percent of the population of the United States,       African Americans accounted for 43 percent of HIV infections;        Whereas, in 2010, African American youth accounted for an       estimated 57 percent, and  [[Page S3538]]       Latino youth accounted for an estimated 20 percent, of all       new HIV infections among youth in the United States;        Whereas, between 2005 and 2014, the number of Asian       Americans diagnosed with HIV increased by nearly 70 percent;        Whereas, in 2014, Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders       were 1.7 times more likely to be diagnosed with HIV than non-      Latino whites;        Whereas Native Hawaiians living in the State of Hawaii are       5.7 times more likely to die of diabetes than non-Latino       Whites living in Hawaii;        Whereas Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders are 30       percent more likely to be diagnosed with cancer than non-      Latino whites;        Whereas, although the prevalence of obesity is high among       all population groups in the United States, 42 percent of       American Indian and Alaskan Natives, 41 percent of Native       Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders, 40 percent of African       Americans, 31 percent of Latinos, 24 percent of non-Latino       whites, and 11 percent of Asian Americans are obese;        Whereas, in 2013, Asian Americans were 1.2 times more       likely than non-Latino Whites to contract Hepatitis A;        Whereas, among all ethnic groups in 2013, Asian Americans       and Pacific Islanders had the highest incidence of Hepatitis       A;        Whereas Asian American women are 1.3 times more likely than       non-Latina Whites to die from viral hepatitis;        Whereas Asian Americans are 3 times more likely than non-      Latino Whites to develop chronic Hepatitis B;        Whereas of the children living with diagnosed perinatal HIV       in 2014, 65 percent were African American, 15 percent were       Latino Americans, and 11 percent were non-Latino whites;        Whereas the Department of Health and Human Services has       identified heart disease, stroke, cancer, and diabetes as       some of the leading causes of death among American Indians       and Alaskan Natives;        Whereas American Indians and Alaskan Natives die from       diabetes, alcoholism, unintentional injuries, homicide, and       suicide at higher rates than other people in the United       States;        Whereas American Indians and Alaskan Natives have a life       expectancy that is 4.4 years shorter than the life expectancy       of the overall population of the United States;        Whereas African American babies are 3.5 times more likely       than non-Latino White babies to die due to complications       related to low birth weight;        Whereas American Indian and Alaskan Native babies are twice       as likely as non-Latino White babies to die from sudden       infant death syndrome;        Whereas American Indian and Alaskan Natives have 1.5 times       the infant mortality rate as that of non-Latino whites;        Whereas American Indian and Alaskan Native babies are 70       percent more likely to die from accidental deaths before       their first birthday than non-Latino White babies;        Whereas only 5 percent of Native Hawaiian and Pacific       Islanders, 6 percent of Asian Americans, 8 percent of       Latinos, 9 percent of African Americans, and 14 percent of       American Indians and Alaska Natives received mental health       treatment or counseling in the past year, compared to 18       percent of non-Latino whites;        Whereas marked differences in the social determinants of       health, described by the World Health Organization as ``the       high burden of illness responsible for appalling premature       loss of life'' that ``arises in large part because of the       conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work, and       age'', lead to poor health outcomes and declines in       longevity;        Whereas the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act       (Public Law 111-148; 124 Stat. 119)--        (1) has reduced the uninsured rate for minority communities       by at least 35 percent;        (2) has helped further combat health disparities for low-      income individuals through coverage expansions in the       Medicaid program under title XIX of the Social Security Act       (42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq.) and the individual health insurance       marketplaces; and        (3) provides specific protections and rights for American       Indians and Alaskan Natives, 21.4 percent of whom lack health       insurance;        Whereas, despite the substantial improvements in health       insurance coverage among women overall, women of color are       more likely to be uninsured;        Whereas, in 2012, 36 percent of Latina women, 29 percent of       American Indian women, 23 percent of African American women,       19 percent of Asian and Pacific Islander women, and 14       percent of non-Latina White women were uninsured;        Whereas community-based health care initiatives, such as       prevention-focused programs, present a unique opportunity to       use innovative approaches to improve health practices across       the United States and to sharply reduce disparities among       racial and ethnic minority populations: Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That the Senate supports the goals and ideals of       National Minority Health Month in April 2017, which include       bringing attention to the severe health disparities faced by       minority populations in the United States, such as American       Indians, Alaskan Natives, Asian Americans, African Americans,       Latino Americans, and Native Hawaiians or other Pacific       Islanders.     I thank Senators Menendez, Blumenthal, Brown, Hirono,  Markey, Klobuchar, Van Hollen, Booker, Peters, Duckworth, and Carper  for their help in regard to minority health and the resolution.
