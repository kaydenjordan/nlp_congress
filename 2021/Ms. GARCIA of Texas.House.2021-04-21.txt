 Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the  NO BAN Act. In 2017, when the Trump administration implemented the  first travel ban, nearly a thousand college students around Texas were  forced to make a choice. Either stay in the United States to earn a  world-class education or visit their family abroad and risk being  blocked from returning to their studies. This is a choice that aspiring  students should never be forced to make. Evidently, these travel bans  were not in place because of national security. These bans were used as  a tool to discriminate against the Muslim population. Texas is home to  one of the largest and fastest growing Muslim populations in the  country, and these bans separated families across many of our  districts. I applaud the Biden-Harris Administration for revoking these  discriminatory bans. But, now is the time for Congress to deliver to  the American people by ensuring that no future administration works to  discriminate against vulnerable communities. I urge a yes vote.
