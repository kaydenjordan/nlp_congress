 Mr. Chair, typically, a budget is a  blueprint for how our government plans to meet our obligations to our  people; but not this time.   By including reconciliation instructions for their tax plan, the  Republicans are using this budget as a blueprint to give tax cuts to  the wealthiest few, without requiring bipartisan support.   Under this bill, a family making $50,000 a year could see their tax  burden go up, while millionaires will save $230,000. And who will pay  to make the rich richer? Our working families, children, and seniors.   This budget slashes priorities like education, infrastructure, and  veterans' benefits, and even guts Medicare and Medicaid by $1.5  trillion.   ``You can't make guarantees,'' is how Treasury Secretary Mnuchin  responded when asked if the Republican tax plan would help the middle  class. But the thing is, you can make guarantees. If this Republican  budget moves forward, it will guarantee that inequality gets worse,  while the rest of us pay to help make millionaires into billionaires.   Mr. Chairman, I reject this budget and ask my colleagues to oppose  it.
