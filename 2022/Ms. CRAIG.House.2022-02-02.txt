 Mr. Speaker, today for the Jazz and Friends National Day  of School and Community Readings hosted by HRC's Welcoming Schools  program, I am going to read from the book ``Calvin'' written by JR and  Vanessa Ford and illustrated by Kayla Harren of Minnesota.   It is critically important to make sure that transgender and  nonbinary youth not only feel supported but valued and affirmed for who  they are.   I am reading from the book ``Calvin.''   [[Page H341]]              For as long as I could remember, I knew I was a boy.        I'd draw myself with short hair and a shirt like Papa's.       I'd dream about swim trunks like my dad and brother wore.        I didn't tell my family until the night before our summer       trip to Gigi and Papa's. I was scared they wouldn't believe       me. But I knew it was time to be me.        Whenever I have to do something scary, my dad always says:       ``Take deep breaths and count down from five.''        Breathe in. Breathe out. Five, four, three, two, one.        ``I'm not a girl,'' I told my family.        ``I'm a boy--a boy in my heart and in my brain.''        ``We love you if you are a girl, boy, neither, or both. We       love you whoever you are,'' my dad said.        Later, Dad told me the word for how I felt was transgender.       Being transgender means other people think you are one       gender, but inside, you know you are a different one.        I wondered how Gigi and Papa would react. As we got closer,       I squeezed my stuffed lion to my chest. I had already told my       family who I was. Now I needed to tell them my name.        ``The same name as your favorite stuffed lion?'' Dad asked.        ``It's why I named him that. It's always been my name to       me.''        When we got to Gigi and Papa's, Dad told them my new name.       He introduced me.        Our summer trip turned out to be the best ever. At the       comic convention, Papa bought me my favorite costume. My       favorite superhero signed my poster, using my real name.        At Water World, Gigi bought me and my brother matching swim       trunks. Even the water slides felt better in them.        In line for popcorn, I made a new friend. I felt proud to       tell him my name. We spent the whole day together.        On the last day of vacation, at the big outlet stores near       Gigi and Papa's, I picked out new clothes. That night I gave       my family a fashion show.        ``You look so handsome,'' Gigi told me.        School was starting soon, and I knew there was only one       more thing I needed to feel like me.        When I looked in the mirror, I finally saw me.        Dad said there were other transgender people in the world,       but I didn't know any kids like me at my school--and my       school started next week.        Being the only one felt scary.        How would everyone treat me?        What if my friends wouldn't call me ``he''?        What if, what if, what if?        The first day of school, I dragged my feet to the door.       Breathe in. Breathe out. Five, four, three, two, one.        ``Welcome back to school! We're glad you are here!''        When the principal said my name, I felt safe and happy.        Violet skipped up to me, calling out my new name, too.        ``You know my name?'' I asked.        ``Yup! Your dad told my mom you are a boy now.''        ``I have always been a boy inside. Are we still friends?''        ``Yes! Did you bring your jump rope for recess?''        When I stepped inside my classroom, I couldn't believe what       I saw. The cubby, the lunch chart, the homework station, and       the mailboxes, the name tag on the table, my new name was       everywhere, everywhere it should be.        I felt my fears start to go away.        ``Welcome back, class! For morning meeting, we'll all share       about our summers.''        I knew just what I would say when it was my turn.        I stood up proudly to share my summer story. But first, I       introduced myself. ``Hi,'' I said. ``My name is Calvin, C-a-      l-v-i-n.        And I felt my what-ifs melt away.                            ____________________
