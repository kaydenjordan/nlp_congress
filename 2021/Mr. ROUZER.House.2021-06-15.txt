 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Last Congress we worked together to ensure bipartisan support for  several regional water bills, including this one.   H.R. 610 codifies the Environmental Protection Agency's existing  restoration work in the San Francisco Bay estuary and establishes a San  Francisco Bay program office.   I urge support of this legislation and reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1230     Madam Speaker, in closing, I urge support of this  bipartisan legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 587, introduced by Congressman Peters from  California and others from his home State, is a bipartisan bill that  aims to make permanent a regulatory exemption under the Clean Water  Act. This exemption allows certain wastewater treatment facilities  seeking to discharge to the ocean to apply for permit modifications  that offer alternatives to the Clean Water Act's secondary treatment  standards.   These alternative standards must be met every 5 years during the  normal permit renewal period. This permit renewal process is lengthy,  complex, and costly.   The city of San Diego's Point Loma Wastewater Treatment Plant has  been operating under this regulatory exemption for well over two  decades.   The objectives of this bill are worthy and a win-win for the city and  the environment.   Madam Speaker, the bill will help ensure that San Diego has long-term  certainty for its water supply and will save the city millions of  dollars and protect regional ratepayers from billions in new costs by  providing this regulatory certainty while preserving applicable  standards.   Madam Speaker, I support this legislation, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 587 would support the water recycling and  conservation efforts of the city of San Diego's Point Loma Wastewater  Treatment Plant by making permanent its longstanding regulatory  exemption under the Clean Water Act.   Madam Speaker, this is a good bill, and I urge support of this  bipartisan legislation.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 1144, the PUGET SOS Act, codifies the  Environmental Protection Agency's existing restoration work in the  Puget Sound and establishes a Puget Sound program office.   Puget Sound was one of the first estuaries designated within the  National Estuary Program in 1987, and EPA has worked with Federal and  non-Federal entities to coordinate restoration efforts. This bill  ensures this important work will continue.   Madam Speaker, I urge support of this legislation, and I reserve the  balance of my time.

Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1300     Madam Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to  the gentlewoman from Washington (Mrs. Rodgers), the ranking member on  the Energy and Commerce Committee.    Madam Speaker, in closing, H.R. 1144 would continue the  EPA's management of a competitive grant program to support projects  that protect and restore the Puget Sound.   Madam Speaker, I urge support of this legislation, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 2008 reauthorizes the Environmental Protection  Agency's section 319 Nonpoint Source Pollution Control program under  the Clean Water Act.   Reauthorizing this program reinforces the Federal leadership that  helps our State and local partners in their efforts to control nonpoint  source pollution.   For example, my home State of North Carolina typically receives $1  million for competitive grant funding for watershed restoration  projects. This money is put to good use conducting watershed  restoration projects like stormwater and agricultural best management  practices and restoration of impaired streams affected by nonpoint  source pollution.   In my district, some of these grant funds are being used to reduce  stormwater runoff volume on the campus of UNC-Wilmington.   Madam Speaker, I urge support of this legislation, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  [[Page H2766]]    Madam Speaker, in closing, the Section 319 Nonpoint Source Pollution  Control program has benefited water bodies all across the country and  reauthorizing this program will reinforce this successful cooperative  Federal, State, and local partnership to control nonpoint sources of  pollution around the country.   Madam Speaker, I urge support of this important legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 1921, the Protect and Restore Lake Pontchartrain  Basin Act, introduced by my friend Garret Graves from Louisiana, would  reauthorize the Lake Pontchartrain Basin Restoration Program to provide  assistance to the Federal, State, and local watershed partners in  addressing the water quality challenges that are in this especially  sensitive area.   I support the critical work these partners are doing to help restore  the water quality of the lake, and this bill will help continue this  work.   I commend Aviation Subcommittee Ranking Member Garret Graves for his  leadership on this issue, and I urge support of this legislation. I  have no further speakers, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Graves), who is the Aviation Subcommittee  ranking member.    Madam Speaker, H.R. 1921 would reauthorize an important  program that supports the critical efforts of the Federal, State, and  local watershed partners in restoring water quality in the Lake  Pontchartrain Basin.   Madam Speaker, I urge support of this important legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
