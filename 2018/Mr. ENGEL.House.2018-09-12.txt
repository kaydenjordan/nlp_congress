 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this measure. We are taking up a  bill from the Senate that I fully support, with a couple of small  amendments.   One of these amendments is to rename the legislation after a Member  of this House. I find myself experiencing a little bit of denial,  because it reminds me that one of our most able and valued colleagues  is about to wrap up her distinguished career. I can't imagine what it  is going to be like without Ileana Ros-Lehtinen around here. She came  to Congress the year after I did, and we have been close friends ever  since.   The gentlewoman from Florida has been a dear friend and an  exceptional colleague, and there has been no fiercer champion of the  U.S.-Israel relationship than Ileana Ros-Lehtinen. So it is entirely  fitting that we amend this bill to name it in her honor, the Ileana  Ros-Lehtinen U.S.-Israel Security Assistance Authorization Act.   Let me also thank the chief Democratic sponsor of this legislation,  Mr.  [[Page H8148]]  Deutch, also of Florida, who has worked tirelessly to shape this  legislation and to reaffirm the unshakable bond between the United  States and Israel.   This bill, like the House version passed by the Foreign Affairs  Committee, fully authorizes the historic memorandum of understanding,  or MOU, between the United States and Israel, which President Obama  signed and which will go into effect next year.   This MOU provides for a 10-year agreement at $3.3 billion per year  and a $500 million missile defense pledge, the largest single pledge of  military assistance in our country's history. The MOU is a concrete  example of something I often say; while prime ministers may come and  go, Presidents come and go, members of Knesset come and go, and Members  of Congress come and go, the U.S.-Israel relationship is here to stay.   Our relationship with Israel benefits both our countries. For both of  us, it strengthens security and stability, and advances our shared  values. This is the bedrock of our friendship. This bill moves us  forward in new areas of cooperation.   For example, Mr. Kilmer of Washington wrote a provision that will  spur closer cooperation on space issues. Mr. Crist of Florida wrote a  section dealing with unmanned aerial vehicles that threaten the United  States or Israel. Mr. Schneider's work will help ensure Israel's  qualitative military edge. Mr. Boyle included a measure that will  increase Israel's access to precision-guided munitions.   I would like to point out a couple of issues, which I hope we can  address through additional legislation. This bill was originally  intended to include Mr. Langevin's legislation to enhance U.S.-Israel  cooperation on cybersecurity. This is an area where we should be  working together. So I was disappointed that it was struck from this,  and I hope that it soon crosses the finish line as a standalone bill.   Additionally, Mr. Boyle's bill to allow Israel to purchase precision- guided weapons was included in the Senate bill. The Armed Services  Committee majority objected. So this version waters down the  authorization for these purchases to a sense of Congress, which is  considerably weaker.   While I wish Armed Services Republicans would reconsider their  objection, I won't stand in the way of moving this critical bill  forward at this time. I am told that their concern is jurisdictional,  and I hope they will remain sensitive to this issue the next time a  defense authorization comes to the floor loaded down with provisions  that fall in the jurisdiction of the Foreign Affairs Committee.   Let me finish by saying that this bill is very timely. The threats  facing the United States and Israel are becoming more urgent and more  complex. ISIS is growing in the Sinai; Israel's neighbors are  shouldering new burdens from refugees, causing further instability; and  Iran's behavior in the region has, unfortunately become even more  dangerous. The United States has been there by Israel's side throughout  this dangerous time. And that is the way it should be.   Today, we put that into law. I urge my colleagues to support this  legislation, and I congratulate my good friend, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Deutch), the lead Democratic author on the House version  of the bill. He is also a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee  and the ranking member of the Middle East Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Florida an  additional 1 minute.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Frankel), a very valued member of the Foreign Affairs  Committee and a cosponsor of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield for such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Hastings).   (Mr. HASTINGS asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Let me again applaud the chief sponsors of this legislation,  Representatives Ros-Lehtinen and Deutch, along with their Senate  counterparts, for their tremendous work.   Let me also, again, as I have many times, thank our chairman. We have  worked very closely together on the Foreign Affairs Committee, and this  is proof of that kind of collaboration where we have both sides of the  aisle doing things that are good for the United States of America.   This legislation and the MOU that it puts into law represents the  unbreakable bond between the United States and Israel and the shared  interests and values that have been the hallmark of this relationship.   As Chairman Royce mentioned before, he and I have been there together  many times. We have seen those terror tunnels. We have seen all kinds  of things. The people of Israel need the United States, and we need the  people of Israel.   The United States has stood up for democracy through all these  glorious years of our being a republic, and we  [[Page H8150]]  cannot stop now. That is why legislation such as this bipartisan  legislation is so important for us to pass.   This, in law, represents the unbreakable bond between the United  States and Israel and the shared interests and values that have been  the hallmark of this relationship.   The Middle East is a very dangerous neighborhood. We here in the  United States have the benefit of stepping back a bit, but we are not  on the front line day in and day out the way the beleaguered people of  Israel are with one country after another vowing to try to destroy it.   This Congress, in a bipartisan fashion, stands together and says that  the United States stands with the people of Israel, and that makes me  very proud of this Congress, proud of our Foreign Affairs Committee,  proud of our chairman, and proud of all the people who have spoken,  particularly Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, who deserves all the accolades you  can think of. Whatever I said wouldn't be dramatic enough to explain  the force that she has been for the past 30 years on the Foreign  Affairs Committee doing good things, particularly with the State of  Israel.   It is going to be difficult to not see her here, but I know she will  be doing everything that she can continue to do to enhance the U.S.- Israel relationship.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this measure, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume,  and I rise in support of H.R. 1911.   Mr. Speaker, I am a proud original cosponsor of this bill, and I am  pleased that we are considering it today.   I want to start by thanking my colleagues for their hard work on this  bill and their hard work on this effort: Congressman Chris Smith, the  author of this legislation, and my fellow co-chairs of the Bipartisan  Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism. I am proud to stand with a group of  legislators committed to fighting intolerance and hatred.   Mr. Speaker, every day, more and more alarming anti-Semitic attacks  shock the world: Holocaust survivors violently assaulted, rallies and  parades glorifying Nazi leaders, swastikas graffitied to incite fear  and terror. The list goes on and on.   And let's be clear, Mr. Speaker, this isn't just happening in faraway  places. We have seen a sickening increase of anti-Semitic acts in our  country as well. We have seen people who embrace hatred and bigotry  given a loud new megaphone to spread their poison.   As a country, we need to come together to say enough is enough. We  need to say there are not good people on both sides. We need to  confront evil, call it by its name, and say there is no place for it  anywhere in the United States or around the world.   We all need to do it as citizens. We need to do so in our laws and in  our policies. And the very least that we could do is have the  administration fill the positions that are supposed to be dealing with  this issue. The Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism  position at the State Department is still vacant. That is really  unacceptable.   We must have a senior official to push back against the intolerance  and hatred of anti-Semitism. American leadership is desperately needed  in the fight against this ancient form of hatred. I am fed up with the  administration dragging its feet on filling this crucial position. It  should happen now.   That is why I am glad we are moving this bill forward. This  legislation would elevate the Special Envoy position and require the  President to put forward a nominee no more than 120 days after a  vacancy. That is 4 months.   This is essential for making sure that a prolonged vacancy like we  have right now never happens again.   We must have a senior State Department official dedicated to  coordinating U.S. Government efforts to combat anti-Semitism abroad. So  I strongly support this measure, and I ask my colleagues to join me  doing so.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Hastings).   (Mr. HASTINGS asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Deutch), one of the chairs of the Task Force to Combat  Anti-Semitism, and, again, a very esteemed member of the Foreign  Affairs Committee, and an original cosponsor of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, if there are no other speakers on the other  side, I am prepared to close.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   In closing, I want to, again, strongly support this bipartisan bill.  I want to thank all the people who have worked hard on it, particularly  Mr. Smith of New Jersey, who always, for years, has been battling the  scourge of anti-Semitism; our chairman, Chairman Royce, and people on  both sides of the Foreign Affairs Committee.   We can never become complacent when we see anti-Semitism, or anti- anything rear its ugly head. We need to reject it. We need to fight it.  We need to shine a light in all the dark corners so it has no place to  hide and fester.   What does it look like when it comes to foreign policy? It starts by  appointing a senior diplomat, someone we can point to with confidence  and say, ``You're leading America's effort to grapple with this problem  around the world.''   This bill would make sure that that seat can't stay vacant the way it  has been for the last 18 months. I am proud to be an original cosponsor  of this legislation. I, again, thank Mr. Smith, Chairman Royce, and all  the people who have worked so hard for this.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I too rise in support of this measure.   Let me, first of all, thank my friend from Florida, Mr. Hastings, for  his work on this resolution, and thank Chairman Royce for moving it  forward.   This is one of those issues that certainly stirs the emotions of  anyone who learns about it. The horrible abuse of dogs and cats crammed  into cages, driven across borders, slaughtered and sold in meat  markets, it just seems so cruel and needless.   The animal rights community has come together around this issue,  pleading for an end to these inhumane practices, particularly in the  markets in Asia where this takes place the most.   There are broader concerns as well. The trade of dog and cat meat is  associated with health risks, including the spread of disease. And an  illegal market for this meat has sprung up in places where governments  have failed to step in and enforce their own laws against these  practices.   So I think it is important that the House go on record saying we  oppose this practice. I am glad to support this measure, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the esteemed gentleman  from Florida (Mr. Hastings).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Nevada (Ms. Titus), a cosponsor of this bill, and a valuable member of  the Foreign Affairs Committee.    Mr. Speaker, let me say in closing, I am, again, grateful  to Mr. Hastings and to all the people who have helped elevate this  issue. Actually, I have gotten many calls from people who are very,  very concerned about this bill and who want to see it passed.   I have been a dog lover all my life, had the wonderful time to have  dogs, and to me, it is just unfathomable that they are suffering like  this in the trade to eat dogs and cats. It is really just something  that is awful.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support this measure. It is a bipartisan  bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6197, the Rescuing Animals  With Rewards Act of 2018.   I would like to begin by thanking Mr. Donovan and Mr. Castro for  introducing this important legislation, and I would also like to thank  Chairman Royce for his incredible efforts over many, many years to  promote the conservation of wildlife and wild places.   In recent years, Congress has taken a number of important steps to  combat wildlife trafficking, but the situation remains dire. Over the  last 10 years, one-third of African elephants have been slaughtered for  their tusks.   Let me say that again. Over the last 10 years, one-third of African  elephants have been slaughtered for their tusks. That is a shocking  statistic.   Rhino populations have also been decimated, and many other species  are at risk.   Protecting wildlife is the right thing to do. I know the Wildlife  Conservation Society does a really good job. My good friend John  Calvelli is leading the charge there, and so I am very aware of what we  need to do to protect our wildlife.   But not only is it the right thing to do, it also serves American  national security interests. Wildlife trafficking feeds corruption,  undermines the rule of law, threatens economic prosperity, and drives  instability, and it is carried out by many of the same international  criminal syndicates engaged in the trafficking of drugs, weapons, and  people.   This bipartisan, commonsense legislation before us today provides our  government with a tool it can use to tackle the illegal trade in  wildlife. Specifically, it authorizes rewards under the State  Department's Rewards for Justice program for information leading to the  arrest or conviction of those engaged in wildlife trafficking. This can  provide a powerful financial incentive for people to turn in those  responsible for this appalling activity.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of our colleagues to support this bipartisan  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Nevada (Ms. Titus), a cosponsor of this bill and, as I said before, a  very valued House Foreign Affairs Committee member.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, let me say in closing, I want to again thank Mr. Donovan  and Mr. Castro for authoring this bill and Chairman Royce for his  extraordinary leadership in efforts to combat wildlife trafficking.   It is shocking to me that in the year 2018 people still want to kill  majestic animals like elephants and rhinos for their body parts. It is  just disgusting.   We need to continue our support of a multipronged effort to address  the poaching crisis, going after the international criminal networks  that drive this illicit trade, working with other governments to  establish and enforce tough laws against wildlife trafficking,  partnering with local communities in the countries where animals live  to make sure they have a stake in protecting wildlife, and educating  consumers about the consequences of their decisions to purchase illegal  wildlife products, because we really need to hit them in their  pocketbooks. If people are purchasing these things, the illicit  trafficking is going to continue.                                time  1830    The bipartisan legislation before us today will provide one  additional tool in the fight against wildlife trafficking, and I urge  my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to join me in supporting it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.  [[Page H8157]]
