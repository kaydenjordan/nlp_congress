 Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I plan to withdraw my amendment, but before  I do, Madam Chair, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Calvert) to engage in a brief colloquy.    Madam Chair, I appreciate the strong support from a  number of my colleagues in regards to an issue that is vitally  important to California's 25th Congressional District.   Citizens of Santa Clarita, California, have fought for over two  decades against a sand and gravel mine in their city, which is known  for its ideal filming and tourism location just outside the city. Santa  Clarita is known as Hollywood North. It is the third most populous city  in Los Angeles County and proudly preserves 9,000 acres of open space  for its residents and filming.   A sand and gravel mine at this particular location would have extreme  negative impacts on local community life and its economy. The already  congested highways in the area would see additional transport trucks 24  hours a day, and local industries would see downturns from dust and air  pollution.   I thank Chairman Calvert for his support and look forward to working  toward a permanent solution to this long overdue local issue.    I appreciate that very much.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time, and I withdraw my  amendment.
