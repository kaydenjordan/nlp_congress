 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding, and I rise  to congratulate Karen Haas, who after five terms as Clerk of the House,  is retiring.   I would like to remind all Members in this body that fewer than  11,000 people have ever had the privilege to serve in this House. It is  even fewer for a Clerk.   Karen was our 34th Clerk and only the second woman to hold that  position. We thank you for that leadership. When we think about the  role of the House Clerk, you think of roll calls and recorded votes.  But the Office of the Clerk is really about continuity. Without the  Clerk, Congress could not fulfill its obligation to the American people  and move in a smooth manner, which many people don't see the challenge.   Few individuals are more committed to preserving the continuity than  Karen. She has done that as Clerk and as a trusted staff member and  floor assistant. Always, she has been a friend and counselor to  Members, regardless of what side of the aisle you sat on.   Karen Haas also equipped and modernized this House for the 21st  century. Oftentimes, you won't see that because it is behind the  scenes, but it makes the legislative process more accessible to the  people it serves.   Mr. Speaker, we are grateful to Karen for her dedication, her team's  professionalism, and her steady hand on the tiller. Her service reminds  us of an important fact: The people's House is only as good as its  people.   You rose to the occasion. On behalf of a very grateful House, and a  grateful Nation, we say thank you, Karen.   And to Cheryl, we wish you the best.
