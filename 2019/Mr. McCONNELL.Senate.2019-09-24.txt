 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    First, this morning, I join the Kentucky families and  first responders in Meade County in mourning the loss of volunteer  sheriff's deputy Chris Hulsey, who was killed in the line of duty over  the weekend. According to reports, on Saturday evening, Deputy Hulsey  was attacked while investigating a suspect and pronounced dead at the  hospital hours later.   Deputy Hulsey proudly answered the call of public service with a  decades-long career that also included time as a firefighter and a  paramedic. His service left his community safer, and his sacrifice left  it in grief. I stand with them in mourning his loss and honoring his  service. The community will hold a candlelight vigil tonight to honor  this Kentucky hero. The prayers of the Senate will be with them.                            ____________________     Madam President, on an entirely different matter, the  Senate continues making headway in the personnel business.   It is still too bad that our Democratic colleagues continue to insist  on cloture votes, floor time, and rollcall votes for the kinds of  uncontroversial nominees who have ordinarily traveled by voice vote for  past administrations of both parties. Yet the Senate hasn't been  deterred by this novel campaign of systematic obstruction from our  Democratic friends. We will keep right on getting these talented public  servants on the job, where they belong.   Later today, we will confirm a Deputy Under Secretary of the  Treasury. Then we will confirm an ambassador, a solicitor of a Cabinet  department, and a deputy commissioner of Social Security. They aren't  the only nominees we will confirm this week. Before our work is  finished, we will also have confirmed our next Vice Chairman of the  Joint Chiefs and, pending the committee action of our colleagues, our  [[Page S5636]]  next Secretary of Labor--another group of talented professionals put to  work for the American people and more of the President's team in place.                            ____________________     Madam President, this week, we will also address our  responsibility to keep the Federal Government funded.   The Republicans regret that our Democratic colleagues have chosen to  back away from the agreement we all reached just last month to ensure a  smooth, bipartisan funding process. We regret that the Democrats chose  to block funding for the national defense, including a pay raise for  our men and women in uniform, in order to pick a partisan fight with  the White House.   Yet, for the sake of the country, our near-term priority is that of  passing a continuing resolution so the government can stay open while  work continues. I am glad the continuing resolution on the table earned  significant bipartisan support across the Capitol and has also earned  the green light from the White House. The Senate will vote on it this  week. As Chairman Shelby and Senator Leahy continue their work on  regular order appropriations, I hope the cooperation that has  surrounded this CR can carry over and that we can get the  appropriations process back on track.                            ____________________     Madam President, on yet another matter, the  productive, bipartisan work that needs to happen in the Senate will  stand in stark contrast to the choices made by the House Democrats  across the Capitol.   Over there, it seems as though a far-left socialist ideology is  increasingly becoming mainstream Democratic Party doctrine, and rather  than roll up their sleeves and work with the Republicans and with the  White House on proposals that could actually become law, the House  continues to promote one dangerous leftwing policy after another.   The Senate has already voted on the Green New Deal, the Democrats'  socialist wish list that seeks to outlaw affordable energy and  transportation, eliminate the jobs many Americans rely on, and even  empower government bureaucrats to redesign families' homes. Needless to  say, it didn't do too well. Here in the real world, out of the college  campus atmosphere that seems to characterize the House Democrats, the  Senate voted it down. I have already discussed the recent House-passed  bill that would have cut down on our domestic energy and American  energy independence.   We also all know about Medicare for None, which is the plan the  Democrats' Presidential candidates are rushing to embrace, that would  literally outlaw the existing health insurance 180 million Americans  currently get on the job and throw everyone into an untested, one-size- fits-all government plan.   Just last week, Speaker Pelosi expanded on the Democrats' Medicare  for None philosophy by introducing a bill to micromanage Americans'  medicine and start trying to have Washington, DC, run the prescription  drug industry because, if there is anything that has been proven to  increase competition and affordability for American families, it is  huge, new doses of heavyhanded Washington, DC, interference.   No, we will not let the Democrats take us down the path that embraces  the socialist concept of starting to nationalize an industry with  people devoted to finding cures and saving lives. The life sciences  sector is driving the search for cures to Alzheimer's, Parkinson's,  multiple sclerosis, and countless other diseases that impact millions  of Americans.   The Speaker and her caucus may be content to spend their majority  passing leftwing messaging bills, but in this Senate, we take the  American people's priorities more seriously, and we will stick to  getting their business done.                            ____________________     Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, reserving the right to object, all of  us share the concern for protecting whistleblowers who use appropriate,  established channels to raise legitimate concerns. The Senate's  obligation is to treat such allegations in a responsible and deliberate  manner, to avoid racing to judgment based on media leaks, and to not  fuel media speculation with reckless accusations.   There is much we do not know about the complaint lodged with the  intelligence community's inspector general, including whether the  complaint involves intelligence activities at all.   Before the Democratic leader elected to go to the media yesterday,  the chairman and vice chair of the Senate Select Committee on  Intelligence had already been working together in a bipartisan manner-- free from politicization--to get more information from both the Acting  Director of National Intelligence and the intelligence community's  inspector general. Given the progress the committee was making, I don't  believe this made-for-TV moment was actually necessary. I would have  preferred the committee be allowed to do its work in a quiet and  methodical manner. It doesn't serve the committee or its goals to  litigate its business here on the floor or for the television cameras.   Nevertheless, I agree that the DNI should make additional information  available to the committee so it can evaluate the complaint consistent  with the statute and other procedures that exist to safeguard  classified and sensitive information.   I also want to express my appreciation for President Trump's  announcement that the White House will release tomorrow the ``complete,  fully-declassified, and unredacted transcript of [his] phone  conversation with President Zelensky.'' I hope this will help to  refocus the conversation away from reckless speculation and back toward  the facts.   So, stipulating that our objective here is simply to conduct the kind  of bipartisan oversight of intelligence matters that the committee has  successfully conducted in the past, I have no objection to the  Senator's request.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the remaining  votes in the series be 10 minutes in length.    Madam President, I move to proceed to executive  session to consider Calendar No. 415.    Madam President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Senate proceed to legislative session and be in a period of morning  business, with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes  each.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that at 10:30  a.m. on Wednesday, September 25, S.J.

Further, I ask that the time until 12:15 p.m.  be equally divided between the leaders or their designees on the joint  resolution and that following the use or yielding back of that time,  the joint resolution be read a third time and the Senate vote on the  resolution. Finally, I ask unanimous consent that following the  disposition of the joint resolution, the Senate proceed to the  consideration of resolutions to instruct conferees to be submitted  pursuant to the order of September 18, 2019; that they be made pending  and reported by number with concurrent consideration until 3:45 p.m.,  equally divided between the leaders or their designees; and that at  3:45 p.m., the Senate vote on the resolutions in the order listed, with  2 minutes of debate equally divided prior to the votes.

I ask unanimous consent that the Hassan substitute  amendment at the desk be considered and agreed to; that the bill, as  amended, be considered read a third time and passed; and that the  motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Judiciary Committee be discharged from further consideration of S. Res.  313 and the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and that the  motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Senate now proceed to the en bloc consideration of the following Senate  resolutions, which were submitted earlier today: S. Res. 326, S. Res.  327, S. Res 328, and S. Res. 329.   There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the  resolutions en bloc.    Madam President, I know of no further debate on the  resolutions.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  preambles be agreed to and the motions to reconsider be considered made  and laid upon the table, all en bloc.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m.  Wednesday, September 25; further, that following the prayer and pledge,  the morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be  approved to date, and the time for the two leaders be reserved for  their use later in the day; further, that following leader remarks, the  Senate be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to  speak therein for up 10 minutes each until 10:30 a.m.    Madam President, if there is no further business to  come before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order following the remarks of our Democratic  colleagues.
