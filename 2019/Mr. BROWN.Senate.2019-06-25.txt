 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter  from the chairman and the vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee  regarding the referral of S. 1879 be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                        U.S. Senate,                                Select Committee on Intelligence,                                      Washington, DC, June 25, 2019.      Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.        Dear Senator McConnell: Pursuant to section 3(b) of S. Res.       400 of the 94th Congress, as amended by S. Res. 445 of the       108th Congress, we request that S. 1879, the Protect our       Universities Act of 2019, be sequentially referred to the       Senate Select Committee on Intelligence for a period not to       exceed ten days.            Sincerely,      Richard Burr,        Chairman.      Mark R. Warner,        Vice Chairman.                            ____________________     Madam President, this month, we surpassed the record for  the longest period in American history without an increase in the  minimum wage. It has been nearly a decade since minimum wage workers  last got a raise--literally a decade. Because of inflation, the salary  of a minimum wage worker today is worth $3,000 less than it was in  2009. Think about that. It is not like minimum wage workers are making  a lot of money. A minimum wage worker's salary today is equivalent to  $3,000 less than it was a decade ago because of inflation.   President Trump and Republicans in Congress don't have a plan and  don't even propose to have a plan. In fact, they block any plans the  rest of us have. They don't have a plan to give millions of workers a  raise. Why? Because the corporate lobbyists going in and out of the  office of the Senate majority leader don't want them to.   We know it is not just minimum wage workers who are losing out on  money in their pockets because the President and the Members of this  body always stand on the side of corporate interests, always put their  thumb on the scale supporting corporations over workers. Look at the  priorities Democrats fight for every day in this body, and then look at  what this administration does. It is pretty clear who is on the side of  American workers.   Democrats have plans to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour.  President Trump is against it. He wants to do nothing to raise wages.   Democrats have a plan to strengthen collective bargaining rights to  give workers more power in the workplace--the PRO Act. President Trump  nominates judge after judge who puts their thumb on the scale for Wall  Street over consumers and workers.   Democrats have a plan to put more money back in the pockets of 114  million American workers--the Working Families Tax Relief Act. It means  if you are making $25,000 or $30,000 and if you have children or if you  don't have children, through the earned-income tax credit, you get more  money in your pocket. Again, President Trump and the special interest  Republicans in this town show their hostility to workers by opposing  it.   President Trump, though, did sign a tax cut for corporations that led  to record stock buybacks. The tax cut that President Trump pushed  through this Senate, with the majority leader doing his groundwork for  him--the bill he pushed, the tax cut he pushed through the Senate, over  time, more than 75 percent of that tax cut will go to the richest 1  percent of the people. Think about that. There was $1\1/2\ trillion in  tax cuts. Who benefits? Seventy-five percent of the benefits go to the  richest 1 percent of the people in this country.   Democrats also have a plan to give American workers more control over  their lives and their schedules--the Schedules that Work Act, which we  will be introducing soon.   We have a plan to protect workers from companies that steal their  hard-earned money by refusing to pay them for the hours they have  worked--the Wage Theft Protection Act. Think about how that works. You  work at a salary. Say you are making $35,000 a year. You are a night  manager at a fast-food restaurant. The company decides to list you as a  manager, so you are making a $35,000-a-year salary. The company can  work you 42, 45, 50 hours a week and pay you not a cent for the hours  above 40 because you earn that salary and because the company declared  you manager. I call it wage theft.   We used to have laws in this country that we enacted many years ago,  updated with President Ford, President Nixon, and then President Obama,  but President Trump has said no and scaled that back. His  administration rolled back rule after rule that protects workers from  companies that cheat them out of the wages they have earned.   Again, whose side are you on when you have a President who is hostile  to workers and who betrays workers while talking a good game but is  clearly on the side of corporate interests every single time?   Democrats are united in demanding that any new North America Free  Trade Agreement--any new NAFTA have strong labor standards so we don't  end up with another race to the bottom on workers' rights and benefits.  So far, President Trump hasn't produced a deal that protects workers  from corporations that want to move to Mexico so they can pay the  workers less. In fact, the Trump tax cut bill that Senator McConnell-- down the hall--fought for and rammed through this Senate by only a  couple of votes gave corporations a 21-percent tax rate.   You shut down the Lordstown GM plant in Youngstown, OH. You are  paying a 21-percent tax rate. When you move to Mexico, you pay half  that tax rate. You pay 10.5 percent. That is  [[Page S4523]]  what has happened as the President has failed to renegotiate NAFTA to  help workers.    Let me give you an example. Let me give a real quick story. After  NAFTA passed, 5 months later, I went to the Mexican border with a  friend. I went across the border and visited a Mexican auto plant. That  auto plant looked just like an auto plant in Cleveland or just like an  auto plant in Cincinnati and just like the Jeep plant in Toledo.   There was one difference. The workers were working hard. The floors  were clean. The technology was up-to-date. There was one difference  between the auto plant in Mexico and the auto plant in Toledo. The  difference was the Mexican auto plant didn't have a parking lot because  the workers who work there can't afford to buy the cars they make.   Yet President Trump's renegotiation of NAFTA left those workers'  wages out so the workers will continue to be far, far underpaid in  Mexico, will have weaker environmental laws--especially with the Trump  tax plan--encouraging more American companies to move to Mexico.   On another issue so important to so many in this country, especially  elderly people, Democrats have a plan to lower the price of  prescription drugs. One news outlet said it combines just about every  policy idea that drug lobbyists hate. Yet President Trump and Members  of this Senate, all with good healthcare paid for by taxpayers--don't  ever forget that. All of us who represent people in this country have  good healthcare paid for by taxpayers. They are all trying to take away  the protections for Americans with preexisting conditions.   Let me go back to the overtime issue for a minute. Three years ago, I  stood in Columbus to announce the Obama administration was going to  raise the salary threshold to earn overtime pay and make millions of  more workers eligible. That would have meant 4 million Americans and  130,000 Ohioans were going to get a raise. As I explained earlier, when  you make $35,000 or $40,000 and are paid a salary, they call you  management. So when you work more than 40 hours, you don't get paid a  nickel for any time you work over 40 hours. So what President Obama's  rule did was give a raise to 130,000 Ohioans, 4 million workers, but  workers didn't get that raise because attorneys general--far-right and  extremely conservative attorneys general--around the country first sued  to stop it, and then when President Trump won the election, he came up  with a new rule that leaves most of those workers behind.   We are talking about people making $38,000 or $40,000 a year--middle  managers at banks, restaurants, and grocery stores. They are often  required to work 60 to 70 hours a week without getting a cent of  overtime. It is an American value and what we stand for as a nation. It  is how we should govern, through the eyes of workers, through the  dignity of work. If people work 50 or 60 hours--obviously, Senators and  bank presidents and CEO's and doctors and lawyers shouldn't get paid  overtime, but people making $35,000 or $40,000, if you work more than  40 hours a week, you should get overtime. That is what we used to do in  this country, but we don't do it all the time now because of President  Trump's opposition.   Democrats have a bill to fix this, the Restoring Overtime Pay Act,  that would allow 4.6 million Americans to be newly eligible for  overtime pay.   The President clearly doesn't understand how somebody living on  $35,000 or $40,000 a year--what that person's challenges are. The  President thinks it is fine to leave those workers behind. So much for  fighting for American workers. That was his campaign promise. He would  put them back to work. He would have good manufacturing wages for them.  He would pay them. He would make sure they made good wages. It is all  part of Donald Trump's phony populism. He divides to distract from the  fact that his administration looks like a Wall Street retreat.   True populism is never racist; it is never anti-Semitic. True  populists don't pass tax cuts for rich people and leave out workers  with children. Populists don't choose Wall Street over consumers.  Populists don't choose corporations over workers. Populists don't  choose health insurance companies over sick people.   It all comes down to whose side you are on. Are you going to fight  for the dignity of work or are you going to fight for the privilege of  the wealthy?   The President promised to fight for American workers. He breaks that  promise every day. He has broken that promise for more than 2 years. If  you love this country, you fight for the people who make it work. I  wish President Trump would remember that.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
