 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr.  Hill) for yielding.   Energy prices are up over 35 percent. Groceries have surged more than  11.9 percent. The consumer price index is up 9.1 percent. The producer  price index is up close to 12 percent.   None of this was happening before the American Rescue Plan was passed  by Congressional Democrats and signed into law by Joe Biden. Before  that time period, our inflation rate was holding steady between 2 and 3  percent.   What happened? What happened was the Congressional Democrats and the  President of the United States, Joe Biden, unleashed a labor shortage  on the United States. People did not have to go to work in order to  continue to buy goods. So what happens when you take people out of the  workforce is that they have money to spend, but there is not enough  supply in the economy because enough people are not working to provide  the products for enough goods. So if there are not enough goods, but  everybody has money, prices go up. It happens every single time.   This is very simple. Even Lawrence Summers, who was an economic  adviser to Bill Clinton, said that the American Rescue Plan was going  to unleash a massive inflation in the United States. House Republicans  said if you pass that bill, it is going to unleash a massive inflation  the United States.   So the American people need to know and understand that it is the  policies of Congressional Democrats and Joe Biden that have unleashed  the worst inflation most Americans have ever seen in their lives.
