 Mr. Speaker, this past Tuesday was  Vietnam Veterans Day. The day was a reminder that our freedom is not  free.  [[Page H4022]]    We stand together to thank and honor Vietnam veterans and their  families for their service and their sacrifice. Across the country, we  paused and remembered the service and sacrifices made.   Tuesday, in Indiana County, in the Pennsylvania 15th Congressional  District, the Historical and Genealogical Society hosted their second  annual program featuring guest speakers, music from the era, and an  historical display relating to the Vietnam Memorial in Washington,  D.C., called ``The Wall that Heals.''   Vietnam Veterans Day and the programs are dedicated to honor the  veterans who served Active Duty in the United States Armed Forces from  November 1, 1955, to May 15, 1975, the time period in which the U.S.  had soldiers deployed.   In addition to a pinning ceremony for Vietnam veterans in attendance,  wreaths will be placed remembering Indiana County residents who were  killed in the line of duty or named as missing in action during the  war.   Mr. Speaker, events like the program in Indiana County are a great  way for our younger generation to learn and our older generations to be  remembered. It is important we always find time to thank and honor our  veterans for their service to our great Nation.   To my friends who are Vietnam veterans, welcome home.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Mann  for yielding and for hosting this Special Order tonight on an industry  that I believe is the most important industry in America. It is  the industry that impacts and touches the lives of American families  more times in a given day than any other. It is not just the food. It  is the fiber; it is the building materials; it is the energy resources;  it is the economy.    I am honored to be here. I am proud to be the Republican leader of  the House Agriculture Committee, where we celebrate the contributions  of American farmers, ranchers, producers, and foresters all year long.   Farm country is no stranger to struggle, and the past couple of years  have been a punch to the gut. Between a global pandemic, historic fires  and floods, wind events, and a President who is waging a never-ending  war on agriculture, times have been particularly tough.   The supply chain crisis paired with skyrocketing inflation is kicking  our farm families while they are down--folks who buy retail, sell  wholesale, and pay shipping each way; the men and women who work around  the clock to provide us with a safe and reliable food supply.   But rural America is tough; rural America is resilient; and rural  America is the backbone of this Nation.   I am grateful to Congressman Mann for being on our farm team, as well  as all the other agriculture advocates who will be speaking this  evening.   Before I go, I specifically recognize Pennsylvania's contribution to  agriculture, which is the Commonwealth's  [[Page H4065]]  number one industry. One out of every seven jobs is directly or  indirectly related to agriculture: 59,000 farms; 280,500 direct jobs;  and more than $135 billion in revenue, or about 18 percent of  Pennsylvania's economy. Agriculture's impact in the Keystone State is  undeniable.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the families, the men and women who work 24/7,  365 days a year to feed, to clothe, and to fuel this great Nation. Once  again, thanks to Congressman Mann for leading this important Special  Order.
