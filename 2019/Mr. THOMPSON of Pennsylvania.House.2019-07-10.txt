 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  July as Park and Recreation Month. It is a fitting time to celebrate  our Federal, State, and local parks and recreation systems because so  many Americans will visit them this summer.   As a lifelong resident of rural Pennsylvania, an avid outdoorsman,  and spending time in my career as a recreational therapist, I strongly  support our Nation's parks and recreation facilities.   Our parks provide countless recreational and educational  opportunities for individuals and families to enjoy the outdoors. This  month recognizes the important role these parks and public facilities  play in the lives of Americans and the contributions of employees who  work every day to maintain public parks across the Nation.   Our parks create opportunities for people to come together and  experience a sense of community. They contribute to local economies by  attracting businesses and jobs and increasing housing values.   In the United States, public park operations and capital spending  generate nearly $140 million in economic activity annually, and our  National Park System receives an estimated 331 million recreation  visits every year.   Ninety percent of people in the United States agree that public park  recreation facilities and activities are important government services.  This support spans across all people in the country regardless of race,  income, or political affiliation. Nearly 75 percent of Americans agree  it is important to ensure all members of their community have equitable  access to public parks and recreation facilities.   The most economically sound areas are those with ample public park  and recreation facilities and activities. A key factor in business  expansion and location decisions is quality of life for employees, with  a premium placed on adequate and accessible public parks and open  space.   Mr. Speaker, public parks and recreational facilities foster a  variety of activities that contribute to a healthier society. Americans  living within a 10-minute walk of a park have higher levels of physical  activity and lower rates of obesity. People who use public parks and  open spaces are three times more likely to achieve the recommended  levels of physical activity than nonusers.   Recreational programs at public parks provide children with a safe  place to play, access to healthy foods, opportunities to be physically  active, and enrichment facilities that help prevent at-risk behavior  such as drug use and gang involvement.   As we head further into summer, many Americans will visit public  parks and recreation facilities to spend time outdoors with family,  friends, and neighbors. We are blessed with beautiful outdoor  facilities, and it is my hope that all Americans get out and enjoy the  parks in their areas.                           Minimum Wage Kills Jobs     Mr. Speaker, this morning, I rise to  address a bill that my friends across the aisle, the Democrats, are  going to bring to the floor next week raising the minimum wage to $15  an hour.   There was a score this week by the Congressional Budget Office that  sheds truth and light on that proposal and what it does, and this  government source has indicated it kills jobs. It harms Americans who  are today struggling to make ends meet. The average family income will  be reduced as a result of this bill.   Mr. Speaker, it is estimated by the CBO, the Congressional Budget  Office, that 3.7 million jobs will be lost and that 42 percent of  families who are currently at the minimum wage will see a net reduction  in their family income, taking many of them, maybe for the first time,  down into a poverty level of income.   There is a better way, Mr. Speaker. In the past, this body passed the  Career and Technical Education Reauthorization bill, the Perkins Act. I  was proud to work with Mr. Krishnamoorthi from Illinois on that bill as  we led it. President Trump signed that into law last July.  [[Page H5308]]    We are seeing this bill restore rungs on the ladder of opportunity. A  significant number of jobs--6 million jobs--are open and available  today at family-sustaining wages.   There is a pathway out of minimum wage. Minimum wage should be a  starting point. To me, it is not where you start in life, but it is  where you end up. We have provided the tools to provide individuals  better access to the type of skills-based education to improve their  lot in life and to achieve higher wages and greater opportunity, which  is what this country promises.   We work hard; we take risk; and we better ourselves                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today to applaud  the incredible talent of the United States Women's National Soccer  Team, which secured their fourth World Cup title this Sunday, July 7.   The commitment, athleticism, and drive of these women brought our  Nation together to cheer them on as they truly dominated match after  match.   The team scored 26 goals in their seven matches and allowed only  three goals during the entire tournament, making them the highest  scoring team in tournament history.   I would like to personally recognize the efforts of goalkeeper Alyssa  Naeher and defender Ali Krieger, both alumnae of Pennsylvania State  University.   Naeher denied England a critical penalty shot in the semifinals,  sending the United States to the championship round where the team  outran, outshot, and outplayed the Netherlands Women's National Team to  win 2-0.   Krieger said, ``We were ready for the moment.''   She, along with their 21 other teammates, delivered and brought home  a hard-fought and well-deserved victory for the United States,  rightfully earning the title of champions.                            ____________________
