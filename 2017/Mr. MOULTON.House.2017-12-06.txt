 Mr. Speaker, 26: that is how many people were gunned  down in a Texas church. Fifty-nine: that is how many were murdered at a  concert in Las Vegas. And 489: that is how many law-abiding Americans  were injured in that same attack.   Mr. Speaker, it has been weeks after those shootings, and we haven't  taken a single action in the United States Congress to stop the gun  violence epidemic plaguing America.   Instead, Republican leadership is pushing a bill with blood money  from the NRA that will create a race to the bottom where States with  the weakest concealed carry requirements will rewrite the laws for  everyone else.   Meanwhile, we all know there are bipartisan bills that will reduce  gun deaths, including my bill to ban bump stocks. Those bills have been  denied a vote.   Mr. Speaker, we have lived through too many massacres. At this rate,  I guarantee we will live through more. Let's stop this nonsense and  work together on commonsense solutions the majority of Americans want.
