 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Honoring our  PACT Act. I thank Chairman Takano for yielding and for his incredible  leadership on this bill.   We ask young men and women to serve our country in uniform. We should  not also be asking them to be exposing their bodies to toxins and to  live with the consequences of those toxins for the rest of their lives.   Whether it is Agent Orange in Vietnam or burn pits or other toxic  exposures in Iraq and Afghanistan, this has been part of our military's  history. This bill helps us correct the historic injustices for  veterans and communities like the ones in Camp Lejeune, North Carolina.   I am proud today that we will pass the most comprehensive legislation  in decades to address the severe health problems that so many of our  veterans are facing and to make it easier for them to get the relief  and the care they need.   Mr. Speaker, thousands of my constituents will benefit from what we  are doing here today, and it is my great honor to support this bill.
