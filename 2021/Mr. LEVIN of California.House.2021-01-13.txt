 Madam Speaker, what each of us chooses to do  today, whether we vote to hold this President to account or look the  other way, we will be remembered by history, by our children and their  children.   The facts are clear, the evidence of Trump's insurrection  overwhelming. History calls on us to do what is right rather than just  politically expedient. Let us look back on this day with honor, not  disgrace, knowing we were up to the oath we all took.
