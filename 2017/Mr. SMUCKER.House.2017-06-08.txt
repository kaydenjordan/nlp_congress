 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I start by thanking Chairman Hensarling  and the committee and the staff for all the hard work that they have  done on this very important bill.   Mr. Chairman, protecting the personal information of Americans is  critical to maintaining financial stability. Many of our families,  friends, neighbors, and constituents have suffered from the threat of  their personal information. While private industry works hard to  implement strong protections for our online information, I believe that  Congress has the responsibility to stay informed on the threats facing  constituents in order to help protect those we represent from identity  theft and IRS fraud.   As you are aware, over the past few years, consumer reporting  agencies have experienced numerous breaches of information. High- profile data breaches occurred in 2017, 2015, 2013, and 2011, among  others.   A recent cyber attack on a CRA subsidiary allowed thieves to access  taxpayer W-2s, giving them the ability to file fraudulent tax returns.  Another attack exposed the Social Security numbers of an estimated 200  million Americans.   Protecting consumers and the constituents I serve in Pennsylvania's  16th District is my duty in Congress, and this includes cyber activity.   In 2015, the IRS paid out $5.8 billion in fraudulent refunds to  identity thieves. While it is important to clarify that that is not  attributable fully to the hacks that I have already referenced, we  should work to improve consumer protections and help stop the wasteful  abuse of taxpayer dollars.   Our constituents rely on consumer reporting agencies to monitor their  credit for theft or nefarious activities. My amendment simply  encourages these agencies collecting our highly sensitive financial  information to do everything they deem feasible to adequately protect  our constituents from identity fraud that can wreak havoc on their  financial stability and personal matters.   CRAs collect large amounts of personal, confidential data. The facts  show these companies are under constant attack by cyber thieves.  Therefore, this language merely encourages them to use the strongest  protection for consumer data.   H.R. 10 takes critical steps to improving our consumer protections  while improving our economic and regulatory environment. My amendment  is about signaling our shared desire to protect our constituents and  their data.   Again, I would like to thank Chairman Hensarling for his work on this  bill and for his support of this amendment, and I urge my colleagues to  support this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Missouri (Mr. Luetkemeyer).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Hensarling).    Mr. Chair, I thank both chairmen.   This does not, obviously, replace any work that they are doing. This  is a very, very important issue. This is a sense of Congress simply  saying that we are very concerned about the security of the data of our  constituents, and we are asking that to be looked at. But certainly  there is a lot of work to be done, and I look forward to working with  both the chairmen on this issue.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the topic of this Special Order.    Madam Speaker, tonight I am honored to lead a bipartisan  Special Order on career and technical education. We have several  Members joining us here this evening to highlight CTE programs in their  districts and the upcoming reauthorization of the Carl D. Perkins  Career and Technical Education Act.   I would like to start the order by yielding to my colleague and  colead, Congressman Krishnamoorthi, who has been working hard with my  Pennsylvania colleague, Congressman Thompson, on H.R. 2353, the  Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act.    Madam Speaker, I would like to thank Congressman  Krishnamoorthi for his leadership on this issue. The Congressman is a  fellow member of the freshman class. I really appreciate the  opportunity to work with him, particularly on this very important  topic.   Madam Speaker, I yield to Congressman Thompson, the sponsor of H.R.  2353, who, for many years, has been leading the charge here in the  House to strengthen career technical education.    Madam Speaker, I would like to again thank the  Congressman for his leadership on this very important issue. I very  much enjoyed, in the 5 months I have been here, working with  Congressman Thompson, a fellow member of the Pennsylvania delegation,  but I have seen his passion for this issue. So, again, I look forward  to continuing to work with you on this and really appreciate your  leadership.                                time  1715    You mentioned the critical need of businesses to fill spots that are  available today. We see the unemployment rate today. We know this is a  problem today and will continue to be a problem.   My background is in construction. We owned a construction firm. We  had about 150 employees. Our biggest problem always was finding  qualified people to fill the spots that are available. At the same  time, I saw the opportunities that were available to people who decided  to take up a career in construction. It is not, as many people think,  neither construction nor manufacturing nor many jobs that require  technical trade skills today. Construction uses technology, and it is  not a dirty job that people once thought it was. The manufacturing is  the same way. At the same time, there are great-paying jobs, family- sustaining jobs available in these fields.   I think we need to do a better job of enlightening, essentially, the  opportunities and talking about the opportunities that are available  through career and technical education.   To your point again, Congressman, there is no better way to help  people out of poverty than to connect them with a good-paying job and  the self-worth that is achieved from finding a job. We know those jobs  are available today. What career and technical education does is  prepare people for great-paying jobs that are available.   Again, thank you so much for your leadership on this.   Now I would like to yield to another freshman colleague of mine on  the Education and Workforce Committee, Mr. Mitchell, who has an  extensive background in higher education and brings that expertise to  the committee.    I thank Representative Mitchell for his comments. Again,  I appreciate not only his passion for this issue, but the wealth of  experience in this field that he brings to the table, and I look  forward as well to continuing to work with him on this issue.   I now would like to yield to, once again, another freshman Member of  the class who I very much enjoy working with, Mr. Ferguson.    I thank Mr. Ferguson for his comments. As he mentioned,  this is about family-sustaining jobs. Mr. Ferguson has a lot of  experience bringing jobs to his town of West Point in Georgia, where he  was mayor, creating thousands of new jobs there through innovative  policies. I look forward to continuing to work with him on this as  well.   Now I yield to another colleague on the Education and Workforce  Committee who has been a leading voice as well on CTE, Mr. Wilson.    I thank Mr. Wilson for his comments.   I am happy to say that I am one of those who supports the economy in  South Carolina by buying those Bridgestone and Firestone tires for my  vehicles.   Mr. Wilson has been a strong advocate, obviously, for the people of  his  [[Page H4808]]  district, the people of his State, and has been a leader in regards to  CTE. I look forward to working with him on this bill as well.   I think I will have one more speaker, who is on the way. As I wait  for him, Mr. Wilson talked about some of the schools in his area that  have been doing a great job in connecting people, training people,  educating people for the kind of jobs that are available in our  workforces.   Pennsylvania's 16th Congressional District is home to Thaddeus  Stevens College of Technology, and it is an incredible story and  similar to stories of many of the other institutions that are providing  career and technical education.   There was a job fair recently at Thaddeus Stevens College, and for  just a few hundred graduates, there were about 450 companies  essentially competing for those individuals, competing to fill spots  they had. So it goes without saying that the placement rate at many of  these schools--I know certainly at Thaddeus Stevens College--is almost  100 percent placement rate. They have a problem, in fact, sometimes  keeping people until graduation because students are offered jobs even  before they graduate, and they are hired away.                                time  1730    Some of the students coming out of Thaddeus Stevens College are  earning, on average, $45,000 annually. We have the Marcellus shale  drilling in our area, welders, some of them are earning up to six  figures, $100,000 or more in the first or second year of employment.  So, again, the kind of jobs that we are talking about here are great- paying, family-sustaining jobs.   My district is also home to Reading Area Community College and the  Pennsylvania College of Health Sciences, both of which offer CTE  programs. We have spoken with, as a part of leading up to this bill  being introduced, their faculty, students, and staff about how some of  these programs can be improved.   Harrisburg Area Community College has a campus in my district in  Lancaster. They do something that I think we will be seeing more of and  should be seeing more of: they run an innovative apprenticeship  program. They brought together private businesses that work with the  school to help prepare skilled workers to fill available jobs. It is a  very innovative program. The program has been very, very successful.   Future initiatives there include expanding the program into our local  high schools to ensure that graduates are college or career ready. It  is an opportunity that I think we have across the country.   If you look at some other models, some of the European countries--for  instance, I just had a long, extensive conversation with the Swiss  Ambassador about the apprenticeship program in Switzerland.   Here, we often think of apprenticeship in what we may refer to as  blue-collar workers, construction and manufacturing. In Switzerland, I  was told that they have apprenticeship programs in up to 230 careers.  So it is bankers and insurers. Many, many different companies are  taking advantage of the apprenticeship program there.   It gets to the student debt problem that we hear so much about. Here,  students are earning a degree. In an apprenticeship program, students  are earning a degree while earning dollars, so it sort of does away  with that, if you think about it. You are earning dollars as you are  learning. So it is a great model that I hope to see more of here.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr.  Langevin).    Madam Speaker, I thank Representative Langevin. His  points are very good. We appreciate his leadership as co-chair of the  CTE Caucus and for the work that he has done in bringing this bill to  the point where it is now.   He is right. It was passed unanimously out of the Education and the  Workforce Committee. We thank the chair of the committee for making  that a priority. We hope it passes the floor of the House--it did, of  course, last session--and then we hope it becomes a priority for the  Senate as well. It is important.   He has mentioned some of the schools, the institutions, in his  district. I have talked about some in mine. I have heard from all of  them. Not only have they given input into the bill itself and how we  can improve the entire system across the country, but they have also  talked about the importance of the grants that are provided to them  through the Perkins Act. Reauthorization will be very beneficial in  keeping those grants going, in providing the help that we can from the  Federal level. So I thank him.   Madam Speaker, as I conclude with my remarks, I would first, again,  like to thank all of my colleagues who have participated in this  bipartisan Special Order. It is really, as we have seen, a bipartisan  issue here.   I thank Congressman Krishnamoorthi for helping to colead this and for  cosponsoring the bill, along with Congressman Thompson.   In my own background, I was someone with a nontraditional education.  I recognize the importance of providing our constituents with  educational pathways that provide them the skills necessary to launch  successful careers. In my experience, I know firsthand what it is like  to work a full-time job while attending school, and I believe that it  is important that we accommodate the needs of many different types of  students that are ready to learn and willing to work.   So, again, I am excited and very happy to cosponsor and support the  Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act.  This bill empowers State and local community leaders. It improves  alignment with in-demand jobs, those jobs that we have been talking  about. It increases transparency and accountability, and it ensures a  limited Federal role, putting the decisionmaking where it should be.   Madam Speaker, I mentioned before, but, in closing, I thank my  Pennsylvania colleague, Representative G.T. Thompson, for his  leadership on this critically important legislation. The level of  support for strengthening career and technical education among my  colleagues in the House and on a bipartisan basis is absolutely  outstanding, and I am very eager to continue finding new ways in which  we can grow CTE and apprenticeship programs and expand access for  Pennsylvania's working people to allow them to help achieve the  American Dream.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
