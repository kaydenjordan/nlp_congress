 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise in support of H.R. 3, the  Lower Drug Costs Now Act.   I thank the Speaker and my colleagues for working so hard to bring  this important piece of legislation to the floor. I believe there are  few issues more significant and few issues more impactful to the lives  of everyday Americans than the ever-increasing costs of healthcare and  the lack of access to vital treatment.   As a two-time breast cancer survivor, I know all too well the stress  and the heartache of a life-changing diagnosis. Treatment was  exhausting, both physically and emotionally, but I was truly blessed to  be able to afford my medication.   Even today, I continue to pay excessive out-of-pocket costs for my  medication. However, I am lucky to be in a position where I do not have  to make serious sacrifices to pay for the care that I need.   Unfortunately, this is not reality for all Americans. We live in the  richest Nation in the history of nations. This is the greatest country  on Earth. I refuse to believe that we cannot find a solution that  allows every American to afford the medications that they need.   I have been shocked by the stories from my constituents about how  pharmaceutical companies continue to gouge their pocketbooks and affect  their quality of life.   I heard a story recently of a mother in my district who wrote in  about her son, who is 27 and has type 1 diabetes. He pays $400 a month  for his insulin while also trying to repay his college loans from  pursuing his master's degree. She wrote in to speak for her son because  she is scared. Her son experiences the same hardship that so many  Americans do because of a diagnosis they did not choose.   Too often, stories like this end with a patient resorting to  rationing of essential treatments, often with catastrophic results.   These are lifesaving medications. They are not optional, and people  should never have to make the unthinkable decision about whether to  purchase their medications or put food on their tables or gas in their  cars.   On average, Americans pay three to four times as much for the same  prescription drugs as people in other countries. Over the last two  decades alone, the price of insulin has increased by 1,000 percent.  There is no reasonable explanation for these costs, and the American  people have had enough.   The constantly rising prices have far-reaching consequences,  increasing the price of health insurance premiums and eating into  workers' wages.   Let us be clear, it is taxpayer dollars and wages that go toward  paying for these outrageous prescription drug prices, and it is time  for Congress to say that enough is enough.   This is the most comprehensive solution to our country's drug pricing  problem ever to be seriously considered by the House of  Representatives. This legislation would give Medicare the power to  negotiate directly with the drug companies and create a powerful  mechanism that forces drug companies to the table to compromise on real  price reductions.   It also stops pharmaceutical companies from overcharging Americans  while charging other countries less for the same drugs, and it creates  a $2,000 out-of-pocket limit on prescription drug costs for Medicare  beneficiaries.   Finally, it will reverse years of unfair price hikes above inflation  across thousands of drugs in Medicare, making lower drug prices  negotiated by Medicare available to Americans with private insurance,  not just Medicare beneficiaries.   The Lower Drug Costs Now Act is a good deal for the American people.  It saves the taxpayers over $450 billion during the next decade and  allows us to make long-sought-after investments into Medicare and the  National Institutes of Health.   In fact, this bill includes legislation that I wrote to include  coverage of hearing aids in Medicare, making them affordable for our  seniors. It will also deliver vision and dental benefits while  investing huge sums into the search for new cures.   All the mothers and fathers who lay awake at night worried about  enrolling their kids in after-school activities or making their  mortgage or car payments will benefit from this bill. We are fighting  for them, and it is a fight that we intend to win.                            ____________________
