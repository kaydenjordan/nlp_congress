 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in  morning business for up to 15 minutes.    Mr. President, I am here for my 254th ``Time to Wake  Up'' speech. In the time I have been giving these speeches, I have  watched the shifting trajectory of climate denial. First, climate  change was a hoax. Then, there wasn't enough science. Then, the science  is still uncertain. Then, solving this problem would hurt our economy.  Then, innovation will magically save us, and now there is a new entrant  in the climate denial lexicon: China. ``China isn't doing enough on  carbon emissions,'' goes the argument. So we shouldn't do anything at  all.   It is a talking point you hear all the time from the fossil fuel  industry and its array of front groups working to block climate action  here in Congress.   Now, China has done plenty to complain about. China has stolen our  intellectual property, manipulated its currency, jailed its political  dissenters, set unfair labor rules, and more. I have been front and  center with those complaints about China. Yet, before we offer up China  as the latest ``climate denial lite'' excuse for doing nothing, let's  take a look at what China is really up to.   For starters, China is still a party to the Paris climate accord, and  China's President doesn't say stuff like ``wind turbines cause  cancer.'' OK--a low bar, I concede.   Our President recently tweeted:         Which country has the largest carbon emission reduction?       AMERICA! Who has dumped the most carbon into the air? CHINA!    Actually, that is not quite true. We have still dumped more  CO2 into the air than China because we have been at it  longer, and we still dump a lot more than China per capita, but China's  1 billion people do put out more carbon pollution than our 300 million.  They overtook us as the world's top national emitter in 2007. Last  year, China accounted for about 28 percent of global CO2  emissions, and the U.S. accounted for 15 percent. Cumulatively, China  accounts for 13 percent of emissions, and the U.S. accounts for 25  percent, which is about twice as much. Americans' per  [[Page S5688]]  capita carbon emissions are among the highest in the world. The average  Chinese citizen--China is here--accounts for less than half the per  capita emissions of the average American.   We actually don't have lots to brag about on our emissions, but that  is not where it looks the worst for us. Forget the past. Look to the  future at climate action. That is where China is blowing us out of the  water.   As the Trump administration slavishly fronts for fossil fuel--and is  even turning the agencies of our government over to this corrupting  industry--China is leaning in hard on a green energy future. China is  resetting its economy for a clean energy future. China began  implementing a national cap-and-trade system--a price on carbon--for  its power sector in 2018, which will go into full force across the  country next year. Several provinces already run cap and trade locally.  This year, China is launching a mandatory renewables quota, requiring  that 35 percent of its electricity be renewable by 2030, and its energy  plan seeks 50 percent of total electric power generation from nonfossil  sources by 2030.   China is also investing to dominate clean energy manufacturing and  technology. In 2017, nearly half of the world's new renewable energy  investment took place in China--triple the investment made in the  United States. China leads the world in renewable power deployment with  there being more than twice as much capacity as in any other nation.  Almost 30 percent of the world's renewable power capacity right now is  in China, including the most solar, the most wind, and the most hydro.  China dominates the global deployment of solar panels. It has several  times greater installed solar generation capacity than the United  States. In fact, we virtually lost solar panel manufacturing to China.   On this graph, China is the yellow, and it shows China outdoing all  of the other countries in total capacity. We are here compared to China  there, and the gray is the general category for the rest of the world.  China is even bigger than the rest of the world, not counting the  United States, Japan, Germany, and India.   So that is China's lead in total renewable electricity deployment,  with more than double the installed capacity of the United States and  nearly a third of the total global renewable electricity capacity. Here  is the world's total. There is China at 404. Then you actually have to  scale down the graphic to get over here to the United States at 180-- 180 to 404. If you count nuclear power as clean energy, there is China.   China currently has the world's largest nuclear power construction  program. It has 37 nuclear reactors in operation, 20 under  construction, 40 in planning, and proposals for an additional 100. Next  generation nuclear technologies originally designed in the United  States are among those Chinese proposals. If all of those reactors are  built, China will end up with twice the U.S. nuclear fleet.   In the transportation sector, we feel pretty good in the United  States. We all see Teslas driving around, and Chevy has its terrific  Bolt. There are emerging EV manufacturers, like Rivian, that are  proposing extremely cool vehicles. Again, there is China--far out front  in building electric vehicles and in deploying the infrastructure  needed to run electric vehicles. China now requires that 10 percent of  vehicles sold be electric or plug-in hybrids. This quota increases to  12 percent in 2020. By the end of 2018, 45 percent of all of the  electric cars on the planet were in China. Last year, China  manufactured nearly half of all of the electric vehicles that have been  manufactured in the world.   In other areas, it is China, China, China. China dominates global  markets for electric buses and two-wheelers. Exxon fabulously predicted  to its shareholders that there would be zero electric buses by 2040;  China is already operating 400,000.   High-tech batteries will power transportation and balance the  electric grid of the future. China is planning for three times as much  battery manufacturing capacity as the rest of the world combined.  Carbon capture will grow as an industry as soon as it has a business  model, which, by the way, carbon pricing, including China's cap-and- trade plan, will provide them. On carbon pricing, there is China, with  20 carbon capture projects under construction or in development--more  than in any other nation.   Of course, it is not all good news on climate out of China, not by  any stretch. The Chinese continue to build more coal-fired powerplants  than any other country, not just in China but around the world.  However, the difficult truth for us is that China's progress on climate  change is real, and it is way more than ours. China is not doing this  to be nice. It is doing this to outdo us economically and politically.    If we keep kicking our own renewable industries in the teeth here in  America just to please Trump's coal industry donors while China invests  in these new technologies, we will be making a losing bet. China's one- party government has put economic growth above all else. Chinese  scientists see the same data that ours do. Chinese economists see the  same economic risks that ours do. Chinese businesses see the same  threats and opportunities for their workers and their supply chains  that ours do. Chinese cities see the same threat from sea level rise  that ours do. Yet the Chinese Government has chosen a smarter path  because it is not under the thumb of the fossil fuel industry. The  Chinese are acting out of self-interest. They are acting on climate  because they want their country and their economy to succeed. They want  to own these industries of the future. Rather than compete, we are now  helping them win--all to make some grubby political donors happy.   The Global Commission on the Economy and Climate reports that strong  climate action could deliver at least $26 trillion in economic benefits  worldwide through 2030 compared with business as usual--a $26 trillion  relative benefit. Over that period, these actions would generate over  65 million new low-carbon jobs globally and avoid over 700,000  premature deaths from air pollution, by the way. Whoever acts swiftly  will get the biggest share of these riches.   Last year, Stanford's economists found that keeping global warming to  1.5-degrees Celsius as opposed to the riskier 2-degree safety limit  would likely save more than $20 trillion in economic damages around the  world by the end of this century--$20 trillion.   The world power that positions itself to reap the economic benefits  of a carbon-neutral technology and that helps lead the world away from  runaway climate calamities will garner tremendous economic, strategic,  and diplomatic advantage. In particular, China recognizes the  diplomatic advantage to acting on climate as the United States  withdraws from its traditional position of international leadership.   The last century has been called the American century. We are fast  handing over the next century to become the Chinese century. We are  doing it to ourselves, and we are doing it for the worst of all  possible reasons--to cater to and kowtow to a corrupt industry. Making  sure that the next century is the American century, as well, is as good  a reason as any for us to wake up and act on climate.   I yield the floor.
