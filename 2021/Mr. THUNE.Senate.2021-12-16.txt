 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, Democrats' push to pass their tax-and- spending spree continues to throw into sharp relief the difference  between Republicans' and Democrats' vision of government. And it is  about a lot more than just the amount of money we want to spend. Of  course, the amount of money we are spending matters, but it is also  about what that money represents.   In general, more money means more government. And more government  usually means less freedom. Republicans don't oppose Democrats' tax- and-spending spree just because it would cost a lot of money or drive  up our national debt.   It would do both of those things, of course, with negative  consequences for our economy and the prosperity of American families.  And the negative economic consequences alone are sufficient reason to  oppose Democrats' ``Build Back Bankrupt'' plan. But it is a lot more  than just about excessive spending.   With their ``Build Back Bankrupt'' plan, Democrats envision a society  which government is intimately involved in nearly every aspect of  Americans' life--from, to quote a New York Times article, ``cradle to  grave.'' And that is not a vision Republicans share, primarily because  a government that is intimately involved in nearly every aspect of your  life is a government that is going to exert control over your life.  More government inevitably means more government control.   Take Democrats' childcare plan in their Build Back Better  legislation. To hear Democrats talk about it, you might think this plan  involves nothing more than cutting checks to American parents to help  with their childcare bills, but that is not the case.   First, of course, Democrats take the opportunity to add a lot of new  childcare mandates and regulations. According to one estimate,  Democrats' childcare subsidy measure could drive up the cost of daycare  by somewhere around $13,000 per child. Good luck working that into your  family budget.    Democrats' government subsidy program is set up to favor certain  kinds of childcare and childcare providers. It is set up to favor  institutional childcare, rather than home care or other models like  neighborhood co-ops, and it is set up to place religious providers at a  disadvantage.   That is right. Despite the fact that a majority of working families  who use center-based care opt for faith-based centers, Democrats'  program is set up to put these providers at a disadvantage. It denies  them facilities funding that is granted to secular providers.   And it would disqualify--I should say, it could disqualify many  providers with traditional religious beliefs like those shared by  millions upon millions of Catholic, Protestant, Jewish, and Muslim  families around the country.   It could even disqualify a provider simply because the provider gave  placement preference to families of its own faith. So if you are a  Catholic Church with a childcare program and you give preference to  families who attend your church, you could be accused of discrimination  and disqualified from receiving government subsidies.   And if you are a parent who can't afford that program without those  government subsidies--thanks to government mandates and regulations  that have hiked up the childcare bill--you are out of luck. If you need  those government subsidies, you will have to send your child to one of  the providers the government prefers.   The childcare program in the Democrats' tax-and-spending spree  provides a perfect example of what happens when government gets  involved. And it is about a lot more than how much money the government  is spending.  [[Page S9224]]    With government money comes government control. The decision is no  longer just in the individual's hands. And the more substantial the  government involvement, the larger the government's role in decision  making is likely to be--whether the issue is childcare, healthcare,  education, or anything else.   In his 1967 inaugural address as Governor of California, Ronald  Reagan said:         Freedom is a fragile thing and it's never more than one       generation away from extinction. It is not ours by way of       inheritance; it must be fought for and defended constantly by       each generation, for it comes only once to a people.    Freedom is a fragile thing.   Here in the United States, we have enjoyed an unprecedented degree of  individual liberty--a liberty that it is very easy for us to take for  granted. But that liberty is not guaranteed. It is something that must  be fought for and protected.   And that doesn't involve simply safeguarding our liberty from  external threats from foreign powers; it involves ensuring making sure  that our government doesn't start to exceed its proper role.   The loss of freedom can come dramatically or it can come quietly  through a steady increase of government encroachment.   And it is important to remember that freedom can be eroded or taken  away by the well-meaning, and not just those who are actively hostile  to it.   I believe that my Democrat colleagues likely do not see their ideas  for dramatic government expansion as threatening Americans' personal  freedom. The problem is that when you expand the reach of government,  the diminishment of liberty is inevitable. Expand the reach of  government into Americans' lives, and it is inevitable that you are  going to transfer some of Americans' decision-making power over to  politicians and bureaucrats in Washington.   Democrats' tax-and-spending spree--and its major expansion of  government--is far from the only threat to Americans' liberties that we  are seeing from the Democratic Party.   I am increasingly disturbed by Democrats' tendency to play fast and  loose with religious liberty and the First Amendment--whether that  involves disadvantaging religious childcare providers, threatening  individuals' right to live according to their conscience, questioning  judges' fitness for office based on religious belief, or, as we learned  recently from a courageous whistleblower FBI agent, even opening the  door for the FBI to collect information on parents voicing their  opposition to local school policies during school board meetings.   I am also disturbed by Democrats' clear belief that Americans should  defer to government and Democrat-approved experts, as spectacularly  evidenced in the Virginia Governor's race, which was unquestionably  decided based partly on the Democrat candidate's repeatedly expressed  belief that parents shouldn't be involved in the content of their  children's education.   I am puzzled as to why Democrats are so convinced--so convinced--that  Washington elites or Democrat-approved experts are better at making  decisions than ordinary Americans.   As Ronald Reagan said in that same speech:         [I]t's hard to explain those among us who even today would       question the people's capacity for self-government. I've       often wondered if they will answer, those who subscribe to       that philosophy: if no one among us is capable of governing       himself, then who among us has the capacity to govern someone       else?    I believe that the American people are capable of governing  themselves--of making their own decisions--and that they are actually  generally going to be better at it than a bunch of bureaucrats in  Washington.   And I strongly oppose efforts to substitute the judgments of  Washington bureaucrats--or Democrat politicians--for the judgment of  individual Americans.   It states in the Declaration of Independence that governments are  instituted to preserve our unalienable rights, including the rights to  life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.   Preserving liberty is a fundamental purpose of government, but, of  course, before you can enjoy liberty, you have to enjoy the right to  life. For a long time now, the Democratic Party has consistently denied  the right to life to a whole segment of the American population: unborn  Americans.   There is no better example of their aggressive pro-abortion extremism  than the so-called Women's Health Protection Act the Democrats in the  House passed in September. This legislation, which would more  accurately be termed the ``Abortion on Demand Act,'' would eliminate  almost every democratically passed State abortion restriction, no  matter how mild. It would endanger the religious and conscience rights  of doctors and nurses, and, of course, it ignores the clear position of  the American people, a strong majority of whom support restrictions on  abortion.   Apparently, Democrats are not content with joining repressive regimes  like China and North Korea as one of a tiny handful of nations that  allow elective abortion past 20 weeks of pregnancy. No, they want to  remove even the mildest and most widely supported restrictions on  abortion. That is yet another example of Democrats' tendency to think  they know better than the American people.   The Republican vision--the conservative vision, the vision that I  share--is a vision that foregrounds liberty, not government; that  believes individuals acting freely generally tend to do a better job of  making decisions than a small handful of politicians and bureaucrats in  Washington.   We believe in government as a backstop, not Big Brother. A system of  permanent government dependence erodes individual liberty, to say  nothing of the ways in which it undermines prosperity, robs individuals  of the purpose and pride that comes with work and achievement.   Government should create the conditions in which freedom,  opportunity, and prosperity can flourish, not attempt to secure  particular outcomes or to dictate the paths that Americans should take.   We are privileged to live in the freest country the world has ever  known. It is not a privilege we can or should take for granted, and it  is a privilege that we can all too easily lose. Our liberty is, as  Ronald Reagan said, ever only one generation away from extinction.   I will continue to make safeguarding that liberty that we have been  given one of my most cherished priorities, whether that involves  fighting for the right to life of unborn Americans, opposing attempts  to restrict religious liberty, or fighting against an expansion of  government that would push out parents and put the government in the  driver's seat on way too many issues.
