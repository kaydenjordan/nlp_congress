 Mr. Speaker, I really appreciate the gentleman's efforts  to be able to highlight the threat from wildfires that we are having in  the West.   Mr. Speaker, in recent weeks, the aftermath of Hurricanes Harvey and  Irma have dominated our news cycles. Our hearts certainly go out to the  people who have been impacted as they rebuild their lives and continue  to work to ensure that they have the resources they need.   When we hear the term ``natural disaster,'' most of us probably think  of hurricanes, tornadoes, or earthquakes. Unless you come from the  Western United States, you probably don't think of wildfires as a  natural disaster. But they are, and they have devastating effects.   Wildfire season is a part of life in the West, but this year's fire  season is shaping up to be the worst in history. Years of mismanagement  of our national forests have led to conditions where fires are burning  longer and hotter than ever before.   We need to address this problem on two fronts: one, through better  forest management; and, two, by updating wildfire response so it is  more in line with the Federal response to other natural disasters.   On the forest management front, we need to give the Forest Service  the tools to engage in actual forest management. This means removing  the dead and downed timber that serves as a fuel source for either man- made or naturally occurring fires, empowering local foresters and land  managers to identify and designate areas of high risk, and supporting  collaboration between all levels of government.   These principles are laid out in the Resilient Federal Forests Act by  my colleague, Mr. Westerman from Arkansas. I am proud to be a cosponsor  of this legislation.    We must also reform the Federal budgeting process for wildfire  prevention and the suppression efforts. For too long, the process the  Federal Government has used to allocate money to fight catastrophic  wildfires has undermined forest management efforts that could prevent  these types of fires from igniting in the first place.   Under current law, if firefighting costs exceed an agency's budget,  it must shift money from non-firefighting accounts to make up the  difference. Last year, the Forest Service had to transfer $700 million  from other budgeted line items to cover firefighting costs, which  brought the agency's total firefighting efforts to about 55 percent of  the entire budget.   You would think that firefighting wouldn't be the biggest line item  in the budget for an agency tasked with maintaining healthy forests. It  is critical that we treat wildfires like other natural disasters after  an agency's wildfire suppression funds are exhausted. The cost of any  extraordinary firefighting that goes beyond the agency's annual budget  should be funded through a budget cap adjustment similar to what is  used by FEMA for other natural disasters.   It is my hope that we can continue to bring more attention to  wildfires that are burning across the West and the impacts they are  having on our communities, and also that we can work together to  advance policies that better support forest management and fire  prevention and suppression efforts and forest health.                                time  1915
