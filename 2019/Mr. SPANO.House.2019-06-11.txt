 Madam Speaker, at the start of this Congress, the new  Democratic majority promised that legislation would be considered under  regular order. Six months into Congress, it is evident that that  promise has been abandoned altogether.   Instead, the majority has used a procedural tactic to set spending  levels and circumvent the normal budget process. There is now no sign  of a 2020 budget resolution coming before the House to set spending  levels, so the full House has no opportunity to debate these levels as  a standalone bill.   The national debt exceeded $22 trillion this year. The American  people expect us to debate and vote on a budget that will outline the  direction of our Nation. However, without having passed the budget, the  House will consider a massive spending bill this week that combines  five appropriations bills. Altogether, the package includes nearly $1  trillion in spending. Members will take this vote to spend with no plan  or agreement between the House and Senate on an overall budget.   I call on the majority to follow through on its promise of regular  order and bring a budget before the House so that we can debate the  out-of-control spending and how it can be reined in and reined in now.                            ____________________
