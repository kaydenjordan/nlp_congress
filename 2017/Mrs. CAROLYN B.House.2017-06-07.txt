 MALONEY of New York asked and was given permission  to address the House for 1 minute.)    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in  strong opposition to H.R. 10, the ``Wrong'' CHOICE Act.   This bill would take us back to the regulatory stone age and would be  a disaster for our entire financial system. It would actually increase  risk in the financial system because, under this bill, any bank that  meets an arbitrary new 10 percent leverage ratio would be exempted from  all other capital and liquidity requirements. The problem with the  leverage ratio is that it treats all assets equally risky. Under the  leverage ratio, a subprime mortgage-backed security is considered just  as risky as a U.S. Treasury bond.   As a result, many banking regulators have pointed out that relying  solely on the leverage ratio would give banks an incentive to get rid  of their safest assets, like U.S. treasuries, and load up on riskier  assets.   Incentives matter, Mr. Speaker, and this bill gives banks a huge  incentive to load up on risk. We know what risk is like. Eleven million  people lost their homes, and many lost their jobs. Let's not remove the  safety net that was put in place with the Dodd-Frank bill.   I oppose the ``Wrong'' CHOICE Act. It is bad for America, bad for  people, and the wrong direction. I urge a strong ``no'' vote.                            ____________________     MALONEY of New York. I thank the gentlewoman for her  leadership and for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to H.R. 10, the  ``Wrong'' CHOICE Act.   This bill will take us back to the regulatory stone age and would be  a disaster for the entire financial system.   Let us remember why we passed Dodd-Frank: we confronted the worst  financial crisis, caused by mismanagement from the financial industry,  that cost this country $18 trillion in household wealth, millions lost  their homes, millions lost their jobs, and the suffering was deep and  strong.   First, this bill, the ``Wrong'' CHOICE Act, would repeal the orderly  liquidation authority, which is the only tool that would allow large  financial institutions like Lehman Brothers or AIG to be wound down  safely, without requiring a taxpayer bailout or causing a financial  panic, like Lehman.   We had two choices in the crisis: either bail them out--a bad  choice--or let them fail--another bad choice.   The liquidation authority is helpful, yet the majority claims that  the liquidation authority codifies taxpayer bailouts. Nothing could be  further from the truth. Under the liquidation authority, the FDIC wipes  out the firm's shareholders, imposes losses on the firm's creditors,  fires the firm's management, and completely liquidates the entire firm.  The only people who are guaranteed not to suffer losses are the  taxpayers.   So if we wipe out this protection to the taxpayers, we are putting  the taxpayers in harm's way yet again.                                time  1330    This bill would also devastate investors by rolling back decades of  investor protections and trampling on the property rights of  shareholders by making it virtually impossible for them to influence  the management of the companies that they own.    MALONEY of New York. Finally, the bill would  completely gut the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which has been  an incredible, effective watchdog for consumers and has protected the  consumers who were often not thought about first of all or second of  all--or not thought about at all. This agency protects them. If we  would have had it, we would not have had the financial crisis we  suffered. This would just make it easier for banks like Wells Fargo to  rip off consumers and would protect them from being punished if they  are caught.   So I want to point out that the Republican ``Wrong'' CHOICE Act puts  Wall Street ahead of Main Street, leads to taxpayer bailouts for big  banks, guts consumer protections for seniors and their families, and  brings back risky practices that caused the 2008 financial crisis. It  is the wrong direction, it is a wrong vote, and I caution my friends on  the other side of the aisle the voters are going to remember this vote.  Don't turn us back to the Stone Age of regulation.   I urge a very strong ``no'' vote on this wrongly directed ``Bad''  CHOICE Act.
