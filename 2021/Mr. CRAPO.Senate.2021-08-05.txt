 Mr. President, along with my colleagues Senator Jim  Risch, Representative  Mike Simpson, and Representative Russ Fulcher, I  honor Allen Thomas Noble, a stalwart of the city of Boise and a great  Idahoan.   Allen Noble was a visionary, who loved our country. He was a native  Idahoan, born in Idaho Falls. He graduated from Kuna High School and  started out in farming in the Happy Valley of Idaho. Allen married Vera  May Shulz, of Kuna, and they had five children: Susan, Linda, June,  David, and Mark. As his obituary reads, ``He loved farm equipment and  in 1958 bought an interest in Nampa International Harvester and moved  his family to Nampa.'' Allen's deep love for farming was evident in his  agricultural advancements, including his development of ``high lift  pumping'' that advanced farm irrigation capabilities in the Dry Lake  area and later near Glenns Ferry. In 1965, Allen married Billie Dee  Jolley Johnson and added  [[Page S5928]]  four more children to the family: Linda Sue, Cindee Lou, Kate, and  Rusty. He later expanded into John Deere dealerships, as Campbell  Tractor Co., and extended his appreciation for aviation into  agricultural spraying and Idaho Helicopters, Inc.'s firefighting and  air medical operations. His helicopter operations have served as the  primary life flight service in the Pacific Northwest, saving countless  lives. This service has been instrumental in serving Idaho's  backcountry and moving patients quickly from accidents to medical care.   In addition to his success and advancements in agriculture, Allen  gave generously of his time, talents, and resources to many  organizations and efforts in the community. He was a longtime supporter  of Boise State football, and he contributed for decades to the Boise  State athletic department. This included backing the expansion of  Albertsons Stadium and helping to establish the Allen Noble Hall of  Fame Gallery, named in his honor. He served on the Bronco Athletic  Association Board of Directors and earned the Bronze Bronco Award. He  also served on the board of directors for the Idaho First National  Bank. Additionally, he was an initial outside investor in Micron  Technology and served on its board of directors, playing a key role in  the start and growth of the company.   Allen's light shined brightly over the 92 years we were blessed to  have him as part of our world. He has been fittingly described as a  great man who had an innovative mind, a passion for progress, and a  pioneering spirit with the drive and determination to accomplish  anything he put his mind to. He was also warmhearted and giving, and  his encouragement and support touched many lives over the years.   He is remembered as a loyal friend who was open and generous with his  life. We offer our heartfelt condolences to his many friends and loved  ones, including his siblings, children, grandchildren, and great- grandchildren. Multiple lifetimes may not have been long enough for all  Allen Noble had in mind and was so capable of accomplishing, but he  certainly made his time on earth count--putting strong foundations  under his ideas and steadfastly helping others.                            ____________________
