 Madam Speaker, I rise to celebrate the work  Democrats are doing to create safer communities across America. Living  safely should not be determined by your ZIP Code, your ethnicity, or  your salary.   That is why, last week, Democrats passed four public safety bills,  including:   The Invest to Protect Act, which helps local police departments with  less than 125 officers to hire additional officers;   The Mental Health Justice Act, which provides for training of mental  health professionals to respond to mental health crises;   The Break the Cycle of Violence Act, which provides grant dollars for  neighborhood crime prevention programs; and   The VICTIM Act, which allows us to hire and train more detectives to  investigate violent crimes.   Keeping families safe by putting people first and putting people over  politics is what Democrats do.                            ____________________
