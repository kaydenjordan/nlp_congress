 Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Chair, upstate New York and communities across the country are  experiencing an unprecedented increase in Lyme disease and tick-borne  diseases. At all 14 of the townhalls that I have held in my district  this term, folks asked me what Congress is doing about Lyme disease.   Today, I am offering an amendment to better understand and prevent  this disease. The amendment adds $1 million in critical CDC funding for  the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of Lyme disease.   This package of appropriations bills makes critical investments in  our priorities. But as temperatures rise and families spend more time  outside, we must invest more in treating and preventing Lyme.   Lyme disease is a devastating disease that can often go undetected as  it travels through ticks, tiny bugs that reside in dense forests and  rural areas, areas found all across my district in upstate New York.   While most Lyme disease patients who are diagnosed and treated early  can fully recover, 10 to 20 percent of patients suffer from persistent  symptoms, which, for some, are chronic and disabling.   These numbers are even more startling as we consider that, over the  last 25 years, Lyme disease has increased by over 300 percent in the  northeastern States. In 2017, there were 3,502 confirmed cases of tick- borne Lyme in New York State alone.   Madam Chair, I have 5-year-old twin boys. Whenever I do bath time, I  have to check for ticks. There have been a few scary moments where I  have actually had to pull ticks off my little boys. It is a frightening  experience.   Parents, myself included, are sending their children into their  backyard or local park with fears that they can return with a chronic  lifelong and potentially disabling disease.                                time  0930    But this is just not a medical or moral issue. Lyme disease is  costing our economy. How much money are the American people spending on  this disease as we still know so little about it?   Studies indicate that Lyme disease costs approximately $1.3 billion  each year in direct medical costs alone in the United States. The  American people are spending $1.3 billion on the symptoms of a disease  rather than investing in medical research to treat and prevent it.   This figure doesn't even address the opportunity cost of failing to  act to address Lyme disease in our communities. How will our local  economy attract tourists when people can get sick? What is the cost of  keeping children cooped up inside rather than enjoying the outdoors for  fear of tick-borne illnesses?  [[Page H4635]]    Upstate New Yorkers and communities struggling with tick populations  need medical solutions now to stop this disease in its tracks. Prompt  diagnosis and treatment of tick-borne diseases are crucial to prevent  long-term complications.   Today, available diagnostic tests can be inaccurate and complex to  interpret, especially during the earliest stage of infection when  treatment is most effective. My amendment offers trying to better  understand the disease and allowing for research to develop a more  effective treatment of the disease.   Unlike in other infectious disease settings, tests to directly  measure the presence of the infecting organism are not available for  Lyme disease. This leaves physicians without the tools needed to  diagnose; and without an accurate diagnosis, it is challenging for  physicians to provide early treatment.   The disease requires specialized treatments, which requires real  investments in research to better manage and prevent the disease. Madam  Chair, the time to invest is now. Indeed, the National Science  Foundation has declared that Lyme disease is an emerging global  pandemic due to climate change.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro).
