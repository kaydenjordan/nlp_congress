 Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Expanding  America's Pacific Diplomatic Presence Act, a bipartisan piece of  legislation that seeks to deepen our diplomatic relations with Pacific  Island countries and territories. I am thankful to Senator Cotton,  Senator Markey, and Senator Hagerty for joining me in introducing this  legislation.   The United States enjoys strong historical ties, economic  relationships, and cultural links with many Pacific Island nations.  During World War II, these islands became the frontlines of some of our  hardest fought battles of the Pacific campaign. Now, Pacific Island  nations and territories are at the frontlines of climate change. Our  friendships with Pacific Island nations are deepened by generations of  Pacific Islanders whose presence in the United States and contributions  have enriched communities throughout our country. We also recognize the  strategic importance of Pacific Island nations, as demonstrated by the  Compacts of Free Association we have with the Republic of the Marshall  Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, and Palau. Unfortunately,  while our diplomatic presence in the region has waned in the last  decade, the diplomatic and economic presence of the People's Republic  of China, PRC, has increased as it seeks to forge closer ties with  Pacific Island nations. What happens in the Pacific Islands matters to  the United States and we must take steps to demonstrate the strength of  our commitment to the region.   Diplomatic engagement in the region is critical for understanding how  we can better support our Pacific Island partners. President Biden has  worked to elevate the U.S.'s diplomatic engagement by being the first  U.S. President to participate in a gathering of the Pacific Island  Forum leaders. The President also signaled his commitment to the Freely  Associated States by appointing Special Presidential Envoy Ambassador  Joseph Yun to lead negotiations over the Compacts of Free Association.  Several high-ranking administration officials, including the Secretary  of State Antony Blinken, have visited the region to pledge U.S. support  for efforts related to COVID-19 response, climate change adaptation,  maritime security, infrastructure development, trade, and economic  investment. I applaud this level of meaningful diplomatic engagement in  the region and would like to see this sustained in the future.   Establishing new U.S. diplomatic posts would support our efforts to  build lasting relationships with Pacific Island nations and  territories. The United States currently has eight Embassies among  Pacific Island nations, with plans to reopen an Embassy in the Solomon  Islands. These Embassies play an important role in forging relations  with host nations and serve as important symbols of the U.S.'s long  term commitment to the region. Opening new embassies, consulate  generals, or other diplomatic posts would allow U.S. diplomats to have  more regular interactions with the governments of the Pacific Islands  and learn more about the challenges and opportunities facing each  nation. The year-round presence of more U.S. diplomats would improve  our ability to compete with the PRC's growing presence in the region  and would enhance our coordination with Australia, New Zealand, and  Japan on economic development assistance and humanitarian aid. An  expanded diplomatic presence in the region would also improve oversight  of U.S. Government-funded programs in the region.   The legislation I am introducing would direct the Government  Accountability Office, GAO, to conduct a feasibility study on  establishing new diplomatic posts in Pacific Island countries and  territories that currently do not have a U.S. Embassy or other U.S.  diplomatic post. This legislation recognizes and seeks to understand  what potential benefits and challenges may exist for establishing new  U.S. diplomatic posts in the region. I hope that the results of an  independent study conducted by GAO will inform future decisions by  Congress and the executive branch to establish and appropriately fund  new diplomatic posts in the region.   I urge my colleagues to pass the Expanding America's Pacific  Diplomatic Presence Act to demonstrate our support for greater  diplomatic engagement with our partners in the region and reaffirm our  commitment to building a shared future with the people of the Pacific  Islands.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Expanding  America's Pacific Diplomatic Presence Act, a bipartisan piece of  legislation that seeks to deepen our diplomatic relations with Pacific  Island countries and territories.
