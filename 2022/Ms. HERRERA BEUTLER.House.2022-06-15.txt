 Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate Ron and  Terry Prill for being recognized as the 2022 Philanthropists of the  Year.   For two decades, Ron and Terry have dedicated their lives to worthy  causes, positively impacting residents across southwest Washington.   After retiring and moving to Camas, Ron served on the board of the  Boys and Girls Club of Southwest Washington, helping make a difference  in the lives of countless kids in our communities.   This venture inspired the Prills to continue giving back through  other organizations. Among their numerous acts of charity, Ron and  Terry have been highly supportive of several healthcare-related  nonprofits and were critical in expanding PeaceHealth Southwest  Washington's operations.   This includes a remodeled cardiology unit with state-of-the-art  equipment and a cardiac education center, which provides care to  countless patients and their families.   Ron and Terry, thank you for your unwavering support of our  communities, and congratulations again on this well-deserved  recognition.                            ____________________
