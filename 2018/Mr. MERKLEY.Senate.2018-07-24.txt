 Mr. President, as ranking member of the Agriculture  Appropriations Subcommittee, I rise today to discuss the Agriculture  appropriations bill. This is a good bill that was drafted in a  bipartisan manner and passed out of committee unanimously.   A big thanks goes to Chairman Hoeven for his hard work on the bill,  as well to members of his team who worked closely with members of my  team throughout this process and considered requests and concerns from  Senators on both sides of the aisle.   In his budget request, President Trump proposed more than a 25- percent cut to USDA's funding. He also zeroed out a number of very  important programs, including programs that benefit  [[Page S5235]]  rural America, along with research programs and domestic and  international nutrition programs. The bill that came out of the  Appropriations Committee rejects those devastating cuts that were  presented in the President's budget request.   This bill, which is within the subcommittee's discretionary  allocation of $23.2 billion, makes smart, targeted investments in  programs that are important to the American people while keeping out  controversial policy riders. In this bill we maintain funding for  important rural development programs while building on the increases  provided last year for rural infrastructure initiatives, including  rural water and waste programs and a broadband pilot program. These  programs are vital in providing rural communities the ability to  support entrepreneurs to be able to grow their businesses, creating  much needed jobs in the community.   The bill protects vital research programs and makes important new  investments for the organic industry. The Organic Transitions Program  is funded at $6 million. The National Organic Program is funded at $15  million. The Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education Program is  funded at $37 million. All of these are historic funding levels that  demonstrate the commitment to a vital and rapidly growing industry.   What else does this committee bill do?   It supports funding for farm ownership and farm operating loans. With  farm incomes on the decline, access to credit is crucial for farmers to  stay in business. Farm loans will serve the most disadvantaged in the  farming sector, including farmers who are just starting out, as well as  ranchers, minorities, women, and veterans.   I am also pleased that we were able to include $150 million in  funding for the Watershed and Flood Prevention Operations Program to  protect our watersheds and help to prevent floods, reduce erosion, and  protect wildlife habitats. With a backlog of $850 million for projects  that have already been authorized, this funding is much needed.   For domestic nutrition programs, our bill maintains funding for the  Summer Electronic Benefit Transfer for Children Program, which provides  access to food for low-income children during the summer months when  schools are out of session. Beyond that, the bill provides for $30  million for school meal equipment grants, $18 million for the Farmers'  Market Nutrition Program, and $238 million for the Commodity  Supplemental Food Program. This bill also protects SNAP, or the  Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which 42 million Americans  rely on. It does not provide provisions that would eliminate benefits  to those who qualify.   On the international front, the bill maintains strong funding for  nutrition programs such as Food for Peace and McGovern-Dole. Since its  inception, Food for Peace has reached over 3 billion people in 150  countries and more than 32 million people last year alone.   I have been in the field to see the impact of this program for  communities that rely on it in some of the hardest hit parts of the  world affected by conflict and climate chaos and corruption. This  support is a considerable feature of what people around the world see  in terms of the United States reaching out to assistant communities in  need worldwide.   Meanwhile, in 2017, the McGovern-Dole Program fed 4.5 million  children, and it helps to support education and food security for low- income countries, as well as increasing school attendance. This program  supports good health and better education for children around the  world, with a particular emphasis on girls. In the state of the world  today, we need programs like Food for Peace and McGovern-Dole, which  have a proven track record. I am pleased that we have worked in a  bipartisan to ensure that these programs are funded.   The bill in front of us supports the important work of the FDA, or  the Food and Drug Administration, through a $159 million increase in  the agency's funding. Included in that funding increase, among other  things, is full funding for the Oncology Center of Excellence,  modernizing the generic drug review process, investment and innovation  for rare diseases, and the continuation of last year's work on opioid  prevention activities. I know, and my fellow Senators understand, just  how important that opioid addiction prevention program is.                         Tribute to Jessica Schulken    Mr. President, before I conclude, I wish to take a moment to  recognize an outstanding member of the Agriculture Subcommittee team.   Jessica Schulken will be leaving us in the next few weeks after  almost 19 years on the Appropriations Committee. Her accomplishments  are numerous. During her years on the committee, she has been a  tireless advocate for our Nation's farmers and ranchers, a fierce  protector for rural America, a staunch advocate for ensuring that the  Food and Drug Administration has all the resources it needs, and a  defender of transparency who has worked hard to ensure that these  agencies are answerable to Congress.   I cannot begin to adequately express the tremendous work that she has  done on this committee as clerk. I speak for many who know how sorely  she will be missed. Here is a big thanks to Jessica Schulken for her  years of service and dedication, and I wish her well in her new chapter  of life.   The process on this agriculture appropriations subcommittee bill has  been emblematic of the type of good, strong bipartisan work that we  would like to see much more often here in the Senate--bipartisan work  that has assisted our ranchers, bipartisan work to assist our farming  communities, bipartisan work to support rural communities and rural  infrastructure. So I look forward to getting this bill passed, getting  it through conference, and getting it to the Oval Office.   Thank you, Mr. President.
