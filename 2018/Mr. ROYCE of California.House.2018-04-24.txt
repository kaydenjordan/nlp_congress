 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, let me thank the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros- Lehtinen), the chairman emeritus of our committee, for her tireless  work advocating on behalf of Holocaust survivors. Let me say at the  outset here that no one in Congress, no one in this Congress, has done  more to advocate on behalf of survivors than Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, and I  believe that to be true through her entire tenure in this body.   Let me also explain the thoughts, as explained to us, behind our  Senate colleagues that put together the JUST Act.   From their standpoint, from their vantage point, the JUST Act is a  simple reporting requirement to assess the progress of signatories to  the 2009 Terezin Declaration on Holocaust era assets and related  issues. The goal there, of course, was to fulfill the principles in  that declaration. A lot of time and effort went into trying to leverage  that agreement out of 46 countries that agreed to these principles.   Now, here is the point; here is where we have a difference of  opinion: of those 46 countries, some of them are falling woefully short  of their commitments.   Here are the conflict divisions. Some are saying, many are saying:  Look, we need to put pressure on them.   The Senate unanimously came to the conclusion that a way to do that  is with this bill, because what the legislation does is to ensure that  there is an accountability mechanism of checking adherence to the  declaration principles and to making sure that it doesn't fall by the  wayside by bringing accountability to those countries that don't.   The injustices of the Holocaust, frankly, here today, those  injustices are too many to name. Many are unaddressed in that  declaration, and I concur from that standpoint. But, at the same time,  we need to continue pushing to right the full spectrum of these wrongs.   Before us we have a bill which will bring much leverage. We cannot  lose the headway that we have made toward compensating survivors and  families for what was rightfully theirs.   Our partners have already agreed to the restitution principles in the  declaration. A formal report that shows who has fallen short and how,  it is argued by our colleagues in the Senate, would be a powerful  instrument for the U.S. Government to push for changes.   From my standpoint, I understand the arguments being made by the  Senate. It does not mean that we should not go forward to make other  points. But the argument they make to us is let's give the State  Department the tools it needs to ensure accountability. This is an  argument that, on both sides of the aisle, the preponderance of Members  here, I think, concur with.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, we have been contacted on behalf of the JUST Act by a  number of organizations in support of the Senate bill. The major  American Jewish organizations supporting this measure are the American  Jewish Committee, the Anti-Defamation League, the Jewish Federations of  North America, the B'nai B'rith, the HIAS refugee assistance  organization, Union for Reform Judaism, Orthodox Union, World Jewish  Restitution Organization, and others; and they have argued that the  Justice for Uncompensated Survivors Today Act, or JUST Act, as the  Senate calls it, is a measure that will have an outsized impact in  encouraging countries to continue working to make amends for the evils  of the Holocaust. That is what drove the Senate to pass this bill.   Now, just to go into the details again a little bit: it was in 2009  that representatives of this country and 40 other countries agreed to a  set of principles to address the welfare of survivors, to address  Holocaust education, and to address issues related to restitution for  seized property, among other issues.   Now, that is what these 40 nations committed to. So 10 years have  passed, approximately, and it is time that we take stock of the work  under way because, while a number of these partner countries have made  great strides to uphold their commitments under the agreement, you and  I know--everybody here knows--that some countries have fallen short.   And this legislation, which charges the State Department with the  responsibility for this important report--and let's call it naming and  shaming; that is basically what is intended here--gives the United  States another tool to seek justice for Holocaust survivors, to seek  justice for the families of Holocaust victims. And it is our hope that  passing this bill will motivate improvements even before the report is  penned. Already we have seen some of these countries overseas renew  their engagement on this issue, and that is the leverage that we want  to deploy.   It is a devastating issue to even begin a discussion because we can  never compensate Holocaust survivors truly for the unbelievable horror  and devastation that they suffered. But from the perspective of most of  the organizations that have talked to us about the bill, their point  would be: We can try. We can try to restore what is rightfully theirs.  And part of the trying, from their standpoint, is to shed light on the  efforts, or lack thereof, that other countries are making. And this  bill does that. It unanimously passed the Senate for that reason.   Mr. Speaker, I thank all the Members here who participated today in  the debate over this very difficult issue, and I yield back the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 4744) to impose additional sanctions with respect  to serious human rights abuses of the Government of Iran, and for other  purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4744         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,  [[Page H3465]]            SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Iran Human Rights and       Hostage-Taking Accountability Act''.       SEC. 2. UNITED STATES POLICY ON HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS BY                     THE GOVERNMENT OF IRAN.         (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:        (1) Iran is a member of the United Nations, voted for the       Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and is a signatory to       the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,       among other international human rights treaties.        (2) In violation of these and other international       obligations, Iranian regime officials continue to violate the       fundamental human rights of the Iranian people.        (3) The Iranian regime persecutes ethnic and religious       minority groups, such as the Baha'is, Christians, Sufi,       Sunni, and dissenting Shi'a Muslims (such as imprisoned       Ayatollah Hossein Kazemeyni Boroujerdi), through harassment,       arrests, and imprisonment, during which detainees have       routinely been beaten, tortured, and killed.        (4) Following voting irregularities that resulted in the       2009 election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, the Iranian       regime brutally suppressed peaceful political dissent from       wide segments of civil society during the Green Revolution in       a cynical attempt to retain its undemocratic grip on power.        (5) Since February 2011 the leaders of Iran's Green       Movement, former Prime Minister Mir Hossein Mousavi, his wife       Dr. Zahra Rahnavard, and former Speaker of the Majles       (parliament) Mehdi Karroubi, have lived under strict house       arrest, ordered by Iran's Supreme National Security Council.        (6) In 1999 the Iranian regime brutally suppressed a       student revolt that was one of the largest mass uprisings up       until that point in the country since 1979.        (7) Over a 4-month period in 1988, the Iranian regime       carried out the barbaric mass executions of thousands of       political prisoners by hanging and firing squad for refusing       to renounce their political affiliations and in some cases       for possessing political reading material, including       prisoners of conscience, teenagers, and pregnant women. In a       recently disclosed audiotape, the late Hussein Ali Montazeri,       a grand ayatollah who served as former Supreme leader       Khomeini's chief deputy, said that the 1988 mass killings       were ``the greatest crime committed during the Islamic       Republic, for which history will condemn us''.        (8) Senior governmental, military, and public security       officials in Iran have continued ordering, controlling, and       committing egregious human rights violations that, in many       cases, represent official policies of the Iranian regime.        (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress       that the United States should--        (1) deny the Government of Iran the ability to continue to       oppress the people of Iran and to use violence and executions       to silence pro-democracy protestors;        (2) work with international partners to investigate human       rights violations by senior officials of the Government of       Iran, regardless of where or when such violations took place;        (3) support efforts made by the people of Iran to promote       the establishment of basic freedoms that build the foundation       for the emergence of a freely elected, open, non-corrupt and       democratic political system;        (4) condemn Iranian human rights abuses against dissidents,       including the massacre in 1988 and the suppression of       political demonstrations in 1999, 2009, and 2017, and       pressure the Government of Iran to provide family members       detailed information that they were denied about the final       resting places of any missing victims of such abuses; and        (5) help the people of Iran produce, access, and share       information freely and safely via the internet and other       media.        (c) Statement of Policy.--It shall be the policy of the       United States to stand with the people of Iran who seek the       opportunity to freely elect a government of their choosing,       and increase the utilization of all available authorities to       impose sanctions on officials of the Government of Iran and       other individuals responsible for serious human rights       abuses.       SEC. 3. DETERMINATIONS WITH RESPECT TO IMPOSITION OF                     SANCTIONS ON CERTAIN PERSONS RESPONSIBLE FOR OR                     COMPLICIT IN HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES, ENGAGING IN                     CENSORSHIP, ENGAGING IN THE DIVERSION OF GOODS                     INTENDED FOR THE PEOPLE OF IRAN, OR ENGAGING IN                     CORRUPTION.         (a) In General.--Not later than 270 days after the date of       the enactment of this Act, the President shall submit to the       appropriate congressional committees a report containing a       determination of whether any senior officials of the       Government of Iran or other Iranian persons meet the criteria       described in--        (1) subsection (b) of section 105D of the Comprehensive       Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010,       as added by section 5 of this Act; or        (2) paragraph (3) or (4) of section 1263(a) of the National       Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 (Public Law       114-328; 22 U.S.C. 2656 note).        (b) Review of Certain Entities.--The report required under       subsection (a) shall contain a review of any activities of       cooperative foundations or bonyads in Iran with a       capitalization that exceeds $200,000,000 and that meet the       criteria in paragraph (3) or (4) of section 1263(a) of the       National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017       (Public Law 114-328; 22 U.S.C. 2656 note) for purposes of       corruption.

(d) Definition.--In this section, the term ``appropriate       congressional committees'' means--        (1) the Committee on Financial Services and the Committee       on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives; and        (2) the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs       and the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate.       SEC. 4. UNITED STATES POLICY ON HOSTAGE-TAKING BY THE                     GOVERNMENT OF IRAN.         (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:        (1) Since 1979 the Iranian regime has engaged in various       destabilizing activities that undermine the national security       of the United States and its allies and partners.        (2) These activities include the hostage-taking or       prolonged arbitrary detentions of United States citizens and       other persons with connections to Canada, the United Kingdom,       France, and other nations allied with the United States.        (3) The Iranian regime has detained on fabricated claims a       significant number of United States citizens, including       Siamak and Baquer Namazi and Xiyue Wang, as well as United       States legal permanent resident, Nizar Zakka, in violation of       international legal norms.        (4) The Iranian regime has not provided information on the       whereabouts of or assistance in ensuring the prompt and safe       return of Robert Levinson, despite repeated promises to do       so, after he was kidnapped while visiting Iran's Kish Island       on March 9, 2007--making him the longest held hostage in       United States history.        (5) The Iranian regime reportedly uses hostages as leverage       against foreign investors to exact business concessions in       foreign investment deals.        (6) The type of hostage-taking enterprise put in place by       the Iranian regime is a crime against humanity and a       violation of customary international law.        (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress       that--        (1) the Administration should fully utilize all necessary       and appropriate measures to prevent the Iranian regime from       engaging in hostage-taking or the prolonged arbitrary       detention of United States citizens or legal permanent       resident aliens, to include--        (A) the use of extradition to try and convict those       individuals responsible for ordering or controlling the       hostage-taking or arbitrary detention of United States       citizens; and        (B) the use of the Department of Homeland Security's Human       Rights Violators and War Crimes Center to target such       individuals; and        (2) the United States should encourage its allies and other       affected countries to pursue the criminal prosecution and       extradition of state and non-state actors in Iran that assist       in or benefit from such hostage-taking to prevent such state       and non-state actors from engaging in this practice in the       future.        (c) Statement of Policy.--It is the policy of the United       States Government not to pay ransom for the purpose of       securing the release of United States citizens or legal       permanent resident aliens taken hostage abroad.        (d) Strategy.--Not later than 120 days after the date of       the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State shall       submit to the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of       Representatives and the Committee on Foreign Relations of the       Senate a report that contains a strategy to prevent elements       of the Iranian regime from engaging in hostage-taking or the       prolonged arbitrary detention of United States citizens or       legal permanent resident aliens.       SEC. 5. IMPOSITION OF SANCTIONS WITH RESPECT TO IRANIAN                     PERSONS WHO ENGAGE IN CERTAIN ACTIONS AGAINST                     UNITED STATES CITIZENS OR IRANIAN PERSONS.         (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that       the United States should coordinate with United States allies       and other allies and partners whose citizens may be subject       to politically-motivated detention or trial in Iran, to apply       sanctions against Iranian persons that are responsible for or       complicit in, or responsible for ordering, controlling, or       otherwise directing, such detention or trial.        (b) In General.--Title I of the Comprehensive Iran       Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010 is       amended by inserting after section 105C (22 U.S.C. 8514c) the       following:       ``SEC. 105D.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and to include any extraneous material on H.R. 4744, currently  under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, in January this body came together. It was a near  unanimous vote to support the Iranian people, who were engaged in  legitimate protests against a very oppressive regime. I want to thank  Mr. Mike McCaul here, chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security,  and Mr. Eliot Engel, the ranking member of our Committee on Foreign  Affairs, for their engagement in this issue.   At the time, we were witnessing tens of thousands of Iranians who had  taken to the streets in the largest demonstration that we had seen  since the Green Revolution of 2009. The protests, aimed at economic  stagnation, aimed at widespread corruption--and people were talking  about that all the time--aimed at the Revolutionary Guard Corps'  control over that economy because they had nationalized, seized, so  much of that economy. And quickly we saw that spread across Iran, as  Persians sought to exercise the fundamental right of freedom of  expression, as people across that country, of every ethnicity and every  religion, began to speak out.   Many demonstrators shouted slogans aimed at Iran's costly support for  Syria's Bashar al-Assad, if you recall, from reading the press  accounts. And they attacked, they argued about the cost, the support  that went to the terrorist groups such as Hezbollah. Predictably, the  Iranian regime moved swiftly to quash the demonstrations and throttle  social media.   More than 1,000 Iranians were jailed, dozens were killed. H. Res. 676  condemned this brutal violence back in January, called for targeted  sanctions to hold the regime to account. But today we act to make good  on that call, because the bill before us today, Chairman McCaul's H.R.  4744, requires the administration to determine whether senior Iranian  officials should be sanctioned for human rights abuses. And it also  requires determinations on whether Iranian businesses should be  sanctioned for public corruption with respect to those who are involved  in corruption. And it mandates sanctions on those officials responsible  for Iran's wrongful, politically motivated jailing of U.S. citizens.   Mr. Speaker, for years the regime in Tehran has systematically beat  down all opposition inside Iran. It regularly uses brutal tactics back  in Iran, including torture and mass executions, as it seeks to export  violence and radical ideology abroad as well. I think all of us can  think back to that 1979 revolution and contemplate how much better Iran  would have been had it not went off onto a path of becoming a rogue  state.   As this legislation details, today the regime flagrantly disregards  commitments it has made to respect the fundamental rights of the  Iranian people. Many of us recall the barbaric mass executions carried  out over a 4-month period in 1988. And I dare say, if you know any  Persians, if you know people who escaped from Iran, you know that,  during that period of time leading up to 1988, there were over 30,000  students and young professionals who lost their lives as a consequence.   We know that the political prisoners there went through a grueling  experience, in Evin Prison and other prisons. Many were executed by  hanging, many by firing squad. They refused to renounce their political  affiliations, and that was the fate that was handed out to them.  [[Page H3467]]    And today the regime still persecutes ethnic and religious minority  groups; such as, the Baha'i; Christians, of course; Sufi; Sunni;  dissenting Shia Muslims. And we all remember the way the ayatollah  brutally suppressed the peaceful political dissent during the Green  Revolution, during which the previous administration remained  embarrassingly silent, in my view. And many of us here on this floor  today spoke up often at that time about that dissent during the Green  Revolution, because I think this was a real opportunity missed by the  United States.   So again, Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman McCaul and I want to  thank Ranking Member Engel for their leadership on this legislation. I  am glad we have strong bipartisan support for this measure. Regardless  of how one views the Iran nuclear agreement, it is critical that the  United States and our allies continue to press Iran for its dangerous  and threatening acts that fall outside of the JCPOA.   This is an area where officials from both the Trump and Obama  administrations agree, and they agree for good reason here. Remember,  this is the same regime that is holding American citizens, including  one who is in very poor health, on sham charges in one of the largest  ransom schemes, from my standpoint, that was ever devised.   This regime, of course, held its first American hostages in 1979,  when it overran our U.S. Embassy. The regime's MO remains the same. It  is far past time the regime faced consequences for its attacks on  Iranians and Americans alike.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                           House of Representatives,                                     Committee on Ways and Means,                                     Washington, DC, April 13, 2018.      Hon. Edward R. Royce,      Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Royce: I am writing with respect to H.R.       4744, the ``Iran Human Rights and Hostage-Taking       Accountability Act,'' on which Ways and Means was granted an       additional referral.        As a result of your having consulted with us on provisions       in H.R. 4744 that fall within the Rule X jurisdiction of the       Committee on Ways and Means, I agree to waive formal       consideration of this bill so that it may move expeditiously       to the floor. The Committee on Ways and Means takes this       action with the mutual understanding that we do not waive any       jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in this or       similar legislation, and the Committee will be appropriately       consulted and involved as the bill or similar legislation       moves forward so that we may address any remaining issues       that fall within our jurisdiction. The Committee also       reserves the right to seek appointment of an appropriate       number of conferees to any House-Senate conference involving       this or similar legislation, and requests your support for       such request.        Finally, I would appreciate your response to this letter       confirming this understanding, and would ask that a copy of       our exchange of letters on this matter be included in the       Congressional Record during floor consideration of H.R. 4744.            Sincerely,                                                       Kevin Brady,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                    Committee on Foreign Affairs,                                     Washington, DC, April 13, 2018.

Dear Chairman Brady: Thank you for consulting with the       Foreign Affairs Committee and agreeing to be discharged from       further consideration of H.R. 4744, the Iran Human Rights and       Hostage-Taking Accountability Act, so that the bill may       proceed expeditiously to the House floor.        I agree that your forgoing further action on this measure       does not in any way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of       your committee, or prejudice its jurisdictional prerogatives       on this measure or similar legislation in the future. I would       support your effort to seek appointment of an appropriate       number of conferees from your committee to any House-Senate       conference on this legislation.        I will seek to place our letters on H.R. 4744 into the       Congressional Record during floor consideration of the bill.       I appreciate your cooperation regarding this legislation and       look forward to continuing to work together as this measure       moves through the legislative process.

Dear Chairman Royce: I write with respect to H.R. 4744, the       ``Iran Human Rights and Hostage-Taking Accountability Act.''       As a result of your having consulted with us on provisions       within H.R. 4744 that fall within the Rule X jurisdiction of       the Committee on the Judiciary, I forego any further       consideration of this bill so that it may proceed       expeditiously to the House floor for consideration.

Hon. Bob Goodlatte,      Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Goodlatte: Thank you for consulting with the       Foreign Affairs Committee and agreeing to be discharged from       further consideration of H.R. 4744, the Iran Human Rights and       Hostage-Taking Accountability Act, so that the bill may       proceed expeditiously to the House floor.

[[Page H3468]]         I will seek to place our letters on H.R. 4744 into the       Congressional Record during floor consideration of the bill.       I appreciate your cooperation regarding this legislation and       look forward to continuing to work together as this measure       moves through the legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                   Edward R. Royce,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. McCaul), chairman of the Committee on  Homeland Security and the author of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen), who chairs the Foreign  Affairs Subcommittee on the Middle East and North Africa.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        April 24, 2018, on page H3469, the following appeared:  Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Poe), chairman of the Foreign Affairs  Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade.  [[Page H3470]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   In closing, I would again like to thank my colleagues, Chairman  McCaul and Ranking Member Engel, for their bipartisan leadership to  hold Iran accountable, to hold them accountable for their brutality:  their brutality in the 1988 massacres, and their brutality in terms of  the way they are treating their religious minorities today.   We know that Americans formerly imprisoned by Iran describe being  subjected to electric shock and whippings. We have heard that before  our committee. We have heard them say that they were denied medical  care.   Today, U.S. citizens, such as Siamak and Baqer Namazi, Xiyue Wang,  and U.S. permanent resident Nazar Zaka, are all sitting in Iranian  jails on bogus accusations of collaborating with a hostile government  for espionage. And U.S. citizen Robert Levinson is still missing, and  that is more than 10 years after he disappeared in Iran. Our hearts go  out to these victims and our hearts go out to their families as we  renew our call for the immediate release of all U.S. citizens and  permanent residents held in Iran.   With this legislation, we will impose tough sanctions on the regime.  And we do that for its corruption, for its attacks on innocent  Americans, and for its attacks on Iranians alike.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 4681) to limit assistance for areas of Syria  controlled by the Government of Syria or associated forces, and for  other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4681         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,  [[Page H3471]]            SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``No Assistance for Assad       Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress makes the following findings:        (1) Seven years into the conflict in Syria, over 11 million       Syrians have been displaced from their homes and more than       400,000 have been killed.        (2) Since the conflict in Syria began, the United States       has provided more than $7.6 billion to meet humanitarian       needs of the Syrian people, making the United States the       world's single largest donor to the Syrian humanitarian       response.        (3) It is estimated that the reconstruction of Syria could       cost between $200 and $350 billion.        (4) According to the 2016 Transparency International       Corruption Index, Syria is among the most corrupt countries       in the world.        (5) In October 2015, a visiting Russian delegation to Syria       announced that Russian firms would lead in the effort to       rebuild Syria, and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad       reportedly said, ``Syria is ready to provide Russian       companies with all the contracts worth hundreds of billions       of dollars.''.        (6) In August 2017, the Government of the People's Republic       of China hosted a trade fair in Syria, and a Chinese-Arab       business group announced a $2,000,000,000 commitment from the       Chinese government to fund the construction of industrial       parks in Syria.       SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.         It is the policy of the United States that United States       foreign assistance made available for early recovery,       reconstruction, or stabilization in Syria should be used only       in a democratic Syria or in areas of Syria not controlled by       a government led by Bashar al-Assad or associated forces.       SEC. 4. LIMITATION ON ASSISTANCE FOR AREAS OF SYRIA                     CONTROLLED BY THE GOVERNMENT OF SYRIA OR                     ASSOCIATED FORCES.

(c) Definitions.--In this section, the term ``appropriate       congressional committees'' and ``associated forces'' have the       meanings given such terms in section 4(f).     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and to include extraneous material in the Record.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this bill comes at a very critical time. After 7 years  of devastating civil war, the destruction inflicted on the Syrian  people by the Assad regime and its allies is catastrophic. By  catastrophic, we mean a half million dead and we mean 14 million souls  pushed out of their homes in that civil war.   Even now, Iranian-backed militias are engaged in sectarian cleansing.  Ethnic cleansing was supposed to be something of the past. They are  forcing people from their homes, and Russian warplanes continue to drop  bombs on hospitals. Just 2 weeks ago, the regime again used chemical  weapons outside of Damascus as part of an operation that has displaced  55,000 people in this latest operation.   Mr. Speaker, I want to commend the ranking member of our committee,  Mr. Eliot Engel, because during this period of time--and we have  assisted in this effort--but during this period of time, he has tried  to lead in getting a solution to the problem of that civil unrest in  Syria, which began with people on the streets in Damascus marching,  saying: ``Peaceful, peaceful.'' From day one, he has led an effort to  try to focus us on trying to resolve this crisis.   Unfortunately, as the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum noted in a  recent report, the situation on the ground is getting even worse in  Syria, and the worst, they say, is probably yet to come.   At the same time as this carnage is going on, representatives of  Syria, Iran, and Russia have spread out across the international  community trying to gin up reconstruction money. They will not find it  here.   It would be unconscionable for U.S. Government function to be used  for stabilization or reconstruction in the areas under control of the  illegitimate Assad regime and its proxies, and I will tell you why:  because the people in those areas that they have taken over are being  pushed out. And the militia that are being brought in are militia-- whether it is Hezbollah or other militia--that are not indigenous to  those communities. We are not going to support the building of  infrastructure that is going to benefit Hezbollah, Iran's revolutionary  guards, or foreign militias recruited and paid for by the Iranian  regime.   If or when the day comes that the Government of Syria is no longer  led by Bashar al-Assad and his proxies, then the U.S. can once again  look at the prospect for assistance, if the day comes when people are  allowed to return to their homes. We do have an interest in seeing a  stable and secure--and not hostile--Syria one day.   But until then, murder, industrial level torture, starvation,  deliberate targeting of schools, hospitals, and markets, and the  shameless use of chemical weapons cannot be in the remotest way  possible supported by U.S. funding.   Mr. Speaker, I ask that Members join with us to ensure no U.S.  funding makes it into the hands of the Assad regime and his proxies.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                           House of Representatives,                                 Committee on Financial Services,                                     Washington, DC, April 16, 2018.      Hon. Ed Royce,      Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Royce: I am writing concerning H.R. 4681, the       No Assistance for Assad Act.        As a result of your having consulted with the Committee on       Financial Services concerning provisions in the bill that       fall within our Rule X jurisdiction, I agree to forgo action       on the bill so that it may proceed expeditiously to the House       Floor. The Committee on Financial Services takes this action       with our mutual understanding that, by foregoing       consideration of H.R. 4681, at this time, we do not waive any       jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in this or       similar legislation, and that our Committee will be       appropriately consulted and involved as this or similar       legislation moves forward so that we may address any       remaining issues that fall within our Rule X jurisdiction.       Our Committee also reserves the right to seek appointment of       an appropriate number of conferees to any House-Senate       conference involving this or similar legislation, and       requests your support for any such request.        Finally, I would appreciate your response to this letter       confirming this understanding with respect to H.R. 4681 and       would ask that a copy of our exchange of letters on this       matter be included in the Congressional Record during floor       consideration thereof.            Sincerely,                                                    Jeb Hensarling,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                    Committee on Foreign Affairs,                                     Washington, DC, April 17, 2018.      Hon. Jeb Hensarling,      Chairman, Committee on Financial Services,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Hensarling: Thank you for consulting with the       Foreign Affairs Committee and agreeing to be discharged from       further consideration of H.R. 4681, the No Assistance for       Assad Act, so that the bill may proceed expeditiously to the       House floor.        I agree that your forgoing further action on this measure       does not in any way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of       your committee, or prejudice its jurisdictional prerogatives       on this resolution or similar legislation in the future. I       would support your effort to seek appointment of an       appropriate number of conferees from your committee to any       House-Senate conference on this legislation.        I will seek to place our letters on H.R. 4681 into the       Congressional Record during floor consideration of the bill.       I appreciate your cooperation regarding this legislation and       look forward to continuing to work together as this measure       moves through the legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                   Edward R. Royce,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Kinzinger), the primary Republican  cosponsor of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Poe), the chairman of the Committee on  Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   In closing, I would like to thank Ranking Member Engel and  Representative Kinzinger for their exceptional work on this important  bill. This bill will keep taxpayer dollars out of the hands of a  murderous regime and its proxies.   Time and again, Mr. Eliot Engel has been this body's conscience on  the issue of Syria. We have acted many times, passing the Caesar Syria  Civilian Protection Act twice; adopting H. Con. Res. 121, which  expressed the sense of the Congress supporting the establishment of a  tribunal in Syria to try Assad's war crimes, another measure we had  passed.   While we have made important progress in the military campaign  against ISIS, there is no end in sight to the misery inflicted on the  people of Syria by Assad and his proxies. Now is not the time to turn  away. As we engage, we cannot allow U.S. taxpayer money to reward war  crimes.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  agree to the concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 111) recognizing and  supporting the efforts of the United Bid Committee to bring the 2026  Federation Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) World Cup  competition to Canada, Mexico, and the United States, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the concurrent resolution.   The text of the concurrent resolution is as follows:                              H. Con. Res. 111         Whereas soccer is one of the fastest growing and most       popular sports in the world and the FIFA World Cup       competition is the single most important event in that sport;        Whereas the United States successfully hosted in 9 cities       throughout the Nation the 1994 FIFA World Cup competition,       which was broadcast to billions of fans around the world and       set an attendance record of nearly 3,600,000, which remains       unbroken today;        Whereas the 1994 FIFA World Cup competition served as a       catalyst for the increased popularity and development of the       game throughout the United States, as well as the       introduction of Major League Soccer, the United States       national first division professional soccer league;        Whereas United States Soccer Federation and its       counterparts in Canada and Mexico have established a United       Bid Committee to prepare and submit an unprecedented joint       bid to host the 2026 FIFA World Cup competition in North       America;        Whereas Canada, the United States, and Mexico share core       beliefs in justice, freedom, equality, and opportunity, and       have a long history of partnership, innovation, and growth       together on our shared continent;        Whereas for the first time in history the 2026 FIFA World       Cup will include teams from 48 nations and presents an       opportunity for Canada, Mexico, and the United States as host       countries to demonstrate the highest achievable standards and       serve as a benchmark for future organizers;        Whereas North America is home to one of the most       competitive and advanced professional sports landscapes in       the world that is continually updating to take advantage of       the latest innovations and modernizations;        Whereas numerous American cities have been named by the       United Bid Committee as candidates to serve as hosts to FIFA       World Cup matches in 2026, with each of these cities       embodying the diversity and enthusiasm shared by the entire       Nation and guaranteeing each participating team and its       followers a ``home team'' atmosphere;        Whereas the United States and its neighbors offer FIFA a       valuable and receptive market within which to further develop       the sport of soccer, which in turn will have significant       impact on and off the field in both the United States and       throughout the world;        Whereas the United States possesses all necessary state-of-      the-art infrastructure in its stadiums and potential host       cities to ensure that the competition sets a new standard of       quality, comfort, security, and safety for players,       officials, spectators, media, and sponsors alike;        Whereas hosting the 2026 FIFA World Cup in Canada, Mexico,       and the United States promises record-setting attendance and       financial performance, allowing revenues and tourism       generated by the competition to be used for the further       development of soccer, FIFA's objectives of positive social       and environmental change, and further economic growth       throughout our Nation;        Whereas hosting the 2026 FIFA World Cup competition in       Canada, Mexico, and the United States would serve as a       tremendous impetus to national and international goodwill, as       the competition would bring people from many nations, along       with a diverse public, together under one banner of peace,       friendship, and spirited and fair competition;        Whereas the historical tradition of inclusivity in the       United States is shared by Canada and Mexico and the three       countries are eager to welcome the players, spectators, and       visitors who may travel to North America for the 2026 FIFA       World Cup games; and        Whereas pursuant to FIFA bidding procedures, the President       of the United States and certain Federal agencies have been       asked to issue guarantees that upon authorization or       appropriation, would establish the conditions required to       help make the 2026 FIFA World Cup competition the most       successful in history: Now, therefore, be it        Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate       concurring), That the Congress--        (1) recognizes and supports the efforts of the United Bid       Committee to bring the 2026 FIFA World Cup competition to       Canada, Mexico, and the United States;        (2) encourages the President of the United States and       appropriate Federal agencies to support the United Bid       Committee in its efforts to meet all requirements for the       United States to jointly host with Canada and Mexico the 2026       FIFA World Cup competition; and        (3) stands prepared to give full consideration to       legislative proposals or other requests by the President to       provide support related to the 2026 FIFA World Cup       competition, if Canada, Mexico, and the United States are       selected to host this event.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and to include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Illinois (Mr.  LaHood).  [[Page H3475]]  I thank him for introducing a resolution which expresses the broad  bipartisan agreement that the United States supports the United Bid  Committee's effort to jointly host the 2026 FIFA World Cup competition.   Soccer is one of the most popular sports in the world, and the World  Cup is its most important competition. Hosting the tournament would be  a win for the United States and for our neighbors in Canada and Mexico  as well.   The United States has not hosted a FIFA World Cup since 1994, but 24  years later, we still hold the all-time attendance record. Over 3\1/2\  million people attended those matches. I remember. I was there in the  stands for the games in L.A. The economic revenue generated by the 1994  tournament generated more than double what was expected.   The 2026 tournament is expected to break revenue and attendance  records. FIFA has already announced that it will be the first time in  tournament history that 48 teams, instead of 32, are going to compete  in the World Cup. The addition of more teams will mean more economic  opportunities for American cities such as Los Angeles and San Francisco  to host and entertain visitors from around the country and around the  world.   The FIFA World Cup, much like the Olympics, has a long tradition of  bringing countries together in a competitive but peaceful environment.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the  gentleman from Illinois (Mr. LaHood), the author of this resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   In closing, I would like to, once again, thank the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. LaHood), and I also thank the 40 cosponsors who have been  pushing this important, bipartisan resolution. By passing this  resolution, we show our support for the efforts of the United Bid  Committee to bring the excitement of the World Cup tournament to the  United States once again, for the first time since 1994.   Mr. Speaker, I urge unanimous support for this measure, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
