 Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Chairman, H.R. 8 is brought to us by the same groups and  politicians who have made no secret of their desire to ultimately strip  law-abiding citizens of their right to defend themselves. Now, they  can't do that outright; they know that. So they do it through cynical  measures like this, which weave a web of laws so intricate, that,  sooner or later, everyone can be caught up in them.   This law affects not just transfer of ownership, but any transfer of  weapon for any period of time. Suppose you exchange shotguns with a  friend on a hunt and then separate for a period of time, or you loan a  gun to your next-door neighbor of 20 years who is being victimized by a  stalker, or you give a gun to your stepson or your great-grandson.  Under any of these innocent scenarios and countless more like them, you  are guilty of a Federal crime.   These flaws were all pointed out to the bill's sponsors, and none  were addressed. Why not? I think the reason should be obvious.   Last October, a 10-year study by Johns Hopkins and UC Davis concluded  that California's universal background check law had no effect on gun  homicides or suicides--none.   The purpose of this bill is not public safety. That is just a  deceptive facade. Its true purpose is to make gun ownership so legally  hazardous, so fraught with legal booby traps and draconian penalties,  that no honest and law-abiding citizen would want to take the risk of  gun ownership.   Most criminals already get their guns illegally and are unconstrained  by laws like this. Make no mistake, this is aimed squarely at law- abiding citizens, moving us closer to a society where decent people are  defenseless and armed criminals are kings.
