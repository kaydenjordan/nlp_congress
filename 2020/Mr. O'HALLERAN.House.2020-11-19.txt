 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of National Rural  Health Day.   I am proud to represent Arizona's First Congressional District. Our  district is larger than the State of Illinois, and it is one of the  most rural in the country.   Many of my constituents must spend hours traveling hundreds of miles  to access any kind of care, let alone specialist care.   This year, the COVID-19 pandemic has hit our rural communities  especially hard.   In March, we passed the CARES Act: Sweeping legislation to address  the coronavirus pandemic and provide relief to struggling healthcare  facilities workers, families, small businesses, and Tribes.   Within this package, we pushed to include $8 billion in funding  specifically for our rural Tribal Nations. We also secured over $1  billion to support the Indian Health Service in Tribal health systems.   The CARES Act included $200 million for new rural telehealth services  and $3.1 billion in funding for community health centers.   But this is not enough. We need to pass a new, comprehensive COVID-19  package now.                              A Talk About Life     Mr. Speaker, I want to divert for a second from what  I have written here and talk about life.   When I became a police officer a while back, I did it because I  wanted to save lives. And right now, our doctors and our nurses across  this country are doing that with limited help and with the need for  more supplies.   So our businesses are struggling.   But when I would go to a door and knock on that door when I was a  homicide investigator and tell someone's loved one that their son or  daughter had died suddenly through violence, it was one of the harshest  things I had to do in life, and I had to do it way too many times.   And now I sit here almost 4 years and see a national emergency  declared, and month after month after month we have not made a decision  to help the American people again. Families are being broken up. We all  care about families. People are suffering because they have lost their  jobs. We care about that, I know, all of us.   I know that each and every one of us, if we had a family member that  was about to die, that we would want to be there by their side, but  also, we would do everything we could to save that life. And, yet, here  we sit as a body, and the Senate sits as a body, and the administration  is here, and month after month after month we have failed to address  these severe problems within our country.   Whatever Governors do, they do. That is because part of the issue is  that we haven't provided enough responsibility and direction.   But the other part of it is that we just haven't gotten our job done.  After 4 years I sit here and look out and know that 1,800 fellow  Americans died yesterday and a thousand more the day before and a  thousand more the day before that, and the amount of cases are going up  and spiraling. Thank God the healthcare industry has found some ways to  help our families.   But the vaccine is not around the corner. It is months away from  having any impact; months away. And people will still die; our fellow  Americans. We cannot allow this to happen.   We are going to be going on Thanksgiving break. Really? I couldn't  comprehend it when we left for the summer and our fellow Americans were  dying. I really can't comprehend going home for Thanksgiving and not  working as hard as I can before that to make sure that our American  families do not have to suffer anymore.   When I worked in the Chicago neighborhoods as a police officer,  people were suffering then without this going on. And now they are  suffering even worse.   This is something that I signed up for, to save lives as a police  officer, and to do that here as much as we can. And we should all be  going in that direction. I know you want to. I know we want to, but we  have to show it.   We can say to leadership, go leadership and negotiate. Us being here  is a way of making sure they and our country know that we care. We care  enough to not just go away week after week after week and not allow the  people of America to know their leaders are here for them.                            ____________________
