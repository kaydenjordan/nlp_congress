 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about school safety.  I present as a doctor, a healthcare professional, as a father, and as a  Representative that is open to new ideas from people who are really  attempting to do something to try to make our schools safer and better  for our children.   As a doctor, I see violence as a public health crisis which is  multifaceted, with different contributing factors to consider and with  preventive strategies to implement. That is why I want to share with  you what a couple of organizations in my district are doing in an  attempt to tackle some of the lesser explored potential factors  contributing to violence within our schools, among our students, and  growing in our society.   It begins with an organization called Screen Education. Screen  Education is a Cincinnati-based organization that seeks to understand,  scientifically, how technology and social media impacts kids.   Screen Education and EMI Research Solutions, which is an online  market research supplier, also from Cincinnati, partnered with Stark  Statistical Consulting of Albuquerque, New Mexico, to conduct a survey  of students. While their full analysis contains much insight, I would  like to share three statistics that I found particularly shocking:   Sixty-eight percent of students said they witnessed someone being  bullied online at least several times a year;   Thirty-one percent of students said they had seen online bullying  result in physical violence; and  [[Page H7168]]    When asked if they felt that using social media will contribute to  conditions that can result in school shootings, 73 percent of the  students said ``yes.''   Now, to be clear, I am not saying that social media is the sole cause  of shootings or suicides, but these statistics are statistics that  should shock everyone. Recent findings say revenge is a strong  motivation for school shootings and that among students, homicide  perpetrators were more than twice as likely as their victims to have  been bullied by peers.   These are more than just statistics. They are the reported  experiences of our Nation's children on a daily basis, both in and  outside of school. So this is an example of a problem that clearly  could and should be addressed and that our society surely has the means  to  deal with.    Some organizations are stepping up to do just that. Bully Bully is a  Cincinnati-based firm that was created out of a disconnect that the  founder noticed between widespread bullying in our schools and the  often reactive, largely ineffective ways of addressing that harassment.   Bully Bully is developing an anonymous reporting app that not only  allows students to provide information regarding antagonistic  situations, but also assists school administrators in analyzing and  addressing these incidents and supporting victims of harassment.   Bully Bully's stated goal is to never allow another incident of  intimidation or harassment lead to a school fatality or suicide. What  they are saying is: Here is a problem. It might be a factor in  violence, and I think we have the means to stop it. So here is a  solution. Let's try it.   In my experience, Mr. Speaker, there is rarely a simple solution to a  public health crisis. You need to try multiple solutions across  multiple fronts. Physical or verbal intimidation may be a facet of this  public health crisis that we haven't paid enough attention to but ought  to.   I am glad we have Americans like those in my Ohio district who are  willing to try and solve part of a large problem. Evidence has  suggested that students who get harassed by their peers tend to grow up  more socially anxious with less self-esteem and require more mental  health services. Hundreds of thousands of students skip school each day  out of fear and anxiety.   It may be a more pervasive problem than we think, actually. Recent  research by Screen Education on 12- to 16-year-olds at Camp Livingston  in Bennington, Indiana, found that students were largely happier by  being deprived of their smartphones. They were more engaged and  connected to one another as people when removed from the cyber world of  drama, gossip, and aggression.   Instead of being forced to react to student violence when tragically  necessary, perhaps we should focus on equipping the adult who spends  all day with these students with the means to support and guide them.   Let's keep looking for ways to make schools safer for our children  and maybe, just maybe, we can make the school experience better and  safer for our children as a result.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise to support the Long-Term Care  Veterans Choice Act, legislation that contains the text of my bill, the  VET OPP Act. The VET OPP Act continues our effort to invest in our  troops from the day they take their oath of service to when they begin  their civilian careers.   Part of our commitment to our men and women in uniform is helping  them reintegrate back into civilian life. We can ease this transition  by prioritizing programs that help them find meaningful employment or  educational opportunities when they return home.   For too long, the outdated structure of the VA has allowed economic  opportunity and transition programs for our veterans to fall by the  wayside. H.R. 5693 will change that. With the inclusion of the VET OPP  Act, it prioritizes veteran employment and education programs at the VA  by utilizing existing resources to place educational, employment, and  transition programs together in a fourth administration within the VA.  This will promote transparency and oversight, while placing greater  priority on opportunity-based programs within the VA.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 5693.
