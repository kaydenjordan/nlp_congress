 Madam Speaker, we cannot let America be like this.   Children shouldn't be texting their family good-bye as they lay  barricaded behind desks. Parents shouldn't dread having to drop a child  off at school, wondering if this is a death sentence. And a grandmother  shouldn't have to fear being murdered as she goes into a grocery store  to get dinner.   The U.S. is the only country in the world with more civilian-owned  firearms than people, and it is costing us our loved ones' lives.   Thoughts and prayers are not enough. They never were. We have to take  action. This is what we were sent to Congress to do, to act.   The bill before us today, H.R. 7910, the Protecting Our Kids Act,  will save lives. We can no longer act like we are powerless to stop  mass murders in our communities when it is clear there is so much we  can do.   Pass this bill. Enough is enough.
