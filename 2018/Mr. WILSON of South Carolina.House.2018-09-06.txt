 Mr. Speaker, next Tuesday is the tragic  17th anniversary of the terrorist attack by radical Islamic jihadists  who sought to destroy our freedoms on September the 11th, 2001.   The memories of the 3,000 innocent civilians who were killed at the  Pentagon, the World Trade Center, and in rural Shanksville,  Pennsylvania, will never be forgotten. We are reminded of the  incredible heroes of that day, the selfless commitment of so many first  responders helping their neighbors, coworkers, or complete strangers,  with the leadership of President George W. Bush.   Since that fateful day, our Armed Forces have courageously fought to  prevent another tragedy by eliminating safe havens overseas. These  servicemembers and their families who have paid the ultimate sacrifice  deserve our eternal gratitude.   Unfortunately, the global war on terrorism is generational, as  Islamic terrorists continue to barbarically murder civilians, killing  people of Islamic faith first, in their attempt to establish safe  havens to plot mass murder in America, as were the acts of 9/11. Today,  I am grateful that President Donald Trump is rebuilding the military to  protect American families.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________
