 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a pioneering  institution in the field of early childhood education located in my  district, Project Enlightenment.   Project Enlightenment provides extraordinary services to families and  children, and I was privileged to visit with them last week.   In the late 1960s, insightful staff from the Raleigh city schools,  Wake County Mental Health and Dorothea Dix Child Psychiatry recognized  that strengthening a child's social and emotional development in the  early years would have long-term benefits. They were right, and the  American Families Plan recognizes this fact.   Project Enlightenment has offered prevention and early intervention  services to young children by providing services to the primary  caregivers in their lives. Over the years, they have helped people all  over the State of North Carolina and all over the country.   I am grateful for the attentive staff that includes a variety of  professionals. Because of their commitment to our children, they truly  make our county and State a better place.                            ____________________
