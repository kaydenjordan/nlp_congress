 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to the  inflation expansion act.   It feels a little bit like Groundhog Day here on Capitol Hill because  it wasn't but about a year ago that we found ourselves debating almost  this very same legislation. It was a bad idea then; it is a bad idea  now. Even Bernie Sanders isn't buying this bill and has said that it  won't do much to reduce inflation.   The only difference here really is the price tag from a year ago-- $745 billion in new spending. That is not cheap. Do you know what we  could do with that?   You could give every single working mom in America a check for  $96,000.   You could give hardworking American seniors, who are, many of them,  [[Page H7655]]  now retired and having to go back to work, and they are on fixed  incomes, you could give them $14,000.   You could give every homeless veteran in America a check for $5.6  million with this bill.   Instead, we are going to double the size of the IRS and target  hardworking families who make $400,000 or less. We know it to be a  fact. Stop denying it. The Senate Democrats refused and rejected the  amendment that would have protected families making $400,000 or less.   Reject this bill. Put Americans first. It is time to vote hell no.
