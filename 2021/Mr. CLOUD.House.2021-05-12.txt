 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to wish a happy 100th birthday  to a well-loved member of the south Texas community, Captain Robert  Batterson, whose friends call him Bob.   Bob has spent his life in service to a Nation that he loves. He  served at Naval Air Station Pearl Harbor, where he worked on December  7, 1941. Shortly after witnessing the Pearl Harbor attack, Bob was  accepted for Navy flight training. He was awarded his wings and  assigned to Fighter Squadron 1.   Bob's life paints a picture of sacrifice and duty that we can all  learn from. May it serve as a reminder of the price that he and others  like him paid for our freedom.   After World War II, Bob did not stop his commitment to serving our  great Nation. He transferred to the Navy Supply Corps, where he worked  for 35 years until his retirement in 1974.   Bob raised five children, four of whom also served our Nation. And he  is one of the USS Lexington Museum's first volunteers and can often be  found in the aircraft carrier's Pearl Harbor exhibit.   Bob has a true passion for speaking with people of all ages about  becoming personally involved in the United States' future, especially  by contacting their elected Representatives.   Happy birthday to a true American hero and an inspiration to all of  us, Captain Batterson.                                time  1100             Congress Must Regularly Review Military Engagements     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak about a bill I am  introducing today. This bill is called the Preventing Endless Armed  Conflicts and Engagement Act, otherwise known as the PEACE Act.   The Constitution makes it clear that the authority to declare war  rests with Congress, and it is important that Members of Congress have  the opportunity to carry out our duty to regularly review current  military engagements. Unfortunately, that has not been the case.   Today, less than a fifth of the current Members of Congress voted on  the 2001 and 2002 Authorization for Use of Military Force. This  statistic ignores the many Members of Congress who have been elected  and since left who never got a chance to weigh in on the Authorization  for Use of Military Force.   It is critical that new Members of Congress with new constituencies  do their duty and provide input into military operations. It is my hope  that the PEACE Act can ensure regular oversight is being conducted on  future military authorizations.   First, this bill would require each military authorization, called an  AUMF, to sunset after 2 years. Now, why 2 years? Well, obviously, it  would give each Member of Congress and, therefore, the people they  represent the opportunity to review and weigh in on ongoing conflicts.   The President, of course, has the authority to deploy military forces  in an emergency and respond to imminent threats, and that would  continue under  [[Page H2206]]  this bill. Sustained military operations, however, need approval from  Congress. This is a principle firmly rooted in the Constitution, which  stipulates that funding for our military should not extend beyond 2  years.   The PEACE Act would also set the standards for new military  authorizations. For instance, each authorization would need to set a  geographical scope on where military force can be used. A clear  objective would need to be established for each authorization so that  we know when victory is achieved, and the countries and groups that the  U.S. is authorized to fight must be listed.   Additionally, the Departments of Defense and State would be charged  with publishing an annual report on existing military operations for  congressional review. This report will include information such as  whether the military is meeting defined objectives, the number of  casualties, and total costs.   Finally, the DOD and State Department will be required to brief  Members of Congress on the contents of this report every 6 months.   It is never easy to decide between risking the lives of our troops or  jeopardizing our national security. However, this is a decision that  Members of Congress are elected to do, in large part because we are the  body in this Federal Government that is closest to the people.   Military deployments that are accountable to we the people are one  thing that sets us apart as a nation to ensure that our fight is always  for what is right. We owe it to our troops. We owe it to the American  people.                            ____________________
