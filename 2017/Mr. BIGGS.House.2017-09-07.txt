 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 64, line 1, after the dollar amount, insert ``(reduced       by $10,234,000)''.        Page 141, line 4, after the dollar amount, insert       ``(increased by $10,234,000)''.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 504, the gentleman  from Arizona (Mr. Biggs) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.

Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, earlier this year President Donald Trump submitted his  budget request for fiscal year 2018 to Congress. The budget request  included a 20 percent reduction in funding for the Environmental  Protection Agency's Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance to  $419 million, $129 million below the fiscal year 2017 level.   The underlying bill cuts roughly 15 percent of the EPA's enforcement  budget, and my amendment would get us closer to meeting the President's  request by cutting an additional $10,234,000 from the EPA's programs  and management account enforcement line item.   Reducing the EPA's enforcement budget will help rein in inappropriate  bureaucratic actions. It is necessary to revive the American economy  and restore regulatory sanity to environmental regulations.   Make no mistake, Mr. Chairman, the American people cannot afford to  continue to be burdened by an out-of-control EPA that overregulates and  promulgates rules and then punishes the American by adjudicating  unconstitutional penalties.   Mr. Chairman, I urge all Members to vote ``yes'' on my amendment, and  I reserve the balance of my time.   Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Minnesota is recognized for 5  minutes.   Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chair, I can't support an amendment taking money  from an underfunded agency, reducing our bottom line, when it is  already $824 million below the FY17 enacted level. Let me give you two  examples of why I think the gentleman's amendment should not be  supported.   One is I have been talking to EPA officials because we have a  surprise toxic dump site that is as close to a residential area as I am  from the Chairman. Barrels. The owner just walked away. Too much for  the city of St. Paul to handle. Too toxic. Too dangerous.   The State of Minnesota, the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, had  to call in the EPA for help. It is costing us as taxpayers millions of  dollars to clean that up because the businessowner just walked away.  Nothing that the EPA can do but clean it up, and clean it up they are,  and the neighbors are ecstatic that the Federal Government is there to  help them.   The EPA, by taking more money away from it and putting it in the  spending reduction account at a time when I know that the EPA regions  all across this country are sending men and women down to help cities  and counties and communities out with the disaster that Harvey has  created, this is all money that is being spent right now in an agency  that is $824 million below 2017.   I think it is important that we protect the air that we breathe and  the water that we drink, and the consequences of further cuts to the  EPA, I believe, will be felt in communities like mine, like Houston,  like maybe what we will be hearing in Florida--we haven't had the  assessment yet in the Virgin Islands--all across this Nation. That, to  me, is just irresponsible.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Calvert).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Calvert).    Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining?   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Arizona has 3\3/4\ minutes  remaining.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   The EPA has no statutory duty to pursue or enforce regulation. My  home State of Arizona, along with the States west of the Mississippi,  are those who are most affected by the heavy hand of the enforcement  arm of the EPA.   In my community, dust is the number one particulate. The EPA's  response is to come to us in a desert and say: ``Water it down. Water  it down.'' Then they come after us because of misuse of water.   This is the inconsistency that we see in the EPA that is weighing  down the economy of many of the areas within the West.   The more I meet with local and national natural resource leaders,  their number one concern mostly deals with the EPA's burdensome  regulations and its enforcement proceedings. Further reducing the EPA's  enforcement budget will limit its ability to stifle the economy and  enforce unconstitutional rules.   I also want to emphasize the need to restore fiscal sanity in our  country. With the ever-growing national debt, my amendment will return  $10 million back to the United States Treasury.   I thank the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Smith) for partnering with  me on this effort, and to all Members who support our effort to restore  fiscal and regulatory sanity in our country.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chair, as I said earlier, this account has already  been cut by $240 million below the 2017 enacted level, another $108  million tonight on the floor, but at least those dollars were going  back into something, in my opinion, meaningful. This is just taking  money away from the EPA, which is underfunded, which is undersourced,  and being asked to do more for less at a time when, as I pointed out,  we don't even know until there is an opportunity for the waters to  subside what we are going to find at the Superfund sites from Harvey.   Mr. Chair, I oppose this amendment, and I yield back the balance of  my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Biggs).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes  appeared to have it.   Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.   The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further  proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Arizona will  be postponed.                    Amendment No. 30 Offered by Mr. Katko    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 30  printed in House Report 115-297.
