 Madam Speaker, the 1970 Clean Air Act was  passed by a Democratic-led Congress and a Republican President after  millions of Americans demanded change. Five decades later, a new  generation of Americans is calling on Congress to act on our Nation's  biggest challenges. The Inflation Reduction Act is not just a good  climate bill; it is also a major achievement.   To address the climate crisis, it makes a $369 billion investment  toward decarbonizing our Nation. The bill addresses environmental  justice. Everyone should benefit from a cleaner environment, especially  those who are vulnerable to disease because of where they live.   The bill finally helps Medicare negotiate a better deal on drug  prices. This provision will save lives and help seniors enjoy their  retirement without fear of poverty due to the cost of their  medications.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation,  which is vital to our Nation's future.
