 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, all week I have been speaking about the  impending deadline of tomorrow, the continuing resolution that we  passed following the shutdown of the government over the DACA issue,  and the importance of meeting that deadline. So you can imagine my  pleasure at hearing the announcement this afternoon by the majority  leader. His hard work leading to this critical funding negotiation has  now produced an agreement that both sides should be able to get behind.   One of the reasons these negotiations were so significant and why the  announcement today was such good news has to do with our military. I  happened to have been raised in a military family. My dad served 31  years in the U.S. Air Force and was a B-17 pilot in World War II in the  Army Air Corps. Those who have seen the old movies about the B-17, like  ``Memphis Belle'' and others, realize what treacherous service that was  during World War II.   He was shot down on his 26th mission over Mannheim, Germany, and was  captured as a prisoner of war for the last 4 months of World War II.  But, thank goodness, the U.S. Army and General Patton came through  Germany and liberated those POW camps at the end of World War II. My  dad came home, built a family, and finished his career after 31 years  in the military. So, as you might imagine, the men and women who serve  in our military are near and dear to my heart.   I recognize the importance of our support not only for the ones who  wear the uniform but also the families. Of course, having an all- volunteer military means we have to provide support not just for the  servicemembers but for the families as well. When our servicemembers  enlist, they sign a contract and, basically, hand their lives over to  us to be good stewards of their service and to be in a position of  trust.   To hold their budget hostage, which is what has happened until now,  is to ask them to assume even greater risk in order to satisfy certain  narrow political agendas. Given all that our men and women in uniform  do for us--to keep us safe, to keep the world at peace as much as  possible--it is not too much to call holding that funding hostage a  disgrace.   Our men and women in uniform can't afford to be hamstrung, especially  when we face new and evolving threats across the globe, but because of  our inability to produce longer term certainty, they were. That is,  until now.   The compromise we have reached will ensure both that our troops have  what they deserve--in terms of training, equipment, and readiness--and  that our country has what it needs in order to achieve ``peace through  strength'' across the globe.   Since the Budget Control Act of 2011, we have kept discretionary  spending, which includes defense spending, relatively flat.  Unfortunately, the threats have done nothing but proliferate and  increase, and we have seen a number of training accidents like the  Fitzgerald and the John McCain where, literally, according to General  Mattis, we have lost more servicemembers in accidents as a result of  inadequate training and readiness than we have in hostile activities.  That is just a shameful situation. Of course, now we have acted to  change it.   Yesterday, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis testified before the House  Armed Services Committee, and he wasted no time in telling us how  urgent the situation was becoming. He said that, without a proper  defense appropriations bill, the U.S. military lacks the most  ``fundamental congressional support.'' As Secretary Mattis stated, the  Trump administration's new national defense strategy requires  sustained, predictable appropriations in order to be carried out. I am  confident that we are heading toward that  [[Page S684]]  in light of this new agreement, but it took us an embarrassingly long  time to get here, and that is regrettable, to say the least.   I join the majority leader and our colleagues in strong support for  our men and women in uniform and their families during this week of  difficult and delicate negotiations, and I ask my other colleagues to  vote to support this bipartisan legislation, to show their support for  our military readiness, procurement, and testing--all of which are  required to keep our forces the best trained, the best equipped, and  the best prepared force on the planet.   When we vote on this agreement, we can't lose sight of other  critically important issues--issues that seem to fade from people's  memories; that is, something like disaster relief. I can't adequately  describe the outpouring of support we got from the President on down to  neighbors helping neighbors following Hurricane Harvey and its  devastating impact on my State. Certainly, our hearts are with the  people of the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, and Florida as they have  suffered from Hurricane Maria, as well as our friends and colleagues in  the West, who have suffered as a result of the devastation caused by  wildfires and mudslides and other hardships.   The House passed an $81 billion relief package at the end of last  year, and here we are; a couple of months later, we are actually acting  on this disaster relief package. It is long overdue. I am pleased,  though, to announce that the bill we will be voting on provides  significant funding for disaster relief efforts around the country, and  I applaud the House for taking the first step in December. I appreciate  Governor Abbott of Texas, as well as the Senate Appropriations  Committee, for working with us to help us strengthen the House bill.   My fellow Texans who were hit by Hurricane Harvey last August have  been waiting patiently, along with all the folks who faced the fury of  Mother Nature in Florida, California, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin  Islands. It simply has been unacceptable to see the delay in getting  the relief they need to them. Now we have the chance to stand up,  finally, in a bipartisan fashion and show not only that we remember  what they have been through but also that more help is on the way. That  is why I am urging all of my colleagues to support this agreement when  we take it up.                                Kari's Law Act    Mr. President, the last issue I wish to address is a bill that I  cosponsored called Kari's Law. Two days ago we passed it in the Senate,  and soon, I hope, the House will follow suit. It is imperative that we  get this bill to the desk of the President for his final signature soon  so that it can become law.   Kari's Law amends the Communications Act of 1934 to require multiline  telephone systems, common in places like hotels and offices, to be  equipped for emergency calls. Under the bill, the users of these phone  systems will have the ability to dial 911 without first having to dial  for an outside line.   Why is this important? Let me tell you briefly the story of Kari Hunt  Dunn of Marshall, TX. Kari was killed in her hotel room in Marshall,  TX, in 2013. Kari's then-9-year-old daughter was unable to reach  emergency personnel because she failed to dial 9 to get an outside  line. She tried four times but was unable to connect, which meant no  help ever came.   With this simple change in the default configuration of phone systems  in offices and hotels, we can help folks reach the help they need in a  crisis quickly, and we can save precious seconds that ultimately could  save precious lives.   I am grateful to my colleague, the senior Senator from Minnesota, for  working with us on this legislation, as well as my colleague  Representative Louie Gohmert, who carried the corresponding bill in the  House. I also want to thank Mr. Hank Hunt, Kari's father, for his hard  work in championing this bill and pushing so hard for this crucial  change to become law.   I yield the floor.
