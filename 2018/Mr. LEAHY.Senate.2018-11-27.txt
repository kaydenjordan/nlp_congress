 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, this Friday, November 30, at noon,  Vermonters will be gathering to see a large crane carefully hoist a  14\1/2\-foot carved statue of Ceres, the goddess of agriculture, atop  the newly gilded dome of the statehouse in Montpelier. I was born in  Montpelier, and I am proud of this because it is going to be a great  moment for our State and for everyone involved in the project, which  has captured the attention of not only Vermonters but of those who have  been following the project from great distances with the help of social  media.   The new version of Ceres replaces a 1938 replica of the original  statue that was removed last April after too many severe Vermont  winters took a toll on the wood figure. Since that time, Vermont  artists Jerry Williams and Chris Miller have been hard at work creating  the new Ceres, first sculpting a model and then, out of a big piece of  mahogany, they chiseled the final mahogany figure.   Marcelle and I and my sister Mary, along with David Schutz, had the  pleasure of visiting the Vermont Granite Museum in Barre, VT, a few  months back to witness Mr. Miller at work.   I am the grandson of two stone carvers. One of my grandfathers  immigrated to Vermont from Italy. The other, my Irish grandfather,  carved stone in Barre. So it was a thrill to see how Mr. Miller used  the original tools of the trade.   He took raw wood and turned it into the fine details we now see, from  Ceres' flowing robes to the distinctive veins in her hands. It was  really remarkable to see this hunk of wood turn into a real person.   Both artists learned their techniques by studying in the studios of  Barre's stone carvers. It is a specialized art that requires intense  dedication, patience, skill, and practice. We are so fortunate that  artists such as these have carried on a tradition that makes Vermonters  proud.   It reminds me of the times as a child when I would go in and watch  stone carvers at work in Barre, where my father was born, and watch  them turn stone into pieces of pure art.   In this case they are using wood. Incidentally, the reason the statue  is made out of wood instead of stone is that wood weighs less, and  there is only so much weight the dome can hold.   I grew up in a home across the street from the Vermont State House.  Ceres was always in our sights. Walking to school, coming back from  school, doing my paper route, and being out with my brother and sister  and my parents, we would always see Ceres. She is a strong figure, one  that befits a State where farming and soil and hard work are so closely  linked to our lives.   Frankly, over the past few months, when I have been home in Vermont,  going by the statehouse and seeing it without Ceres has been odd  because it has always been part of my life. So this Vermonter and  Vermonters like my wife Marcelle and others are going to be glad to  have her back.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this November 10 article  from the Barre, VT, Times Argus, profiling these two sculptors be  printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                   [From the Times Argus, Nov. 10, 2018]       For the Love of Carving: Jerry Williams and Chris Miller Earn                             Governor's Honors                               (By B. Amore)         Jerry Williams and Chris Miller are united in their love of       the ancient craft of carving. It is this common love that has       brought them together as a team in creating the 14.5-foot       statue of Ceres for the Vermont State House dome. This       project, and their separate accomplishments, have won them       the 2018 prestigious Governor's Award for Excellence in the       Arts, which will be presented by Gov. Phil Scott at the State       House Nov. 14.        Carving, a reductive process that was once part of every       classical sculptor's training, has now become the purview of       a discrete selection of artists in the United States. Barre,       of course, is a mecca of stone carving, primarily in granite.       Its community of skilled carvers who work in the monument       trade, as well as executing large public art sculptures and       making their own personal work, is a unique resource.        The native stone of the surrounding region, and the culture       of carved sculpture, drew both Williams and Miller, albeit by       different paths. Williams talks of attending the art program       at Johnson State College and being the only one interested in       learning clay sculpture. It was at a time when conceptual       work and mixed media held sway in the art world, but he was       interested in learning the basics of sculpture. In order to       learn ``real'' sculpture at the source, he set up an       internship with Frank Gaylord, who trained a generation of       Barre sculptors. That internship turned into a job and a life       in granite.        Eventually, Williams founded his own shop, the Barre       Sculpture Studio. He talks of belonging to a ``lineage'' in       the sense of the classical studio system that exists in       Carrara, Italy, and that was brought to Barre and to the       Vermont Marble Company in Proctor in the 19th century.        Generally, a well-known sculptor would create a model and       the expert carvers in the sculpture studios would then       execute it. ``Youth Triumphant,'' a Barre monument depicting       a young warrior pleading for world peace, was carved by Gino       Enrico Tosi, Enrico Mori and John Delmonte from a model       created by famous New York sculptor C. Paul Jennewein.       Williams is one of the few sculptors in Barre who creates his       own model for a commission and then sees it through to       execution in his studio.        Miller began woodcarving independently in 1976 while       studying art at Southern Connecticut State University and       Southern Vermont College in Bennington. Although he is       largely self-taught, he worked with the sculptors Lothar       Werslin and Billy Brauer of Vermont to hone his skills in       drawing, sculpture, and anatomy. For his first 25 years as a       working artist, he carved only in wood.        Living in Calais, in Barre's shadow, it was inevitable that       Miller would eventually carve stone. Finding his way to the       studios of several Barre sculptors, he learned the rudiments       of stone carving, and since then has been working in wood and       stone, doing both public commissions and personal work.        According to Miller, Williams' classical studies have       enabled him to become one of the best figurative sculptors in       Vermont. As Miller meticulously carves the Ceres statue in       wood, he is constantly taking measurements from Williams'       exquisite model.        Williams is a consummate artist and craftsman, and builds       his models from the inside out, beginning with a metal       armature, layered over with clay to create a nude body, then       layering clothing on that. His knowledge of anatomy underlies       the figure, giving it a much more realistic sense than most       contemporary sculptors are able to achieve with less rigorous       means. Miller's own anatomy studies enhance the liveliness of       his carving so that there is an incredible flow to Ceres'       robes--something that is very evident in the supine form that       is near completion at the Vermont Granite Museum in Barre.        Miller's portraits in wood are incredibly sensitive. The       character of the individuals shines through the seemingly       obdurate material. Miller is imbued with a love of carving       and speaks of feeling relaxed and joyous at the end of a day       of work. His portrait piece ``Stanley Fitch,'' complete with       eyeglasses carved on the face, feels like an integral part of       his subject's personality.        The elderly farmer, ``Percy,'' and the couple, ``Howard and       Dot,'' are more expressive and personal than a photograph or       a painting. The character of each person seems alive before       our eyes, under Miller's sensitive strokes. The flow of the       lines of carving, all done by hand, follow the form as       intimately as a sculptor's fingers working clay. This is an       extraordinary achievement and a real legacy creation for many       generations.        Most of Miller's personal work in granite and marble is       figurative. The female form seems to be of endless       inspiration to him. He has also joined forces with other       sculptors who have an ongoing project at the Millstone Hill       Sculpture Park on the site of the old Websterville quarry.       There is a plentiful supply of grey Barre granite, and one       never knows when one of Miller's trolls or Hephaestus, the       god of fire, might emerge from an old quarry block. Another       popular work is a sculptural truck that Miller built, with       community support, that resides in Maple Corner, Calais.        Miller doesn't see much of a difference between public and       private work. He approaches them with the same spirit. With       personal sculptures shown in galleries, he never knows where       they will end up. With a public art piece, the area has to be       researched, and the artist has to come up with an idea that       is relevant. For one commission in Marion, Iowa, a bike-      centric community, Miller designed a bike rack supported by       granite gloves carved from the town's photos. One of his bike       racks featuring gargoyles engaged in an eternal tug of war       graces Barre's North Main Street.        Williams' approach to working with clients on public       commissions is a genuinely collaborative one, whether he is       working on a  [[Page S7105]]       memorial sculpture for a family grieving over the loss of       their infant daughter or a 10-foot-high granite Teddy bear       for Highland Park in Dallas, Texas. His modus operandi is       consistently professional, beginning with drawings, moving       towards a clay model, then the final execution in stone       using diamond saws and pneumatic tools powered by air. For       the Barre City and Elementary School, Williams chose to       create a collection of freestanding Teddy bears tumbling       playfully in one of the sculptural niches at the school.        Williams admits that the challenge of running a carving       business and creating personal work is not an easy one. He's       not sure that there is a ``happy medium,'' and often feels       that he is ``stealing time'' to make personal work. His       personal work is often carved granite and mixed media. Two       pieces that demonstrate this are ``Argon,'' a split sphere,       combining high polish and texture that contains a line of       blue argon gas. ``Neon,'' a linear piece with a mysterious,       mask-like face, is illuminated with a center of red. Williams       loves the effect of the light energy contrasting with the       density of the stone. Other pieces are always       representational, but not figurative. The work ``Warm Gun''       is a tour de force of softly draped fabric covering a form       that reveals itself as a gun only after close inspection.        Williams and Miller belong to a group of sculptors who       believe in collaboration. At times, an artist is awarded a       commission and will come to Williams to create the model. If       Williams or Miller needs help on a larger project, they may       bring in one or two other carvers. Large-scale sculpture       takes a cooperative effort, and it is this spirit of sharing       between Williams and Miller that animates the Ceres project.       They both tell of a chance meeting at LBJ's store in       Worcester and discussing the requirements for the Ceres       sculpture. It was that informal conversation that led them to       the path of creating a proposal together to apply for the       commission.        Williams was involved in the early days of the Barre       Sculptors and Artisans Guild, a loose affiliation of Barre       carvers who were also creating their own personal sculpture.       What began as a Friday afternoon gathering to drink beer       together at Gaylord's studio blossomed into a group that       showed their work together. Their first show filled Williams'       studio in 1986. Some of those carvers still participate in       the annual Stone Show at Studio Place arts.        Williams also participated in the Burlington International       Sculpture Symposium organized by University of Vermont       professor and sculptor Paul Aschenbach. The intense six-week       symposium resulted in a park on the site of the Moran       Municipal Generation Station, which endured for 23 years.       Local sculptors worked with sculptors from Japan, Germany,       Czechoslovakia, Scotland, the Netherlands and Romania to       create a people-friendly environment that has been       temporarily dismantled and hopefully awaits a second       installation in Burlington's redesigned waterfront area.        Sue Higby, director of Barre's Studio Place Arts (SPA), has       supported the personal work of Barre carvers by hosting the       annual Stone Show at SPA. She has also been a key mover in       the execution of public projects in Barre, including       developing and securing funding for the Stone Sculpture       Legacy Program, which was supported initially by the Charles       Semprebon Fund. It was Higby who approached Miller with the       idea of creating a site-specific piece in a narrow space       between Studio Place Arts and Barre City Place. The resulting       ``Unzipping the Earth,'' simultaneously a sculpture and a       garden, was designed and executed by Miller, and won the 2014       American Society of Landscape Architects Merit Award for       Public Places.        Both Miller and Williams are outstanding examples of the       creativity and perseverance that marks sculptors who carve       stone or wood. In dealing with an obdurate material, one has       to have an eternally flexible attitude--a willingness to work       with the stone, not in competition with it--a willingness to       bend the carving to follow the flow of the grain of the wood       or stone.        Vermont is fortunate to count these seasoned professionals       among the ranks of its profuse community of artists. They are       exemplars of artists who have followed their individual       paths, and have succeeded in creating exceptional works of       art in both the public and private sphere. They have given       generously to their communities, and richly deserve the       Governor's Award for Excellence in the Arts.     Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
