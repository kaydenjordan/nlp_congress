 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New York for  yielding and for hosting this Special Order. In my humble opinion, the  people of New York are lucky to have a gentleman like him representing  them; and I know it is the highest honor of his life as well.   I also want to associate with my good friend, the gentleman from  Kentucky (Mr. Barr), for the remarks he made. I think he has made an  excellent record of not only the premise of the deal, but the effect of  the deal so far.    Mr. Speaker, I agree with the gentleman from New York that Mr. Barr  is going to be critical in leading the effort forward in sanctions,  whether they are part of the JCPOA or not. I thank the gentleman from  Kentucky for his words tonight as well.   Earlier this month, President Trump set a new direction for the  United States, a direction of leadership. He made clear that we would  no longer allow the Iranian Government to continue to pursue nuclear  weapons, continue funding terrorism, or threaten the very existence of  our great friend, Israel, the strongest ally we have in the region.   President Trump made clear that, unlike the previous administration,  we will not reward Iran for chanting ``death to America,'' and we will  not allow this terrorist regime to dictate our Nation's foreign policy.   Getting the Iran deal done was the only thing the previous  administration cared about. Think about that, just getting the deal  done. I think we all remember that sentiment around here: getting the  deal done no matter how terrible was the only thing the previous  administration cared about. We had to get the deal done. We had to get  the deal done, as bad as it was.                                time  1930    It is unlike our current President who has demanded action to hold  Iran accountable, guarantee our national security, and protect Israel  and our allies across the world night and day. I appreciate the  President's leadership on this and other matters.   The United States never should have signed onto the deal in the first  place, Mr. Speaker, because it was a bad deal. It gave Iran immediate  access to $150 billion, it allowed the Iranians to continue their  ballistic missile research, and it contains a sunset provision that  will allow the Iranians to return immediately to enriching uranium  without consequence.   Now, even then-Secretary of State John Kerry said: ``Some of the $150  billion will end up in the hands of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard  Corps or other entities, some of which are labeled terrorists.''   That was our Secretary of State's direct quote admitting that some of  this $150 billion was going to get to terrorists.   There is no situation in which the United States should allow money  to get to terrorists. Hoosiers that I represent see this quite clearly.  Surely, the Americans that the rest of us represent see the same thing.  But then-President Obama and Secretary Kerry allowed this to happen and  were cheered on, in fact, by many in this very Chamber and many in the  Senate.   This year alone, Iran has tested their ballistic missiles at least  three times, and they tested a rocket space launch vehicle. Now, in  their most recent test in September, they used a ballistic missile with  the potential range to hit Israel, the only stable democracy in the  region.   As Mr. Barr pointed out, Mr. Speaker, intercontinental ballistic  missiles aren't even meant for Israel. They are meant to come here.  They are meant to go to our other allies--a bad deal indeed.   The threats Iran poses are truly extreme: terrorists, a nuclear arms  race, and continued threats to America and its neighbors.  Unfortunately, we cannot go back in time and stop then-President Obama  from signing this disastrous Iran nuclear deal--and, by the way, it is  signing in the theoretical sense because Mr. Yoho is also right, Mr.  Speaker, when he said that this was a set of papers that truly had no  signatories. It was an executive action by then-President Obama for  sure. But, all in all, no matter what the semantics, it was a bad deal.   But we can--we can--move forward by creating tough sanctions like,  Mr. Speaker, Mr. Barr was pointing out and making sure Iran is held  accountable. That starts tonight with the work that Lee Zeldin and  other Members of Congress are doing.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New York again for yielding  to me, and I thank him for his leadership. Mr. Speaker, let's get it  right this time. Let's make sure Iran doesn't become the threat that  the previous administration has allowed it to become.
