This bill reauthorizes the Food and Drug Administration's animal drug  and animal generic drug user fee programs and ensures that the FDA  continues to have the tools it needs to approve animal drugs to help  our pets and livestock live healthier lives.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the remainder of my statement.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5554, the Animal Drug and  Animal Generic Drug User Fee Amendments of 2018.   This bill reauthorizes the Food and Drug Administration's Animal Drug  and Animal Generic Drug User Fee Programs and ensures the FDA continues  to have the tools it needs to approve animal drugs to help our pets and  livestock live healthier lives.   This legislation reauthorizes the FDA's authority to collect user  fees from the animal drug and generic animal drug industries for  additional five years and reflects bipartisan agreement and  recommendations negotiated between the FDA and the animal drug industry  with input from farmers and ranchers, veterinarians, food and feed  producers, and other public health stakeholders.   These critical user fee agreements have helped to accelerate the  development of animal drugs, reduce application review times at the  FDA, and create a more predictable and streamlined process for getting  animal drugs to market.   It is critical that we pass H.R. 5554 today as the current  authorization for these programs will expire on September 30th of this  year. If ADUFA and AGDUFA are not reauthorized by the deadline, the FDA  will lack the resources and subject matter experts it needs to do this  important work.   This will be the fourth reauthorization of ADUFA and the third  reauthorization of AGDUFA. These user fee programs have proven to be  highly successful and allow the Center for Veterinary Medicine at FDA  to meet and exceed its performance goals.   The FDA's gold standard for safety and efficacy extends beyond  products just for humans, but also for animal drugs. Safe and effective  animal medications, as approved by FDA, protect our companion animals  and keep our food supply safe. Reauthorizing ADUFA and AGDUFA ensures  this continues.   As a result of our bipartisan compromise, this bill also creates a  conditional approval pathway for certain new animal drugs that are  intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition or  address an unmet health need for which ongoing efficacy studies are  complex or particularly difficult. I am  [[Page H6242]]  pleased we have reached consensus on this policy and that the provision  includes a 10-year sunset.   The Energy and Commerce Committee has worked in a strong bipartisan  fashion to move this bill forward. I commend my colleagues, Rep. Kurt  Schrader and Rep. Markwayne Mullin, for introducing this important  legislation and advancing it for floor consideration.   I urge my colleagues to join me and vote in support of the Animal  Drug and Animal Generic Drug User Fee Amendments of 2018.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Oregon (Mr. Schrader), our colleague from the Energy and  Commerce Committee.
