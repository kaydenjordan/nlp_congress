 Mr. Speaker, I condemn U.N. Security Council Resolution  2334.   This is an outrageous attack against the State of Israel, the world's  only Jewish state and the only democracy in the Middle East. I also  condemn the Obama administration's failure to veto such a resolution,  because it betrayed Israel and it harmed our national security  interests. The Obama administration's actions, or lack of actions, were  more than just a sin of omission in that they worked behind the scenes  to move this resolution forward so that it could be voted on in the  United Nations General Assembly. That is a sin of commission.   Now, we have to be honest about how the two sides have acted in this  in putting pressure on Israel and not on the Palestinian Authority.  Remember, when you talk about a two-state solution, the Palestinian  Arabs rejected a state in 1948. They tried to wipe Israel off the map.  They tried to beat them in 1967. It has been a constant state of war,  and they have chosen to get rid of the Jewish state as something that  is more important to them than the creation of their own state, and we  have to be honest about that.   I will support this resolution. I view it as a good statement, but as  just a first step. We need something in the coming days that has teeth  to deal with the United Nations and its outrageous conduct. It has  become a hotbed of anti-Israeli activity where all of these tin-pot  countries get together and rail against the world's only Jewish state.  They did 20 resolutions against Israel at the United Nations in 2016  and four against the rest of the world.   We need to take our power of the purse and defund the U.N. until U.N.  Security Council Resolution 2334 is revoked.   Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to my  colleague from Texas (Mr. Doggett).
