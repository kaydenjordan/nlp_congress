 Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague  Senator Kaine and so many others who are here on the floor today to  talk about the hardship that has been created for so many Americans by  this government shutdown--a government shutdown that is wasteful,  unnecessary, and totally about politics.   Today is the 17th day since this partisan brinkmanship shut down 9  out of 15 Departments and dozens of government Agencies that we depend  on to protect our health and safety.   We could reopen the government's doors today if Senate Republicans  take up the bills that were passed by the House--bills that were  written and overwhelmingly approved by the Republican-controlled Senate  just a few weeks ago.   If there is bipartisan and bicameral agreement on the appropriations  bills, then why has the government shut down? Sadly, it is because the  President wants to force American taxpayers to foot the bill for an  ineffective and costly wall on the southern border--a wall which the  President promised Mexico would pay for and which is opposed by the  majority of Americans.   Meanwhile, the men and women who work in Agencies that protect the  American people and who protect our borders are either not working or  on the job but not getting paid. In total, more than 380,000 Federal  employees have been furloughed, and more than 450,000 are working  without pay.   This shutdown affects the entire country, including New Hampshire. It  is not just the thousands of Federal workers who are affected by the  shutdown; it is also harming millions of Americans who depend on  essential services provided by the affected Agencies, people like those  Senator Kaine described.   Last Friday, I had a chance to meet with farmers in New Hampshire who  are affected by the ongoing closure of the Department of Agriculture's  Farm Service Agency. They are not receiving the essential services and  loans they need to prepare for spring planting.   Many dairy farmers, who have been under extreme hardship anyway  because of the tariffs with China and falling dairy prices, talked  about the impact on them. Last year, New Hampshire dairy farmers lost  $1 million because of the tariffs, and our farmers tell me they are in  danger of losing several million more this coming year. So they can't  afford to have another hit.   The fact that this new dairy safety net program, which was passed in  the farm bill--and congratulations to Senator Stabenow, the ranking  member of the Agriculture Committee. She and Senator Roberts did a  great job providing help for the first time for so many dairy farmers.  Even though they are hurting because of the tariffs, those farmers  can't benefit from that right now because the program's implementation  has been delayed. They don't know how long they will be able to hold on  before they are able to get help.   Furloughs have also slowed work at the Office of National Drug  Control Policy and the programs it oversees that are integral to New  Hampshire's effort to fight the deadly opioid epidemic. Everybody who  is getting ready to speak has seen the effects in their States because  of the delays in these programs. Last year, New Hampshire had the  second highest rate of deaths due to opioid-related drug overdoses.  Continued delays from the Agency will pull the rug out from under our  first responders, who rely on ONDCP resources and critical Federal  opioid response efforts. Just as we are beginning to see some progress  in fighting the opioid epidemic because of the work of Congress, we are  seeing steps taken that move us backward.   Of course, there are the air traffic controllers. Last Friday, I  visited with New Hampshire's air traffic controllers to discuss how the  shutdown is affecting their operations and safety at our airports. I  have received 38 handwritten letters from New Hampshire air traffic  controllers who are opposed to the shutdown.   (Mr. DAINES assumed the Chair.)   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that these letters be printed  in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:         Dear Senator Shaheen, My name is Dara and I have been an       air traffic controller with the FAA for close to 19 years. I       am writing this letter to express my concern about our       current government shutdown.        On Christmas Eve, my dear mother passed away. Ever since I       was a child I have been taking care of her since she was       permanently disabled from Multiple Sclerosis. The day before       Thanksgiving she was diagnosed with metastatic cancer and was       given 3-6 months to live. When she passed I was devastated! I       had to call people on Christmas Day to tell them the news.       That was so hard. I had to contact the funeral parlor down in       NJ (that's where we're from) to coordinate a burial. I had to       take 3 days off to make it work. But I still worked during       this difficult time on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day and       the 26th. I also ended up having to pay thousands of dollars       for her funeral.        Honestly, this government shutdown has been the last thing       on my mind. But now the realization of not being able to pay       my mortgage, credit cards from Christmastime, and now this       funeral is too much to bear.        Air traffic control is a very stressful profession, but I       am proud to be able to do it and work with such a group of       professionals who come to work and are dedicated to safety in       the National Airspace System. My colleagues and I deserve       better.        Please end the government shutdown immediately!      Dora (Bedford, NH).                                   ____         Dear Senator Shaheen, As an Air Traffic Controller and       constituent, I want you to know how the partial government       shutdown is affecting me. For the last two weeks, air traffic       controllers have remained on the job, dedicated to the safety       of every flight. But we don't know when we will receive our       next paycheck. My colleagues and I have suffered the sudden       loss of our income due to the government shutdown. My husband       is a firefighter/EMT in Londonderry. We both have very       important and stressful jobs and take our responsibility for       public safety very seriously. We have a home, a mortgage and       are trying to start a family and the stress of not knowing       when I will receive my paycheck is a heavy burden to bear.       Many of my colleagues had to cancel vacation time over the       holidays and miss out on time with their family out of       concern that they would not be reimbursed for time off that       they worked hard to earn        It is not too much to ask to get paid for the time we are       required to show up and work our hardest five days a week.        Many air traffic facilities are already critically staffed       with many having scheduled 6 day work weeks. In our building,       we currently have 6 employees whose training is at a       standstill because their trainers are non-essential       contractors.        Senator Shaheen, I truly appreciate your time and beg you       to do all you can to end this shutdown immediately.            Sincerely,      Sarah (Deerfield, NH).                                   ____         Dear Senator Shaheen, As an Air Traffic Controller, I want       to you to know how the government shutdown is affecting my       family and I. My husband and I are both Air Traffic       Controllers and are extremely proud of what we do. However,       not knowing when we will get paid puts a log of stress on us       in addition to an already stressful environment that we work       in. I myself am in training at A90 and this shutdown has the       possibility of delaying my final rating, which means a pay       raise. Bills do not stop and we are both out of a paycheck.       This puts a huge burden on my family and I. Please end the       government shutdown.            Sincerely,      Michelle (Pelham, NH).                                   ____         Dear Senator Shaheen, Thank you so much for all the hard       work you are doing on my behalf to end this harmful       government shutdown.        It was a pleasure to meet with you yesterday and discuss my       concerns with the shutdown. As an Air Traffic Controller and       President of Boston TRACON NATCA, located in Merrimack, NH, I       was able to discuss with you firsthand how the shutdown is       harmful to my coworkers and the FAA as a whole.        Please keep up the fight to end the shutdown.            Sincerely,      Curt (Merrimack, NH).                                   ____         Dear Senator Shaheen, I am writing to you today to share       with you the effect the government shutdown has had on my       family. I'm married to someone who is older and retired, so       his income is considerably less than  [[Page S51]]       mine. We have two small children and own a home in Merrimack,       NH. We not only have a mortgage to pay, but other bills for       heat and utilities and my car. This shutdown has been       extremely stressful, more than the others I have worked       through. The current administration has been so unpredictable       as well as volatile, it's an actual thought that this could       drag out for months and that non-essential friends and family       that are currently furloughed will not receive pay. This       shutdown is unfair to the dedicated and professional       government employees, not just myself and the other air       traffic controllers.        I am asking you to please end the shutdown. Please re-open       the government and allow us to work knowing we will earn our       paychecks again.            Sincerely,      Lisa (Merrimack, NH).                                   ____         Dear Senator Shaheen, I am writing you today to share the       impact the government shutdown is having on me and more       importantly my family. First, I would like to tell you a       little about my wife and I. We were high school sweethearts       and have been married almost 15 years. While Kelly is not       perfect, she is perfect for me. Kelly struggles with and is       receiving treatment for anxiety and depression. Due to       childhood trauma, she struggles with uncertainty. In previous       shutdowns the not knowing causes stress and strife. Even the       anticipation of a possible shutdown raises her anxiety so I       have started to keep them to myself and not tell her until       the last possible moment to save her the anguish. It has been       over two weeks with no end in sight and this wreaking havoc       on our relationship.        Next I would like to tell you about my two daughters. My       oldest Kaley is 13, a bright honor roll student athlete.       Kaley has been having gastrointestinal issues for a few years       and just had her second endoscopy last month. Even with FEHB       coverage the procedures are not free. We have a follow up       with her G.I. tomorrow. I find myself hoping she won't need       major medical treatments as money is starting to get tight.        Next would be my other daughter Savanna. She is 10 and like       her mom suffers from anxiety. Like her mother, I have also       tried to shield her from this so she won't worry because no       10-year-old should have to. Unfortunately, the time where I       can protect her from this is drawing to a close as this week       I will have to inform her dance studio that I won't be able       to afford February's tuition. I know dance classes can seem       frivolous in the grand scheme of things, but they are her       outlet, her freedom, and her happiness. I hope and pray for       accommodation and understanding from a N.H. small business       owner to allow her to continue without payment. Another       Savanna story for you, she has sensory issues and through       therapy is finally learning how to voice them. About a week       before Christmas while tucking her into bed, I jokingly asked       her why she had 9, yes 9 blankets on her bed. Her response       was a big break through for us. ``Dad, I like the weight of       it. It helps me calm down.'' That Saturday we were finishing       up our Christmas shopping for mom and I took her into Yogibo       at the Pheasantland mall. They have weighted blankets and I       let her try it out. ``Oooh dad, this is nice.'' Well, those       N.H.-made blankets are $80. Normally, a purchase would have       been made that day. Unfortunately, that was the eve of the       shutdown, and Savanna is still waiting patiently for dad's       next check.        Lastly, how has this affected me? I put myself last as I       normally do with the girls. It pains me to watch them go       through this. Furthermore, I was faced with a thought that       would never have come up normally. Thursday night my 64-year-      old mother was rushed to the emergency room in Brockton, MA,       about an hour away from Nashua. For a brief fleeting moment I       actually thought about fuel for my truck. I had fuel and have       resources for more for now, but I need to keep driving to       work without pay. I did go down to check up on her and she       came home last night thankfully. I do despise the fact       however that the thought of not going even crossed my mind.       Starting next week I have to start looking for a second job       to offset some of the losses. I will have 16 years of       government service at 3 different air traffic facilities in       March.        I humbly request your assistance in ending the government       shutdown and returning some normality to our house hold.            Sincerely,      James (Nashua, NH).                                   ____         Dear Senator Shaheen, First and foremost, I want to thank       you for taking the time to read my letter. During times of a       government shutdown, federal employees (either furloughed or       working without pay) feel like no one is actively listening       to their stories. With that in mind, thank you for hearing       what I have to say.        I am a single mother of three, and I thank God every day       for the job that I have. My career as an air traffic       controller has enabled me to take care of my children and       afford to give them opportunities that many families cannot       afford. I have two girls attending out of state colleges. One       is at Purdue University studying Airport management, the       other at University of South Carolina studying Political       Science. My son, 14, is in middle school and actively engaged       in sports.        Some days, when I feel the stress of bills pilling on, I       feel guilty because I have a great job, make a really good       salary, and have great benefits. However in the end, no       matter how much any of us make, we all have bills and       responsibilities. I work for the sole purpose of earning a       wage to support my family. This government shutdown has left       me worried. I called one of my creditors and they were not       sympathetic at all. I'm worried about using credit cards and       being charged a high interest rate and yet, life still       happens. Food needs to be put on the table, cars need to run,       and my daughter's rent at college still needs to be paid.       Unfortunately, everything goes on except my paycheck.        Holding federal employees paychecks ``hostage'' should       never be an option in the midst of Congressional funding       arguments. The ironic thing about it is that I am ``paying       the price'' and I am not even receiving a paycheck! I       understand that everyone has an opinion on border security. I       would hope that 100% of Congress (and the President) agree       that employees of the federal government should not be a pawn       in this matter.        I hope that you and your fellow members of Congress can       come to an agreement to let federal employees go back to       work, get paid, and feel safe knowing that their family needs       are being met.            Sincerely,      Sherri (Hollis, NH).                                   ____         Dear Senator Shaheen, As an air traffic controller and a       constituent, I want you to know how the partial government       shutdown is affecting me and my colleagues.        The lack of paid leave means missing time with the family.       It means coming to work at a stressful job when you might not       feel at your best. It means not being able to plan time off       to get my car fixed or get that new furniture delivered       during the week.        The world of air traffic is constantly evolving. New and       revised rules and procedures are a constant. The lack of       support personnel means that eventually those changes could       be missed and safety compromised.        The lack of training in classrooms and simulators means an       already short-staffed controller workforce will continue to       shrink and controllers will not be able to progress in their       careers. Eventually the lack of pay may convince eligible       controllers to retire or make others decide to seek other       employment. The number of fully certified air traffic       controllers is now at a 30-year low.        Please end the shutdown immediately.            Sincerely,      Todd (Manchester, NH).                                   ____         Dear Senator Shaheen, As an Air Traffic Controller and       constituent, I want you to know how the partial government       shutdown is affecting me.        In the past year my in-laws have moved in with my family.       My father-in-law lost his job and him and his wife were no       longer able to afford living on their own. The extra       financial burden with the combination of the government       shutdown is going to make it hard for me to meet my financial       obligations.        Please end the shutdown immediately!      Shane (Bedford, NH).                                   ____         Dear Senator Shaheen, I appreciate your efforts for our       state and country. At this time I feel it is vital that you       understand the impact that Washington politics is having on       my family and friends. The inability for our elected       officials to find common ground and demonstrate leadership is       disheartening to say the least. It is time for our elected       officials to put politics aside and put people as their       priority. Our federal workforce has good men and women with a       strong desire to place the needs of this country first, yet       our elected officials are preventing this. Please end this       shutdown now and allow us to do our jobs.      Gerald (Brookline, NH).                                   ____         Hon. Senator Jeanne Shaheen, I would like to first thank       you for reaching out and meeting with our NATCA legislative       leadership team yesterday. They do so much work, on their own       time, to help support all the air traffic controllers       throughout New England. As a constituent directly impacted by       this government shutdown, I would like you to stress to all       colleagues, Democrat or Republican, that this has and will       continue to put an undo stress upon me and my family. As an       air traffic controller, with one of the most stressful jobs       in the world, the last thing that I need is to worry about       when I'm going to receive my next check for work. I've been       performing at a professional and safe level that is expected        In the weeks leading up to the shutdown, and knowing that       it was almost certain it would happen, my federal coworkers       and I raised over $12,000 in donations in the Southern New       Hampshire area. This included 200 gifts and gift cards,       totaling over $18,000 to the Nashua Children's Home and       $4,020 donated to Family Promise of Greater Nashua at Anne       Marie House. We will continue to contribute to our       communities but please bring an end to this shutdown       immediately.        Thank you for your time,      Everett (Bedford, NH).                                   ____         The Hon. Senator Jeanne Shaheen, As an air traffic       controller and constituent, I want you to know how the       partial government shutdown is affecting me. For the last two       weeks, air traffic controllers have remained on the job,       dedicated to the safety of every flight. But, we don't know       when we will receive our next paycheck. My colleagues and I       have suffered the sudden loss of our income due to the       government shutdown. It's going to be hard for me to meet all       of my financial obligations.        Please end the shutdown immediately!      Andre (Derry, NH).                                   ____         The Hon. Senator Jeanne Shaheen, I am currently working at       Boston TRACON for  [[Page S52]]       the FAA. For the past thirty years I have been providing air       traffic services for the United States. For the first nine       and half years I was serving the country in the Air Force       during Operations Desert Storm and Desert Shield.        I am a one income family that relies on my federal       paycheck. I have two children, one that is planning on going       to college in the upcoming year. That being said, I should be       financially planning to pay for her college, not my mortgage!       While the Congress is celebrating, high fiving each other,       I'm wondering, How will I meet my financial obligations.       Please help end this nonsense soon.            Sincerely,                                         Douglass (New Boston, NH).     Air traffic controllers keep our airways safe, but, as  we all know, they are being asked to work long shifts without being  sure they are going to get paid for that work. One air traffic  controller I heard from was recently transferred to the Boston area,  which is covered in New Hampshire. She is the sole provider to her  mother. Now she is paying not only her mortgage but her mother's  mortgage.   In a letter she addressed to my office, she wrote:         As a sole source of income to my household, the foreseeable       future of this shutdown is detrimental. . . . [It has       created] a substantial burden on not just me but the       thousands of federal employees it's impacting.    Sadly, the shutdown also stands to affect the safety of air travel-- not because our air traffic controllers aren't on the job. They are on  the job. They are doing the work even though they are not getting paid.  But the fact is, men and women who provide administrative and  maintenance functions on the runway--those people who fix equipment  when it stops working, who are in the control tower and at airport  facilities--they will not be at work to support our air traffic  controllers. So when a runway or taxiway light goes dark, it is going  to go unrepaired. That jeopardizes the safety and the efficiency of  aviation operations.   Then there are the impacts to those Agencies that are funded by the  Commerce-Justice-Science appropriations bill. I understand this  particularly well as the ranking member on the CJS Subcommittee of  Appropriations. I know what a devastating effect this shutdown is  having on these Agencies.   More than 41,000 law enforcement agents of the Department of  Justice--including agents within the FBI, the Drug Enforcement  Administration, and the Bureau of Prisons--are working for IOUs. We are  hearing this directly in New Hampshire, where every staff member at the  Federal Correctional Institution in Berlin, NH, which is in northern  New Hampshire, is excepted. That means they are required to report for  work, and they are not being paid.   I would like to read an excerpt from a letter I received from Chris  Allen. Chris is the president of the union at FCI Berlin, which  represents 180 staff members. He highlighted the kinds of choices staff  members are being forced to make. He said:         While some staff members can call and potentially have a       mortgage or a car payment excused if they are missing only       one source of income, even buying simple groceries or paying       for childcare becomes difficult for a family when all sources       of income have been stopped and you are required to continue       working.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have Chris's letter printed  in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:           American Federation of Government Employees Council of             Prison Locals, Local #2008,                                                        Berlin, NH.        Dear Senator Shaheen: My name is Chris Allen and I am the       President of AFGE Local 2008. 1 represent 180 staff members       at the Federal Correctional Institution in Berlin, NH. Today       I write to you with great concern for these federal       employees. As you are aware, these staff members are       currently being affected by the current lapse in funding for       the Justice Department. Every staff member employed at FCI       Berlin is considered ``excepted'' and are required to report       for work without being paid at this time. Next week, on       January 17, 2019, which would have been our next scheduled       pay day, we will be missing our first full pay check.        We are fortunate to have some banks willing to lend a       helping hand to employees during this difficult time.       However, it hasn't been a save all either. Staff members are       running into issues with banks asking for documentation that       they are truly furloughed and guaranteed to be paid when the       shutdown ends. With no firm date that the shutdown could be       resolved and no legislation in place to guarantee they will       be paid in the end, banks are giving staff a harder time       while they are applying for loans at a 0% interest rate. The       other fear is that the shutdown continues past one or two pay       periods. Many of the banks are only offering short term loans       equal to only one or two pay checks. If the shutdown       continues, banks are undecided on whether future low or no       interest loans will be continued for our staff.        We also have a number of families working at FCI Berlin       that have two incomes coming from the Justice Department.       While some staff members may have a significant other being       paid from outside the government, many of our families are       now missing two sources of income. While some staff members       can call and potentially have a mortgage or car payment       excused if they are missing only one source of income, even       buying simple groceries or paying for childcare becomes       difficult for a family when all sources of income have been       stopped and you are required to continuing working.        I ask you and your colleagues in Washington to please keep       the excepted staff of FCI Berlin in mind during this time of       shutdown so they can be paid for the professional work they       do day in and day out to keep our communities safe.            Sincerely,                                                       Chris Allen,                                        President, AFGE Local 2008.     Mr. President, because of the shutdown, the Department  of Commerce is not processing U.S. companies' requests to be excluded  from the President's steel and aluminum tariffs. That delay will cost  companies millions of dollars and will increase economic uncertainty.  The shutdown is also preventing the Department of Commerce from  assessing new anti-dumping and countervailing duties cases that help  ensure our companies are competing on a level playing field.   Finally, this shutdown, like all shutdowns, is going to put a lasting  burden on the economy. The 16-day shutdown in 2013 cost the government  $2.5 billion in pay and benefits, and it lowered fourth-quarter gross  domestic product for the country by about $3 billion in lost output.   The 2018 Trump shutdown has furloughed about 380,000 employees,  nearly half of the number furloughed in 2013. So it is fair to say that  the shutdown has already cost the government at least $1 billion, and  the number is growing every day. The toll this shutdown is taking on  the American people was completely avoidable. That is what is so  frustrating, and I know it is frustrating to everybody in this Chamber.   Last week, the House passed legislation to reopen the government that  is virtually identical to legislation that passed the Senate or was  reported by the Appropriations Committee with strong bipartisan  margins. In fact, here, as we remember, that continuing resolution to  allow us to keep negotiating passed by a voice vote.   I urge Senator McConnell to bring these bills to the floor. Let  President Trump decide to sign them or not sign them. He can make that  choice as President, but we are a separate branch of government, and it  is up to us to make the determination to end the shutdown immediately  and to do what is right for the American people. We need to ensure that  all government employees affected by the shutdown receive the pay they  deserve. I know there is legislation, led by Senators Cardin and  Collins, to do that. I urge Congress to take up and pass this critical  legislation as soon as possible.   One of the most fundamental constitutional duties of Congress is the  appropriations process--to supply annual funds for Federal programs  that support national defense, transportation, small businesses, food  assistance for low-income families, research and development, and so  much more. Right now, by refusing to allow legislation to reopen the  government, this Senate--this Congress--is failing, and millions of  Americans are suffering as a result.   I urge President Trump, Senator McConnell, and congressional  Republicans to reopen the government and allow Americans to get back to  work.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Pennsylvania,  Senator Casey, for his compelling remarks. In fact, for the last  several hours, we have heard compelling remarks from a number of our  colleagues. I thank Senator Kaine from Virginia for helping to organize  this effort and all of those who have come to the floor to talk about  the lasting and negative effects of this senseless shutdown--a shutdown  that is all about President Trump yielding to Rush Limbaugh and the  rightwing commentators who told them he wasn't being tough enough.   Senators Casey and Markey reminded us how we got here, that we had an  agreement we thought the President had committed to sign. His Vice  President, his Acting Chief of Staff, told us he was going to sign it.  It passed the Senate on a voice vote.   What is so ironic, as Senator Markey said, is that what is happening  now is actually making us less safe. The idea that we have all of these  people on our southern border, all of these TSA agents, people who are  working, 800,000 employees, 400,000 who are furloughed, 380,000 who are  working without pay--that is actually making us less safe.   As Senator Durbin pointed out, a wall across our southern border  wouldn't do anything to interdict the fentanyl that is coming across  from China. That is the biggest killer of people in New Hampshire from  overdoses; it is the fentanyl. As Senator Jones pointed out, the Coast  Guard's role in interdiction is what is significant. It is not a wall  that is going to keep out those vehicles that are going to come through  our ports of entry.  [[Page S76]]    Senator Stabenow reminded us that there are 38 million people who  depend on food assistance, and a quarter of the people in New Mexico,  as Senator Heinrich told us, depend on food assistance. He quoted his  constituent Kathy, who pointed out that the President is holding us  hostage. She said: Federal employees are being held hostage. We are now  being held hostage in the Senate because the majority is unwilling to  act on the legislation that has passed the House and previously passed  the Senate.   Senator Bennet talked about China landing on the dark side of the  Moon last week. It is a reminder that we have to compete in this world,  that we can't assume that America is going to be No. 1 in everything  again. Yet, while China was landing on the dark side of the Moon, our  government was shut down. Thousands of researchers weren't doing their  jobs at NASA, the Department of Agriculture, and so many other places  because we were shut down.   The cost to the economy as a whole, as Senator Hassan pointed out-- there are craft breweries in New Hampshire, small businesses that can't  get their businesses started because government is shut down.   Senator Klobuchar pointed out that the cost to the economy, according  to the President's own advisers, is $10 billion a week. At a time when  the stock market is going up and down, when we have people losing  billions of dollars because of fluctuations in the stock market, $10  billion a week contributes to that uncertainty.   Then, of course, Senator Van Hollen and Senator Merkley and virtually  everybody here talked about the impact on ordinary Americans from this  government shutdown. We are going to hear from President Trump in about  5 minutes. He is going to speak to the country. I will bet he doesn't  talk about the impact on ordinary Americans of this government  shutdown. I will bet he doesn't talk about the cost to the economy or  what he promised to sign when this Congress passed funding bills. I  will bet he doesn't talk about the future of America and what is going  to happen if we don't continue to invest in research and if we don't  continue to invest in our people and instead get involved in these  partisan fights. No. I think what he is going to do is tell Americans a  made-up story about the emergency at our southern border--an emergency  that we saw from Senator Durbin and Senator Merkley is not real. We  have gone from 1.6 million people coming across our southern border and  being arrested down to about 200,000 in the last year.   This is not a crisis that is affecting America. We need to address  border security. Everybody here believes that. All of the people who  spoke tonight said we need to address border security. We need to do it  in a way that is thoughtful and that spends taxpayer dollars wisely.   It is time for us to act in the Senate. It is time for Congress to  fund this government, to get it back open. I very much appreciate  Senator Kaine's work here tonight as we talk about the impacts on this  country of this government shutdown.   Thank you, Mr. President.   I yield to my colleague from Virginia.
