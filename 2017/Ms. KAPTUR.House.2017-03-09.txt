 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak on behalf of an  important bipartisan-supported vital Environmental Protection Agency  program, the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, spanning the largest  body of freshwater on the face of the Earth. Many media outlets have  suggested that the President intends to cut this program by 90  percent--90 percent.   I would like to clarify that this proposal is not yet official, but  it is more than a rumor. So I would like to believe that this President  who achieved the White House by carrying the Great Lake States of  Michigan, Indiana, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and my own Ohio, would not  take this awful step backward.   Candidate Trump traveled to Flint, Michigan, and promised that the  water situation would never happen if he were President. Is he going to  reverse his firm promise of clean water?   The blue economy of the Great Lakes depends on clean water: a $7  billion maritime industry in Lake Erie alone; jobs related to the  automotive and industrial sector of our country; recreational  opportunities; and, most importantly, preserves clean drinking water  for the millions and millions of people who depend on that today and in  the future.   Supporting the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative is not partisan; it  is common sense.                            ____________________
