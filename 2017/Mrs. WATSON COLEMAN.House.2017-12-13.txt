 Mr. Speaker, education is supposed to be the  great equalizer, but instead of investing in our students, Republicans,  through their tax scam, are attempting to widen that equality gap.   Young people want to pursue higher education, and Republicans want to  punish them with higher taxes so we can give away benefits to  millionaires and billionaires.   Students are gaining knowledge that can actually make a difference in  this world, but the Republicans' tax plan will only serve to deter them  from that goal.   It is right here in black and white. Republicans are trying to  eliminate student loan interest deductions. They want to tax college  endowments that provide scholarships and student aid. They are taxing  graduate tuition benefits that would make graduate school unattainable  for low- and middle-income students.   So this Republican attack on college and graduate students says loud  and clear: Low income? No rich parents? Good luck. Pay up.   It is an absolute disgrace.                            ____________________
