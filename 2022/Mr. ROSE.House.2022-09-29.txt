 Mr. Speaker, August was another month under President Biden  where inflation exceeded economists' expectations. The Consumer Price  Index was up 8.3 percent over the past year, and if you exclude food  and energy, it rose six-tenths of a percentage point in just 1 month.   On the same day, the higher-than-expected inflation number came out,  President Biden and congressional Democrats held an event at the White  House to celebrate the passing of the Inflation Reduction Act, which we  all know will do nothing to slow inflation.   Tennesseans are bearing the brunt of the President's disastrous  fiscal policies, all while the President celebrates passing a bill that  raises taxes amidst a recession, spends more than $400 billion on woke  Green New Deal programs, and hires 87,000 new IRS agents to target the  middle class.   Borrowing and spending more money won't ease the pain in our  pocketbooks. The only solution is an end to one-party control of  Washington.                            ____________________
