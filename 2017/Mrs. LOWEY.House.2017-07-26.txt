 Mr. Speaker, I, too, want to thank my very good friends,  Chairman Ed Royce, Ranking Member Eliot Engel, my fellow New Yorker,  and the strong advocate, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen. I want to thank them for  advancing this very important resolution.   I rise in strong support of H. Res. 317, which I introduced with my  friends, Representatives Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, Ted Deutch, and Ted Poe.  This resolution calls for the unconditional release of U.S. citizens  and legal permanent residents being held on baseless charges by the  Government of Iran.   Two of these prisoners, Siamek Namazi and Baquer Namazi, were  previously my constituents when they last lived in the United States. I  have had the honor of getting to know Babak Namazi, the courageous  brother and son of these two prisoners, who has tirelessly worked to  free them from unjust imprisonment.   While the Iranian Government continues to try and exact concessions  with these prisoners from the United States, Baquer Namazi, an 80-year- old former UNICEF leader, suffers from increasingly poor health in Evin  Prison. A man who spent his entire life serving the world's most  vulnerable should not, cannot, spend his final years in such terrible  conditions.   But this is just one prisoner's story. Each of the United States'  citizen and legal permanent resident prisoners is suffering while  imprisoned on trumped-up charges. Each has family members who worry,  every hour of the day, whether they will ever see their loved ones  again.                                time  1500    The United States must do all we can to ensure these prisoners return  home. This resolution sends a strong message to the Government of Iran.  These heinous attempts will not pay off. All of the prisoners must be  released immediately. And Iran must fulfill its previous promises to  locate and return Representative Deutch's constituent, Robert Levinson,  a U.S. citizen missing in Iran since 2007.   Mr. Speaker, once again, I thank everyone who helped advance this  resolution.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself 4 minutes.   Typically, the Legislative Branch, Military Construction and Veterans  Affairs, Energy and Water, and Defense bills would be debated and  amended by the full House individually. Regrettably, we are debating  this $790 billion so-called security minibus in only 2 hours for some  reason other than necessity. Substantive amendments chosen at the  discretion of the chairman of the Rules Committee will be debated for  10 minutes. We also expect $1.6 billion in border wall funding to be  added through a rules gimmick meant to prevent an up-or-down vote on  the wall.   The undemocratic maneuver by the Rules Committee to unilaterally  remove Congresswoman Barbara Lee's amendment to debate a new AUMF,  which received bipartisan support in the committee, is simply  outrageous. All the promises of Republican leadership of returning to  regular order have been broken.   I do, however, want to thank Chairman Frelinghuysen for conducting  business in the Appropriations Committee markups fairly and  collegially, as the minority offered amendments late into the night.   On top of the many procedural inequities, however, the majority's  increased defense spending is a mirage. Shattering budget control caps  would trigger automatic, across-the-board cuts of 13 percent to every  defense account. Yet, the majority pretends the sequester, which would  cut $72 billion in defense funding in this bill, isn't real.   I want to make it very clear that Democrats are ready to work with  our Republican colleagues to raise the caps on defense, but we must  also raise the caps on important domestic priorities. Playing politics  with the bill that funds the troops by inserting the toxic border wall  into it is really beyond the pale.   Why not include the FBI, or the entire Homeland Security bill? If the  intention is to pass security-related bills, securing our homeland goes  beyond the Department of Defense and our own budgets in the legislative  branch.   The Republican approach to funding our government for FY18 all but  guarantees a short-term, if not a full-year, continuing resolution-- just like every year. Democratic votes will be needed to enact  appropriation law, and I really do hope we will soon start to work  together again to invest responsibly in both defense and nondefense  priorities to grow the economy, create jobs, and secure the country.   As I conclude, I want to thank our distinguished chairman, Mr.  Frelinghuysen, and his outstanding staff, as well as my outstanding  staff.   The CHAIR. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself an additional 1 minute.   However, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this bill which would  waste $1.6 billion on Trump's border wall, use fraudulent defense  numbers, gut critical investments in clean energy, include poison-pill  riders, and leave the remaining spending bills with no path forward.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself an additional 1 minute.   However, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this bill which would  waste $1.6 billion on Trump's border wall, use fraudulent defense  numbers, gut critical investments in clean energy, include poison-pill  riders, and leave the remaining spending bills with no path forward.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 6 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur).    Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 6 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur).    Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 6 minutes to the  distinguished gentlewoman from California (Ms. Roybal-Allard) who is  the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Homeland Security.   Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Mr. Chairman, it is difficult to understand how a  Make America Secure Appropriations minibus does not include the bill  for the Department of Homeland Security which is responsible for  security at our borders, security in the coastal maritime environment,  security for air and surface transportation, security of cyber networks  and critical infrastructure, and helping State and local jurisdictions  prepare for, prevent, and respond to terrorist attacks and natural  disasters.   Instead of including the entire DHS funding bill in the minibus, the  majority is expected to use a second rule to insert just one part of  that bill--funding for the President's border wall--ignoring much more  pressing and immediate security needs.   Furthermore, because the Department has failed to submit to Congress  a required report laying out the long-term plan and justification for  border  [[Page H6362]]  infrastructure, Members of Congress are unable to responsibly evaluate  the long-term border security strategy and comprehensively assess its  costs, benefits, and trade-offs.   Given this enormous $1.6 billion initial price tag, Members should,  at a minimum, have the opportunity to vote on it separately and in the  context of the entire Homeland Security bill. I submitted an amendment  to prohibit the use of funds for border wall construction, and I hope  the Rules Committee will make it in order.   While I do not support the DHS bill in its current form, I firmly  believe the House would be in a stronger position to make a more  informed and responsible decision on how best to invest these $1.6  billion in the context of debating and amending the entire Department  of Homeland Security funding bill.   For example, instead of using $1.6 billion of taxpayer money for just  74 miles of border wall, we could pay for the first two heavy Coast  Guard icebreakers which are critically needed to help the United States  better counter the ever-increasing Russian presence in the Arctic.   Or we could invest in additional technology and hire thousands of new  customs officers at every air, land, and sea port of entry in the  United States, reducing wait times for travelers, better facilitating  the flow of commerce and contributing to economic growth.   This would also enhance our ability to intercept more illegal  narcotics and other contraband because, contrary to what some may  think, the vast majority of the worst illicit drugs flowing into our  country arrive through the ports of entry, not between the ports. In  2016, 86 percent of the heroin and 81 percent of the cocaine and  methamphetamine came through the ports of entry. In other words, more  physical barriers at the border--in addition to the 654 miles of  fencing already in place--is a misguided and ineffective strategy to  address drug smuggling.   In addition to the fact that we could be using these $1.6 billion for  more pressing security needs, I am concerned that, by including only  border wall funding from the DHS Appropriations bill, we would be  sending a terrible message to frontline homeland security personnel-- many of whom routinely put their personal safety at risk to serve our  country--that the President's border wall is more important than all  the work they do.    Mr. Chairman, when it comes to the security of our Nation and the  American people, we in Congress have an obligation to act in their best  interests and to invest their tax dollars wisely. If the only homeland  security item in this bill is funding for 74 miles of border wall, we  will fail to meet that obligation.   This bill should not include funding for a border wall, and the House  should have an opportunity to vote on this funding in the context of  the entire Homeland Security funding bill.   Mr. Chairman, I urge a ``no'' vote on this bill.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 6 minutes to the gentleman from  Ohio (Mr. Ryan), the distinguished ranking member of the Subcommittee  on the Legislative Branch.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Pelosi), the Democratic leader.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the Democratic whip.    I yield an additional 2 minutes to the gentleman.    I yield an additional 2 minutes to the gentleman.    I yield an additional 2 minutes to the gentleman.    Mr. Chairman, I am delighted to yield 6 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz), the ranking member of  the Subcommittee on Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and  Related Agencies.   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Chairman, I thank the distinguished  ranking member for yielding me time and for her hard work during this  arduous process. And I would also like to thank Chairman Frelinghuysen  and Chairman Dent for their hard work as well.   As we all know, the Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and  Related Agencies bill has a strong reputation for common ground and  bipartisanship. Chairman Dent, like always, set a cooperative tone and  was inclusive throughout this process. He has worked tirelessly to  address many Members' concerns, and I joined him in that effort, as  well as critical issues impacting our veterans and Active and Reserve  servicemembers.   The Military Construction portion of this minibus provides adequate  funding for both the Active and Reserve components. In addition, the  bill funds the NATO Security Investment Program at the FY17 level,  sending a strong message to our Nation's allies that we stand with them  as we continue to face evolving international threats.   For the Department of Veterans Affairs, this bill provides $3.9  billion, which is a 5.3 percent increase over FY 2017.   I am also pleased that this bill will address the issue of breast  cancer awareness and prevention and provides almost $700 million for  medical research, which will fund essential efforts, such as those to  address TBI and PTSD, develop state-of-the-art prosthetics, care for  victims of military sexual trauma, and treat veterans suffering from  mental illness.   The bill also continues to fund important programs to combat veteran  homelessness, provide our vets with effective and timely healthcare,  and improve the veteran benefits application process and appeals  process.   I am also extremely grateful for Chairman Dent's support for in vitro  fertilization and coverage for assisted reproductive technologies for  veterans who have sustained a service-connected injury that impacts  their fertility. This issue is very important to me and to so many  servicemembers. All veterans deserve to be able to start families.  Moreover, providing access to IVF is consistent with the VA's goals to  support veterans and improve their quality of life.   On a personal note, this bill will also address the issue of breast  cancer awareness and prevention.   This past spring, our subcommittee visited the Washington VA Medical  Center. We learned that the VA was relying on the controversial USPSTF  guidance for mammography in making coverage decisions.   Last Congress, we passed a law that barred private insurers from  making coverage decisions based on these guidelines through 2018.  However, the moratorium did not apply, we learned in that visit to the  VA, and so women in their forties who were veterans could be denied  coverage for mammograms. To its credit, the VA changed its guideline  regarding screening, and with Chairman Dent's support, language is  included to hold the VA to this better standard.   As I stated during my testimony before the Rules Committee, Mr.  Chairman, it is my sincere belief that if the MILCON-VA bill were being  considered as a stand-alone, as is tradition, under an open rule, it  would receive strong bipartisan support. But, unfortunately, that is  not what we are doing here today.   Instead of following regular order, we, instead, are taking up four  bills at once and adding funds to begin construction on President  Trump's irresponsible border wall that he promised Mexico would pay  for, and now taxpayers are being stuck with the bill. This fiscally and  morally irresponsible expenditure leaves the nondefense appropriations  bills grossly underfunded.   Furthermore, contrary to popular belief, this bill isn't even great  for defense. All this talk about making sure that we provide adequate  resources for our defense and our national security ignores the fact  that the Budget Control Act provides additional funds that would  ultimately be sequestered without a cap adjustment. This minibus would  breach this cap by more than $72 billion, resulting in a mandatory 13.2  percent sequester of all defense accounts, including the Military  Construction title.   And, by the way, I have said this repeatedly each time I have spoken  on this legislation, and never once has anyone in the majority  countered what I am suggesting. That is deeply troubling.   So even if this bill is signed into law, which it will not be, DOD  would not receive one dollar of this increase.   Secretary Mattis testified ``sequestration and the continued use of  continuing resolutions would result in a steady erosion of military  readiness.'' That is the only outcome this bill guarantees. By taking  up this minibus today, we are setting ourselves up for failure, and we  have set ourselves up  [[Page H6367]]  for an early fall with no real progress to be made on the FY 2018  appropriations bills.   Mr. Chairman, we cannot continue to govern in this fashion. I believe  it is time that we stop listening to the most extreme voices and get  past these unrealistic beliefs that we can cut our way to prosperity.  We cannot. If this failed philosophy persists, our work will only get  more difficult.   It is clear that passing any appropriations bill that will be signed  into law will require a bipartisan majority of both Houses. As a result  of this irresponsible posture, I will sadly be voting against the  minibus, and I look forward to working towards an appropriations  product that both parties can work on together in true bipartisan  tradition.   Mr. Chairman, lastly, before I close, I thank our staff in the  MILCON-VA bill on both the majority and the minority side: Maureen  Holohan, Sarah Young, Sue Quantius, Sean Snyder, and Tracey Russell  with the majority; and Matt Washington, Rosalyn Kumar, and Jonathan  Steinberg with the minority.     Mr. Chairman, I yield 6 minutes to the gentleman from  Indiana (Mr. Visclosky), the ranking member of the Subcommittee on  Defense.   (Mr. VISCLOSKY asked and was given permission to revise and extend  his remarks.)    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro), the ranking member of the Subcommittee on  Labor, HHS.   Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this bill.   What does this bill do?   It would force the Office of Management and Budget to issue an  across-the-board budget cut for defense spending come January.   Why?   Because the House appropriations bills exceed the defense budget  spending cap by more than $72 billion. I might add that both Democrats  and Republicans voted for these spending caps for defense spending and  for nondefense spending.   So the defense funding in the bill, their numbers are, in essence,  fake. These are fake numbers. Republicans have no plan to raise both  our need to support our national security and military readiness and  our need to support hardworking middle class families who are  struggling to get by.   So if these bills are enacted, the only way to avoid this across-the- board defense spending cut is if we had another budget deal to revise  the bipartisan Budget Control Act, which established spending caps for  defense spending and for nondefense spending.   Now, add to that, since military pay is usually exempt from budget  cuts, if this bill and the other House appropriations bills are signed  into law, the Office of Management and Budget, by law, would be  required to cut defense spending by more than 13 percent, or $72  billion. We would need a new budget agreement so that we can increase  both defense spending and nondefense spending to meet the needs of our  country.   My friends, this is not going to happen; hardly likely.   The biggest economic challenge of our time is that too many people  are in jobs that do not pay them enough to live on. We must invest in  programs that provide opportunities for hardworking Americans to be  able to improve themselves and for our economy to grow. We need a  country that works for the middle class and for the vulnerable, not  just the wealthy and those with the most lobbyists.   This budget process is irresponsible, and our military and our  hardworking families will all be shortchanged. This is unacceptable.   Congress needs to negotiate another budget deal that increases both  the defense and the nondefense spending caps. The spending levels in  the Defense bill are impossible to achieve unless there is a new budget  deal and it is reached.   So, again, the numbers are fake. If you vote ``yes'' on this, you are  voting for a pig in a poke. I urge my colleagues to vote against this  bill.    Mr. Chairman, I am delighted to yield 3 minutes to the  distinguished gentleman from Washington (Mr. Kilmer), the distinguished  vice ranking member of the committee.    Mr. Chairman, I am very pleased to yield 5 minutes to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Cuellar).    Mr. Chairman, I am very pleased to yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gene Green).   Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank our ranking  member for yielding to me.   I rise in opposition to funding for President Trump's border wall. I  have visited the border of Texas and Mexico many times. Communities all  along and beyond the border in my home State of Texas are opposed to  this border wall.   Texas has deep and historic ties with our neighbor to the south,  Mexico. The people of Texas and Mexico share a pride. A clear majority  of our communities believe that the close ties between Texas and  Mexico--cultural, economic, linguistic--benefit both Texas and Mexico.   The construction of this ``big, fat, beautiful wall,'' to quote  President Trump, along a 2,000-mile-long U.S.-Mexico border is not only  unnecessary, but would be harmful to our border communities and  wildlife and natural habitats along the border, and become a symbol of  spite and division toward Mexico and its people.                                time  1700    Much of the border between the United States and Mexico is already  separated by the Rio Grande River, a clear natural obstacle between the  two countries. High traffic areas along our Southern border are further  separated by over 650 miles of pedestrian and vehicle fencing currently  on the border.   Congress has provided the Department of Homeland Security with robust  funding since the Department's creation to sharply increase the number  of Border Patrol officers and surveillance tools, including aerial  drones along the border.   As a result of these substantial investments by the American people,  the number of immigrants without authorization has steadily declined,  while the number of border apprehensions are near a 40-year low.   The $1.6 billion funded by taxpayer dollars included in this  legislation for the President's border wall should be directed for  genuine needs, like expanding education opportunities for our children,  rebuilding our Nation's aging infrastructure.   Mr. Chairman, I ask my colleagues, if given the opportunity, to amend  the legislation before this Chamber to remove the border wall funding.  Otherwise, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me  in opposing the minibus appropriations bill.    Mr. Chairman, in closing, I want to reiterate that this  bill is a departure from regular order, wastes $1.6 billion on Trump's  border wall, uses fraudulent defense numbers, guts critical investments  in clean energy, includes poison-pill riders, leaves the remaining  spending bills with no path forward.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no,'' and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I think I closed prematurely without  thanking you for your leadership. It has been really a pleasure working  with you. I do hope that as we move the process forward, we will be  able to have a final product that we can all be very proud of. Thank  you again. You have been a very delightful person to work with.   And I thank the chairman, all my staff that has been so hardworking  and  [[Page H6371]]  so cooperative. We couldn't do this without them on both sides of the  aisle. I thank the chairman.
