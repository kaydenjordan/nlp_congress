 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express disappointment and  frustration of thousands of my constituents after our effort to bring  H.R. 82, the Social Security Fairness Act, to the floor for a vote,  which was delayed this week.   The Windfall Elimination Provision and the Government Pension Offset  are unfair, bureaucratic deductions that cheat nearly 2 million  Americans out of their earned Social Security benefits.   These rules impact our public servants--the teachers who educate our  children, firefighters and police officers who keep our communities  safe. At a time when we desperately need more men and women to enter  these fields, knowing these penalties exist deter them from pursuing  these occupations.   WEP and GPO have been in place since the 1980s and Congress has  ignored this problem for decades. I want to be clear, we are not trying  to create new entitlement programs or forgive debt. We are trying to  ensure that retirees obtain the benefits that are rightly theirs.   Just last week, I received a letter from Carla Moreau, a teacher from  Bunkie, Louisiana, who retired after spending 23 years in the  classroom.   Carla recently lost her husband, Gerard, to cancer at age 60.  However, due to WEP and GPO, she is ineligible to receive his Social  Security survivor benefits simply because she was a teacher. If Carla  had chosen any other profession outside of public service, she would  automatically receive those benefits just like any other American  would.   Mr. Speaker, Carla's story is just one of the many from across my  district and around our country, and each one is heartbreaking and  unjust. Not a single day goes by that I don't hear from a constituent  who is impacted.                                time  1030    Since I took office over 1 year ago, almost 3,000 people have  contacted my office to ask us to fix WEP and GPO--by far, the most  calls concerning a single issue.   High inflation and record price hikes continue to plague our Nation,  and now, by refusing to address WEP and GPO, this Congress is  essentially telling hardworking Americans that they must either not  retire, reenter the workforce, or find other means to make ends meet.   It is astounding to me that this administration and the Democratic  majority spend trillions to forgive student loans, bail out private  industry, and create new government programs, but the people impacted  by WEP and GPO continue to be ignored.   My colleague from Illinois, Rodney Davis, brought forward H.R. 82 to  repeal WEP and GPO. I am a proud cosponsor of this bill, along with  nearly 300 other Members of this House.   Since the 117th Congress convened, we worked together as Democrats  and Republicans to find a way to bring this bill to the floor for a  vote. After nearly a year and a half of being denied, we worked to have  it placed on the Consensus Calendar, a process that could force the  bill to come to the House floor.   Only when we were on the cusp of forcing a floor vote and had 300  Members ready to support this measure did Democratic leadership take  action to remove the legislation from the Consensus Calendar and  essentially bog it down in a backlog.   Mr. Speaker, it is unconscionable to me that some would play  procedural games and deny this body the opportunity to vote on a bill  that fixes such an obvious wrong.   What am I supposed to say to the people like Carla Moreau? That  despite the fact that we were sent here to solve problems, we will just  kick the can down the road?   Is that really the answer that we are okay with relaying to her and  the 2 million Americans who are adversely impacted?   Mr. Speaker, I was sent here to represent the people of the Fifth  District of Louisiana, and today, I can say with grave sincerity that  their voices, along with 2 million other Americans, continue to be  silenced.   Instead of my standing behind this podium today, we should be doing  the will of the people and bringing H.R. 82 to the floor for a vote.                            ____________________
