 Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support  of H.R. 2153, the Keeping Girls in School Act.   I want to thank my very good friend from Florida, Representative  Frankel, for championing this incredibly important legislation, and  also my colleague, Representative McCaul of Texas, for helping ensure  that this was through the House Foreign Affairs Committee.   I am the mother of a daughter, and from birth I let her know that she  could be anything she wanted to be. If she wanted to be a lawyer, a  doctor, a nurse, a teacher, or an engineer, she could do whatever she  wanted.   We all know too well that many girls around the world are not so  lucky. As my good friend, Representative Frankel, just talked about,  Malala of Pakistan was shot at the age of 15 returning from school. I  am very proud that the Children's Museum of Indianapolis in my home of  Indianapolis will be inducting her into the Power of Children Exhibit,  because she has fought for the human rights of girls and children being  able to go to school.   She was shot returning from school, and the Malala Fund is now  focusing on her activism and trying to make sure that girls have the  right to go to school.   As we have learned, 130 million girls don't have the opportunity to  go to school, and it is impossible for them to consider their big  dreams and goals. So this bill is about breaking down these barriers  that women and girls face in attending and staying in school.                                time  1515    We know that the evidence has already shown, if we can keep girls in  secondary education, it can boost economies of low- and middle-income  nations by as much as $92 billion, annually. It can cut childhood  deaths by 50 percent, annually. It can reduce violent conflict in  countries, and it can reduce child marriage by 66 percent, annually.   Studies show that girls between the ages of 10 and 19 are three times  more likely than boys to be kept out of school, particularly in these  countries where there is so much conflict. Yet, if we keep girls in  school past fourth grade--and we are trying to get them through high  school--we know that their wages will rise, their countries will be  better, their communities will be better.   With our foreign investments, why wouldn't we want to take all of the  incredible aid that we provide and make sure that there are strategies  in place to make sure that girls get education?   This bill outlines that inexhaustible list of 14 barriers that keep  girls from entering and remaining in secondary school. So let's bring  together the State Department, USAID, Peace Corps, Millennium  Challenge, and PEPFAR to address those challenges.   We know that young girls like Malala, who is leading the way, is a  child who is so powerful in her voice because of what she went through.  We know that, when girls succeed, nations and our world will succeed.   Madam Speaker, thank you, and I urge passage.
