 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order       for the quorum call be rescinded.         Madam President, I just had the opportunity to hear from       Senator Collins about some of the legislative accomplishments I have       had over the years, and I want to say two things. One, on so many of       those issues, it was Susan Collins--as I call her, ``the indispensable       one''--who through hard work and grit and, frankly, understanding of       the issues better than anyone else around the table, is able to succeed       in finding ways forward on tough issues that face our country. She       mentioned infrastructure as an example, but, more recently, there is       the Electoral Count Act, which I think is going to be broadly supported       by our            [[Page S9732]]            colleagues but required that kind of deep understanding and knowledge       of the issues.        Second is that there is no one more bipartisan and interested in       finding results than Senator Collins.        So I appreciate her words, but, as they say, right back at you,       Senator Collins, and thank you for your friendship and for your       willingness to put up with me over the years on so many of these       important issues.        I yield the floor.        I suggest the absence of a quorum.
