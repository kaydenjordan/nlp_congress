 Mr. Speaker, today, our prayers are with our faithful  friend and ally, Israel. The country is under attack by Hamas, a  terrorist organization that will stop at nothing to kill and destroy.   The world is watching and hoping that Iran-backed Hamas and the  Palestinian Liberation Organization will cease their destructive and  reckless attacks on Israel.   Recently, pre-COVID, I had an opportunity to visit Israel. I spoke  with one mom who talked about the horrific decision they are faced with  at times. When the alarm goes off, when the missiles are coming in  Israel, they know they have about 13 seconds to make it to a shelter,  and they are faced with the decision of: Which child on the playground  do you take with you?   This has got to stop. Israel's actions are a clear example of a  nation committed to duty and responsibility of protecting their  citizens. We know that Israel will continue to need our support, even  after this attack subsides.   While other nations fueled by anti-Semitism act to boycott, divest,  and sanction Israel, the U.S. hopes for prosperity and flourishing for  the Israeli people. As such, we support continued economic cooperation  and bold security assistance that benefits Israelis and Americans  alike.   We applaud and stand by the accomplishments of the Trump  administration to improve peace in the Middle East. We recognize  Jerusalem as the true capital of Israel. We affirm Israel's sovereignty  over the Golan Heights. We celebrate the historic Abraham Accords,  reestablishing diplomatic ties between Israel and their regional  neighbors.   We oppose efforts within the U.N. to undermine Israel on the global  stage. We also oppose Iran's nuclear ambitions and call for the United  States to withdraw from the Iran deal.   While the Washington left remains weak on Israel, the American people  stand strongly in support of the Israeli people. It is time for  Democrats to reject the extreme left, anti-American, anti-Israel, pro- Marxist agenda. They need to work with Republicans to pass a bill to  provide security aid to the Israeli Government.                                time  2015
