 Mr. President, climate change is a clear and present  danger, but we can confront that danger in a way that presents new  economic opportunities. While the Trump Administration has abdicated  American leadership on this critical issue, Congress must fight back,  which is why today I am introducing the Healthy Climate and Family  Security Act for the first time in the U.S. Senate.   Two of the most pressing challenges we face as a Nation are the need  to address the economic costs and public health risks associated with  climate change, and to strengthen the middle class. We do both in this  bill. By capping carbon emissions, selling permits, and returning 100  percent of the revenue to everyone equally, this `Cap and Dividend'  approach achieves necessary greenhouse gas reductions while boosting  the purchasing power of families across the country.   Mr. President, the Healthy Climate and Family Security Act is a  simple, effective, and transparent way to combat climate change while  supporting economic growth and a thriving middle class. The solution is  market based, pro-growth, and is built to last.   The bill achieves reductions in greenhouse gas emissions while  increasing incomes for Americans. It places a declining cap on carbon  pollution each year to reach 80 percent below 2005 levels by 2050. A  polluter pays principle is then applied by requiring the first sellers  of carbon to buy permits for emissions within those caps. Finally, 100  percent of the revenue raised from the sale of those permits is  returned straight to the American people through a Healthy Climate  Dividend. On an economy-wide level, the price signal placed on carbon  pollution will accelerate innovation and incentivize both greater  energy efficiency as well as greater use of lower-carbon energy  alternatives. And the bill's robust border adjustment protections  ensure that U.S. companies are not disadvantaged against foreign  competitors at home or abroad.   In sum, this legislation puts a price on carbon pollution and returns  the proceeds directly to the American people at the same time it  accelerates the growth of good paying jobs in clean technologies. It is  a win-win-win, boosting middle class pocketbooks, growing good paying  jobs, and reducing our carbon footprint.  [[Page S552]]    Mr. President, I am pleased that Representative Don Beyer of  Virginia, a strong advocate for the environment, is introducing a  companion measure in the House. I want to thank Mike Tidwell of the  Chesapeake Climate Action Network, who has been helpful in developing  this legislation. Other organizations such as the League of  Conservation Voters and the Sierra Club are supportive of this  approach. I look forward to working together to address the most  pressing environmental problem of our time: climate change.                            ____________________     Mr. President, climate change is a clear and present  danger, but we can confront that danger in a way that presents new  economic opportunities.
