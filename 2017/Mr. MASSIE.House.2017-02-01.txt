 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues, Sam Johnson and  [[Page H836]]  Ralph Abraham, for sponsoring this joint resolution. I would also like  to point out that my colleague from Colorado is a member of the Second  Amendment Caucus, and he has been working hard on this issue.    H.J. Res. 40 would strike down a rule that was finalized by the  Social Security Administration just days before the close of the 114th  Congress. This rule is yet another example of the previous  administration's last-ditch efforts to attack our Second Amendment  rights.   Any attempt to curtail the right of Americans to defend themselves  and their liberty is untenable. This scheme is particularly appalling  because of whom it targets and how the administration sought to  implement the rule.   The rule targets our grandparents, our elderly mothers and fathers  who have been awarded disability benefits and have had a family member  or guardian appointed to handle their finances. They haven't committed  a crime or demonstrated that they were a danger to society. There is no  trial, no presumption of innocence. Their names are sent to the NICS  database and their firearms are taken away, their right to own a  firearm.   Hardened criminals don't have their rights violated to that extent  without due process, so why would it be acceptable for our seniors?   These men and women have worked hard to raise families, worked a job,  and paid their fair share of taxes. Now they are being told that, in  order to receive their Social Security benefits, they must first  surrender the fundamental right to defend themselves. Is this the level  of pettiness to which we have sunk?   The House and the American people have soundly rejected gun control  in all of its forms year after year; yet this last administration  bypassed the legislative process, imposed a rule, and completely  disregarded due process in order to strip seniors of their  constitutional rights. Our seniors deserve better than that.   This rule is not about protecting anyone. This rule should be seen  for what it truly is: awful, politically motivated, and a dangerous  infringement on our Second Amendment rights.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, I am not sure where to begin, because I have  heard so many fascinating things here today.   The distinguished chairman of the Rules Committee said we are here  today to enunciate the rules. I don't know what there is to enunciate.  The only thing to enunciate is this is a closed rule. It is yet another  closed rule. There is no opportunity to have any real deliberation, no  real discussion. On top of that, there were no hearings on any of this  stuff.   No matter what your position is, I have to be honest with you,  listening to the gentleman, Mr. Massie, just speak, I think it would  have been nice if the Judiciary Committee could have actually had a  hearing on this and maybe delved into some of the issues that the  gentleman raised.   When people say that there is no due process, I would remind them  that, under the rule, impacted beneficiaries are notified that this  determination is being considered and they are provided a process to  challenge that determination. Should the Social Security Administration  determine that that recipient is able to safely use or possess guns,  rights are restored and the person's name is removed from NICS. That is  what it says.   Now, if there is a way to improve this, I am all for improving it;  but by passing this measure here today, you prevent the agencies that  are impacted here from ever being able to revisit the issue unless  Congress deemed it appropriate.   So we are not trying to fix anything here. Basically, what we are  doing is the bidding of the National Rifle Association to eliminate  anything aimed at protecting people from gun violence in this country.   The gentleman from Colorado talked about the fact that his  constituents want the right to protect their rights for life, liberty,  and the pursuit of happiness. Well, my constituents want that, too, but  they have a right to not have to be victims of gun violence. They have  a right to protect their loved ones who may use a weapon against  themselves or their family members.   But again, we can have this argument on whether or not we should do  more--and I believe we should--to protect people in this country from  gun violence, but that discussion ought to have happened first in the  Judiciary Committee, at a minimum, not in the Rules Committee. I am on  the Rules Committee. I admire the intellect of everybody on the Rules  Committee, but our expertise is not on judiciary matters.   Similarly, on the other rule that is being repealed, the Financial  Services Committee should have deliberated on that. I think there are  some serious issues raised by repealing that rule, issues that I think  go to the heart of corruption not only here in the United States, but  around the world.   When the chairman of the Rules Committee got up and gave his  description that somehow the U.S. oil companies are only being singled  out, it makes my case why we should have had a hearing. What he just  said, in my opinion, does not reflect reality.   The fact of the matter is, I looked at section 1504 of Dodd-Frank. It  doesn't just require all extractive companies in the U.S. It says that  all extractive companies, U.S. and foreign, listed on the U.S.  exchanges are to publicly disclose the payments they make to  governments for oil, gas, and mining resources.                                time  1315    And then, on top of that--and I said this earlier--is that other  countries have followed suit. Canada and the European Union and Norway  have all passed similar laws. It is not just the United States being  singled out. That is just wrong. Maybe, if we had a hearing in the  committee of jurisdiction, that would have been clear, and this  wouldn't be a point of contention.   The fact of the matter is, it is a simple reporting requirement. It  places no limits or restrictions on who companies can pay money to or  how much or for what. It has absolutely no regulatory effect on any  aspect of their business operations. There is absolutely no benefit to  nullifying this commonsense law unless your objective is to make it  easier for corrupt elites to steal money. The rule has no regulatory  impact on business operation and does not define illegal or improper  payments. It is a simple reporting requirement.   There is a problem with corruption, especially in places like Russia.  Now, I know with the new administration, Russia is now in, and we are  all supposed to say nice things about Russia. But Russia has a terrible  record on human rights, and Russia has a terrible record when it comes  to corruption, and we know that. We ought to not just cave to  everything that Russia wants, and Russia and Big Oil want this  repealed.   So I would say to my colleagues that we can argue about the merits of  all of this, and that is fine, but I go back to my original point. This  is the rule, and the Speaker of the House talked about the importance  of regular order. I have heard my colleagues talk about the importance  of regular order. We don't have regular order. You are all out of  order. We end up coming to the floor with legislation that is always  under restrictive processes, and most of the time now, in this new  Congress, completely closed rules. That doesn't just disadvantage  Democratic lawmakers who may have some ideas or may want to raise some  issues, it disadvantages Republicans who may want to come to the floor  with thoughtful ideas.   I urge my colleagues to absolutely vote ``no'' on this rule because,  again, we are getting into this habit where it is closed, closed,  closed, closed, closed, and it undermines the integrity of this House  of Representatives. It really is shameful.   Finally, I will urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous  question so that we can have a debate and a vote on overturning  President Trump's awful, discriminatory executive orders on  immigration. It jeopardizes our national security. It was carelessly  implemented, carelessly put together. It is shameful. It is  unconscionable that we are confronted with the mess that we are  confronted with now.   I know it is uncomfortable to talk about issues that impact the new  President who is of your party, but this  [[Page H837]]  is absolutely the right thing to do. And if you want to vote no on  these things, vote no on them, but allow us to have the debate and  allow us to have the vote. I urge ``no'' on the previous question and  ``no'' on the rule.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
