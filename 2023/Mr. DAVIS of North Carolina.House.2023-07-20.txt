 Madam Speaker, I rise to celebrate the  passage of the Securing Growth and Robust Leadership in American  Aviation Act. This achievement is the result of bipartisan efforts  representing a significant step forward in transforming our Nation's  aviation industry while addressing the issues and delays that flyers  have faced over the last year.   I am particularly delighted by provisions in the bill which  specifically focus on upgrading airport infrastructure and addressing  workforce shortages in the aviation sector.   With increased funding for airport infrastructure upgrades, we are  supporting nonhub airports like Pitt-Greenville Airport, enabling them  to modernize their facilities. Additionally, large airports will expand  capacity, enhancing safety measures and fostering economic growth.   I am committed to ensuring the effective implementation of these  policies as we continue to advocate for measures that promote safety,  economic viability, and a bright future for aviation in eastern North  Carolina and beyond.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I hereby remove my name  as a cosponsor of H.R. 4637.
