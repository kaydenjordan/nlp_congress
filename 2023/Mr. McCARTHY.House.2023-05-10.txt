 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Green for his work.   Mr. Speaker, when we took the majority and Mr. Green became chairman,  he didn't stay in Washington to figure out what the problem was. He  actually took his committee to the border to see firsthand.   Mr. Speaker, unfortunately, the ranking member on the other side  wouldn't attend. He stands up speaker after speaker thinking he knows  what is happening on the border from far away in Washington.   I have been to the border four times in the past 3 years. I have seen  the fear in the eyes of the ranchers who have had their property broken  into. I have heard the frustration in the voice of the Border Patrol  agents who are stretched to the limit.   Mr. Speaker, 2\1/2\ years ago, when I went to the border, I sat with  the agents in El Paso. They told me they saw something different that  they hadn't seen before. They were actually catching people on the  terrorist watch list. I came down and had a press conference and  announced what they told me.   Mr. Speaker, I would have thought that the Members on the other side  of the aisle, knowing what has happened with 9/11 and others, that they  would rise up in a united front to protect America.   Do you know what I heard from my colleagues on the other side of the  aisle? They said that I was lying. They said that they had as much  security clearance as I did, that it must not be true. In Washington,  they thought they knew all, but they didn't go to the border to  actually talk to the people who work right there.   It is interesting, though, that the next day, the administration had  to say it was true. Do you know what the administration did then? They  withheld the information from Congress so they could no longer find out  how many people we would catch on the terrorist watch list. They wanted  to deny knowing going forward.   My good friend on the other side of the aisle, the ranking member of  the Homeland Security Committee, I am sure he knows that, in the month  of February, we caught more people on the terrorist watch list in this  1 month than the entire time of the last administration.   In the last administration, the 4 years of everybody who came across  on the terrorist watch list, this February, more came across. I am sure  from far away he might probably think that is not true, too.   Mr. Speaker, I felt the sorrow in the words of the mothers and  fathers who lost their children to fentanyl. Do you know what? You can  stay in Washington if you want, and you will still hear the sorrows of  the mothers and the fathers.   Today alone, 300 Americans will be poisoned by fentanyl. It is the  equivalent of an airline crashing each and every day in America. I  don't hear them rising up. Every day there are 300. They come from all  walks of life.   Mr. Speaker, they want to stand and say ``no'' to H.R. 2. I want them  to look in the eyes of the parents of the young children. They didn't  buy fentanyl when they died. They were at college and bought Xanax. It  doesn't just happen to the kids who are maybe into partying or others.   Just last year, on spring break, six kids OD'd in Florida. They  didn't belong to a fraternity. They went to West Point. They didn't buy  fentanyl. They all didn't take cocaine. Four of them did. The other two  simply gave them mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.   Do you know what? Vote ``no.'' Go ahead and vote ``no.'' If you won't  lead, we will. If you want to take the same approach as the President,  that you want to ignore a problem and say it is not happening, we won't  sit back. We don't sit back in Washington. We go to the border to  actually see what is going on. We listen. We learn. Then, we sit in  committee.    Even though your committee went and had a hearing--I am sure they are  very proud that they protested and didn't go. Who lost? More Americans  lost. More Americans will die by their actions. For their sake and for  our Nation's safety, we must secure our border.   This is President Biden's record on the border: record crossings,  record carelessness, and record chaos. More than 11,000 people were  caught yesterday crossing the border illegally, the highest single-day  total ever.   Mr. Speaker, I look forward to hearing what the ranking member's  quote is coming forward. Maybe he will quote the Secretary that the  border is secure and believe him. You sit in Washington.   What is the administration's plan for these 11,000? According to NBC  News, the plan--it is brilliant; listen to it--is to release many of  them into the United States with no court dates and no way to track  them. That worked so well in the past. Just ask the 85,000 children  that the Biden administration lost.   Mr. Speaker, I look forward to hearing the other side get up and tell  me why they are voting ``no.''   They don't want to find these 85,000 kids? Don't take my word for it.  This comes from The New York Times.   Tomorrow, as you sit here in debate and fight to make sure the border  is still wide open, title 42 expires. Everyone knows we are days away  from disaster. The mayor of El Paso, which recently declared a state of  emergency, says: ``There is no light at the end of the tunnel. We are  preparing for the unknown.''   The Governor of Arizona says that President Biden has been  unresponsive. Governor Abbott of Texas rightly pointed out that this is  not a Texas problem. This is a problem for the entire United States.   Mr. Speaker, I heard President Biden say yesterday that lifting title  42 means it is going to be chaotic for a little while. With all due  respect, Mr. President, it has been chaotic for 2 years because of your  actions.                                time  1915    On the very day President Biden took office, he decided against the  advice of the border security experts, and he single-handedly removed  the successful border policies of the previous administration.   The first thing President Biden did was he stopped construction of  the border wall. He spends money now just to house the equipment and  materials. He halted deportation. He ended remain in Mexico, and he  called for amnesty for millions of people who broke the law.   His actions sent a clear message to the world, including the cartels:  the border is open.  [[Page H2223]]    I remember on one of my trips down to the border right after the  President took office, we had a new facility built. That day they hit a  record number at the facility that they thought would never make  capacity, but they did. As we walked in, we interviewed those who were  standing in line.   We asked them: Why did you come?   They said: President Biden told us to. He told us the border was  open.   We asked: How long was the trek?   Weeks, months, but the President invited us.   The world listened, and the cartels acted.   To this day, the southern border is being flooded by illegal aliens  from more than 140 countries: Yemen, Russia, China, and others.   Yet, how has this administration responded?   A responsible administration would have told the American people in  clear terms that this is a crisis. However, the Biden administration  tells the public that there is no crisis. Rather than leveling with the  American people, the Biden administration is choosing to mislead them.   I don't know if the ranking leader has ever been to Tucson, Arizona,  but I was there recently. In Tucson, Arizona, the cartels control the  border. Every single person who comes across that border wears a  camouflage outfit. On their feet and on their shoes is a piece of rug.  Seventy-one percent who come across that border are single males. They  don't run up to the border agents. They run from them. It is one of the  highest areas of get-aways.   It is a large terrain. Every day Americans risk their lives to go  rescue people on the cliffs who have fallen. We took balloons up so we  could actually calculate who was coming across.   When this became such a reported case, do you know what the Biden  administration did, Mr. Speaker?   They cut the number of balloons.   Do you know why?   Because they said the numbers would go down. That is how they want to  deal with it. They want to lie to the American public.   There is no better example than Secretary Mayorkas' comments that the  border is secure.   Mr. Speaker, I hope the ranking member gets up after me, and I would  like him to answer one question: Does he believe Secretary Mayorkas  that the border is secure?   You have been chairman. You are ranking now. I am sure at some time  you went to the border--but not when your committee did and not when we  wanted to work on this bill.   You wanted to protest. You wanted to not go because you could learn  everything you needed from right here in Washington--maybe from the  Secretary.   I would like to know how many of you who stand up and say that you  are going to vote against H.R. 2 believe Secretary Mayorkas?   Do you believe the border is secure?   Honestly, tell us. Tell the American public if that is what you  believe.   Everyone knows that isn't true.   You can't say the border is secure when more than 4.5 million people  have crossed our border illegally in the 24 months since President  Biden has taken office.   There is not one piece of legislation that has changed from one  administration to the other. The only thing that changed was the  President.   And what did President Biden do?   He lifted all the actions of President Trump and President Obama.  That is what happened to our border.   You can't say the border is secure when more than 175 individuals on  the terrorist watch list have tried to cross our border.   You can't say the border is secure when human trafficking has grown  into a multibillion-dollar business for the cartels.   You can't say the border is secure when you don't control the border  and when the number one employer in some of these border towns is the  cartels.   You can't say the border is secure when I sit there with a mayor, who  happens to be from the other party, and he tells me a personal story  that his daughter called, and he told her not to go outside because  there was a car chase, a car chase because a cartel hired a young  American to drive somebody they put across, and the car was going  through--it is not an unusual thing. It happens often. Schools there,  they would tell me they had to close for 45 days.   This car chase ended like others. It killed an innocent American, an  innocent American who was going to a retirement party. She was a 65- year-old grandmother. She was going to have her friends celebrate a  life of work and was looking forward to the times, with all the work  and investment she had put in, to spend with her grandchildren and  travel, but, no, her life was taken from her. And the Secretary said  that our border is secure.   If you would travel to these towns, then you would know this too. If  you would spend the time, then you would understand.   You see, Mr. Speaker, many of those elected officials aren't  Republicans. They are Americans. They are registered as Democrats. They  say they are disgusted by what this administration is doing.   While the Biden administration is missing in action, House  Republicans are going to take action. We spent 2 years listening to  those who have lived through the border crisis: Border Patrol agents,  ranchers, families, businesses, and local leaders.    When I was in Tucson, I sat with a rancher. He told me that he has  found five dead bodies on his ranch. His grandson, 7 years old, found  one just last year. This is human life. Fifty-two died in a tractor  trailer.   I sat with one who told me the story that when he looked down the  road, he saw three young children, one not even 1, the other 3, and the  other 4. Had the rancher not found them, they wouldn't be alive.   What about those who don't make it?   What about those who don't pay the cartels?   I sat with one news-covering agent who told the story of a woman who  didn't pay the cartels, so the cartels took her life. They didn't just  take her life. They wanted to show it to everybody in the world. So  they strung her body up in a tree, cut her legs off, and set her on  fire.   You see, if you go to the border, you will learn these stories. You  will actually know what is happening there. So I don't think you would  take a partisan position. You wouldn't talk in talking points. You  would actually believe that 4.5 million people in the last year came  across. If 11,000 came across yesterday--title 42 is going to be  lifted.   If you don't like our bill, what is your answer?   What is your plan?   What are you going to do?   As I promised, we brought their government to them--visiting the  border, gathering facts, and holding hearings.   What we learned directly informed not only our Commitment to America,  but also the Secure the Border Act.   Here is what this bill does:   It fully provides for effective border enforcement policies,  infrastructure, and advanced technology.   It increases the number of Border Patrol agents and gives them the  bonus pay they deserve.   It ends catch and release and strengthens current laws to protect  unaccompanied children from exploitation by human traffickers. I hope  everybody who votes ``no'' reads The New York Times. I hope you read  the stories about these young children.   It reinstates the so-called remain in Mexico provisions.   And it resumes construction of the border wall because the border  wall works.   The Secure the Border Act is the strongest border security bill to  come through Congress in more than 100 years.   If it passes, I am confident that we will stop the flood of fentanyl  into our country, solve the Biden border crisis, and support our Border  Patrol agents so they can continue to keep us safe.   Fentanyl is the number one killer of Americans between the ages of 18  and 45.   If anybody thinks about their life between the ages of 18 and 45,  those are the years in which you reproduce. Those are your most  productive years in business. Those are the years of those who  volunteer to serve in the military to defend our freedom.   Right now, the most productive population age in our country is being  killed.   However, I listen to the other side, and they are going to say: ``No,  continue it.''  [[Page H2224]]    By the actions of this President, Mr. Ranking Member, you don't have  to go to the border because now every city is a border city.   You see, in my hometown of Bakersfield, in the elementary school, a  father registered his son just after Thanksgiving. The public school  district did a really good job. They noticed in 2 days this boy had an  issue. They didn't sit back, they went to his house, and they met with  his father.   They said: We feel your son has a challenge learning and other  things. We want to work with you, and we want to help him.   Literally, they went to his house in 2 days. They watched him as he  came to school.   Do you know what he did when he came to school?   He walked over to a vape room. He had a backpack, and he came into  the class. They looked in the backpack. He had 150 pills. This kid was  not even 16 years old. I think he was only 12. The counselor took out a  pill to see what it was. They had to call an ambulance because the  counselor touched a fentanyl pill.   I am far from the border. Just up the road in my district, they  pulled over a car. I believe it had more than 500,000 fentanyl pills.  California law says you couldn't ask the individuals if they were  citizens--and they weren't.   I can't tell you how much jail time they got because in California  they believe in a lot of your policies, and so the individuals didn't  even have to have bail. They both got a ticket and were told to show  back up. They never did. They probably got back in the car  and delivered more of those fentanyl pills coming across the border. Of  those 300 Americans who will die today, I am not sure if one of those  pills was theirs.    I do know this: Tomorrow when I cast a ``yes'' vote for H.R. 2, we  are doing something to stop the fentanyl. We are doing something for  those families. We are doing something for the next generation of  Americans.   If you believe that the rule of law is one of the greatest strengths  of this Nation, you cannot keep it if you have millions of people who  break it by entering it.   There is no nation as generous as America. One million people will  become citizens this year, and one million more next year. We are  different from any other nation, but what we have today is something  that we don't even control: our own operation of our borders.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the Secure  the Border Act, vote ``yes'' on security over chaos, and vote ``yes''  to stop fentanyl killing our children.
