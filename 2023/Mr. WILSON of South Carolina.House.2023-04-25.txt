 Mr. Speaker, as the United States has  only 5 percent of the world population, the remaining 95 percent are  job opportunities for South Carolina.   Last year, the Palmetto State achieved $32 billion in net export  sales. The top industries included: vehicles, nuclear reactors,  plastics, aircraft, and rubber tires. South Carolina exports reached  196 countries, topped by Canada, Germany, Mexico, and South Korea.   The State leads in export sales of motor vehicles with $10 billion  from BMW, Volvo, and Mercedes-Benz. Additionally, South Carolina is a  leading manufacturer and exporter of tires by Michelin, Bridgestone,  Giti, Continental, and Trelleborg.   In 2020, over 4,400 companies in South Carolina exported goods,  creating 116,000 jobs, promoted by Governor Henry McMaster and Commerce  Secretary Harry Lightsey.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, who successfully protected  America for 20 years as the global war on terrorism continues moving  from the Afghanistan safe haven to America.   Welcome to President Yoon Suk Yeol of South Korea who will address  Congress on Thursday as a champion for democracy.  [[Page H1921]]                                ____________________
