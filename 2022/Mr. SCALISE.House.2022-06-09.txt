 Madam Speaker, I rise to inquire of the House majority  leader the schedule for next week.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), my  friend and the majority leader of the House.    Madam Speaker, I wanted to ask, specifically, there was  some talk that we may today take up the Senate bill, the bill that  passed over a month ago in the Senate, to give stronger protections to  Supreme Court Justices and their families.   Of course, yesterday, something that angers a lot of us--Justice  Kavanaugh, there was an arrest of a man that was at his house,  attempting to murder Supreme Court Justice Kavanaugh. This is something  we have expressed concern about for weeks, especially some of the  language directed at Supreme Court Justices, people encouraging people  to go to their houses.   There was a bill that had bipartisan support that passed the Senate  over a month ago to give them stronger protections. We thought that may  come up today. I don't hear it on the schedule. Can we get a vote on  that bill when we come back early next week on the suspension calendar  to get that bill sent to the President's desk to get that in motion  quickly?   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman.    Madam Speaker, I hope that we can get that early in the  week put on the suspension calendar, in the form the Senate sent over  where there is broad agreement on both sides of the aisle, and get that  to the President's desk to get those stronger protections in place.   Finally, I would like to ask the gentleman, we have talked about this  bill a number of times, H.R. 6858, which is a bill dealing with  American energy independence, to open up more areas of our country to  American energy production so that we don't have to be reliant on  foreign countries, whether it is Russia, Venezuela, Iran or, now, the  President is going to go to plead with Saudi to produce more energy  when America has more energy that we could be producing that we can't  because of current policies by President Biden.   This would open those up. It would allow us to lower gas prices. It  would allow relief to families who are struggling because of these  energy policies that are hurting our ability to produce in America and  making us more dependent on countries that are cartels or monopolies,  whether it is OPEC or other countries where they want they want a  higher price. They want to limit production.    We want to open up American energy, and that is what that package of  legislation would do.   Can we get that bill added to the calendar quickly, hopefully next  week, so that we can help get relief to families who are trying to plan  a family vacation and can't afford to pay $4.50, $5 a gallon or more  for gasoline?   I yield to the gentleman.    Madam Speaker, hopefully, we can get that addressed as  well so that we can tackle some of these other problems: inflation,  high gas prices, border issues that we are trying to bring legislation  on.   If the gentleman has nothing else, Madam Speaker, I yield back the  balance of my time.                            ____________________
