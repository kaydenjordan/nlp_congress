 Madam President, I rise to speak again today  about the crisis in Venezuela--a defining human rights issue of our  time.   Nicolas Maduro is starving his own people, and innocent children are  dying. It is a genocide right here in our hemisphere. Every day that  passes, the situation in Venezuela grows more dire.   The United States and all freedom-loving countries around the world  must do more. As Governor, I strictly prohibited the State of Florida,  including all State agencies, from investing in any company that did  business with Maduro's repressive regime.   I am grateful for the bipartisan support this bill has received, and  I specifically thank Senator Rosen for her leadership and for joining  me in this effort.   We must never give up on the fight for freedom, and I look forward to  all of my colleagues joining me in support of the people of Venezuela.   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to address the Senate in  Spanish.    I stand with the people of Venezuela and will  always fight for freedom and democracy in Latin America.   I understand my colleague has an objection. I am disappointed, but I  look forward to working with him to address his concerns.   Thank you.
