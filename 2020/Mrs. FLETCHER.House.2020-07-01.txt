 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the Patient  Protection and Affordable Care Enhancement Act.   At this unprecedented moment in our country's history, when the novel  coronavirus has made plain the vital need for affordable and accessible  healthcare for people across our country, I was proud to cast my vote  in favor of this bill, which builds on the Affordable Care Act.   Ten years ago, the Affordable Care Act expanded access to healthcare  for millions across Texas and across the country. Since that time, we  have also learned of critical improvements needed to the ACA to ensure  that care is both affordable and accessible.   This bill lowers the cost of prescription drugs, caps premiums, and  protects people with preexisting conditions.   Vitally important for Texas, with the highest rate of uninsured  people in the country, this bill encourages States that haven't  expanded Medicaid to do so. And I will work with leaders in Texas to  make sure that we do.   These are priorities for people across my district, across my State,  and across our country. As we battle this public health crisis, I am  glad the legislation that is necessary and timely has passed the House,  and I urge the Senate to do the same.                            ____________________
