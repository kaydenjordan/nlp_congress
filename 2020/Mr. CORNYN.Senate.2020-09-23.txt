 Mr. President, as we all know, President Trump will  announce his nominee to fill the seat vacated by the death of Justice  Ruth Bader Ginsburg. The Senate is prepared  [[Page S5820]]  to examine the qualifications of that nominee and hold a vote here on a  timely basis.   This, of course, is set in line with the precedent set by Presidents  and Senates that were elected long before we became Members of this  body or were even born, and we are prepared to follow suit. There were  29 times when there was a vacancy during the election year where the  party occupying the White House and the majority of the Senate were the  same, and 29 times there were confirmation processes, and it will be  the same again this year with the 30th.   As always, we will be thorough. As a member of the Judiciary  Committee, I have had the privilege of participating in a number of  confirmation hearings for Supreme Court Justices. I know every member  of the committee takes this job very seriously--our role of advice and  consent under the Constitution. We will not rush the process. Every  Member of this body will have an opportunity to vote for or against the  nominee once the nominee is voted out of the Judiciary Committee.   But it seems that for our friends on the other side of the aisle,  precedent is not enough. The prospect of another Trump-appointed  Supreme Court Justice has mobilized our Democratic colleagues to launch  an attack that has been months in the making on our very independent  judiciary.   One of the hallmarks of our Constitution and our democracy is an  independent judiciary--an umpire, if you will--that will mediate the  fight between the executive and legislative branches and rule on the  very constitutionality of the laws that are passed. Long before this  vacancy even existed, though, our Democratic colleagues were sounding  the alarm, suggesting they would expand or pack the Supreme Court with  liberal Justices that will rubberstamp the political results they could  not achieve through legislation.   During the Presidential primary this year, candidates were especially  eager to share their vision for a larger and solidly liberal Supreme  Court. A number of our Senate colleagues were among those open to the  idea, including the current Democratic candidate for Vice President,  the Senator from California.   Over the last several months, Democrats in both the House and the  Senate, including House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, have  expressed an interest in upending the integrity of the Supreme Court  and its role in leading the independent judicial branch. Once the  Supreme Court vacancy went from a possibility to a reality, these  comments have now turned into threats.   Over the weekend, the junior Senator from Massachusetts tweeted that  ``when Democrats control the Senate in the next Congress, we must  abolish the filibuster and expand the Supreme Court.''   The Senator from New York, the minority leader himself, reportedly  told his Members on a call this weekend, which was reported in social  media: ``Nothing is off the table.''   Now, mistreatment of conservative nominees to the courts is nothing  new, including 2 years ago, when Democrats waged an all-out smear  campaign against Justice Kavanaugh. But now, even before the nominee is  announced, our Democratic colleagues are taking aim at the institution  itself.   We know this isn't the first time that our colleagues have floated  institutional changes to shift the political tide in their favor. When  they lost the Senate majority, they decided they wanted to add new  States. They are uninterested in bipartisanship. So they want to end  the legislative filibuster. And now they threaten to pack the court  with liberal Justices to give them a political outcome. They are taking  the saying, ``if you can't win the game, change the rules,'' to a whole  new level.   This isn't just political gamesmanship anymore. It is an assault on  the Constitution itself, along with the integrity of our article III  courts and our system of checks and balances. This court-packing threat  isn't new. It preceded the death of Justice Ginsburg in the creation of  the vacancy that we will soon consider, but they are now trying to  rebrand the reasoning behind it.   Since the idea was previously viewed as too radical by members of  their own party, with even Justice Ginsburg opposing it, they are  trying to shift the blame to Republicans. By following the precedent of  29 judicial confirmation hearings occurring during an election year and  undermining or challenging the Senate's constitutional duty to provide  advice and consent, our Democratic colleagues claim that it is we who  are responsible for an attack on democracy. They, in effect, are  holding the Supreme Court hostage in saying: Don't make me kill the  hostage.   Democrats aren't just trying to prevent a single conservative Justice  from joining the Court. They are trying to dismantle the very  institution itself. The Supreme Court has had nine Justices for more  than 150 years. As the balance has shifted in many different directions  over the years, Members of Congress have respectfully refrained from  engaging in such dangerous threats.   This isn't just about a conservative Justice or a liberal Justice. It  is about preserving one of our most basic institutions--a free and  independent judiciary.                               Economic Growth    Mr. President, now on another matter, by virtually any measure our  economy was booming at the start of this year. Successful reforms under  the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act allowed workers to keep more of what they  earned and gave job creators the freedom to create new economic  opportunities for the American people.   Within the first 2 years of these changes, we experienced record  gains in employment and increases in household income for families  across the country, including Hispanic and African-American households.  New census data paints a clear picture of just how strong the economy  was in 2019. The median household income reached an all-time high of  $68,700. That is a 6.8-percent increase over the previous year. Not  only that, if you look at the dollar amount alone, it is almost double  the next highest dollar amount in annual growth.   As I said, Black and Hispanic Americans each experienced a higher  than average growth rate and historically low unemployment rates.  Median earnings increased 7.8 percent for women, compared to 2.5  percent for men, representing progress in the fight to close the pay  gap.   The benefits of our booming market, though, didn't stop there. The  new jobs and opportunities created during this boom drew more workers  who had been on the sidelines into the labor market, and the result was  spectacular. The poverty rate dropped to 10.5 percent, which is the  lowest since 1959. Every population group made gains. Regardless of  race, gender, age, disability status, or marital status, each group  experienced a decline in the poverty rate.   Make no mistake about it. We still have a long way to go to ensure  that no family in America lives in poverty, but we also ought to be  willing to assess progress when progress is made. There is no doubt  that our economic engine was humming and the American people were  seeing and feeling the benefits of our strong economy every single day.  And then, of course, the pandemic hit. Suddenly, after years of adding  new jobs and creating economic opportunities for millions of Americans,  it felt like the gains we made were erased in the blink of an eye.   Through no fault of their own, businesses were forced to close their  doors to help slow the spread of the virus, and with no tables to wait  on, customers to serve, or travelers to accommodate, millions of  workers were left without a way to earn a living. Well-meaning  employers, sadly, handed their workers pink slips and said they hoped  to have jobs for them to come back to once the pandemic was in the  rearview mirror.   Until that could happen, millions of Americans relied on enhanced  unemployment benefits, which ended at the end of July, including an  extra $600 a week in Federal benefits. But there are still families  across Texas struggling to make ends meet, and there are workers  waiting to return to their jobs with no end in sight.   While we have made progress against the virus, we have to make  progress, too, in recovering our economy. In the beginning, restaurants  and retailers began adding curbside service and delivery to regain some  income, and throughout most of Texas now, these  [[Page S5821]]  businesses are able to open to 75 percent of capacity. Gladly, we are  seeing more and more workers returning to work and our children  returning to school.   In Texas, unemployment has steadily declined from a peak of 13.5  percent to 6.8 percent in August. I think a lot of that progress is due  to the success of the CARES Act and, especially, the Paycheck  Protection Program, which sent more than $41 billion in more than  417,000 different loans to small businesses in Texas alone.   I am still hoping that we can come to an agreement on another  coronavirus relief bill that would extend the Paycheck Protection  Program and provide some enhanced level of Federal employment benefits,  but those measures alone will not support our economic recovery. We  know that regaining lost ground will not happen overnight. It is going  to take time for our country to return to the pre-pandemic economy that  the President and Republican Senate fought so hard to achieve.   As we consider the most effective ways to tune up our economic  engine, our guiding principle should be that of the doctor-patient  oath--the Hippocratic oath: First, do no harm.   Raising trillions of dollars in new taxes, as a number of leading  Democrats have suggested, would be counterproductive. It wouldn't grow  the economy. It would kill the economy. In 2009, as the Nation was  fighting to recover from the 2008 recession, President Obama was asked  about the possibility of raising taxes, and he didn't mince words. He  said: The last thing you want to do is raise taxes in the middle of a  recession.   That is exactly right, but that is exactly the opposite of what the  leading Democratic candidates, including the Democratic nominee for  President, are advocating. They are advocating for a huge tax increase,  even as we are hopefully closer to the end of the pandemic than we are  the beginning. It is just the wrong medicine for what ails our economy,  as President Obama noted.   Families, we know, are still struggling, workers are still hurting,  and the American people need more money in their paychecks, not less.  We need to look at what made the 2019 economy such a success and try to  ensure that those changes prop us up for a strong comeback, and I think  the best place to start is with the success of the Tax Cuts and Jobs  Act.   After it passed almost 3 years ago, I traveled across my State and  met with business owners and employees who were reaping the immediate  benefits. Those were in the form of new hires, bonuses, raises, and  401(k) match increases. Employees at every business of every size were  seeing the benefits of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. While some of the  provisions of that law are permanent, others are set to expire in 2025,  and, without action, things like the lower income tax rate for  individuals and the increased child tax credit will expire.   As we work to support our country through the recovery process, we  need to emulate the reforms that made our booming economy a reality in  the first place. As I said, I don't expect the road to recovery to be  quick, but there are steps that we can take to make it easier.   First, we could do our job by supporting the individuals and  businesses hit hardest by the pandemic. Time and again, our Democratic  colleagues have objected to us even considering legislation to continue  those important provisions of the CARES Act. We can take the  government's boot off of job creator's necks, and we can fight to bring  jobs back that were shipped overseas because we learned a lot about  vulnerable supply chains and manufacturing that needs to be returned to  the United States.    Following tax reform, millions of new jobs were created, and  Americans brought home more of their hard-earned money. As a result, we  reached 3.5 percent unemployment--the lowest unemployment rate in a  half a century. That progress was possible because of the right  policies that increased take-home pay for workers and unleashed the  power of the private sector. So I have no doubt, as we rebuild our  economy, that we will do so if we continue to embrace the policies that  made 2019 a banner year.   Let me just conclude by saying that we must pass another COVID-19  relief bill. Time and again, Speaker Pelosi has refused to negotiate in  good faith to come up with a compromise. In the meantime, airlines that  employ tens of thousands of people in my State and across the country  will begin laying off their employees beginning October 1. Businesses  that were sustained by the PPP program have now run out of those funds,  and they need to be replenished.   I get questions time and again about the lapsing of the enhanced  unemployment benefit that was part of the CARES Act. We tried to extend  that at some reasonable level, but our Democratic colleagues objected,  blocked it, and stopped it.   What I fear, as Chairman Powell of the Federal Reserve and Secretary  Mnuchin, the Treasury Secretary, have suggested, is that the massive  stimulus that we provided, roughly $3 trillion through four bills that  were passed on a bipartisan basis--that has sustained our economy and  brought us to where we are today, even in the darkest of times through  this pandemic, but if we leave here with our Democratic colleagues  having prevented us from providing another COVID-19 relief bill, I  think it guarantees nothing but pain for the economy, American workers,  and American families. We should not go down that path or tolerate it.
