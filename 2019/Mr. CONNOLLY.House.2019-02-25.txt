 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1235) to provide that the term of office of certain members  of the Merit Systems Protection Board shall be extended by a period of  1 year, to limit such members from concurrently holding positions  within the Federal Government, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1235         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``MSPB Temporary Term       Extension Act''.       SEC. 2. MERIT SYSTEMS PROTECTION BOARD MEMBERS: TERM                     EXTENSION AND LIMITATION ON SERVICE.         The term of office of any member of the Merit Systems       Protection Board appointed under section 1202 of title 5,       United States Code, serving as such a member on the date of       enactment of this Act shall be extended for a period of one       year beyond the date the member's service would otherwise end       under subsection (c) of such section.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank House leadership for bringing H.R. 1235, the  MSPB Temporary Term Extension Act, so quickly to the floor at the  request of the Committee on Oversight and Reform.   Chairman Cummings and I introduced this bill to prevent a potential  crisis at the Merit Systems Protection Board, a vacant Board without  any members. Acting Chairman Mark Robbins is and has been the sole  member on the Board since January 2017. His holdover term expires at  the end of this month, the 28th of February, and it cannot be extended  without legislation. We planned to address this issue through regular  order, but circumstances arose that prevented us from doing so.   The subcommittee I am going to chair originally scheduled a hearing  to examine the problem on February 14, but the hearing was postponed to  the end of this month to allow all Members to attend the funerals of  our colleagues John Dingell and Walter Jones.   We hoped that the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs  Committee would take action to address the problem during its business  meeting on February 20. Although the Senate committee was able to  approve two nominees for the Board, Chairman Johnson indicated he would  withhold those nominations from the Senate floor pending the naming of  a third nominee by the White House.   The Senate committee was also reportedly working on language to  extend Mr. Robbins' holdover term for another year, but no legislation  was considered at the markup, thus our action today.   Given these events, it appears less and less likely that the Senate  will be able to confirm new Board members before time runs out this  Thursday. That is why the Committee on Oversight and Reform, Chairman  Cummings and I, introduced this stopgap measure, H.R. 1235, to ensure  some work by the MSPB will continue. The legislation will provide a  one-time, 1-year extension for Mr. Robbins' term to give the Senate  more time to confirm the additional Board members.   This version of the bill before us eliminates the provision  prohibiting dual appointments because Mr. Robbins assured us he would  continue to recuse himself from working on matters related to OPM and  that he would recuse himself from OPM matters that related to votes he  had taken at MSPB if this bill is enacted.   This amendment is in response to many of the concerns raised by our  Republican friends.   We urgently need to pass this bill because we need to ensure that  MSPB can continue its operations. If Mr. Robbins' term expires without  new members confirmed, it will be the first time in the agency's  history that the Board has no members at all. We will be entering  uncharted new territory, and not good territory.   If there is no principal officer to lead the agency, not only is it  unclear  [[Page H2063]]  which agency functions may continue and which ones must be suspended,  but, also, whether the entire agency must shut down completely. Mr.  Speaker, I urge my colleagues not to risk that shutdown.   There is a lot at stake here. MSPB protects whistleblowers from  retaliation, veterans from job discrimination, and Federal employees  from prohibited personnel practices. The agency ensures that the  Federal civil service is nonpartisan and complies with the merit system  principles.   Since 2017, MSPB has been operating under certain constraints without  a quorum on the Board. This has prevented the Board from hearing final  appeals of agency adverse actions.   The absence of a quorum has also prevented the Board from issuing  special studies of the civil service and reviews of OPM rules and  regulations, as is required. This has resulted in a backlog, Mr.  Speaker, of 2,000 final appeals which will take more than 3 years to  process and eight Merit Systems studies pending issuance by the Board.   The current situation is certainly less than ideal, but let's not  make it worse by doing nothing and creating a complete vacancy on the  Board.   This would cause decisions made by Mr. Robbins, by the way, to be  voided, exacerbating the backlog, and any new Board members who are  finally confirmed would have to start again from square one.   We should not and cannot allow that to happen. Addressing the problem  should be a bipartisan concern, and I believe it is. We cannot let  politics prevent MSPB from doing its job.   The bill in front of us is supported by the American Federation of  Government Employees, the National Treasury Employees Union, the  National Federation of Federal Employees, the Government Accountability  Project, Public Citizen, Project on Government Oversight, the Make It  Safe Coalition, the Senior Executives Association, and the National  Taxpayers Union.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record letters of support from those  organizations and a coalition of other stakeholders.          American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO,                                 Washington, DC, February 22, 2019.      Hon. Elijah E. Cummings,      Chairman, House Committee on Oversight and Reform,           Washington, DC.      Hon. Jim Jordan,      Ranking Member, House Committee on Oversight and Reform,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Cummings and Ranking Member Jordan: On behalf       of the American Federation of Government Employees. AFL-CIO       (AFGE), I am writing to urge support for the ``Merit Systems       Protection Board (MSPB) Temporary Term Extension Act,''       introduced by Congressman Elijah Cummings (D-MD). This       legislation would allow the term of the current and only MSPB       member to be extended and avoid having a vacant Board.        An employee may appeal an adverse action to the MSPB, a       third-party agency that hears and adjudicates civil service       appeals. MSPB administrative judges (AJs) hear the matter in       an adversarial setting and decide the case in accordance with       established legal precedents. If dissatisfied with the AJ's       decision. either the agency or the employee may appeal the       decision to the full three Member MSPB. Currently, the Board       does not have a quorum. Mark Robbins is the only member on       the Board and his term expires on February 28, 2019. Robbins'       original term ended in March 2018, and he is currently       serving under a maximum one-year statutory extension.        When Robbins' term expires, the Board will have no       Presidentially-appointed members. The ``MSPB Temporary Term       Extension Act.'' would allow for Robbins to extend his term       for one additional year and avoid having an MSPB with no       members. AFGE believes that the MSPB serves an important role       in upholding the Merit Systems Principles and the rights of       federal employees. Therefore, AFGE strongly urges you to       support the ``MSPB Temporary Term Extension Act.'' to allow a       temporary carryover of the current and only member of the       MSPB. Thank you.            Sincerely,                                                 J. David Cox, Sr.,                                                National President.          NTEU, The National Treasury Employees Union,                                 Washington, DC, February 19, 2019.      Hon. Elijah E. Cummings,      Chairman, House Committee on Oversight and Reform,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Cummings: On behalf of the National Treasury       Employees Union (NTEU), representing over 150,000 federal       employees in 33 agencies, 1 write to applaud your efforts to       support the important work performed by the Merit Systems       Protection Board (MSBP or Board) and ensure that it can       continue. We believe that your bill, the MSPB Temporary Term       Extension Act, is the appropriate response to address the       impending loss of leadership at the Board.        As you know, Mark Robbins is the Acting Chairman and the       only Member left on the Board. His original term expired last       year and his holdover year will expire on February 28, 2019.       Given the uncertainty regarding the operations of the Board       once Mr. Robbins' term ends, we appreciate that your bill       would temporarily allow Mr. Robbins to remain on the Board       for a short period of time while the President's nominees for       the MSPB undergo Senate consideration. We also appreciate       that the bill stipulates that the individual who would be       allowed to extend their term would be unable to hold another       position in the government at the same time.        NTEU fully supports your carefully crafted temporary       extension bill and we appreciate your efforts to safeguard       the employee protections envisioned in the Civil Service       Reform Act. Thank you.            Sincerely,                                                 Anthony M. Reardon      National President.                                   ____                                                  February 25, 2019.      Hon. Elijah Cummings,      Chairman, Committee on Oversight and Reform, Washington, DC.      Hon. Gerald Connolly,      Chairman, Subcommittee on Government Operations, Washington,           DC.      Hon, Jim Jordan,      Ranking Member, Committee on Oversight and Reform,           Washington, DC.      Hon. Mark Meadows,      Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Government Operations,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Cummings, Ranking Member Jordan, Chairman       Connolly, and Ranking Member Meadows: On behalf of the       undersigned organizations, who all strongly value and support       our nation's professional nonpartisan civil service, we write       to express our concerns about the future of the Merit Systems       Protection Board (MSPB) and convey our support for H.R. 1235.        As you know, the Board has already operated under       unprecedented circumstances, lacking a quorum for nearly two       full years. The result has been a backlog of nearly 2,000       cases and a delay in justice for federal employees,       whistleblowers, veterans, and federal annuitants with matters       before the Board, as well as a lack of closure for agencies       in personnel matters. Moreover, due to the lack of quorum the       Board has been unable to issue official reports or studies to       Congress and the President during a critical time in which       there is growing appreciation for the imperative of       modernizing our civil service.        On February 13 the Senate Homeland Security and       Governmental Affairs Committee advanced two of the       President's MSPB nominees, yet they are still awaiting floor       action pending nomination of a third Board member by the       President. Should the Senate be unable to approve the Board       nominees and restore a quorum, effective March 1 the Board       would be without any Senate-confirmed leadership for the       first time in its history, due to the expiration of acting       chairman Mark Robbins' holdover period.        In order to ensure that the Board can continue operations       at the most basic levels, including the critical role in       issuing stays in whistleblower cases, passage of legislation       to extend the holdover period for the Board is imperative. We       strongly urge passage of H.R. 1235 to prevent the current       crisis with the Board from doing permanent damage to the       merit system and the civil service.        Thank you for your consideration of our perspective on this       critical matter.            Sincerely,          FAA Managers Association (FAAMA), Federal Managers             Association (FMA), Government Accountability Project             (GAP), Tom Devine, Liberty Coalition, National Council             of Social Security Management Associations (NCSSMA),             National Federation of Federal Employees (NFFE),             National Taxpayers Union, National Whistleblower             Center, Professional Managers Association (PMA),             Project on Government Oversight (POGO), Public Citizen,             Senior Executives Association (SEA), Taxpayer             Protection Alliance, Union of Concerned Scientists,             Whistleblowers of America.     Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in  supporting H.R. 1235, a commonsense stopgap measure to prevent serious  injury to hardworking civil servants who expect the Merit Systems  Protection Board to function.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Briefly, in responding to my friend: I agree with him. I think we  need a full board. Our problem is the Senate. They didn't get around to  acting in a timely fashion, and so we are faced with this.   I think it is also important to note that, although a quorum is  necessary for most work of MSPB, it isn't necessary for all of it.   So Mr. Robbins, in a caretaker, interim position, can still do some  of the work of the board, including issuing stays, reviewing some of  the work, and helping to avoid adding to the backlog.   He can't substitute himself fully, obviously, for a quorum in the  board. My colleague is quite right about that.   What we are trying to do here is not to compel him or coerce him to  stay against his wishes; it is to try to buy some time and have the  board at least do some of its basic functions so that we don't come to  a complete standstill. That would not be necessary, frankly, had the  Senate acted.   I think my friend is right in suggesting that is the ultimate answer,  and I would join him in calling on the Senate to act as swiftly as  possible. But I think we have no choice but to act on this bill now.   With that, Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of the bill, and I yield back  the balance of my time.
