 Madam Speaker, the coronavirus has upended life as we know  it.   Healthcare workers need personal protective equipment and hospitals  need supplies.   Small businesses and small farmers need financial security to weather  this storm.   America needs a national testing regime to safely and efficiently get  this country back to work.   Underserved rural communities need doctors and increased access to  care.   The Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act will  provide much-needed relief to millions across the country and help save  lives.    Because of the urgency, I urge you to vote ``yes.''  However, State and local governments and Tribal nations across the  country need funding, too, to provide essential services for our  essential frontline workers: paramedics, law enforcement, firefighters.   We must include the Coronavirus Relief Act, $250 billion for local  government for populations less than 500,000 in the next act because  small cities' firefighters and paramedics in my district matter, too.
