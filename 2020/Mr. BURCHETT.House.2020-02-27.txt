 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the career of  Judge Charles D. Susano Jr. who is retiring after 25 years of service  on the Tennessee Court of Appeals. Judge Susano  [[Page H1242]]  will finish his career as the longest tenured State appellate judge in  the history of Tennessee once he retires this coming April.   Judge Susano is a lifelong Knoxvillian and a dedicated public  servant. After graduating magna cum laude from--it hurts me to say  this--Notre Dame in 1958, Judge Susano served in the United States Army  for 2 years before he was honorably discharged. He then earned his  juris doctor from the University of Tennessee College of Law in 1963.   For the majority of his adult life, Judge Susano has dedicated  himself to the law. He spent 30 years as a legal partner between two  Knoxville-based law firms until Governor Ned McWherter appointed Judge  Susano to his position with the Tennessee Court of Appeals--Eastern  Section in March of 1994.   Judge Susano was elected Statewide to his judgeship four times  throughout his public service career and issued over 1,000 opinions  during his time on the bench. He is also active in the Knoxville  community through service on many nonprofit boards and at his church.  The State of Tennessee is lucky to have had his public service  throughout the years.   Judge, I wish you the best in your retirement, and I hope it is  filled with quality time with your wife, children, and grandchildren.   Mr. Speaker, on a personal note, I want to thank the judge for being  such good friends of the Burchetts.                            ____________________
