 Madam Speaker, today I rise in support of H.R.  4470, and I urge all Members to support this important legislation.   Keeping our American homeland secure has been a part of my life for  over four decades. Though the threats to our Nation have changed since  I first entered the United States Air Force in 1973, I am reminded of  our former Commander in Chief Ronald Reagan, who once said: ``Yet peace  does not exist of its own will.''   ``We must always remember that peace is a fragile thing that needs  constant vigilance.''   This is an important admonition we should keep in mind because on  July 27, 2023, this week, the legal authority for the Chemical Facility  Anti-Terrorism Standards program, or CFATS for short, will sunset.   This means that everything about it--right down to its fundamental  legal structure--disappears, including Federal outreach and networking  to prevent terrorism against these facilities.   Now to be clear, from our perspective on the Energy and Commerce  Committee, we should be authorizing this program for longer, but time  is of the essence, and today it is vitally important to pass this  clean, 26-month CFATS extension.                                time  1830    American businesses have invested billions of dollars in security,  expecting a strong return for their efforts. We should not nullify  investments that would send a bad message to those who wish to do our  Nation harm, a message that Congress doesn't take security at our  chemical facilities seriously.   The Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards Act is an important  anti-terrorism-focused program. It is not a perfect tool, but CFATS is  an important, unique program based upon collaboration between the  Federal Government and the private sector.   Unlike other programs at the EPA or the Department of Labor, CFATS is  focused and it serves as an important bulwark against the threat of  terrorism here in the United States. It doesn't mandate the answer or  the specific technology but, rather, asks facilities to identify their  own vulnerabilities and meet risk-based performance standards in a way  that makes sense for them.   I am aware that there are those who, because CFATS is a compulsory  program for some, might question the value of the current program.   CFATS does not need to be stripped or have its mission overhauled.  Though no Federal program is without need of improvement in some area,  but the immediate answer should not lie in trying to destabilize or  dismantle it all together.   Rather, the question should be whether Congress has thoroughly  overseen the program to understand the program's statutory authority;  how its operation lines up with congressional direction; whether it is  effective and efficient; and if it has the will and statutory authority  to correct deficits or if the law needs to be changed.   Because of that ongoing oversight work and the seemingly improved  history of the program, I am comfortable voting to continue it.   To those colleagues who are still skeptical of the CFATS program----    While this extension gives time for not only  more assessment and for CFATS to demonstrate its progress, I would urge  you to see past this as a time to take this program hostage or distract  from its security-related, terrorism prevention focus.   I urge all Members to vote for the passage of H.R. 4470, and I urge  the Senate to not delay in its passing, as well.
