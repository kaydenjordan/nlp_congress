 Mr. Speaker, I rise in honor of the life and legacy of  my dear friend and colleague, Harlem's own, New York State Senator Bill  Perkins.   Senator Perkins was not just an elected official but a giant and a  community leader.   I extend my deepest condolences to his wife, Pamela Perkins, and the  entire Perkins family during this time of grief.   Senator Perkins never forgot where he came from. I had the honor of  serving with him in the New York State Senate. I had the opportunity to  watch him very closely firsthand. He was a force of nature and a  champion for working people. He made a difference with his leadership  using his powerful voice to bring about change and give back to the  city that saw him grow up.   Early in his life of public service, he became a champion in defense  of the Exonerated 5 and took on Donald Trump. He never backed down from  a righteous fight and was a fearless advocate for the vulnerable and  underserved. He treated all with respect.   May Bill's legacy inspire all of us as we move forward.   Rest in power, Senator Perkins.                            ____________________
