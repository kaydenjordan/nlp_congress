 Mr. Speaker, independent workers are vital to our  country and the strong economy that we are enjoying today, with  unemployment under 4 percent, wages rising, and Americans keeping more  of their own money, thanks to tax reform.   These millions of workers are pursuing the American Dream of working  for themselves, including contractors, consultants, freelancers, and  small business owners. They embody the principles and values of our  country's Declaration of Independence by truly representing what it  means to be free. They are found across every profession, income level,  industry, party, race, religion, gender, and geography.   That is why I am joining with the Association of Independent Workers  in calling for August 16 to be National Independent Worker Day.   This special recognition of independent workers' vital role in our  Nation's economy is long overdue. As more and more Americans choose to  take this career path, I will keep fighting to make sure Washington  stays out of their way and allows them to innovate and succeed.   I am proud to support all the independent workers in my district and  throughout this great Nation.                  Honoring Conservative Writer Russell Kirk     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the late  Dr. Russell Kirk, a political theorist, moralist, historian, and  literary critic, in honor of a historical marker being placed at his  beloved home in Mecosta in my district in Michigan next month.   For over 40 years, Dr. Kirk taught students about political theory,  culture, and virtue. He also wrote more than 30 books. Today, his  legacy lives on through the Russell Kirk Center under the gracious  leadership of his wife, Annette.   Dr. Kirk is considered one of the preeminent thinkers of his time.  His first book, ``The Conservative Mind,'' has shaped the modern ideas  of American conservatism.   Dr. Kirk found his true joy in addressing college audiences because  he believed the key to the lasting success of conservative ideas rested  on shaping the cultural and moral beliefs of the next generation.   In his books, articles, speeches, and interviews, Dr. Kirk's wisdom  has shaped the thinking of generations of conservatives around the  world.   His ideas have personally helped me in forming my own beliefs, and it  is a privilege to pay special tribute to Dr. Kirk and his legacy today.                            ____________________
