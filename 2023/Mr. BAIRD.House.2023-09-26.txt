 Madam Chair, today, I rise in opposition to the Spartz  amendment No. 76. This amendment states that none of the funds made  available by this appropriations bill may be used to carry out  commodity checkoff programs.   Checkoff programs function as research and promotion boards that help  different commodities achieve industry success through market  development, heightened demand, and expanded consumer awareness.   This amendment proves factually unnecessary and inaccurate since no  tax dollars are used to implement the checkoffs and no appropriated  dollars are used to oversee them, pursuant to the statute. These  programs benefit our Nation's agriculture industry and bolster the work  that is being done by our farmers and ranchers who put food on the  tables across the country.   The continued success of these programs must not be interrupted and  misguided by the lack of understanding and nongermane amendments.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.
