 ``Each State shall appoint, in such manner as the  legislature thereof may direct, a number of electors, equal to the  whole number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be  entitled in the Congress: but no Senator or Representative, or person  holding an office of  [[Page H104]]  trust or profit under the United States, shall be appointed an  elector.''    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 11 to  reject the anti-Israel U.N. Security Council Resolution 2334. Since  1972, the United States has vetoed 42 anti-Israel resolutions; but all  of that changed in 2016.   The facts are, in the very final days of his administration,  President Obama left our only ally in the Middle East to stand alone by  blatantly and deliberately violating longstanding U.S. policy. For  crying out loud, either we are with Israel or we are not.   I could go on and on about the severity of the President's refusal to  veto an anti-Israel U.N. resolution and his decision to abstain from a  vote on it. Instead, I will let Prime Minister Netanyahu's words speak  for themselves:   ``The Obama administration not only failed to protect Israel against  this gang-up at the U.N., it colluded with it behind the scenes.''   Antagonizing our allies is not much of a foreign policy strategy.  This is betrayal of the worst kind. Anti-Israel policies will not be  tolerated. We are partners in this world and allies in democracy. I  urge my colleagues to stand with Israel and support this legislation.
