 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1, the Tax Cuts  and Jobs Act.   As a result of this bill, Ohio families will keep more of what they  earn. Additionally, it will create tens of thousands of jobs in Ohio  and in other States all across the country.   As chairman of the House Small Business Committee, I want to make  sure that the Tax Code works for our Nation's job creators so that we  can create jobs, not against them.  [[Page H9389]]    Seventy percent of the new jobs created in the American economy  nowadays are created by small businesses. Unfortunately, small  businesses are getting killed by the existing Tax Code.   This Tax Code will bring rates down from approximately 40 percent for  small-business owners to, in many cases, 25 percent and, in a lot of  cases, 9 percent. From 40 percent down to 9 percent. That means small  businesses can keep that money, invest and create more jobs for more  Americans.   The naysayers around here obviously can't say enough bad about this  bill, but it is going to be good for America. I urge my colleagues to  support it.
