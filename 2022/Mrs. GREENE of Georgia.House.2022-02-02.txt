 Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to  another bill that puts China first and America last. Instead of  focusing on a bill that is almost 3,000 pages worth $325 billion in  spending, estimated, that doesn't really help America. It is going to  give $8 billion to the UN Climate Fund and mentions coral reefs 383  times.   What Congress should be doing is working on a budget that will fund  our government, since we are running out of money in just a few weeks.  What Congress should be doing is doing something about the fentanyl  that is coming from China that is killing young people. It is now the  number one cause of death in Americans from 18 to 45, not COVID-19.                                time  1615    What Congress should be doing is funding a wall, building a wall,  protecting our border, and deporting illegal aliens who are stealing  American jobs. That is what we should be doing to help the American  worker. But instead, we are debating a bill that is going to fund  climate change and the Green New Deal and help the coral reefs. This  isn't what Americans care about.   We all should be voting ``no'' and doing a better job.    Madam Speaker, maybe Mr. Perry and I can  discuss together and maybe he can help me with some things. I am new to  Congress. I am a freshman Member of Congress. I have been pretty  shocked.   I thought Congress' role was to create a budget for the United States  for our government, and we are about to run out of money in just a few  weeks. The 117th Congress hasn't produced a budget to keep the  government open. It is appalling to me as a business owner that we are  even in this situation.   Private businesses go out of business when we are not able to produce  a budget that makes a profit to be able to pay our employees, to be  able to buy our materials and continue. That is something I am  struggling with.   Something I am also struggling with, Mr. Perry, is that I heard the  Democrats present a bill today that they are very much wanting to pass,  what is called the America COMPETES Act, having to do with our American  jobs and economy in relation to China.   But here is the real trouble for me, and this is where I struggle,  American jobs are so important, but yet our border is wide open and  being invaded every single day. I just can't comprehend why Congress  doesn't pass legislation and write into law that illegal aliens should  be deported because illegal aliens are competing with American jobs. I  find that to be a major problem, especially being in the construction  industry where we have to employ legal Americans to do these jobs.   That doesn't seem to be the case, and maybe you can help me out here.    Madam Speaker, absolutely. Then we learned  yesterday that Border Patrol agents are completely demoralized; that  they are not even capable of doing the job that they were hired to do,  that our United States Government hired them to do because their  authorities are not allowing them to do it.   They are not able to deport illegal aliens so that our American  people can have jobs. No. Our American people are having to compete  with them. But even worse what we learned is about fentanyl. Fentanyl  coming from China. That is what bothered me when I was listening today  when the Democrats debated this bill with us. Only in this COMPETES Act  bill it mentioned fentanyl only 10 times.   Yet, it is Chinese fentanyl coming from Communist China that is  killing young people. It is the number one cause of death with  Americans age 18 to 45. That is a tragedy, but yet we have been  controlled by COVID-19. Children in schools are forced to wear masks;  people are told they have to take vaccines. It is totally out of  control, but yet it is fentanyl from China.   Here is something else. Maybe Mr. Perry can help me out with this  since I am new here. Why doesn't the Joe Biden administration--why  don't the Democrats care about doing something about fentanyl, a  horrible poison coming in from China, but yet they care more about  coral reefs?
