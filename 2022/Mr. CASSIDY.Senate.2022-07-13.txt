 Madam President, I rise today to express my  appreciation for and offer my sincere congratulations to a dedicated  public servant, Mr. Roland J. Babin, on his retirement after 67 years  of service for the Louisiana Department of Transportation and  Development. Mr. Babin commenced his career as a student worker in  1955. He currently serves as the districtwide maintenance specialist  for the department's Acadian region, making him the department's and  the State of Louisiana's longest actively serving employee.   During his long tenure, Mr. Babin served the department and the State  in a number of ways, from working as an engineer aide I to an engineer  technician VII. He has supervised and trained countless construction  and maintenance personnel over the years, making an impact on the  department that will last for years to come. Even at 85 years old, Mr.  Babin can be found on a job site operating a shovel, measuring tools, a  roller behind a hot mix paver, or a vibratory compactor. Mr. Babin also  recorded daily journal entries, dating back to 1970, narrating the  department's construction and maintenance projects, hurricanes, ice  storms, other emergency responses, and personal anecdotes from his  career. In 2017, Mr. Babin was a recipient of the Charles E. Dunbar,  Jr., Career Civil Service Award, the highest honor awarded to  classified Louisiana State employees for outstanding and selfless  service for the Louisianan community.   His tireless work throughout the years has ensured that the Louisiana  Department of Transportation and Development will continue to serve  Louisiana for decades to come. The department and the State of  Louisiana have benefited greatly from his leadership and contributions,  and his legacy will not be soon forgotten. I personally thank Mr. Babin  for his notable service and congratulate him on his well-deserved  retirement.                            ____________________
