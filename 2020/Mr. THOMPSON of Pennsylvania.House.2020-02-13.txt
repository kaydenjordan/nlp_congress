 Madam Speaker, I rise today to  recognize the ABC Life Center, a pregnancy center in Franklin,  Pennsylvania in Venango County.   The Life Center offers pregnant women a wide variety of resources,  including no-cost pregnancy tests, consultations for women with  unexpected pregnancies, adoption referrals, counseling for women who  have had a pregnancy end in miscarriage or abortion, and more.   The Life Center recognizes that being pro-life means supporting all  life. The center itself encourages women by letting them know that  their story, their life and their babies' lives matter. The center also  dispels the notion that to be pro-life is to be antichoice.   In fact, pregnancy centers such as Life Center offer a great deal of  choices and resources to women who find themselves unexpectedly  pregnant.   Pregnancy centers like ABC Life Center encourage and empower women  all around the country. I am proud of the work that they do every day  to enrich the lives of women and children, and together they help  spread the message that life really is a better choice.                            ____________________
