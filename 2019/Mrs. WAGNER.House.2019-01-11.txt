 Mr. Speaker, I unexpectedly had to return to my district  this morning and was unable to attend the vote series. Had I been  present, I would have voted ``yea'' on rollcall No. 26, ``nay'' on  rollcall No. 27, ``yea'' on rollcall No. 28, and ``yea'' on rollcall  No. 29.                             personal explanation
