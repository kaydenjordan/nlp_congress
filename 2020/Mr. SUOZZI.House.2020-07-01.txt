 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Moving Forward Act,  expertly led by Chairman DeFazio.   This transformative $1.5 trillion infrastructure investment, the  largest in our Nation's history, would not only help rebuild America's  decaying infrastructure, not only stimulate our post-coronavirus  economy, not only create solid middle class jobs, hopefully many of  them union jobs, but will also make the most significant investment in  protecting our environment in a generation.   Investments here will combat climate change, improve the resiliency  of our shorelines, improve water quality for many American communities,  and much, much more.   This bill also includes a provision of mine, which incentivizes  homeowners in my district, and throughout the Nation, to upgrade their  antiquated septic systems by reversing a wrong-headed IRS decision that  requires homeowners to pay income taxes on septic system improvement  grants that they receive from local governments, such as Suffolk County  in my district.   Admittedly, this is not a high-profile provision, but it will help  homeowners financially and dramatically improve our environment by  reducing the devastating impacts of nitrogen pollution.   Over the past 25 years, as a former mayor, county executive, and now  a Member of this body, I have seen firsthand how reducing nitrogen has  helped revitalize the Long Island Sound, our national park. This can  happen up and down the coast of America.    Investments like these are critical pieces in a comprehensive  approach we must take to preserve and protect our environment. I  encourage my colleagues to support the bill.                                time  1045
