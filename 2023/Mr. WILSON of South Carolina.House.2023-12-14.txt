 Madam Speaker, I congratulate Chairman    Mike Rogers and Ranking Member Adam Smith for the diligent work for  this bipartisan NDAA, which I support.    The axis of evil, war criminal Putin, the regime in Tehran, the  Chinese Communist Party, dictators with rule of gun invading  democracies with rule of law makes the passage of this bipartisan  legislation more important than ever.   I am grateful to have provisions included such as authorization for  operations for critical missions at Savannah River Site, including  plutonium pit production and the Tritium Finishing Facility; the U.S.- Israel Future of Warfare Act, which provides for collaboration on  defense and technology  [[Page H6956]]  for border security; the Foreign Extortion Prevention Act, which is  protecting American companies from demands for bribes by corrupt  foreign officials. This is the most significant anticorruption law  since the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation,  which promotes peace through strength.
