 Mr. Speaker, Jennifer Mamola represents the very  best of America. She volunteered for the Peace Corps at 26 and served  in Uganda.   While there, tragically, she was hit from behind by a drunk driver,  breaking both of her legs. Her life changed forever.   When she returned home to America, she faced an uphill battle to get  treatment and endless bureaucracy. After 3 months, the Peace Corps  stopped covering her medical costs and sent her to face the bureaucracy  of the Department of Labor.   Instead of serving as a resource, the Peace Corps' postservice unit  was no help at all. When she reached out asking for mental health  services, they ignored her. She has undergone four surgeries and  endless hours of agony.   America's angels abroad deserve better. My legislation will ensure  that Peace Corps volunteers have medical care in foreign countries and  in America when they return home.   I want to welcome Jennifer to the House Chamber today. Congress  appreciates her service as a Peace Corps volunteer, and we must provide  help for wonderful people like her.   And that is just the way it is.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, having lived in Texas all my life, I,  like many other Texans, have been to the Texas border numerous times. I  have been to the border from San Diego to Brownsville while I have been  in Congress, the entire length of the border. Some things are working  on the border, and one of those things that is working is a wall in the  big cities.   One of my friends from El Paso likes to talk about how El Paso is the  safest city in America. Well, one reason is El Paso has multiple  fencing, a canal, and a river between the U.S., Texas, and Mexico.   The sheriff of El Paso told me after that fencing was created, cross- border crime is almost nonexistent. That is one reason--not the only  reason--why El Paso is the safest city in America is because they have  a wall, a fence, the Rio Grande River--a barrier. Let's use that term.   Sure, not everybody from Mexico is coming to commit crimes, of course  not, but a wall works.   It also works where they have fencing in San Diego. It also works  where they have fencing in Brownsville, Texas, between Brownsville and  Mexico. It stops and reduces the cross-border individuals coming in  without permission. So a partial fence will work.   This bill, let's make it clear, is not a complete border wall of the  whole border. It is only 74 miles. And we need to do everything. We  need to have that 74 miles. We need to have aerostats in the air. We  need to have more Border Patrol on the ground. We need to have all  types of technology to have a virtual wall, if you will, to protect the  United States' security.   People need to come to the United States. We want people to come to  the United States, but come the right way.   Lastly, as my friend from Tyler, Texas, said, the drug cartels are  the major problem, and the criminal gangs, like the MS-13 gang, are the  ones who come into the United States because there is no barrier to  stop them.   And that is just the way it is.
