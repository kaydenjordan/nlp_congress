 Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution  667, I offer amendments en bloc.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Cohen).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pallone).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Correa).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Auchincloss).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Chu).    Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close at  this time.    Madam Speaker, I too urge support of the  amendments en bloc, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, first of all, I want to get the  numbers clear here. The budget proposed by President Biden was $753  billion, and by supporting this amendment, we support President Biden's  budget of $753 billion, which was a $12 billion increase over last  year's budget.   Last year's budget--the last budget from the Trump administration-- only increased the defense budget that year by $3 billion. So a $3  billion increase last year was perfectly acceptable to my Republican  colleagues in the House and Senate under President Trump. A $12 billion  increase this year is not. So the numbers are just being dramatically  presented here as some kind of cut when it is actually a bigger  increase than Trump did in his last year in the White House.   Let me make it clear: I see the threats, and I do agree more with my  Republican colleagues on that point. I don't support the previous  amendment that does the $75 billion cut because I understand the threat  environment and I know that we need to modernize to meet that threat  environment.   But the other thing I see is decades of waste and wasteful  expenditures on programs like the F-35 and the Ford-class carrier.    Mr. Speaker, we spent money in a very  imprudent way. We have got to instill discipline at the Pentagon so we  get value for the dollars that we spend. Simply giving them another $25  billion does not do that, and $753 billion is enough. It is even better  if we actually start spending it wisely, intelligently, and  effectively. That doesn't happen. I am a little short. Can you just  give me a little more money?    I always love the Winston Churchill quote: ``Gentlemen, we have run  out of money; now we have to think.''   That is the type of discipline we need at the Pentagon, not just to  give them a blank check every time they ask. The President's budget is  sufficient to meet our needs.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support for the amendment.    Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution  667, I offer amendments en bloc.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  [[Page H4985]]  amendment No. 207 printed in part C of House Report 117-125 be modified  in the form I have placed at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Langevin).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30  seconds to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Krishnamoorthi).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Kelly).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Manning).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. Lawrence).    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and  I am prepared to close, therefore, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge support of the  amendments en bloc, and I yield back the balance of my time.   Miss GONZALEZ-COLON. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of en bloc  package number two for the National Defense Authorization Act of 2022.   This bill includes three amendments that were submitted by my office  and will directly benefit the people of Puerto Rico and our Nation's  security.   Amendment 162 requires the Secretary of Defense to enter into an  agreement with the National Academy of Sciences for the purpose of  investigating the health effects on the island Municipality of Vieques  that may have been  [[Page H4989]]  caused by toxic waste left after nearly 70 years of live fire training.   This waste includes heavy metals like lead, cancer-causing fuel  chemicals, and even depleted uranium. In some locations, areas are so  contaminated that it is not safe for workers to collect samples.   While there are numerous studies from different government agencies  on this topic, including from the Centers for Disease Control and  Government Accountability Office, much work remains to be done to  further understand the consequences from this practice.   I am proud to say that this legislation now builds upon existing  research for this important topic.   Amendment number 163 prohibits the Secretary of Defense from retiring  the Landing Craft ships used by Puerto Rico's Army National Guard until  such time as an adequate replacement is provided.   These ships delivered critical food, water, and other materials to  Puerto Rico's noncontiguous islands of Vieques and Culebra, as well as  the US Virgin Islands, following the aftermath of Hurricane Maria.   The landing craft ships were scheduled to be retired this year,  however the adopted amendment prohibits this decommissioning until  replacement equipment arrives to Puerto Rico.   My third and last amendment, number 164, requires the Secretary of  the Army to allocate a Modular Small Arms Range to Puerto Rico.   Currently, Puerto Rico only has a single firearms range for  Department of Defense personnel.   This creates numerous scheduling conflicts and decreases mission  readiness.   Puerto Rico's own Fort Buchanan has the capacity to support a Modular  Small Arms Range. My office has met with both Army leaders who support  this request.   Let me close by noting that H.R. 4350 includes funding over 12  million dollars in funding for Fort Allen and 10 million for the Ramey  Unit School, under the energy resilience and conservation program.  Finally, H.R. 4350 includes 14 million under military construction for  Fort Buchanan in Puerto Rico. I am appreciative of the Armed Service  committees work and I look forward to seeing these projects to  completion.   I encourage my colleagues to vote in favor of en bloc number two.    Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at the  desk.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Ocasio-Cortez).    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers at  [[Page H5032]]  this time, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I concur in the remarks of the  ranking member. I urge support for the en bloc, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution  667, I offer amendments en bloc.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume, and I urge passage of the amendments en bloc.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the  balance of my time.                                time  1830     Mr. Speaker, I also support the en bloc.  This will be the last chance for me to speak before we conclude the  amendment process, so I do just want to make a final pitch for the  underlying piece of legislation.   I think the amendment process has gone just fine. The underlying bill  is incredibly well put together in the manner we have described, has  bipartisan support, reflects a lot of the ideas and priorities of  Members of Congress from both sides of the aisle as well, and from even  outside the committee.  [[Page H5075]]    I think we have an excellent piece of legislation that will help meet  the national security needs of our country, and I urge support for the  bill in the final passage process, which will happen at some point  tomorrow after we vote on, I don't know, 18-20 amendments, something  like that. We will be here awhile.   Don't forget what brought us here in the first place. The need to  pass the National Defense Authorization Act and maintain our commitment  to put the men and women who serve in the military in the best possible  position to carry out the missions that we give them.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support for final passage of the bill and urge  support for this en bloc amendment, and I yield back the balance of my  time.
