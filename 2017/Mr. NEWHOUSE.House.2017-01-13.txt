 Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend from Georgia for  yielding me this time to speak on these important issues.   Mr. Speaker, the opportunity to speak on this important rule that  provides consideration for the fiscal year 2017 budget resolution and  S. 84, which provides a legal exception for General Mattis to serve as  Secretary of Defense, certainly are important issues. As a member of  the House Rules Committee, I am very proud to support this rule as well  as both of the underlying measures.   S. 84 provides a one-time exemption on behalf of an individual who is  uniquely qualified to serve during a very challenging period in our  Nation's history and a time when U.S. national security and military  readiness is of paramount importance for both Americans and our allies  around the world.   This legislation does not permanently change the law nor does it  diminish the founding principle of civilian control of our military. In  fact, this rule allows for consideration of legislation providing for a  one-time exemption that does exactly the opposite. It reinforces the  doctrine of civilian control of our military. By setting into motion  this unique procedure, the people's elected representatives are taking  the seriousness of this circumstance to heart, to debate and carefully  weigh granting a historic exception, only provided on one other  occasion in our history.   The man at the center of this matter demonstrates the extraordinary  nature of the situation we currently face. General James N. Mattis has  served our Nation with unparalleled distinction over the past 40-plus  years. Born in Pullman, Washington, General Mattis grew up in my  congressional district, the Fourth District of the State of Washington.  He attended what was then Columbia High School, now Richland High, and  graduated from Central Washington University.   It was growing up along the banks of the Columbia River in Richland  where General Mattis' parents instilled in him a deep passion for  reading, which then developed into a renowned lifelong devotion to  intellectualism, military and world history, and the study of war.   General Mattis has been in command at increasing levels throughout  his career within the United States Marine Corps, where he began as a  student enrolled in ROTC, rose to the rank of general, and served as  commander of the United States Central Command responsible for American  military operations in the Middle East, Northeast Africa, and Central  Asia. Few individuals command the respect and admiration General Mattis  has earned amongst the troops, national security experts, and military  and civic leaders.   This rule allows for the consideration of legislation to provide the  United States Senate its proper role of advice and consent regarding  the nomination of General Mattis to serve as our next Secretary of  Defense.                                time  0945    I urge my colleagues to support this rule so the Senate can  rightfully provide its constitutional guidance, which I am confident  will overwhelmingly support this distinguished leader and public  servant from the great State of Washington.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous question. If we  defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the rule to  allow for the consideration of Representative Pocan's amendment, of  which I am a proud cosponsor, to create a point of order against any  legislation that would cut benefits under Social Security, Medicare, or  Medicaid or that would attempt to privatize Social Security. All are  things that my Republican friends have advocated for in previous  budgets.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to include in the Record the  text of the amendment, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Massachusetts?   There was no objection.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Pocan).
