 Mr. Speaker, the American people do not support Betsy  DeVos.   We don't support her radical attempts to privatize education.   We don't support her corrupt efforts to take coronavirus relief away  from public schools so that it can be sent to private ones.   We don't support her hateful, transphobic agenda or her attacks on  survivors of sexual assault.   And we do not support her putting predatory, for-profit colleges over  those they cheated with a rule that would force the most vulnerable  students who were robbed to repay 97 percent of what they borrowed.  That is why Congress passed H.J. Res. 76, with bipartisan support.   But just as Vice President Pence had to save Betsy DeVos' Senate  confirmation, President Trump is trying to save her dangerous rule  against our bipartisan bill.   So I urge my colleagues to override this veto, and, once again, let's  make clear that the people's House stands on the side of the people and  not Betsy DeVos.
