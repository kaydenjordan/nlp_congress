 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on the Judiciary be discharged from further consideration of  H.R. 962, the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, an act that  protects living babies who survive failed abortions, and ask for its  immediate consideration in this House.    Madam Speaker, I personally fought in the OB delivery  room for 30 years for the unborn and newly born. I ask the Speaker to  immediately schedule this important bill so we can protect these  babies.
