 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the Trump  administration's decision to end temporary protected status, TPS, for  more than 200,000 Salvadorans.   TPS holders are thoroughly vetted legal residents who have  contributed to our economy and to our communities for almost two  decades. Most TPS recipients now call the United States home. Many are  parents to children who are American citizens, and tearing these  families apart is a heartless and cruel act.   In their decision, this administration claims they reviewed the  disaster-related conditions on which the original determination was  made; however, they failed to consider the current realities that make  El Salvador one of the most dangerous countries in the world. This  irresponsible decision will drop hundreds of thousands of people into  violence and disaster.   Sending 200,000 Salvadorans, many from my district, to a dangerous  foreign country is inhumane. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to  immediately pass the American Promise Act so that we can correct this  despicable action.                            ____________________
