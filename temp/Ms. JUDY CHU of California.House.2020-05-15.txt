 Mr. Speaker, as businesses, families, and  entire communities struggle, Congress must step up. The HEROES Act does  just that, helping us through this crisis.   Our priority is a healthy economy, but there is none without healthy  workers. So this bill ensures a plan for testing and contact tracing.   State and local governments will be able to pay workers on the front  lines. Families will be able to get help to survive unemployment, stay  in their homes, and keep their small businesses alive.   Mr. Speaker, we cannot afford to wait one minute longer.
