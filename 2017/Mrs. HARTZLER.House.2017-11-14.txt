 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of an important  bill that could help so many families with loved ones struggling with  life-threatening diseases. I am talking about the Right to Try Act  which would allow terminally ill patients to request access to  experimental drugs after all other available treatment options have  been exhausted as well as prevent the Federal Government from  interfering with States that have already passed such laws.   While Missouri passed a right-to-try law in 2014, I was reminded of  the importance of this bill just last year. As I was returning to my  office one morning after votes on the House floor, I was stopped by a  little boy, Zack Mongiello, who ran after me to catch my attention.  Zack, who is only 11 years old, is one of the most effective advocates  for the right-to-try campaign. His father, Frank, was diagnosed with  ALS a few years ago.   This devastating disease has an average life expectancy of 2 to 5  years, with half of those diagnosed surviving for only 3 years. Ever  since that life-changing diagnosis, Zack's family, including his mother  and five siblings, have been doing all they can to ensure passage of  this important bill.   When Zack came running up to me that day last year, his message was  clear and powerful: ``My dad is dying,'' he said. ``Please help.'' I  was incredibly moved by this, as I think anyone would be. Here is his  picture. This precious little boy, whose family is dealing with the  unimaginable, convinced me and numerous other legislators of the  urgency of this legislation. We must act now.   I want Congress to help Zack's family and other families who have no  other options. Washington should not stand in the way of Americans with  life-ending illnesses who want to try to save themselves and have no  other available options.   That is why I am a proud cosponsor of the Right to Try Act and was  glad to see the Senate pass their version of this bill. It is now time  for the House to act, and I call on my colleagues to support this  potentially lifesaving legislation. Please join me so that we can give  families like Zack's more options and hopefully more time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the  conference report for the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal  Year 2018.   I would like to thank Chairman Thornberry, Ranking Member Smith, all  of the conferees, and the committee staff for their hard work on this  important piece of legislation.   As Members of Congress, it is our responsibility to provide support  for our men and women in uniform while they selflessly serve our  Nation. This bill authorizes a much-needed $634 billion in base budget  requirements for our national security. This number is the minimum  requirement needed to even begin the process of restoring our  military's readiness.   Tragically, this year alone, we have heard report after report of  deadly training accidents. These accidents demonstrate severe readiness  shortfalls across the services. We cannot stand by as our men and women  in uniform continue to suffer. Now is the time to invest, and this bill  does just that.   The NDAA authorizes a 2.4 percent pay increase for our troops;  authorizes 24 additional F-18 Super Hornets to help fill the Navy's  strike fighter shortfall; and it fully funds the B-21 bomber, a  critical platform needed to deter and defeat future aggression around  the world.   I am proud to represent Missouri's Fourth Congressional District,  which is home to Whiteman Air Force Base and Fort Leonard Wood. This  bill funds modernization programs for the B-2 bomber, authorizes $50  million in the DOD impact aid for military-connected schools, and fully  authorizes a new hospital facility and blood processing center at Fort  Leonard Wood.   As chairwoman of the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee, I am  proud of the provisions in the conference report that will improve the  foreign military sales process and provide the National Nuclear  Security Administration with much-needed flexibility to address the  crippling infrastructure of the U.S. nuclear security enterprise.   I want to thank Ranking Member Seth Moulton for his support in  working on these important issues in a bipartisan fashion.   Mr. Speaker, our troops deserve this bill and they deserve the  funding that this bill authorizes. Thanks to the leadership of Chairman  Thornberry, this conference report increased defense spending to meet  the needs of today's warfighter. I am proud of this critical bill, and  I urge my colleagues to support its passage.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman. I have a riddle  for everyone. What is the most dangerous book ever published? What is  the most powerful book ever written? What is the most cited book by  Presidents and our Nation's Founders? What is the most prized  possession that I own? The Bible.   It is a controversial book. Many people have it on their shelf at  home, or it gathers dust on some end table, and people think it is a  pretty innocuous book. But more people have lost their lives over this  book than any other book ever written.   Many rulers have ordered the gathering and burning of all Bibles in  the country, and, even today, in countries like North Korea, possession  of a Bible results in death or sentence to a labor camp.   Why? Well, because it is more than a historic book, although it is;  and it is more than a collection of wise advice and spellbounding  stories, which it is. It has the audacity to claim something radical  and all-inspiring at the same time. It claims to be the Word of God.   Now, as a result, it changes lives. The Bible reveals a plan. It  starts right out with these words: ``In the beginning, God made. . .  .'' That changes everything. That sets the stage saying that we are not  here by chance, that there is a loving God who has a design, and we are  a part of it. It makes a difference if we have a plan. It reveals that  plan. It also gives us a purpose.   Part of the Psalms in 139 says, we are ``fearfully and wonderfully  made'' by a loving God. We are not here by chance. And it goes on and  says, and this is God speaking: ``For I know the plans I have for you,  says the Lord, plans for good and not for evil, to give you a future  and a hope.''   That is exciting.   The Bible also gives us power. It gives us power to overcome evil,  hardship, and trials of life by revealing how God sent his son, Jesus,  to introduce us to God and make a way for us to have a personal  relationship with the living God who made us and loves us. It is  incredible.   The Bible also gives us peace and hope as a result, not just for  today, but for the future. I start each day reading from my Bible, and  I am so thankful for it. It has made a difference in my life. I want to  invite anyone who has never read it to read it and to discover God's  plan and purpose for your life which will give you power and peace. So  let this most radical book ever written touch and bless your life.
