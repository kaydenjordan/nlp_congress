 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   As the dean of the Ohio Republican delegation, I rise to welcome the  newest Buckeye to our delegation, Troy Balderson.   Troy was born and raised in southeast Ohio. He grew up and worked on  his family farm. He graduated from Zanesville High School. And, Mr.  Speaker, that is Zanesville, not Janesville. He also attended both  Muskingum College as well as The Ohio State University.   Prior to joining our delegation, Troy served our great State as both  a member of the Ohio House of Representatives and a member of the Ohio  Senate. He is no stranger to building relationships, learning the  issues, and solving problems. So he will do well here.   As a businessman, as my colleague mentioned, an elder at the  Christian Church in Zanesville, and as an athlete, Troy has proven time  and again that hard work and a little grit make a very strong leader. I  have no doubt that our delegation and the residents of the 12th  Congressional District will truly benefit from his experience. I  believe that we all will.   Congratulations to you and your family, Troy. On behalf of the Ohio  Republican delegation and I think all Members, welcome to the United  States House of Representatives.
