 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee  on the Judiciary be discharged from further consideration of H.R. 962,  the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, and ask for its  immediate consideration in the House.    Madam Speaker, I urge the Speaker and majority leader to  immediately schedule this bill to protect babies born alive and to stop  blocking this most basic responsibility we have.
