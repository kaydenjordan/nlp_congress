 Mr. Speaker, if there was ever a time for sobriety,  wisdom, and caution in this House, it is right now.   If this motion carries, the House will be paralyzed. We can expect  week after week of fruitless ballots while no other business can be  conducted. The Democrats will revel in Republican dysfunction, and the  public will rightly be repulsed. It will end when the Democrats are  able to enlist a rump caucus of Republicans to join a coalition to end  the impasse.   This House will shift dramatically to the left and will effectively  end the Republican House majority that the voters elected in 2022.  This, in turn, will neutralize the only counterweight in our elected  government to the woke left's control of the Senate and the White House  at a time when their policies are destroying our economy and have  opened our borders to invasion.   There are turning points in history whose significance is only  realized by the events that they unleash. This is one of those times.  We are at the precipice. There are only minutes left to come to our  senses and realize the grave danger our country is in at this moment.  Dear God, grant us the wisdom to see it and to save our country from  it.
