 Mr. Speaker, with a detailed poll showing that 54 percent  of the American people now support statehood for our Nation's capital,  the District of Columbia, we are optimistic about passage in the Senate  of H.R. 51.   I thank the House for passage of our statehood bill, for that passage  has spurred the American majority that now supports D.C. statehood. The  recent hearing in the Senate helped further educate Americans about our  statehood bill, noting that our country is the only democratic country  that denies equal representation for the people of its capital.   With continuing success with our D.C. statehood bill, we look forward  to reporting progress on our bill on becoming the State of Washington,  Douglass Commonwealth.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of S. 848, the Consider  Teachers Act of 2021. I introduced the companion bill with  Congresswoman Victoria Spartz. I would like to thank Senators Mike  Braun and Kyrsten Sinema also for their leadership on this bill, and my  good friend, Chairman  Bobby Scott, for bringing this bill to the floor  today.   This bill would improve the service obligation verification process  for the Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education  Grant Program, or TEACH grant program, as it is called. The TEACH grant  program was created to attract the best and brightest to the teaching  profession in underserved communities. The TEACH grant program provides  up to $4,000 a year in grants to students who agree to serve for at  least 4 years as full-time teachers in a high-need field in a public or  private elementary or secondary school that serves low-income families.  The obligation to teach 4 years must be completed within an 8-year  period. Those who do not fulfill their service requirement have their  grants converted into Federal direct unsubsidized Stafford loans which  must be paid back with interest. These loans cannot revert to grants.   According to the Office of Management and Budget, 66 percent of the  grants are converted into loans. Though 21,000 grant recipients have  completed the program without conversion, 94,000 recipients have had  their grants converted to loans. Those conversions are often triggered  by small paperwork issues, such as submitting the annual form 1 day  late or missing a date or signature.   In 2018, the U.S. Department of Education released a reconsideration  process for recipients who had their grants converted into loans but  had either fulfilled, or could still fulfill, their service  obligations. The department also turned back the clock to allow  teachers who had left the TEACH grant program once their grants were  converted to loans to give them more time to complete their service  obligations. These changes allowed the department to lift the debt of  2,300 recipients.   I am pleased that the department made additional improvements to the  program on July 1, 2021, including opening the reconsideration process  to all TEACH grant program recipients. This bill would codify some of  these changes, creating a safeguard from changes in  department leadership.    This bill would also outline yearly deadlines and notification  requirements to rectify some of the TEACH grant program's previous  administrative mishaps. Furthermore, with the onset of the coronavirus  pandemic, many recipients have had trouble finding qualifying work.  This bill would create a grace period for those individuals by  extending the service obligation fulfillment period by 3 years for  anyone who was fulfilling their obligations when the coronavirus  pandemic began.   This past year has given us all a hard lesson in the invaluable  service that teachers and educators provide to our society. As many  young students have turned to homeschooling and remote learning, we  have all come to appreciate the hard work and incredible talent of our  teachers who foster the mental, physical, and emotional growth of our  children every day. This bill ensures that that pipeline of talent for  the teaching profession remains strong and that we do not unduly burden  TEACH grant program recipients who have dedicated themselves to serving  our most vulnerable communities.   I understand what that means because my own mother, Vela Holmes, was  a teacher in the D.C. Public Schools.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan  bill.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2485) to require the Director of the Government Publishing  Office to establish and maintain an online portal accessible to the  public that allows the public to obtain electronic copies of all  congressionally mandated reports in one place, and for other purposes,  as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2485         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

SEC. 7. IMPLEMENTATION.         (a) Reports Submitted to Congress.--        (1) In general.--This Act shall apply with respect to any       congressionally mandated report which--        (A) is required by statute to be submitted to the House of       Representatives, or the Speaker thereof, or Senate, or the       President or President Pro Tempore thereof, at any time       before, on, or after the date of the enactment of this Act;       or        (B) is included by the Clerk of the House of       Representatives or the Secretary of the Senate (as the case       may be) on the list of reports received by the House of       Representatives or Senate (as the case may be) at any time       before the date of the enactment of this Act.

SEC. 8. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure before us.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Representative   Mike Quigley for his  persistence in pursuing this good government legislation. Hopefully, we  can get this bill enacted this Congress.   H.R. 2485, the Access to Congressionally Mandated Reports Act, is a  non-controversial bill that has been approved by the Oversight and  Reform Committee many times.   The bill is a commonsense measure that would make the government more  transparent and accountable. It would create a one-stop-shop where  Congress and members of the public could access agency reports to  Congress.   Federal agencies submit thousands of reports to Congress each year.  This bill will improve congressional oversight by making it easy to  find and access those reports.   H.R. 2485 would give the public access to agency reports. Currently,  members of the public often have to file requests under the Freedom of  Information Act to obtain agency reports to Congress because many of  these reports are not available online.   An online library of Federal reports would improve our ability to use  the information in them to make sound policy. It also would encourage  agency compliance with reporting requirements.   Finally, it would support timely access to the reports by State and  local governments, students, academics, and others with the additional  benefit of decreasing the burden on agencies to process Freedom of  Information Act requests.   The Access to Congressionally Mandated Reports Act is endorsed by  almost 40 organizations from across the political spectrum.   Mr. Speaker, I support this bill and urge all my colleagues to  support it, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman from Pennsylvania has no  further speakers, I am prepared to close, and I reserve the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of H.R. 2485, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 272) to amend the Federal Funding Accountability and  Transparency Act of 2006, to require the budget justifications and  appropriation requests of agencies be made publicly available.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                   S. 272         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Congressional Budget       Justification Transparency Act of 2021''.       SEC. 2. PUBLIC AVAILABILITY OF BUDGET JUSTIFICATIONS AND                     APPROPRIATION REQUESTS.

SEC. 3. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go-Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure before us.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the bill before us, the Congressional Budget  Justification Transparency Act, is a commonsense, good government  measure every Member should support.   It would require the congressional budget justification documents  that agencies prepare for congressional committees to be posted online  in a centralized, searchable database.   This would make these detailed, plain-language explanations of how  agencies plan to spend taxpayer dollars more accessible to the public.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Representative   Mike Quigley for his  work on the House companion to this measure. He has a long history as a  strong advocate of transparency in the operations of the Federal  Government.   This bill builds on the work of the Committee to improve government  transparency by allowing the public to more easily learn about how  Federal agencies spend their taxpayer dollars.   Mr. Speaker, I support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman from Pennsylvania has no  further speakers, I am prepared to close.    Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of S. 272, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3533) to establish occupational series for Federal positions  in software development, software engineering, data science, and data  management, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3533         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. OCCUPATIONAL SERIES FOR DIGITAL CAREER FIELDS.         Not later than 270 days after the date of the enactment of       this Act, the Director of the Office of Personnel Management,       shall, pursuant to chapter 51 of title 5, United States Code,       establish or update existing occupational series covering       Federal Government positions in the fields of software       development, software engineering, data science, and data       management.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous materials on H.R. 3533.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3533, the Federal Career  Opportunities in Computer Science Work Act. I commend my colleagues,  Representative Obernolte and Representative Welch, for their bipartisan  work on this measure.   This bill would require the Office of Personnel Management to update  or establish occupational series for Federal civilian positions in  software development, software engineering, data science, and data  management within 270 days of enactment.   It would implement a recommendation that was included in the final  report of the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence.  In its report, the commission stated: ``The artificial intelligence  competition will not be won by the side with the best technology. It  will be won by the side with the best, most diverse and tech-savvy  talent.''   To attract and retain digital talent, the commission recommended that  the Federal Government create the civilian occupational series that are  included in this bill. This bipartisan bill would help support  recruitment of professionals with these specialized skills for Federal  employment.   This is an important step in helping Federal agencies recruit, hire,  and retain the talent that is needed to remain competitive in the  digital domain.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly support this bill, I urge my colleagues to do  the same, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers. I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of H.R. 3533, and I yield  back the balance of my time.  [[Page H3875]]     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3599) to establish a Federal rotational cyber workforce  program for the Federal cyber workforce, and for other purposes, as  amended.

SEC. 6. SUNSET.         Effective 5 years after the date of enactment of this Act,       this Act is repealed.       SEC. 7. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and insert extraneous material on H.R. 3599.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to support H.R. 3599, the Federal Rotational  Cyber Workforce Program Act. This bill is the product of bipartisan  cooperation of our Oversight and Reform Committee members,  Representatives Ro Khanna and Nancy Mace, and I want to thank them for  their work on this bill.   Earlier this year, our committee held a hearing on the Government  Accountability Office's 2021 High-Risk Report, which details the areas  of government operations at greatest risk of failing to meet the  considerable challenges they face.   Cybersecurity was near the top of the list, along with the cyber  skills gap that persists across the Federal workforce. As the  Government Accountability Office report described, Federal agencies are  struggling to ensure that staff have the skills required to address the  critical cybersecurity risks and challenges that our government faces.   Recent cyberattacks have demonstrated the dire consequences of  failing to improve the Federal Government's cybersecurity operations.  These include the SolarWinds breach, in which Russian hackers  infiltrated the networks of nine Federal agencies and went undetected  for months.   Around the same time, cyberattacks linked to the Chinese government  targeted Microsoft's enterprise email software and threatened the  internal data of Federal agencies. In addition, Russian hackers  successfully breached the servers of the U.S. Department of State and  stole thousands of emails.   The Federal Rotational Cyber Workforce Program Act, as it is called,  would enable cybersecurity professionals in the Federal Government to  rotate through assignments outside of their regular position. This  would allow more agencies to benefit from their enterprise and give  program participants the opportunities for professional development.  The program would be authorized for 5 years and, after 3 years, the  Government Accountability Office would assess the operation and  effectiveness of the program.   This legislation would go a long way toward improving Federal  agencies' capacity to strengthen cybersecurity operations, help retain  top talent, and facilitate the exchange of expertise in this critical  field.   The security of Federal information technology systems and data is  essential to national security, to preserving public trust in  government institutions, and to ensuring that agencies meet their  missions in serving the American people.   I strongly support this bill, and I urge my colleagues to do the  same.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Khanna).    Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of H.R. 3599, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1204) to amend the District of Columbia Home Rule Act to  permit the District of Columbia to establish the rate of pay of the  Chief Financial Officer of the District of Columbia.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1204         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``District of Columbia Chief       Financial Officer Salary Home Rule Act''.       SEC. 2. PERMITTING DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA TO ESTABLISH RATE OF                     PAY OF CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER OF DISTRICT OF                     COLUMBIA.         Section 424(b)(2)(E) of the District of Columbia Home Rule       Act (sec. 1-204.24b(b)(5), D.C. Official Code) is amended to       read as follows:        ``(E) Pay.--The Chief Financial Officer shall be paid at       the greater of--        ``(i) a rate such that the total amount of compensation       paid during any calendar year is equal to the limit on total       pay which is applicable during the year under section 5307 of       title 5, United States Code, to an employee described in       section 5307(d) of such title; or        ``(ii) a rate established in law by the District of       Columbia, except that any rate established under this clause       which is applicable to any individual serving as the Chief       Financial Officer shall not be reduced during any period of       the individual's service as Chief Financial Officer.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the measure before us.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  [[Page H3878]]    Mr. Speaker, this bill will give the District of Columbia the  authority to increase the pay of the D.C. chief financial officer. D.C.  requested that I introduce this bill so that it can retain and recruit  the best CFOs. At the outset, I want to emphasize that the CFO is paid  exclusively with local D.C. funds, not Federal funds.   Under the D.C. Home Rule Act, Congress established a maximum rate of  pay for the CFO, and the D.C. council has no authority to increase that  rate. Congress does not cap, or otherwise establish, the pay of any  other D.C. employee. Under this bill, the CFO would be paid at the  greater of a rate equal to the maximum rate of pay of the CFO in  current law or at a rate established in law by the District of  Columbia.   The CFO was established by Congress in 1995. Congress vested the CFO  with extraordinary powers and designed the CFO to be independent of the  D.C. Mayor and council. The CFO may be removed only for cause by the  Mayor, subject to the approval of two-thirds of the council and a 30- day congressional review and comment period. This bill would maintain  the independence of the CFO by establishing a permanent floor on the  CFO's pay and by prohibiting the council from reducing the CFO's pay  during the CFO's term.   The D.C. CFO is unique in the United States. D.C. cannot obligate or  expend funds without the CFO's certification that available funds  exist. The CFO manages a $17 billion budget that consists of State,  county, and city functions, and the CFO has more than 1,700 employees.   D.C. is currently searching for a permanent CFO. Although the CFO is  the most important non-elected official in the district, more than 20  D.C. employees are paid more than the CFO. D.C. must compete with both  the private and public sectors for high-quality CFOs, and there are  many private- and public-sector CFOs who are paid more than the D.C.  CFO.   I thank Chairwoman Maloney for her support of this bill, and I thank  Ranking Member Comer for his support of this bill in committee.   This bill is critical to the financial operations of the District of  Columbia. I urge my colleagues to support it, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of H.R. 1204, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 978) to require the head of each agency to establish a  safety plan relating to COVID-19 for any worksite at which employees or  contractors are required to be physically present during the COVID-19  pandemic, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 978         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Chai Suthammanont       Remembrance Act of 2021''.       SEC. 2. WORKSITE SAFETY FOR FEDERAL EMPLOYEES AND                     CONTRACTORS.         (a) Issuance of Policies and Procedures by Agencies.--Not       later than 60 days after the date of the enactment of this       Act, the head of each agency, in consultation with the Chief       Human Capital Officer of the agency and the Assistant       Director of Administration of the agency (or any individual       holding an equivalent position) shall--        (1) establish, and publish on the website of that agency, a       safety plan containing procedures and policies for--        (A) covered worksites; and        (B) being present at a covered worksite; and        (2) communicate such plan to each employee of the agency       and contractor of the agency (and any subcontractor thereof       at any tier) in such a manner as to ensure that each such       employee and contractor acknowledges receipt and       understanding of the plan.        (b) Plan.--The safety plan required under subsection (a)       shall, at a minimum, include the following:        (1) A description of the efforts of the agency with respect       to mitigating the spread of COVID-19 at covered worksites,       including the following:        (A) A description of any personal protective equipment that       is being or will be provided by the agency to any employee of       the agency and contractor of the agency (and any       subcontractor thereof at any tier) physically present at a       covered worksite.        (B) A description of any procedures established by the       agency for--        (i) testing employees of the agency and contractors of the       agency (and any subcontractor thereof at any tier) required       to be present at a covered worksite;        (ii) contact-tracing at covered worksites, including       procedures by which such employees and contractors (and any       subcontractor thereof at any tier) will be notified of a       potential exposure to an individual who is diagnosed with       COVID-19; and        (iii) administering the COVID-19 vaccine to employees of       the agency.        (2) Guidance on--        (A) any cleaning protocols to be implemented at covered       worksites;        (B) occupancy limits for covered worksites; and        (C) the use of appropriate face coverings by employees of       the agency and contractors of the agency (and any       subcontractor thereof at any tier) while physically present       at a covered worksite.        (3) A description of the actions the agency is or will be       taking to protect from exposure to COVID-19 employees of the       agency who conduct activities in an official capacity while       not physically present at a covered worksite, including       employees of the agency--        (A) who are required to travel in an official capacity; or        (B) perform audits or inspections.

(6) A description of any rule or protocol regarding whether       employees of the agency required to be physically present at       covered worksites are--        (A) required to be fully vaccinated before being present at       covered worksites; or        (B) allowed to take leave--        (i) to get each dose of the vaccine; or        (ii) upon experiencing severe side-effects as a result of       receiving any dose of such vaccine.        (7) Protocols that ensure the continuity of operations,       including a plan to reverse any requirement for an employee       or contractor (or subcontractor thereof at any tier) to be       present at a facility in which covered worksites are located       if there is a surge in  [[Page H3879]]       COVID-19 cases in the geographic area of such facility.        (8) The hotline website and hotline telephone number of the       Inspector General of the agency for employees of the agency       and contractors of the agency (and any subcontractor thereof       at any tier) to report to the Inspector General any instance       in which the agency is not implementing the plan required by       this section.

(d) Inspectors General Reports.--Not later than 6 months       after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Inspector       General of each agency shall submit to the Committee on       Oversight and Reform of the House of Representatives and the       Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs of       the Senate a report on whether that agency--        (1) has published and communicated the public safety plan       required by subsection (a), in accordance with such       subsection; and        (2) implemented such plan.        (e) Application.--Nothing in this Act shall be construed to       alter or otherwise limit the rights and obligations afforded       under chapter 71 of title 5, United States Code.        (f) Definitions.--In this section:        (1) Agency.--The term ``agency'' has the meaning given that       term in section 551 of title 5, United States Code.        (2) Covered period.--The term ``covered period'' means the       period beginning on the date of the enactment of this Act and       ending on the date on which the public health emergency       declared by the Secretary of Health and Human Services under       section 319 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 247)       as a result of the COVID-19, or any renewal thereof,       terminates.        (3) Covered worksite.--The term ``covered worksite'' means       a worksite at which an employee of the agency or a contractor       of the agency (or subcontractor thereof at any tier) is       required to be present during the covered period.

SEC. 3. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the measure before us.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 978 would require Federal agencies to establish  protocols and protections to ensure the health and safety of Federal  employees upon returning to their regular workstations.   Each agency would be responsible for posting its policy on its  website and properly notifying employees of the procedures within 60  days of enactment or 30 days before a closed worksite reopens.   Within 6 months, the inspector general of each agency must submit to  Congress a review on implementation and communication of the  procedures.   I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this bill, which is named  in honor of one of Representative Connolly's constituents, a Federal  employee, who died tragically of coronavirus in May of last year.   Federal employees both here in Washington, D.C., and across the  country have been on the front lines of the government response to the  coronavirus pandemic from the beginning.   As more are preparing to return to their regular worksites, this  legislation will help make sure that policies are clearly conveyed to  employees so that return happens safely.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support this bill, and I urge Members to  vote ``yes.''    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Connolly), my good friend and colleague.    Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of the bill, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2617) to amend section 1115 of title 31, United States Code,  to amend the description of how performance goals are achieved, and for  other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2617         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Performance Enhancement       Reform Act''.       SEC. 2. AMENDMENT.         Section 1115 of title 31, United States Code, is amended--        (1) by amending subsection (b)(5) to read as follows:        ``(5) provide a description of how the performance goals       are to be achieved, including--        ``(A) the human capital, training, data and evidence,       information technology, and skill sets required to meet the       performance goals;        ``(B) the technology modernization investments, system       upgrades, staff technology skills and expertise, stakeholder       input and feedback, and other resources and strategies needed       and required to meet the performance goals;        ``(C) clearly defined milestones;        ``(D) an identification of the organizations, program       activities, regulations, policies, operational processes, and       other activities that contribute to each performance goal,       both within and external to the agency;        ``(E) a description of how the agency is working with other       agencies and the organizations identified in subparagraph (D)       to measure and achieve its performance goals as well as       relevant Federal Government performance goals; and        ``(F) an identification of the agency officials responsible       for the achievement of each performance goal, who shall be       known as goal leaders;''; and        (2) by amending subsection (g) to read as follows:        ``(g) Preparation of Performance Plan.--The Chief       Performance Improvement Office (or the functional equivalent)       shall collaborate with the Chief Human Capital Officer (or       the functional equivalent), the Chief Information Officer (or       the functional equivalent), the Chief Data Officer (or the       functional equivalent), and the Chief Financial Officer (or       the functional equivalent) to prepare that portion of the       annual performance plan described under subsection (b)(5).''.       SEC. 3. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go-Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous material on H.R. 2617.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the Performance Enhancement Reform Act, introduced by  Government Operations subcommittee chair Gerry Connolly and Ranking  Member Jody Hice, builds on the Government Performance and Reform Act  of 1993. That law requires Federal agencies to develop 5-year strategic  plans and annual performance plans and reports.   The law was updated in 2010 to require greater involvement by the  Office of Management and Budget to incorporate governmentwide priority  goals and to improve accountability by requiring agencies to publish  these plans and reports online.   The Performance Enhancement Reform Act would require the development  of a more comprehensive annual performance plan through collaboration  between senior agency leaders, including chief human capital officers,  chief performance officers, chief information officers, and the chief  financial officer.   The bill would also require agency performance plans to include  descriptions of any skill set the agency needs to meet its performance  goals. This would be an important reform to identify any gaps in  expertise or resources an agency must address to accomplish its goals.   This commonsense, bipartisan measure will enhance agency management  and strengthen the focus on achieving the agencies' missions.  [[Page H3881]]    I urge my colleagues to vote for H.R. 2617, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Connolly).    Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of H.R. 2617, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 2382) to authorize the National Cyber Director to accept  details from other elements of the Federal Government on  nonreimbursable basis, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 2382         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. AUTHORITY FOR NATIONAL CYBER DIRECTOR TO ACCEPT                     DETAILS ON NONREIMBURSABLE BASIS.         Section 1752(e) of the William M. (Mac) Thornberry National       Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021 (Public Law       116-283) is amended--        (1) by redesignating paragraphs (1) through (8) as       subparagraphs (A) through (H), respectively, and indenting       such subparagraphs two ems to the right;        (2) in the matter before subparagraph (A), as redesignated       by paragraph (1), by striking ``The Director may'' and       inserting the following:        ``(1) In general.--The Director may'';        (3) in paragraph (1)--        (A) as redesignated by paragraph (2), by redesignating       subparagraphs (C) through (H) as subparagraphs (D) through       (I), respectively; and        (B) by inserting after subparagraph (B) the following new       subparagraph (C):        ``(C) accept officers or employees of the United States or       member of the Armed Forces on a detail from an element of the       intelligence community or from another element of the Federal       Government on a nonreimbursable basis, as jointly agreed to       by the  [[Page H3882]]       heads of the receiving and detailing elements, for a period       not to exceed three years;''; and        (4) by adding at the end the following new paragraph:        ``(2) Rules of construction regarding details.--Paragraph       (1)(C) shall not be construed to impose any limitation on any       other authority for reimbursable or nonreimbursable details.       A nonreimbursable detail made under such paragraph shall not       be considered an augmentation of the appropriations of the       receiving element of the Office of the National Cyber       Director.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous materials on S. 2382.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in support of S. 2382, which would allow the National Cyber  Director to accept details from other elements of the Federal  Government as on a nonreimbursable basis.   Last year the Committee on Oversight and Reform helped advance  legislation to establish the Office of the National Cyber Director in  the Executive Office of the President. The bipartisan effort fulfilled  a key recommendation of the U.S. Cyberspace Solarium Commission, which  was established by the 2019 National Defense Authorization Act to  review the condition of our Nation's cybersecurity posture and to  develop solutions to defend against cyber threats.                                time  1700    The National Cyber Director Act was signed into law through last  year's National Defense Authorization Act, creating a centralized  cybersecurity position in the White House to assist in the development  and streamlining of the Federal Government's strategy, coordination,  and response to cyber threats.   We were thrilled to see President Biden nominate and the Senate  confirm Chris Inglis, a widely-respected member of the Solarium  Commission, as the Nation's first National Cyber Director. Now, Mr.  Inglis needs a team to get to work immediately to address  cybersecurity, which remains one of the most urgent threats on the  Government Accountability Office's high-risk list.   Indeed, the State and non-state actors from Russia, China, Iran,  North Korea, and all corners of the globe are waging a silent war  capable of shutting down our critical infrastructure, breaching our  sensitive information system, and jeopardizing critical sectors in  America and globally.   Until Congress acts to provide the Office of the National Cyber  Director its first appropriation, the Office requires the ability to  bring in details on a nonreimbursable basis. This bill would grant that  authority.   Cyberattacks are critical, widespread, complex, and escalating as a  threat to our national and economic security. A challenge as grave and  pervasive as cybersecurity requires that our government be strategic,  organized, and ready. It is imperative that we pass this bill  immediately to allow the Office of the National Cyber Director to get  up running as it awaits its full appropriation.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly support this bill, and I urge my colleagues  to do the same. I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 5 minutes to the  gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Langevin).    Mr. Speaker, I strongly support this bill and urge my  colleagues to do the same. I yield back the balance of my time.
