 DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman  for yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the rule and in strong  support of the act. As I listened to the discussion relative to the  coronavirus, the pandemic, I am very optimistic now with the advent and  the announcement of vaccines that may very well prove to be effective.  It means that as we gain control of the pandemic, as we gain control of  the virus, we are going to need a well-trained, skilled workforce ready  and available to work if we are going to rebuild and redevelop our  economic status. Having this workforce available, increasing  apprenticeship training and opportunities is one of the best possible  things that we could do.   Madam Speaker, I commend Representative Scott and the Committee on  Education and Labor for their work on this bill. I urge strong support  for it and I will vote to pass it, and I can hardly wait to do so.
