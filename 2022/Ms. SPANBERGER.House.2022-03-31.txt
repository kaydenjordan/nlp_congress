 Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the remarkable  contributions of Phil Jenkins, who recently finished serving as  managing and executive editor at the Free Lance-Star in Fredericksburg,  Virginia.   Phil gave his time, his energy, and his dedication to the Free Lance- Star for 24 years.   ``Equally wise and unflappable,'' that is how his colleagues describe  him. ``A trusted leader, gifted editor, and generous mentor.''   When he arrived at the paper in 1998, Phil made sure the paper stayed  at the top of its game. As the years went on, his determination guided  the paper through difficult stretches and through thousands of local  news developments.   He oversaw critical investigations, including those related to the  D.C. sniper trial. He managed major transitions, such as shifting from  an afternoon to morning production cycle and moving the paper's offices  to downtown Fredericksburg.   Under Phil's leadership the Free Lance-Star was nine times judged as  Virginia's best midsize daily between 2011 and 2020, winning first  place for its writing, design, and photography.   In Fredericksburg, Phil supervised dozens of people, including  writers, photographers, designers, editors, web producers, and clerical  staff. Those who worked with him over the years said that ``few knew a  more journalistically savvy, more evenhanded or more calming influence  in the newsroom.''   When asked to describe Phil's tenure at the paper, a former colleague  said that Phil showed ``unparalleled leadership'' as well as ``an  uncanny ability to measure and satiate the community's hunger for the  news that makes it unique.''   Today, Phil's staff and the entire greater Fredericksburg region and  the Free Lance-Star readership will greatly miss Phil's hand at the  helm of the Free Lance-Star.   One former Free Lance-Star editor said, ``Working with such a gifted  journalist and wonderful person as Phil Jenkins was one of the highest  honors of my life. There is no way to adequately thank him for the  contributions he has made to the paper and to the community.''   Phil's service to the Fredericksburg area and Virginia overall speaks  to the enduring importance of local news, including print journalism.  Local news keeps us informed about the day-to-day events in our  communities. It allows us to share the triumphs of our neighbors. It  holds those in power to account, and it brings to light the challenges  we face together, as a community, as a Commonwealth, and as a country.   As another former colleague said, ``Nobody gave more to the cause of  community journalism than Phil Jenkins.''   Today, on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives, I would  like to thank Phil Jenkins for his service to the people of Virginia.  We thank him for his devotion to his colleagues, his commitment to  accuracy, and his love of a good story founded on the truth.                                time  1045                          Recognizing Bill Shugarts     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Seventh  District constituent and U.S. Army veteran Bill Shugarts.   Bill is a Vietnam veteran who served with the 23rd Infantry Division.  In Vietnam, Bill planned and ran convoys, and one day, while doing  command and control above the Hiep Duc Valley, Bill was in a helicopter  crash. Thankfully, he suffered only minimal injuries.   Bill was honorably discharged in 1971 with various commendations and  medals, including a Bronze Star with two oak leaf clusters. He began a  successful corporate career spanning three different Fortune 500  companies.   But never forgetting his experiences in Vietnam or with his soldiers,  Bill has devoted himself to his fellow veterans and our Nation's allies  who have stood by our servicemembers.   In service to the community and local veterans, Bill founded the  Northern Virginia Military Ministry Outreach, and he cofounded the Fawn  Lake Veterans Group. He is a docent at the U.S. Army Museum, and he is  a lay leader of the Methodist Wilderness Community Church's military  ministry.   In my earliest days in office, and well before the final exit of  American forces from Afghanistan, Bill was working to bring attention  to the urgent needs of the SIV program. As a founding member of No One  Left Behind, Bill focused on increasing the number of visas available,  speeding up processing, and bringing refuge to those in danger. Bill  worked closely with my office as we strived to make progress, get  questions answered, and ultimately get SIVs home to America, their new  home.   Now, through their church, Bill and his wife, Margene, continue their  tireless work to help Afghan evacuees resettle and build community in  their new home in Virginia.   Bill represents the best of Virginia, a Commonwealth made stronger  through our ability to keep our promises to our veterans, our military  families, and our allies. As the U.S. Representative for Virginia's  Seventh District, I thank Bill Shugarts for his advocacy, his  compassion, and his deep and abiding sense of service to our country  and our Commonwealth.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I have been so pleased to hear  colleagues across the aisle speak in favor of competition and price  negotiations.   I hope that they will follow through in their commitment to  supporting competition and negotiation and co-sponsor Lower Drug Costs  Now, H.R. 3.   But that is not the bill we are talking about today. Today, we are  talking about the Affordable Insulin Now Act, a bill that would make  changes in the lives of the more than 630,000 Virginians who are living  with diabetes.   The Affordable Insulin Now Act would finally make sure that every  affected child, teenager, family member, every American can afford the  insulin that they need.   People living with diabetes do not have the choice of whether to  purchase insulin or not. They depend on it to stay alive. People like  my constituent, Joshua Davis, a 13-year-old Virginian with type 1  diabetes who accompanied Dr. Jill Biden to the State of the Union  Address earlier this year.   I am proud to co-sponsor this legislation to make sure that no  American is skipping lifesaving doses of their insulin or making  choices between whether they take their insulin or put food on the  table.   I am grateful to my colleagues for leading this effort.
