 Madam Speaker, I am a proud original cosponsor of H.R.  2547 and rise in its strong support. This important legislation  contains my bill, the Small Business Lending Fairness Act, that  prohibits the use of a confession of judgment in commercial loans at  the Federal level.   As chair of the House Small Business Committee, I understand better  than most how the COVID-19 pandemic has restricted access to capital  and forced the closure of many of America's small businesses.   Unfortunately, some lenders and debt collectors are seeking to cash  in on the pandemic. Whether it is a taxi driver in New York City  pursuing the American Dream or a small business owner trying to make  payroll, predatory lenders and collectors have been targeting small  businesses with loans that have excessively high interest rates and  unfair and abusive terms, like a confession of judgment.   Because cash flow is so vital to a business' survival, many owners  feel they have no choice but to sign away their rights to save their  businesses and provide for their employees. By signing a confession of  judgment, borrowers essentially waive the legal rights regarding any  legal dispute that might arise. And if one does arise, the lender can  unilaterally declare a default and take actions against the small  business owner.   Often, small business borrowers only find out about a judgment  against them after the lender begins to seize bank accounts or other  assets.   While confessions of judgment have been banned at the Federal level  for consumer loans since 1985, these protections have not been extended  to commercial loans. Passing this legislation here today will bring us  one step closer to finally ending this abusive practice.  [[Page H2282]]    I want to thank Chairwoman Waters for including this important  language in her bill, and I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.''
