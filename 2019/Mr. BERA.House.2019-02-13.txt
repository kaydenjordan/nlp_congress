 Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.J. Res. 37, and  applaud Chairman Engel, as well as my colleague from California, Mr.  Khanna, on their leadership.    This joint resolution would direct the removal of U.S. forces from  supporting the Saudi and Emirati that campaign in Yemen. We will still  be supporting our fight against ISIS and al-Qaida in the Arabian  Peninsula, which Congress has specifically authorized. We are not  debating that.   We are also not debating, as some might suggest, setting a precedent  when it comes to cooperating with our allies. This is about hostilities  we are engaged in because we are supporting a coalition in war.   We have not authorized our military to act in the Yemeni civil war.  This is about reclaiming the jurisdiction of Congress in making a war.  That is our job. That is what we were elected to do. I would say that  if there were a Democrat or a Republican in the White House.   Now, if the administration wants to be involved there, they need to  come to Congress and make a compelling case. But let's have that  discussion.   For that reason, I support this resolution, and I urge my colleagues  to join me in helping to move this resolution out of the House.
