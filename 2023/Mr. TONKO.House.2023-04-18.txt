 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.J. Res. 27, the  Congressional Review Act joint resolution of disapproval targeting the  clean water restoration rule.   Our waterways, like the mighty Hudson and Mohawk Rivers that flow  through my district in New York's capital region, are key economic  engines as drivers of heritage tourism and outdoor recreation, as well  as cherished gathering spaces for our communities, if we indeed care  for them.   The Biden administration's clean water restoration rule restores  protections for the rivers, the streams, and the wetlands that  constituents in all of our district areas rely upon.   I will reinstate key safeguards to stop big polluters from recklessly  dumping waste into our water systems and damaging the fragile wetlands  that are so crucial for the resilience of our coasts.   Importantly, the rule is grounded in science. An important fact. It  restores the same science-based approach that Presidential  administrations have utilized for decades to assess the conditions of  upstream waters to protect the health of downstream ecosystems and  communities.   Our water systems are fragile and interconnected. As an engineer, I  know the importance of using a science and data-driven approach to  achieve the very best results for our communities.   The dangerous legislation before us today is an attempt to overturn  these finalized regulations. This is an attack on the clean water that  is critical to the health of our communities, our Nation's economy, and  particularly our agricultural and energy sectors.   Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to oppose it.
