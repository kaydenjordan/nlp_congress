 Mr. Chair, once again, House Republicans are determined  to visit cruel and unusual punishment on the American people by  presenting a budget that is reckless, regressive, and reprehensible. It  is a budget that will hurt working families, middle class folks, senior  citizens, the poor, the sick, the afflicted, veterans, and rural  America.   It is a budget that will eradicate the social safety net, end  Medicare as we know it, rip away health insurance from 23 million  Americans, and impose billions and billions of dollars in life-altering  debt on younger Americans.   It is outrageous that this is all being done to enact tax cuts for  the wealthy and the well-off, tax cuts for the privileged few, tax cuts  for special interests here in Washington, D.C.   This parade of horribles is being jammed down the throats of this  country so that everyday Americans can subsidize the lifestyles of the  rich and shameless.   We deserve better. The Democratic budget will invest in  transportation and infrastructure, invest in education and job  training, invest in the social safety net, invest in research and  development, invest in affordable housing, and invest in the wellbeing  of everyday Americans.   The Republican budget is a raw deal. The Democratic budget is a  better deal, focused on better jobs, better wages, and a better future.  It is worthy of our support.   The Acting CHAIR. The Committee will rise informally.   The Speaker pro tempore (Mrs. Handel) assumed the chair.                            ____________________
