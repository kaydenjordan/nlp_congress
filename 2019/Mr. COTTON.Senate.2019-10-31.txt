 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session and be in a period of morning business,  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, last weekend, elite U.S. Special  Operations forces embarked on a daring and dangerous mission to locate  and kill or capture the terrorist leader of ISIS, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.   These soldiers knew that Baghdadi's compound was well guarded by  radical Islamic terrorists who placed little  [[Page S6347]]  value on their own lives. They knew the compound was booby-trapped and  that Baghdadi kept innocent children as human shields to protect  himself against attack.   Nevertheless, these soldiers carried out their mission fearlessly and  flawlessly. They breached the compound, eliminated Baghdadi's  Praetorian Guard, and then cornered the terrorist leader in a dead end,  underground tunnel.   Baghdadi chose the coward's way out, detonating a suicide vest, even  though he was surrounded by his own children. True to form, he was as  evil in the final moments of his life as he had been throughout it.   Now Baghdadi is dead, thanks to the brave men and women of the U.S.  Armed Forces and our canines too. There is no other Nation on Earth  whose military could have carried out this raid, and the American  people ought to be proud of them.   To commemorate their stunning success, Senator Graham and I have a  resolution to honor the leaders and members of the military  intelligence community who made it possible and to commend the  President for his decisive leadership in ordering the raid.   Therefore, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed  to the consideration of S. Res. 394 submitted earlier today.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the resolution be  agreed to; the preamble be agreed to; and that the motions to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no  intervening action or debate.
