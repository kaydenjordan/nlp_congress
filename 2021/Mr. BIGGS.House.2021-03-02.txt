 Madam Speaker, the majority leader just said: Everything  we do depends on this bill.   I guess he is right because the Democrats are trying to tip the  scales of elections to their party. Besides giving the uni-party in the  swamp power, funding politicians with taxpayer dollars, and preventing  the use of voter identification laws, Democrats will prevent ballot  harvesting and mandate nationwide mail-in balloting, which Jimmy Carter  himself said is a recipe for fraud.   Madam Speaker, Democrats are so enamored of power, it appears that  they want to legalize cheating in elections. If that isn't enough for  you, they want 16-year-olds to be able to register to vote, as well as  felons and illegal aliens to be able to vote. What could possibly go  wrong?   Madam Speaker, while most in the country have some doubt as to the  integrity of our elections across both parties, my colleagues across  the aisle want to ensure we never have an honest election again.   This bill is a dubious path on which to embark. If we do not stop it  again, it will become increasingly difficult to depart to a better road  that actually restores trust in America.   Madam Speaker, when I hear the argument of voter suppression, I say  we had more voters in the last election for President than ever--more  than ever. This bill is a monstrosity. It is a waste. It is  unnecessary. I urge people to vote ``no.''
