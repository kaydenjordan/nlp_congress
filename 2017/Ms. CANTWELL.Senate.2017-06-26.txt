 Mr. President, I come to the floor to join my  colleagues. We can see there are numerous colleagues on this side of  the aisle who are speaking, just as my colleague from Vermont just did  with great passion or my colleague from Massachusetts did with great  passion and as I am sure my colleague from Minnesota will. We have all  been home for the weekend talking to our constituents. We are all back  here now with the CBO news, and we are here because we are very  concerned about the next steps the Senate might take in this healthcare  debate.   When I was at home, I heard some unbelievably positive stories about  healthcare. I was at a hospital in our State, Virginia Mason, which has  been one of the leaders in reducing healthcare costs by utilizing new  efficiencies. They have improved the return time of getting lab results  to patients by 85 percent; they have increased productivity in some  areas by 90 percent; they have reduced liability insurance premiums by  76 percent. They have innovated. They have innovated. They have  innovated. They talked about the direction healthcare should go, and  not once did they mention cutting or capping Medicaid as a solution.   I also talked to a community health center which, under the  Affordable Care Act, was actually able to expand in a community. They  literally cut in half the uninsured, and they are delivering great  adult dental access to thousands of people in a county that didn't have  good access to dental care. They are making great progress.   I talked to a veteran who served our country, who literally got out  and is now going to school but without the help of Medicaid would not  have been able to cover her healthcare expenses.   I met a woman on the street who told me her husband had lost his job.  She never thought they would be on Medicaid, but when he lost his job,  they went on Medicaid, and they depended on that to provide healthcare  for themselves and their children.   I met a gentleman who also said he, too, lost his job, and after that  came down with a serious, life-threatening illness, and it was only  Medicaid that saved him.   So what do we know today that is different than last Friday? We now  have some CBO numbers. We know the numbers. We know the numbers: that  22 more million Americans, as a result of this bill, if it is passed,  would be uninsured; 15 million of them on Medicaid; and $772 billion in  Medicaid cuts. We know we thought it was heartless. Now we see the  numbers that say cutting that many people off of Medicaid is, in my  opinion, as my colleagues have also said, not something we should be  pursuing as a nation. It leaves us to ask about not just the impact of  this on individuals, as I just mentioned--because I believe there is a  much better way to go with innovation--but what it also does for the  individual market. A lot of this debate started because people thought  the individual market hadn't seen some of the benefits of the employer- sponsored system. Well, why not talk about the individual market?   If 7 percent of the way people access health insurance, the  individual market, was having a problem, why not talk about ideas to  improve the individual market? Instead, we have a bill from the House  and the Senate that beats up on the Medicaid population as if they are  the culprit. If you want to improve Medicaid and delivery services and  help decrease costs, let's do that. There are so many innovative ideas,  but just cutting people off Medicaid to solve the individual market  problem doesn't even make sense to me.   We now have, as of last Friday, too, the Center on Budget Policy and  Priorities' assessment, talking about how this would raise individual  premiums in the individual market. They gave some examples. For  example, in West Virginia and Nevada, a 60-year-old with an income of  $36,000 would pay respectively, $5,000 and $4,000 more than what  [[Page S3760]]  they are paying now. In Alaska, a 60-year-old making $45,000 would pay  $5,777 more than what they are paying now for premiums. So the notion  that this bill is driving down costs is just a fallacy.   We have heard from Republican and Democratic Governors talking about  this. They sent us a letter saying the first thing we should do is  focus on improving our Nation's private health insurance system. Where  did the Governors ask that you come and beat up on Medicaid? They  didn't say that. They didn't say: Please beat up on Medicaid, have a  big party covering people on Medicaid as a partner with us for 65 years  and then leave us stuck with the bill. They didn't say that. They say:         Medicaid provisions included in this bill are problematic.       Instead, we recommend Congress address factors we can all       agree need fixing.    That is a pretty clear message, I believe, from Republican Governors  who are saying this is not the way to fix healthcare.   Also, last week, a nonpartisan study by the George Washington  University found that the House-passed bill would have a huge economic  impact on our country. States' economies would shrink by $93 billion,  compared to what they would be without the bill. Business output would  be cut $148 billion. The study notes that the bill, combined with  normal economic cycles ``could contribute to a period of economic and  medical hardship in the U.S.''   That report also talks about job loss throughout the country, saying  that individual states would see more than $1 billion in lost gross  State product, just because of the number of people who wouldn't be  covered, the number of healthcare providers who would no longer be  there, the loss of healthcare infrastructure and then the impact on the  healthcare system overall for uncompensated care. These are costs we  can't afford.   As my colleague Senator Sanders mentioned, there are all these  healthcare organizations that have now come out saying they don't  support this Senate-drafted bill. The Academy of Family Physicians  knows about caring for the Medicaid population. They are seeing so many  patients, and they know what this challenge is. The American  Psychological Association doesn't support this bill. Other healthcare  associations, such as the Catholic Health Association, do not support  this bill. I have a long list.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record  the list of healthcare-related organizations and others that don't  support this legislation.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:              Organizations Opposed to Senate Health Care Bill         Alliance for Retired Persons, America's Essential       Hospitals, American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP),       American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), American Association of       People with Disabilities (AAPD), American Association of       Retired Persons (AARP), American Cancer Society Cancer Action       Network (ACS CAN), American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU),       American College of Physicians (ACP), American Congress of       Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), American Diabetes       Association, American Federation of State.

Mr. President, I hope my colleagues understand that  there are those here who are very willing to talk about how we can  improve our healthcare system, but we are not going to make poor  Americans the scapegoat of our healthcare challenges.   A gentleman named Joe Baker, president of the Medicare Rights Center,  I think, said it best. He said:         You or someone you love is going to need Medicaid. You may       not need the nursing home care . . . but you may rely on       community-based services, like home care, that will allow you       to stay in your home and out of a nursing facility. Medicaid       is the lifeline that covers many of the benefits that       Medicare does not provide.    Now why did I read that? Why did I pick a guy who is the head of a  Medicare organization? Because he knows what his individual  organization participants need in a healthcare delivery system.  Everybody knows--everybody knows the people of America are living  longer and as they age they need more healthcare. To our colleagues who  want to reduce those costs, we are ready to come and talk about how we  are going to reduce those costs.   I have talked about how I authored a community-based ``rebalancing''  program--the kind of rebalancing that helped our State save more than  $2 billion. If we did that in every State, we would be saving billions  of dollars, but the notion that we are going to proceed in the next 24  hours or so on a motion, after we have a CBO report that says this  would have a devastating impact on millions of people with Medicaid, is  not the right way to go.   Taking this out on the poor people of America who need Medicaid will  make it worse for us as well. It will raise our rates, return the costs  to where they were, and not help us solve this problem for the future.  I hope our colleagues will understand that so many people are raising  so many concerns about this. Yes, it is about economics, but there are  also personal stories of people, such as our colleague from Hawaii who  said: You never know. You never know when an individual situation is  going to affect you, and you want to make sure there is healthcare to  help you get through that crisis.   Thank you. I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.
