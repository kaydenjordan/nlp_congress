 Mr. Speaker, February is Career and Technical Education  Month, and I rise today to bring attention to the importance of  technical skills to our economy and our education system.   Teaching our students the skills they need to thrive in the modern  economy should be our top education priority. Our economy depends on a  workforce that is capable of doing jobs in the fields of welding,  automotive, and electrical work, among others.   While the current state of our economy is strong, we must strive to  remain competitive with the rest of the world. Developing a highly  skilled workforce is a key part of that effort and a top priority of  mine. That is why I was happy to see President Trump prioritize  technical education in his budget with a proposed $900 million  increased investment.   I am very proud of our high schools and technology centers in  Kentucky's First Congressional District that are working to equip our  students with crucial vocational skills. I am hopeful that Congress can  work to provide them with the support necessary to build on their  success in creating a 21st century workforce.                            ____________________
