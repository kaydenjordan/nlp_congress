 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania,  my good friend, for yielding me the customary 30 minutes, and I yield  myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I will just take a moment first to recognize the loss  of our dear colleague and historic trailblazer, Dianne Feinstein. The  longest serving woman in the United States Senate, Senator Feinstein  was a political giant.   She fought hard for her constituents in California, passionately  defended American civil liberties, and was a strong voice for national  security as chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee.   She broke more glass ceilings in her career than most thought was  possible, and she will be missed. She left behind an incredible legacy.  May she rest in peace.   Now, Madam Speaker, I have the unfortunate task of turning to the  business before us, a CR that the Republicans have brought forward.   Again, I mentioned legacy with regard to Senator Feinstein. I ask my  friends, is this their legacy? Is this what they want people to  remember their service by? This bill, that was just dropped on us a few  hours ago, really is a piece of garbage, and that is putting it nicely.   Madam Speaker, the clock is ticking; less than 40 hours from a total  MAGA Republican government shutdown. Less than 40 hours, and today we  are here to consider the Republicans' latest continuing resolution that  has absolutely no chance of becoming law. This version of the CR we are  considering won't pass the Senate. It just won't. We all know that.  Hell, I don't even think it is going to pass the House, it is so bad;  and it will not be signed into law by President Biden. We all know  that.   We got this text late last night, and thanks to the quick work of  Democratic Rules and Appropriations staff, we have some preliminary  analysis about what this CR means for the American people. Let me tell  you, the cuts in this bill are even worse than what was proposed  before. They are going in the wrong direction.   House Republicans' earliest CR slashed essential programs by 8  percent, an 8 percent across-the-board mindless cut. This new version  now has across-the-board cuts by 30 percent or more; by 30 percent or  more. It is effectively a partial shutdown bill.   They slash investments in cancer research. They eliminate public  education by cutting funding for Head Start. They fail to support  communities recovering from natural disasters. It cuts money for  wildfire suppression by 50 percent. Haven't they been paying attention?  The wildfires in Maui and in the western part of the Country. I mean,  communities are desperate for help, and my friends propose a bill that  would cut money for wildfire suppression by 57 percent. What planet are  my friends living on?                                time  1030    They cut loans and grants for farmers in rural communities. They  defund law enforcement. Republicans want to talk about fentanyl? They  cut money from the DEA.   What are they thinking? You can't make this stuff up, Madam Speaker.   We estimate that if Republicans get their way, if this thing were  ever to become law, up to 1 million seniors will be kicked off of Meals  on Wheels.   My friend from Pennsylvania talks about, oh, we are upholding our  obligation to protect our national security. I will remind the  gentleman and my friends on the other side of the aisle that national  security means more than the number of bombs we have in our arsenal. It  means the quality of life for our people. It means whether or not our  senior citizens have security in their retirement years. It means  whether they have access to food. It means whether or not people have  jobs and whether or not people can have a decent living in this  country. That has to be part of the discussion on national security,  and this bill just blows all that up.   We expect WIC to get at least a 30 percent cut. Women, infants, and  children will go hungry because of Republicans' misplaced priorities.  Talk about cruelty.   In the Rules Committee just not too long ago this morning, I asked my  friends, who claim that they were well-versed in all the details of  this bill, is the 30 percent cut in WIC accurate? Is that correct?  There was silence. How many women, infants, and children will be cut  off from the benefit if this were to pass? There was silence. No one  knows.   We do know, thanks to the work of the staff, that there is a 30  percent cut and a 74 percent cut in LIHEAP, a program that keeps  Americans warm during the winter. I come from the Commonwealth of  Massachusetts. We have cold winters. The gentleman comes from  Pennsylvania. It gets cold in Pennsylvania, too. Winter is coming.  Everybody represents constituencies that rely on this program to heat  their homes, and my friends cut it by 74 percent.   What are my friends thinking? Give me a goddamn break. This is wrong.   What are you doing? When it comes to keeping seniors warm or  providing pregnant mothers and their babies food, Republicans have a  problem, but the sky is the limit if it is a defense contract--cost  overruns be dammed. They have no problem with tax cuts for corporations  or for millionaires or billionaires, no problem with heaping more  subsidy giveaways to the fossil fuel industry.   Let me just say, we do not share the same values, and this is proof  of that, Madam Speaker. This is proof of that.   This majority is a failure. The day Speaker McCarthy handed his gavel  over to the MAGA/QAnon fringe, this was the inevitable outcome. The  government will shut down tomorrow. Let me repeat that: The government  will shut down tomorrow.   Let me say to my Republican friends: You own this. You did this, and  this is just plain stupid. Stop wasting time and work with us to get  this done in a bipartisan way.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to  join us in defeating this rule. I mean, we are wasting time today. This  is a total waste of time. Let's defeat this rule and force the Rules  Committee to go back up and come up with a rule that will allow a  bipartisan bill to come before the floor. Let's end this clown show  once and for all.  [[Page H4863]]    The American people are watching. They are frustrated by all of this,  and I hope that my friends on the other side of the aisle, my moderate  friends on the other side of the aisle, will join us in defeating this  rule. We appreciate the statements that have been made, calling out the  incompetence of the Republican leadership, but now I think it is time  to put your votes where your quotes are.   We have to stop this. Now is the time to send that message, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman's commentary  and his critique of Republican leadership, but what I didn't hear is  how he was going to vote on this rule or how he is going to vote on the  underlying bill.   The bottom line is, quotes are fine, but votes are better. Votes are  more important here.   By the way, this bill that we are talking about guts things like  LIHEAP, cuts it by 74 percent, which will impact people in New York,  which will impact people in Pennsylvania and all over this country.   The bottom line, Madam Speaker, is that if we want to get rid of the  nonsense and get to the business of funding government in a bipartisan  way, then we need to stop this now. We need to sit in a room in a  bipartisan way and figure this out.    That is what the United States Senate is doing. My Republican friends  have never once talked to the Democratic leadership here about trying  to come up with a compromise. Republicans never once talked to our  ranking members about how we come to a middle ground. It has always  been their way or the highway.   By the way, it is not just their way. It is their far-rightwing way,  going way, way in the wrong direction.   Madam Speaker, the CR we are considering in this rule is not just  shameful. It is a partisan measure. It is also, as I have said, a  complete waste of time, time we do not have.   Tomorrow, the government shuts down. This will not keep the  government open. It will not keep it functioning for the American  people. It does the opposite. It ensures a shutdown will occur, and if  anybody is opposed to a shutdown, then stand with  [[Page H4864]]  us right now and say no to this nonsense.   Madam Speaker, I am urging that we defeat the previous question, and  if we do, I will offer an amendment to the rule for swift consideration  of the Senate's bipartisan continuing resolution to fund the government  after they send it to the House.   Once we receive the Senate CR, the chair and/or ranking member of the  Appropriations Committee can call it up as a privileged question  without further action from the Rules Committee.   There will be 1 hour of debate, and the House will have an up or down  vote on keeping the government running while full-year funding is being  negotiated. We can send the bill straight to the President's desk.   During the 2013 shutdown, a Senate CR was privileged under the House  rules until the Republican majority turned that off.   We aren't even at the procedural stage yet because House Republicans  have failed to advance any real plan to fund the government.                                time  1045    They would rather fight with one another than negotiate with the  Senate.   Some have even openly called for a government shutdown, and we have  been through those quotes of Republican after Republican saying they  relish a government shutdown.   We can fix this right now. If anything deserves to be privileged for  consideration on this floor, it is a bill to keep the government open.  That is so vitally important, Madam Speaker.   Clearly, it is time for the adults in the room to step up to the  plate. We need to give Congress more time.   Again, I ask my moderate friends on the other side of the aisle not  to follow the fringe of their party down this path. It is my hope that  some reasonable Republicans who are interested in governing will join  with us in this effort.   So reject this insanity of cheering on a government shutdown and  abandon the sinking ship that is MAGA extremism. Moderates have a  chance to say enough is enough. A bipartisan CR would be temporary, but  it is better than nothing. We need the time to work all this stuff out.   Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment into the Record along with any extraneous materials  immediately prior to the vote on the previous question.    Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Colorado (Mr. Neguse), to discuss our proposal.    Madam Speaker, I wonder whether the DCCC writes the  gentleman's speeches because what the gentleman from Colorado quoted  was his words in a speech. Talk is cheap around here. Votes are the  currency of the realm in this place.   The choice is clear, and the gentleman has made clear where he  stands.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania  (Ms. Scanlon), a distinguished member of the Rules Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from Pennsylvania.    Madam Speaker, I would just say to the gentlewoman, we  are not here to support Republicans. We are here to support our  constituents.   Madam Speaker, if the President were presented with H.R. 5525, he  would veto it, so this is a complete waste of time.   Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to include in a Record a  Statement of Administration Policy on this underlying bill.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman  from New Mexico (Ms. Leger Fernandez).    Madam Speaker, I remind the gentleman from Michigan  that if the Republicans' shutdown moves forward, he has 5,607 people in  his district who are Federal employees who will lose their paycheck.   In the Rules Committee today, Madam Speaker, Democrats offered an  amendment saying, yeah, we are happy to talk about how to keep Social  Security and Medicare solvent, but we want to guarantee that we are not  going to cut people's benefits, and the Republicans rejected that.   We know what this is about. This is about going after Social Security  and trying to make it solvent by cutting people's benefits, and  Democrats are against that unequivocally.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas  (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I will point out to the gentleman who just  spoke that the Senate can't even take up the Homeland Security  appropriations bill because the way the Republicans wrote the rule was  that they are not going to send it over until the Senate passes H.R. 2  without changing a comma and the President signs it into law.   Lots of luck with that.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Colorado (Mr. Neguse), a distinguished member of the Rules  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to the time remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, it is an absolute joke that we are here today dealing  with this, as I said at the beginning of my remarks, piece of garbage.  That is what it is. This is not a serious attempt at legislating. This  is a MAGA Republican press release at best, and it is a lousy press  release.   All the priorities that are in this bill represent deep cuts to  things that matter to Democrats. When we talk about national security,  we don't only talk about the size of our military and the number of  bombs we have. We talk about whether or not people in this country have  access to jobs, whether they have food, whether or not we have good  schools, whether or not people have access to healthcare and retirement  security. We talk about things like the purity of our environment.   My Republican friends talk about bombs and about tax cuts for the  rich and for big corporations. They don't care about the people who are  at the heart and soul of our concerns on the Democratic side. If they  did, they wouldn't cut and slash programs like WIC, the women, infants,  and children program, providing basic nutrition for low-income,  pregnant moms and newborn babies. They wouldn't cut LIHEAP, a program  that provides vulnerable people with help to be able to heat their  homes in winter. They wouldn't cut it by 74 percent.   Who does that? Who thinks like that? Who would come to the floor and  defend that kind of garbage?   The bottom line is, we don't share the same values. It is that  simple.   I want to tell you, we are going to fight as hard as we can against  all the things that you claim you value in this book because this is  not what America is about. Basically, this is about turning our back on  people. This is essentially a government shutdown in and of itself.   Let me just close with a couple of comments to our moderate friends  who go on MSNBC and give all these quotes about how they want a balance  and how they want this. They criticize their leadership, and then they  come to the floor and vote with the majority. Enough of that. It is  votes, not quotes, that matter. It is votes, not quotes.   If you really want to avoid a government shutdown, to the so-called  moderates on the other side of the aisle, vote with us. Vote ``no'' on  the previous question so we can guarantee that the Senate-passed bill  will have a vote here in the House. Vote ``no'' on the rule so we don't  have to waste all this time today arguing over this nonsense, this  hardline, rightwing garbage that guts the heart and soul of our social  safety net. We can do so much better.   At the end of the day, we have to come together, Democrats and  Republicans, and come up with a bill. My friends keep on going in the  wrong direction. They keep on going further and further to the right.  That is a road to nowhere.   The Senate, to their credit, Democrats and Republicans, are talking.  You guys can't even talk with yourselves. You are fighting amongst  yourselves.   This is a radical idea: Maybe sit down and try to negotiate a  bipartisan solution here because you control one-half of one branch of  government--and barely. You would never know it when you see this kind  of stuff come to the floor.  [[Page H4868]]    Enough of the nonsense. People send us here, at a minimum, to keep  the lights on. You have to do that. Work with us. Stop this nonsense.   Again, vote ``no'' on the previous question, vote ``no'' on this  garbage.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
