 Mr. President, I rise today to discuss and express my  support for the Columbia River Federal Power System. The federal dams  on the Columbia River System are a boon to the Pacific Northwest and  stands as an example to other hydropower projects across the country  and the world. Its capacity to generate always-on, baseload carbon-free  power is vital not just to the Northwest, but relied upon by our  friends in surrounding regions as well. The dams also bring substantial  benefits for flood control, local recreation, irrigation, navigation,  wildlife conservation, and industry. Even Idaho, my landlocked home  State, is able to have a working seaport because of the navigation  benefits provided by these dams, sending Idaho's products all around  the world in an efficient, cost-effective, and low-carbon manner. As  additional challenges have risen, scientists and managers at the U.S.  Army Corps of Engineers have adapted to ensure the dams are still  beneficial to humans and our natural environment.   In the Water Resources Development Act before the Senate today, there  is a seemingly innocuous but rather consequential and far-reaching  study directed at aquatic habitat restoration in the Columbia River  Basin. Other studies in this section are small enough to be measured in  acres or at largest, a portion of a state. The Columbia River Basin  spans nearly 260,000 square miles and reaches into seven States. This  is not a small, localized review but instead an authorization for a  comprehensive study on anything relating to aquatic restoration in one  of the largest basins in the country.   This may sound benign to my colleagues who are not from the  Northwest, but this issue is not a new or small one. I have been  discussing the Columbia River System and salmon recovery since my early  days in the Idaho Legislature. Improving salmon and steelhead  populations in the Northwest is an important goal and one I have long  supported. What I cannot, however, support are the constant efforts to  remove the benefits provided by our hydropower system under the guise  of salmon recovery. The fact of the matter is we have studied this  river and these dams ad nauseam. Most recently, we completed the  Columbia River System Operations review, which specifically considered  whether dam breaching was necessary for fish recovery and determined  the opposite. It is pointless and irresponsible to spend further  taxpayer dollars considering dam breaching.   This brings me back to the study in title II. I appreciate very much  the chairman and ranking member working with me to place appropriate  [[Page S3154]]  sideboards to ensure this study will not consider any recommendations  that would result in the removal or reduction of the federally  authorized purposes of the system or any measures that would result in  a reduction in services provided by those purposes. While I still  believe that this study is far too large and untargeted to result in  timely recommendations for anadromous fish recovery--and as such,  wastes funding better used in the region than on yet another river  study--with this important limitation, I am pleased to be able to  support the overall WRDA bill and the many important priorities it  encompasses for our water infrastructure. Should this study be signed  into law, I expect and will pay careful mind that it meets the specific  congressional intent of preserving our hydropower system and the many  benefits it provides. I look forward to continue working with my  colleagues to identify solutions to salmon recovery that do not inhibit  the clean energy, flood control, navigation, agricultural, and  recreation benefits of our Federal power system.                            ____________________
