 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bipartisan  legislation introduced by my colleague, Representative Dunn, and  myself, which would ensure that lifesaving research and clinical trials  are made available to reduce the rate of prostate cancer for our  Nation's veterans.   Prostate cancer is the number one cancer diagnosed in the Veterans  Health Administration, and numerous reports have established a link  between cancer and military service, including exposure to certain  herbicides like Agent Orange.   Early detection of this disease is critical, and veterans deserve a  health system that provides both early detection and successful  treatment. This bill will do just that.   It is our job to ensure that, when our brave men and women return  home from their service, the VA is there to rehabilitate them and  reintegrate them back into civilian life. They deserve our  unconditional support, which is why I urge my colleagues to join me in  honoring our obligation to our veterans and vote in support of this  bipartisan legislation.
