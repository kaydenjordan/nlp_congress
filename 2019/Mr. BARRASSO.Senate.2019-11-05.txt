 Madam President, I come to the floor today to discuss  the global fight to end poverty and specifically the problem of energy  poverty.   The numbers paint a very grim picture. Worldwide, 840 million people  are living without electricity. They can't cook or heat their homes  safely or reliably. In fact, nearly 3 billion people--3 billion people  worldwide--still rely on wood and waste for household energy.   What should the United States do to help? First and foremost, I  believe we should push multilateral development banks, like the World  Bank, to invest in affordable energy projects, which will help these  people. The World Bank's mission is to lift people out of poverty--to  help lift people out of poverty. That is their mission. Specifically,  it seeks to end extreme poverty while promoting shared prosperity.   For 75 years, the United States has been working with the World Bank  to help developing countries grow. The United States remains the World  Bank's largest contributor. Every U.S. dollar at the World Bank should  make a difference for people in the developing world.   The World Bank's new policies, however, lead me to call for a review  by the United States of how U.S. dollars are being used. Several years  ago, the World Bank decided to stop financing certain projects-- specifically, oil, gas, and coal projects. I am concerned the World  Bank is now blocking affordable energy development--energy that is  needed to make a positive difference for so many people in the  developing world. Traditional fuels are a vital tool for escaping  energy poverty. Yet, with the policy change in the World Bank, only  renewable energy projects qualify for funding. It seems that the World  Bank is putting its liberal political agenda ahead of our anti-poverty  mission.   The question is, Does the World Bank still want to help the people  living in poor nations today? That is the question. If so, they should  be helping with the use of abundant and affordable energy resources. If  not, then I think the United States must reevaluate our support for the  World Bank.   Here is a case in point: The Bank restricts the financing of high- efficiency power stations fueled by coal. Last fall, for example, the  World Bank failed to honor its commitment to the country of Kosovo. The  Bank pulled its funding from Kosovo's state-of-the-art, coal-fired  powerplant--state of the art--needed in Kosovo. Kosovo faces an energy  security barrier to grow. They don't have enough energy to grow the way  they are prepared to. Kosovo has the fifth largest coal reserves in the  world. Kosovo desperately needs to retire its older facility.   I saw this firsthand last month when I was visiting members of the  Wyoming National Guard stationed in northern Kosovo. This decision by  the World Bank is simply unacceptable.   What are other countries doing? China and Russia, meanwhile, are  dramatically increasing their global investment in identical carbon- based energy projects. The World Bank is saying: Go ask China. Go ask  Russia. South Africa, for example, is now working with China's  development bank on its coal-fired powerplant. There are serious  concerns when our allies work with China and Russia. These include  lower standards, dependence on these countries, and undue political  influence.   A number of Members in the Senate share my concern. On Thursday, I  led a group of a dozen Senators in urging the World Bank to immediately  lift these harmful restrictions. My letter to the President of the  World Bank, President David Malpass, was cosigned by Senators Boozman,  Capito, Cotton, Cramer, Cruz, Enzi, Hoeven, Johnson, Kennedy,  Murkowski, and Thune. Together, we are pressing the World Bank to  recommit to an ``all of the above'' energy strategy. Developing  countries desperately need affordable, reliable energy.   We say in our letter:         People living in poor and developing nations want and need       a stable energy supply. They are looking for power generation       that provides energy security, helps create jobs, and       improves their lives.    People back home in Wyoming know firsthand the benefits of developing  abundant energy resources. The United States is a top global energy  producer. Wyoming has played a key role in this success. We have  produced our way to a booming U.S. economy, and we have created  millions of new jobs along the way. People who are struggling worldwide  to survive and thrive in developing countries deserve that same  opportunity. As an energy powerhouse, America can help empower our  allies and our energy exports.   Global philanthropist Bill Gates said: ``Increasing access to  electricity is critical to lifting the world's poor out of poverty. Let  me repeat. ``Increasing access to electricity is critical to lifting  the world's poor out of poverty.''   Ultimately, the solution to energy poverty doesn't lie in limiting  options but in using all available options. In pursuit of its mission,  the World Bank must embrace, not exclude, abundant, affordable energy  resources.   Let's work together to end energy poverty now for the 840 million  people on the planet living without electricity.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
