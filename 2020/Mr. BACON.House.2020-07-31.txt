 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor two dedicated residents  from our district of Omaha who stepped up to the challenge COVID-19 has  placed on our communities.   Holly Barstow and Patricia Longacre started a mask-making movement  that accomplished an incredible feat. Since March, they and over 2,400  volunteers stayed busy as they worked to make over 140,000 masks.   Holly and Patricia's efforts started as a project to make 10,000  masks for local hospital personnel and first responders but quickly  grew. In addition to the 140,000 masks, they also produced over 36,000  surgical caps, 200 surgical gowns, 500 face shields, and thousands of  ear savers.   They are now retiring, as commercial masks are readily available.   I admire and thank Holly and Patricia for serving others. They have  inspired many to be servant leaders. They have also demonstrated the  innovative and can-do spirit that makes America great. We admire them.                            ____________________
