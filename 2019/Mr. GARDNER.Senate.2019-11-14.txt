 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, this week across this country, we  celebrated Veterans Day. Veterans Day in  [[Page S6592]]  Colorado and across the country means a lot of different things to so  many people across our Nation, but one thing it has always stood for is  a day of thanks to share and celebrate the men and women in our  families and our communities who have done so much for our country so  that it continues to be the greatest Nation on the face of this Earth.   In Colorado, we celebrated with parades, parties, charity  fundraisers, races and marathons, and events all over the Centennial  State to recognize the work of our veterans and the sacrifice of our  veterans and their families. Admission to all of our State parks was  free so veterans and their families could enjoy the land they have  defended.   In Colorado Springs, where we have a number of veterans and Active- Duty military members, three of the largest school districts didn't  take the day off for Veterans Day but, instead, they held veteran  appreciation events, breakfasts and lunches with local veterans,  invited special speakers, wrote letters to men and women who have  served, and had other opportunities for students to learn about the  sacrifices our veterans have made for our country.   We in Colorado--we in this country take great pride in our veterans  and our veteran community. In Colorado, our six military bases,  including the U.S. Air Force Academy, all play a critical role in  defending our Nation and keeping the world a safer place. Colorado is  home to more than 400,000 veterans who have bravely served our country.   Earlier this year, I was fortunate enough to meet more than 100  Colorado heroes as part of the High Plains Honor Flight, a tradition  that has been carried on for a number of years. It is an incredible  tradition every year--bringing Colorado veterans to our Nation's  Capital, touring the war memorials, and taking the opportunity to meet  these veterans, look them in the eye, shake their hands, and say thank  you.   I could spend all week talking on the floor about Colorado's veterans  and their incredible acts of service, but if you get the chance, I hope  you will visit Pueblo, CO. The Home of Heroes Medal of Honor Memorial  is in Pueblo, CO. The memorial pays tribute to more than 3,400 people  who have received our country's highest award for military valor.   Outside the memorial, there are four statues, one for each of  Pueblo's Medal of Honor recipients.   One of these men, Lt. Raymond G. Murphy, was a U.S. marine who was  serving in Korea in 1953. After a failed raid with heavy casualties,  Lieutenant Murphy organized and led his platoon in a heroic rescue  effort to save his fellow marines. Providing cover and driving back the  enemy, he rescued his fellow men who were under intense enemy fire. He  sustained numerous wounds but refused treatment until everyone else had  been treated. Lieutenant Murphy stayed on the battlefield until every  marine was accounted for.   When President Eisenhower presented Murphy with the Medal of Honor,  he was quoted as saying:         ``What is it about the water out there in Pueblo? All you       guys turn out to be heroes!''    That is our Pueblo, CO. Whatever it is, there must be a lot of it in  Colorado's water.   U.S. Army CPT Florent Groberg--another Coloradan--was based out of  Fort Carson. He received the Medal of Honor for his heroic actions in  Afghanistan. In 2012, his patrol was ambushed by an individual wearing  a suicide vest. Captain Groberg rushed to the individual and grabbed  him, driving him away from his fellow troops and down to the ground.  The bomber's vest exploded, severely wounding Captain Groberg. He  miraculously survived the blast, and his heroic actions and  selflessness saved many of his patrol members' lives. His actions were  certainly extraordinary, and they showed the character of the men and  women who serve. They would do anything to protect those they love.    I am also reminded of a Coloradan I have had the honor of working  with and meeting over the last several years. Two years ago, in fact, I  had a Veterans Day experience I will never forget with another veteran  who refused to give up on his fellow brothers and sisters in arms. I  was visiting Donald Stratton, who was a seaman 1st class on the USS  Arizona when the Japanese launched a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor on  December 7, 1941.   Mr. Stratton was one of the last five remaining survivors stationed  on the USS Arizona. Since that time 2 years ago, we have lost Lauren  Bruner. There are even fewer today than there were.   He told me how a young sailor named Joseph George disregarded the  orders to abandon ship in order to save his life and the other sailors.  Joseph George never received a medal for his actions, and Donald  Stratton didn't think that was fair. It didn't sit well. Mr. Stratton  and I and his family worked together to finally convince the Navy to  honor Joe George, to give this hero the recognition he deserves.   Donald Stratton's story sticks with me because he had already fought  one war for his country, and then he had to spend another 16 years  fighting government bureaucracy in order to honor the man who saved his  life and the lives of others. It is a reminder that our veterans need  our help and our support to receive the recognition and the care they  continue to deserve.   All of the stories I have shared and the individuals I have talked  about are extraordinary, but there are so many other--countless acts of  heroism. Every single person in our armed services today is  extraordinary. Every day, they perform heroic acts of service and make  sacrifices that may not make the national news or the front page of  newspapers, but we shouldn't lose sight of the fact that they sacrifice  for our country every day. They have put their bodies and their minds  through vigorous training, boot camps, and deployments. They have given  up valuable time with their loved ones. They are away from home for  months at a time, if not longer. There are the holidays they will never  get back and the important milestones they have missed with their  families as they placed their civilian lives on hold to serve our  country. And too many people return with wounds of war, both physical  and mental. All of these sacrifices and their willingness to place  their lives on the line for the country they love add up to a debt we  can never repay--never pay back.   I hope that the Veterans Day celebration this week serves as a  reminder that it is our responsibility to take care of those who have  taken care of us. We owe it to our Nation's veterans to ensure that  they can receive the best possible care and that they have the tools  and support necessary to navigate civilian life.   The Senate and the House have taken great steps to improve the lives  of veterans and the care they receive, but we can always do more, and  we must do more. We must do more and never give up. We can do better  than the status quo.   For veterans living in rural areas like the Western Slope or Eastern  Plains of Colorado, long drive times and a shortage of doctors and  nurses at the VA facilities make it difficult to receive the care we  promised. There has never been a fight too dangerous or a task too  difficult for these men and women who have served our country, and that  is the approach we need to take. We have to be in this fight to make  sure we approach veterans' care with the same commitment and find  creative solutions to ease the transition to civilian life, to make  sure they have the care they need, and to make sure we have enough  physicians and nurses and doctors in these places to provide the best  possible care.   Earlier this year, I introduced my VA Readiness Initiative, which is  a comprehensive package of improvements and reforms to ensure we are  following through on every one of these promises to veterans. The VA  Readiness Initiative focuses on four pillars to support veterans:  expanding access to services, encouraging innovation, VA  accountability, and empowering transitioning servicemembers.   It introduces more oversight and more transparency and accountability  at VA facilities to eliminate fraud and increase the quality of care.   In order to ease the transition to civilian life, it enhances  programs that help veterans start small businesses and train for future  careers in the science, technology, engineering, and math fields.   It promotes innovative approaches to suicide prevention, which is a  heartbreaking problem in the veteran community.  [[Page S6593]]    In Colorado, we are losing one of our own nearly every 7 hours to  suicide. In recent years, we have lost more veterans to suicide than we  lost in combat. Think about that. We have lost more veterans to suicide  than we have lost in combat. In Colorado, we lose roughly 200 veterans  a year to suicide.   I am working with my colleague Senator Tammy Baldwin from Wisconsin  to designate 9-8-8 as a national suicide hotline that veterans and  anyone else in crisis can call when they need help. Veterans answered  our call when we needed them; we need to answer their call when they  need us.   When somebody is suffering from a heart attack or a medical  emergency, a crisis, we all know to call 9-1-1, but how many people  know a number to call if they find themselves in a time of mental  health crisis? Is there a 10-digit hotline? Yes, there is. How many  people can know that and know that now off the top of their heads? How  many people can tell a friend in need what that hotline number is?  Let's simplify it. Let's make it a three-digit number like 9-1-1 for  health crisis emergencies. Let's make sure we have 9-8-8 for mental  health needs.   The current suicide hotline number is 10 digits long. This is an  easy-to-remember hotline--9-8-8--to connect people in crisis with  professional help. When a veteran is in need, a phone call is made, and  they will receive specialized care for veterans. Press 1 to be directed  to the veterans support line, where they can receive mental health  support specific to the unique needs of our veterans.   I also hope every veteran in Colorado will look to our offices--my  office in Colorado and my colleagues' offices--Senator Bennet and  others--if there is anything we can do to help. Oftentimes, too many  people don't know about the services that can help them.   Thanks to the outpouring of veterans who contact my office each and  every year, we were able to help open the VA Medical Center in Aurora,  CO, last year. It was long overdue but essential to their care and to  making sure we have the finest medical care for Coloradans.   Senator Johnny Isakson from Georgia, chairman of the Veterans'  Affairs Committee--somebody who is stepping down from this Chamber at  the end of the year, and we will miss him greatly--was instrumental in  making this happen and will be greatly missed when he leaves. Johnny is  a true statesman and a champion for our veterans. We in Colorado are  grateful for his work to make sure that the VA hospital in Aurora is  the crown jewel of our support system in our State for veterans.   November is also Military Family Appreciation Month. I certainly want  to express my gratitude to the military families who share the burden  of service. This is not just an individual effort; it is indeed a  family effort. When one member of the family serves, the entire family  serves.   We all know this can be a difficult time of the year. The holidays  are coming up for troops and their families. As all of us celebrate  Thanksgiving, Christmas, Hanukkah, and other traditions in our  families, I hope each one of our prayers will go to a military family  in need, heroes who are placing their dreams on hold to protect the  American dream.   To everyone who has served this country, thank you for the sacrifice  you have all made, and know that our Nation is grateful. It is because  of the commitment you bring that we can continue to live in a nation  with unlimited opportunities, a nation founded in liberty and rooted in  the principles that inspire hope and optimism around the world.   To every veteran, thank you from the bottom of my heart for  everything you have done in service to our beloved country. May God  bless you, and may God bless this great United States of America as you  continue to serve and as we continue to serve you.   I yield the floor.
