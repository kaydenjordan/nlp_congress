 Madam Speaker, I appreciate the time very much.   This legislation builds upon the IPAWS Modernization Act, which I  authored and which became law in 2016.   Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California (Mr. McNerney),  the chairman of the committee, and the ranking member. It has been a  great pleasure to serve with all of them on this committee, and I want  to continue to serve on this committee. It is the best committee in  Congress, as far as I am concerned, the original committee.   That bill enhanced the Nation's emergency alert texting system and  implemented training programs for States. I am talking about the IPAWS  Modernization Act, Madam Speaker.   The READI Act builds upon our prior efforts and will ensure more  people receive critical emergency alerts on their mobile phones,  televisions, and radios.   It really works well, Madam Speaker. I am from the great State of  Florida, and we had hurricane warnings for the last couple of weeks for  Eta. I was on the other coast, the east coast, even though I represent  the west coast, visiting friends on the east coast, and I got the alert  on the east coast even though the threat was on the west coast. So, you  know, you have to have planning. And it really works very well. It  saves so many lives.   It also paves the way for examining the feasibility of issuing alerts  through online streaming services, an ever-popular platform, I  understand.   Even more importantly, this bill will help States improve emergency  alert plans and establish reporting systems for false alerts.   I am pleased that this potentially lifesaving legislation has come to  a floor vote. The effectiveness and accuracy of information during an  emergency should always be a top priority, and it is.
