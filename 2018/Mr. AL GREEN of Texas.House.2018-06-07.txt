 Mr. Speaker, once again, I am proud to rise  and stand in the well of the House of Representatives.   Mr. Speaker, I salute the flag, I sing the national anthem, and I  believe in what the flag stands for: liberty and justice for all. But,  Mr. Speaker, I find now that the flag is being used as a tool to  suppress what it stands for: liberty and justice for all.   Mr. Speaker, peaceful protest is how I arrived in the Congress of the  United States of America. If not but for peaceful protest, I probably,  most likely, and believe in the sincerest corners of my heart that I  would not be in the Congress of the United States of America.   Peaceful protest has brought about positive change in this country,  but peaceful protest is now under assault from the highest office in  the land: the Office of the President.   Peaceful protest is under attack, and I rise today, Mr. Speaker, to  defend peaceful protest. I rise especially to defend it as it relates  to the flag because the flag stands for liberty and justice for all.  Peaceful protest is about liberty and justice for all.   So, Mr. Speaker, I would like to share a very shocking piece of  information, perhaps not shocking to some, but it should shock our  consciences. This piece of information was compiled by The Guardian and  reported by Vox.   The information is as follows: racial minorities make up 37.4 percent  of the general population--some things bear repeating: 34.7 percent of  the general population--and 62.7 percent of the unarmed people killed  by police; 37.4 percent of the population, 62.7 percent of the people  who are unarmed and killed by the police.   Why wouldn't we protest this? Why wouldn't somebody decide that this  is unacceptable and I will peacefully protest it? Why wouldn't someone  take a knee at a football game to protest this?   Why would the President of the United States find reason to link that  peaceful protest to disrespect for the flag when the flag stands for  liberty and justice for all? That has to include these people who have  been killed by the police.   By the way, it doesn't matter how great the economy is; their lives  will not be brought back. It doesn't matter how many jobs people have;  those lives will never return. So being comfortable and being able to  say ``I have a great job'' won't bring back people who have lost their  lives.   Mr. Speaker, this is a sad commentary when the President of the  United States brings peaceful protest into dispute as it relates to the  flag.   I believe that we have a duty and an obligation to protest wrong when  we see it. It is as old as the Pilgrims landing at Plymouth Rock, it is  as old as the Boston Tea Party, and it is as old as the farmers coming  to Washington, D.C., in their tractors to protest.   Peaceful protest is at the foundation of this Nation. And for us to  allow the President to assault and attack peaceful protest by and  through the flag, which stands for liberty and justice for all, is an  insult to the country.   So here is what I propose to do by way of standing against what the  President seems to stand for. He has brought Mr. Kaepernick into  disrepute; that is what the President would do. I plan to salute him. I  will have a flag flown over the Capitol of the United States of America  to salute him for his courage, for his willingness to suffer the slings  and arrows that have been thrown at him by the highest office in the  land to protect liberty and justice for all, which is what the flag  stands for.                            ____________________
