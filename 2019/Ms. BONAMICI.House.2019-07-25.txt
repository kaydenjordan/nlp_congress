 Mr. Speaker, my home State of Oregon, like much of the  country, is facing a housing affordability crisis that is hurting  families and the economy.   I recently held six listening sessions in the district I represent.  In every community--urban, suburban, and rural--I heard from  individuals, employers, local officials, and nonprofits that told me  the lack of affordable housing is having serious consequences around  northwest Oregon.   Over the last several years, housing costs have gone up  significantly, but wages have not. Available housing stock has not kept  up with demand, driving prices higher and higher. Much of the new  housing that is being built is unaffordable for middle- and low-income  households.   To afford a modest one-bedroom unit at fair market rent, someone  earning minimum wage in Yamhill County, Oregon, for example, would need  to work 65 hours a week. In Multnomah County, someone would need to  work 81 hours a week to pay for a modest one-bedroom apartment--81  hours a week.   Housing is foundational. It forms the bedrock of a family's stability  and security, and it is vital to each person's full participation in  society.   The toll of this crisis on families and communities is devastating,  and it is also hampering economic growth. I heard time and again from  employers who are struggling to attract workers in areas where housing  was unaffordable or unavailable, employees commuting long hours because  they cannot afford to live closer to their jobs.   In Columbia County, for example, I heard how the lack of affordable  housing for just one individual negatively affected the whole  community. The county government recruited a highly qualified new  finance director from another State, only to have that person struggle  to find a permanent place to live. After staying in an RV for 4 months,  she finally had to quit in the middle of budget season because she  could not find a place to live.   Federal policies and resources are a vital part of addressing this  true national crisis. Unfortunately, Federal support for cost-burdened  individuals and families is severely insufficient and declining.   According to the Oregon Center for Public Policy, more than one-third  of Oregon households are cost-burdened. That is 530,000 households  spending more than 30 percent of their income on shelter, with some  spending more than half of their income for a place to live.   Despite that tremendous need, only one out of every five eligible  families receives any Federal housing assistance. Wait lists at public  housing authorities often stretch into years.   At the Federal level, we have many tools to help address these  problems: tax incentives, voucher programs, public housing, and grants  that empower nonprofits and communities that implement local  strategies. But the resources Congress provides are woefully  insufficient.   We need to do much more if we honestly want to make sure that every  person in our communities has the dignity and stability of a roof over  their head.   Mr. Speaker, this crisis is why I support transformative legislation  like the American Housing and Economic Mobility Act. It would invest  $445 billion to create 3 million deeply affordable homes and cut rental  costs by 10 percent.   I also strongly support the Ending Homelessness Act to  comprehensively address chronic homelessness by providing a surge of  resources that will drastically expand access to housing and case  management that integrates healthcare and other supportive services.  Our communities are better and families will thrive when everyone has a  home.   Ultimately, any solution will require a determined and coordinated  effort by all stakeholders, including community activists, developers,  lenders, nonprofit leaders, and elected officials at every level of  government.   Congress must step up and be part of the solution. I ask my  colleagues to join me today in committing to bold action to address the  housing affordability crisis in Oregon and across the country.                            ____________________
