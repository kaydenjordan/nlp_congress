 Madam Speaker, and still I rise. I rise as a  proud descendant of the enslaved people, who constructed the foundation  upon which the greatness of America resides. They are the foundational  mothers and fathers of this country.   Today, I rise, Madam Speaker, because I was accorded the preeminent  privilege of speaking at the Georgetown University Law Center and I was  accorded this opportunity to talk about the conscious agenda.   In so doing, we, my staff and I, did some research on Georgetown  University and we discovered some things that I will share with you  today.   First, I do want to thank the persons who made it possible for me to  have this opportunity to speak today at Georgetown. I would like to  thank Juan Thomas, the chair of the ABA Section of the Civil Rights and  Social Justice Entity. This is an entity that is associated with the  American Bar Association, and they were hosting this event today.    I would like to thank Dean Treanor. He is the executive vice  president of Georgetown University Law Center.   I would like to thank Professor of Law Edelman. He is a person who  has, quite frankly, helped to set a course of conduct that has made a  difference in the lives of many people at the institution.   Today, Madam Speaker, I, having had this opportunity to visit  Georgetown, would like to commend the university for what it has done  and I would like to do so for things that persons ordinarily might not  assume one would stand before the Congress, the country, if you will,  and give such a commendation.   I am honored to do this because I think Georgetown University is the  supreme, superb example of what an institution should do that has had  some association with the institution of slavery.   I think that Georgetown University is a university that has set an  example for the country, indeed for the United States of America  itself, in terms of how we should respond to questions related to our  association with the institution of slavery.   Today, I want to honor Georgetown University, founded in 1789 by John  Carroll, who was later appointed Archbishop of Baltimore in 1808. I  honor this institution today because it took affirmative action to  correct its association with the institution of slavery.   In 1838, 272 enslaved persons worth about $3.3 million in today's  dollars were sold in part to help pay off the school's debt. Obviously,  this was not something that I would in any way celebrate. It is  something that I find horrific.   The question then becomes: How has Georgetown University responded  since this occurrence? Well, in September 2015, Georgetown University  formed a working group on slavery, memory, and reconciliation to  explore this history that it has associated with slavery.   In 2016, Georgetown created a department of African-American studies  and set plans to establish an institute for the study of racial  justice.                                time  1245    These two things alone are significant. The notion that a working  group would be established for reconciliation, to explore it, to  explore the memory, and to understand what slavery was all about as it  relates to this institution, this working group has done an outstanding  job.   I also have to acknowledge the fact that the African-American studies  program was something that would give young people the opportunity to  better understand more than what happened at Georgetown. It gives them  an opportunity to understand what happened to Africans in the Americas.   Too often, this type of history is overlooked, and today, there are  many who would erase this history. Significant work at the Georgetown  Slavery Archive has been done.   In 2017, Georgetown offered an apology. It was not an apology without  something more, not just a: ``We are sorry it happened, and please have  a nice day.'' It was an apology, and they held a liturgy of  remembrance, contrition, and hope. It was a sincere apology.   It was an apology that would lead to other things. The apology wasn't  the end. It was the genesis of more things that would be done.   In 2017, Georgetown dedicated two campus buildings to members of the  descendant community--the ``descendant community'' would be descendants  of slavery--dedicated two campus buildings to members of the descendant  community.   It didn't stop there. Georgetown went on, in 2018, at the request of  descendant leaders, Georgetown, the Jesuits, and descendants began  truth and reconciliation work with the Kellogg Foundation.   This is the kind of work that has to be done so that we can get to  the truth about what happened, so that we can have the transparency  necessary to understand the history associated with slavery.   It is not pleasant, but it has to be done. It has to be done because  if we don't do it, we allow ourselves to be vulnerable to these things  being repeated.   Let's study this history. In 2019, Georgetown established a  reconciliation fund that awards $400,000 annually for community-based  projects within descendant communities--$400,000 annually.   Georgetown did not simply give an apology with nothing more than ``we  are sorry.'' Georgetown has taken upon itself to atone for what  occurred and has done so by having a truth and reconciliation  committee, worked with the Kellogg Foundation, and went on to establish  a reconciliation fund that awards $400,000 annually for community-based  projects within descendant communities.   I think that Georgetown merits a special thank-you, and I, as a  Member of Congress, intend to have a flag flown over the Capitol of the  United States of America to be presented to Georgetown University for  the way they have demonstrated that we can deal with the issue of  slavery--demonstrated how to do this.   They have been an exemplar of how to do it and how to do it with a  degree of credibility such that someone would come to the Congress of  the United States of America, stand here, and pay tribute to what they  have done to commemorate the lives of those who helped create the great  America that we live in today.   They were the foundational mothers and fathers of this country. They  were the persons who labored. They planted the grains, harvested the  crops. They constructed roads and bridges.   The Capitol itself has benefited from their labor. This very facility  that we are in has benefited from their labor. The Washington Monument  benefited from their labor. The White House benefited from their labor.  Their labor has made a difference.   I would have the country, the United States itself, follow the  example of Georgetown University--follow the example. Let's have the  truth and justice commission. We need it. The truth has to be told.   Let's have the study for reparations. There ought to be some  compensation for centuries of unpaid labor, labor without recompense,  labor without compensation. There ought to be some atonement by the  Government of the United States of America.   Georgetown University is the exemplar. We should follow this example,  and we should move expeditiously to correct, to the extent that it can  be corrected, the injustice that was imposed upon human beings of  African ancestry.   I believe that we who have the opportunity to stand in the well of  the House of Representatives, who can vote on questions of war and  peace, who can vote to fund various projects around this country, ought  to establish a department of reconciliation. We ought  [[Page H1686]]  to establish a department of reconciliation such that we will have a  systemic and systematic methodology by which this problem, this  egregious concern, can be addressed.   It cannot be addressed in the term of any one President. It will take  years, perhaps decades, to address the invidious discrimination that we  have suffered in this country, but it can be done. We but have to have  the will to do it.   A department of reconciliation with a secretary of reconciliation, a  department of reconciliation with a secretary and under secretaries and  a budget that is indexed to the Department of Defense, such that it  will always be funded because we will always fund the Department of  Defense.   If we do this, we can give this country and the world a sense of our  wanting to atone for this 240 years of slavery that this country  suffered, that people suffered, that people suffered and, in so doing,  laid the foundation for America's greatness. They are the foundational  mothers and fathers of this country.   To Georgetown University, I thank you for what you have done, and I  pray that this country will follow your example--follow the example.  Let's have the necessary commissions so that we can get to the truth.   Let's study the issue so that we can understand what recompense  should consist of, and then let's make sure that this is all done by  and through a department of reconciliation.   I will close with this. Reconciliation cannot be limited to African  Americans. Some things bear repeating: Reconciliation cannot be limited  to African Americans. There are others who have suffered invidious  discrimination, and they, too, have to have reasonable redress for the  suffering.   We have to address the Trail of Tears, how people were uprooted from  their homes, forced to migrate across the country. Many died along the  way. There has to be some recompense for the Trail of Tears.   We have to consider what happened to others who were a part of this  country when the persons from Europe arrived, how they were treated.   All of this can be dealt with through a department of reconciliation.   The persons who came here and constructed the railroads, the persons  who were placed in these camps so as to, in theory, protect the country  from persons during a time of war. These camps should never have been  imposed upon people.   We have to, at some point, give redress. This is what a department of  reconciliation can do.   This is a great country, but the greatness of America has not been  achieved until America provides a means for us to have reasonable  redress for the invidious discrimination that was imposed upon people  who meant us no harm, did us no harm, suffered. In their suffering,  America became the great country it is because they laid the foundation  for America's greatness. They are the foundational mothers and fathers  of this country.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
