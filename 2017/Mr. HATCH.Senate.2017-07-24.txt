 Madam President, July 24 marks a significant milestone in  the history of my home State of Utah. On this day, 170 years ago,  Brigham Young and the Mormon pioneers first entered the Salt Lake  Valley. Facing violence and discrimination at every turn, Utah's early  settlers crossed the Nation in search of a land where they could  practice their religion free from prejudice and abuse. In the cradle of  the Rocky Mountains, they found a home.   Each year, we remember the sacrifice of these courageous men and  women and the miraculous events that led to the founding of our State  by observing Pioneer Day. This special holiday is a celebration of the  pioneer spirit, that unique mix of industry, ingenuity, and innovation  that transformed an arid desert plain into one of the most prosperous  States in the Nation.   Pioneer Day is a perennial reminder of how a people--left to their  own devices and empowered to follow their dreams--can accomplish  incredible things. It is a testament to what westerners can achieve  when the government steps out of the way and allows the human spirit to  flourish.   It seems only fitting then that on Pioneer Day I speak in support of  David Bernhardt, a man who immediately understands the western way of  life and has dedicated his career to defending it.   As my colleagues know, Mr. Bernhardt has been nominated to serve as  the next Deputy Secretary of the Department of the Interior. Today, I  wish to express my support for his confirmation in the strongest  possible terms.   Mr. Bernhardt has a distinguished record of public service, having  served for nearly 10 years in the Department of Interior as Solicitor,  Deputy Solicitor, Deputy Chief of Staff, and Director of Congressional  Affairs. Now that Mr. Bernhardt works in private practice, Mr.  Bernhardt is regarded as one of the Nation's most experienced and  authoritative legal minds on natural resource policy.   Broad support for Mr. Bernhardt's confirmation is a testament to the  sterling reputation he has built over an accomplished career in both  the public and private sectors. State wildlife management agencies,  Native American Tribes, environmental conservation and wildlife  protection groups, and the Congressional Western Caucus are among the  many organizations that have strongly endorsed Mr. Bernhardt's  nomination. He has also garnered the support of hundreds of  recreationists, sportsmen, anglers, agricultural producers, and  ranchers.   Nominating Mr. Bernhardt is in keeping with the President's promise  to restore trust between westerners and the Federal Government. After  just 6 months in office, our President has already made tremendous  progress in repairing the broken relationship between local communities  and the executive branch.   Of course, significant challenges remain, especially in my home State  of Utah, where reduced access to Federal land has hurt the rural  economy. Fortunately, as a former Interior Solicitor, Mr. Bernhardt has  the legal and political background necessary to tackle some of the  greatest challenges facing Utah and the West. He is well-equipped to  improve sage grouse management practices, streamline permitting on  Federal lands, and increase recreational access.   Mr. Bernhardt is also committed to fostering cooperation between  Interior agencies and State and Tribal governments, in addition to  reducing the National Park Service's backlog. Reducing the maintenance  backlog is critical to tourism in Utah, which is home to the Mighty 5  national parks.   I applaud the nomination of Mr. Bernhardt. His breadth of experience  makes him uniquely qualified to serve as Deputy Secretary, and I look  forward to working with him and Secretary Zinke to further the  important work of the Department of the Interior.   In that regard, I also praise Secretary Zinke, who, I think, is doing  a terrific job in that Department, understanding the needs of the West,  especially the needs of all those areas that we know are supervised by  the Interior Department. He is a terrific human being, and I have a  great deal of respect for him. The reason he is so good is because he  has had all the experience working in the West and living in the West  and doing the things that really have made the West a great place to  begin with.   Mr. Bernhardt is going to be a great addition to our government, and  I want to applaud Secretary Zinke for helping to push him forward.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I speak today to bid farewell to Kimberly  Brandt. Kim has worked for the Senate Finance Committee as the chief  oversight counsel for more than 6 years. Kim came to the Finance  Committee after years of public service, and she leaves it to again  answer the call to public service. While we are sorry to see her leave,  I want to take a minute to note the important contributions she has  made while on the Finance Committee.   She has coordinated oversight on virtually every conceivable topic  within the ambit of the committee's jurisdiction. That work has  included IRS, Medicaid and Medicare, Social Security, and trade  compliance oversight.   While her work has been both bipartisan and exceptional, Kim is  probably equally known to everyone here as the thoughtful baker.   Always cognizant of the little things, Kim made it her life's mission  in the Senate to ensure every staffer and Senator had a cookie in their  hand when they needed it most. Her mantra that there are only a few  things in life a good cookie can't improve has spread like fresh  flowers in a spring garden.   It is no wonder the first comment most of my staffers have made is  ``who will make us cookies?'' after hearing that Kim is leaving. The  most unfortunate thing, however, is that I am not sure there is anyone  who can fill those shoes. Kim's cookies are perhaps the best I have  ever had during my tenure in the Senate. Only my wife's lemon bars can  compare, and I feel compelled to say that just to ensure I don't end up  on the couch tonight.   I mean, my goodness, just talking about Kim's cookies is making me  hungry. You just can't beat her peanut butter and chocolate chip  cookies.   While Kim's attention to these little things have brought her  considerable fame while she has worked here, there is little doubt in  my mind that Kim's legacy extends far beyond her cuisine.   As just one example, Kim worked tirelessly through one of the largest  investigations of the IRS that we have seen in recent memory. Kim's  leadership ensured that our committee's analysis was both grounded in  fact and integrity, and though it took several dozen months to  complete, I don't believe there is anyone in this body that would  dispute that report's precision, thoughtfulness, and earnestness.   She also has become known as the person who tackles complicated  issues involving the Medicare and Medicaid Programs and develops  creative, thoughtful policy solutions. That has been evident in her  recent work on Medicaid over the past year and in her efforts to come  up with solutions to the Medicare audit and appeals backlog, as well as  the complicated and burdensome Stark rule. In each of these instances,  Kim has engaged the impacted stakeholders and the relevant policy folks  and come up with legislative ideas that are bipartisan. This is no  small task.   It is this type of work ethic and reputable end product that makes  Kim the type of person you hate to see leave, but you quietly rejoice  that they are going to be the one helping steer the ship in the  administration.   Truly, Kim's appointment as Principal Deputy Administrator for  Operations at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, CMS,  reflects this administration's desire to have quality individuals  helping lead an agency facing daunting challenges. I don't think anyone  would contend with the need for strong and informed leadership there. I  can think of no one better suited for the position. I would like to  take a few minutes to briefly reflect on Kim's experience to explain  why I believe that to be true.   Before Kim came to the Finance Committee, she worked as senior  counsel at Alston & Bird here in Washington, DC, advising clients on  healthcare compliance and fraud and abuse issues. Prior to her work at  Alston & Bird, Kim served 7 years as the director of the Medicare  Program Integrity Group at CMS. For 5 years before that, Kim worked at  the HHS Office of Inspector General as special counsel and director of  external affairs and as a senior counsel negotiating False Claims Act  settlements and drafting and monitoring corporate integrity agreements.   Just that work experience, in two administrations and a respected law  firm, should be enough to qualify Kim for this important role, but I am  not done. Kim also worked on authoring OIG's compliance guidance for  individual and small group physician practices.   She received her J.D. with a concentration in health law from the  [[Page S4135]]  DePaul School of Law, an M.A. in legislative affairs and health policy  from George Washington University, and her B.A. from Valparaiso  University.   Kim has long been recognized nationally as an expert in healthcare  compliance and fraud and abuse issues, but in 2016, that recognition  culminated in her receiving the Healthcare Compliance and Ethics  Professional of the Year award from the Society for Corporate  Compliance and Ethics and the Health Care Compliance Association.   While I am sure to speak for all of my staff and fellow Senators when  I say that we will miss Kim, I think I can also say, with confidence,  that we have the greatest faith in Kim. Yes, we will probably have  strikes due to the absence of Kim's baked goods, and yes, our oversight  and Medicaid efforts will not be the same without Kim, but this is  important work we are all engaged in, and it would be wrong to bar our  great country from the service of this wonderful and highly talented  friend of mine.   Before I conclude, though, I would like to harken back to one of my  favorite stories about Kim.   It was in the wake of the Lois Lerner debacle. Kim and her team spent  more than a dozen months hashing out a highly detailed and important  investigation that revealed quite a bit more than what we were  initially expecting. In the end, Kim and her team interviewed more than  32 current and former IRS and Treasury employees and reviewed nearly  1.5 million pages of documents. The fruit of their labor was a  staggering and included a four-part treatise on the IRS's processing of  501(c)(3) and 501(c)(4) applications for tax-exempt status. There were  thousands of pages of appendices and hundreds of pages of report text.   Before the report was finalized, however, I wanted to be sure I had  read every word. Aside from the hefty amount of reading, it also  created problems because the text included confidential taxpayer  information and only those with clearance could enter my office while I  reviewed the text. Kim's humor, wit, and zealous optimism kept me alert  and motivated throughout the investigation of those hundreds of pages,  and while I have always cherished Kim's famous cookies, they never  tasted better than they did then.   Now, I had always appreciated Kim, but in this instance, her  commitment to detail and integrity really struck me. To ensure that the  product coming out of the committee was a complete and accurate one,  she went back to the IRS to confirm that the committee had all relevant  documents. Only then did we discover the thousands of pages of missing  emails which would become a critical part of the investigation. If it  weren't for Kim's hard work and intellectual rigor, we would have never  discovered this fact, and throughout the investigation, which was often  heated and impassioned on both sides of the aisle, Kim was fair,  honest, and worked hard to keep the inquiry bipartisan, something no  other committee in Congress could do.   This and many other incredible memories of Kim will be with me  forever, and words can't quite say how truly grateful I am to have Kim  help me make all those memories these past several years.   Our work in the Nation's Capital can get ugly sometimes. It can be  partisan. We often wonder whether we can still get good people to go  into public service, but then we are reminded that there are good  people in this town who repeatedly answer the call to public service.  Kim Brandt is one of these--and she is one of the best. The Finance  Committee, the Senate, CMS, and, in honesty, the United States of  America is lucky to have her in these roles, and we thank her for her  hard work.   I am going to miss you, Kim.   I want to wish Kim, her beloved pup Sherlock, and her family all of  the best. I feel no need to hesitate when I say that we are all proud  of you and will miss you dearly.   Thank you.                            ____________________
