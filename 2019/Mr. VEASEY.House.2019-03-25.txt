 Mr. Speaker, last week the city of Fort Worth said good- bye to its last surviving member of the World War II Tuskegee Airmen,  Robert T. McDaniel.   Born in Fort Worth, Mr. McDaniel was a proud graduate of Fort Worth  ISD, where he excelled as a student. In 1940, he finished as class  president and valedictorian at the venerable I.M. Terrell High School.   At a time when the military was still segregated and Black men were  not welcomed in the service, Mr. McDaniel became a member of the first  class of African American bombardiers in the U.S. Army Air Corps. He  was part of a group of skilled Black airmen who flew combat aircraft in  World War II.   After serving his country, Mr. McDaniel returned to Fort Worth to  teach at I.M. Terrell and later became a principal and a counselor. In  this role, he worked to inspire a generation of leaders in Fort Worth's  Black community that is countless.   As many of his friends will tell you, Mr. McDaniel never boasted  about his military service, and only a few people knew about his  service to the Nation as a Tuskegee Airman.   I know that we are going to miss Mr. McDaniel.   I also wanted to touch on the fact that I will never forget when his  wife, Hester, died. They were married for 55 years, and they were an  institution in the Black community in Fort Worth. Everybody knew them.  They were just a lovely couple. He was so sad when she passed away.  They were always at each other's side.   While we will miss Mr. McDaniel, we know that he is happy to be  reunited with his wife, Hester McDaniel.   My deepest condolences go out to his family and his friends as we  reflect on the trails that he blazed and his deep commitment to our  country.                            ____________________
