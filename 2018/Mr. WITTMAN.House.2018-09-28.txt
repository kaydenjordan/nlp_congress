 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support my resolution, H.  Res. 1088, a resolution recognizing this Saturday, September 29, as  National Urban Wildlife Refuge Day.   Across the country, urban wildlife refuges are places for families to  gather and enjoy the outdoors. Urban refuges are places where  communities can come together to preserve nature, and places to inspire  the next generation of hunters and anglers.   I encourage all generations, whether old or young, to go visit one of  the 101 national urban wildlife refuges throughout the United States.   I thank Representative Hakeem Jeffries for partnering with me on this  legislation to help further emphasize the value of our Nation's urban  wildlife refuges.                            ____________________
