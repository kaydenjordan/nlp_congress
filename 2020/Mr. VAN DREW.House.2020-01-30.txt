 Madam Speaker, I would like to posthumously recognize  the heroic efforts of Carlton Hand, of Rio Grande in south Jersey.   Carlton Hand was a Technical Sergeant, Infantry, Cannon Company,  349th Infantry. Hand was recognized for his gallantry in combat. He  stormed an entrenched German position in the face of heavy enemy sniper  fire, grenades and mortar shells blasting all around them.   With snipers shooting at them, Carlton Hand abandoned his radio,  secured grenades from one of his comrades, and killed two attacking  Germans. He then seized a rifle in the face of continuing mortar and  sniper fire, and killed two, and wounded one more German.   Germans then dropped grenades on his position, which he then  proceeded to hurl back at the enemy. He then captured 20 prisoners in  the seizure of the enemy position.   Carlton Hand was awarded the Silver Star Medal for Valor for his  heroic efforts. Carlton Hand is the definition of an American hero, and  we owe our future to the brave actions of Carlton Hand and the men and  women like him who have shaped this great United States of America.   Our country was forged by the blood, sweat, and tears of brave men  and women like Carlton Hand.   May God bless them as they look down upon us.                            ____________________
