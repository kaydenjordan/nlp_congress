 Madam Speaker, we are the most powerful  country, and we are less than a week away from defaulting on our debt.  We should all be outraged, and we should all be here.   Constituents in North Carolina's First Congressional District will  feel the impact immediately and long term if we default.   North Carolina's First Congressional District has over 174,000  residents who would lose Social Security payments, and nearly 50,000  veterans, our heroes who protect our communities and defend our  freedoms, would see payments slashed.   As we prepare to honor those who died in military service, the best  way that we can help their surviving family members and those that they  served with is by Congress fulfilling its obligation to pay its bills  now.                            ____________________
