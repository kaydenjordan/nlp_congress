 Mr. President, in reserving the right to object, I rise  today to speak on the nomination of Richard L. Revesz to serve as  Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs,  Office of Management and Budget.   Mr. Revesz has repeatedly voiced support for the Clean Power Plan  developed by the Obama administration. The Environmental Protection  Agency designed that overreaching regulation to shut down the coal  industry by shifting power generation away from reliable energy  sources. The regulation was part of the Obama administration's War on  Coal. That war devastated many communities in my State of West  Virginia.   This year, the Supreme Court held it was unlawful in the landmark  case of West Virginia v. EPA. Mr. Revesz submitted an amicus brief in  that case to oppose West Virginia's position and argue against the  interpretation of the major questions doctrine that the Supreme Court  ultimately adopted.   Mr. Revesz's well-documented approach to regulation, including his  support for the Clean Power Plan, demonstrates he is not the right  person to get the administration's policies on a reasonable track;  therefore, I object.
