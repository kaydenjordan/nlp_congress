 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, earlier this year, the Commerce Department  found the Chinese telecommunications giant ZTE guilty of persistently  and willfully violating U.S. sanctions laws on North Korea and Iran.  That is a pretty serious offense for a large company to commit. It  found that the company then repeatedly lied about it and went to great  lengths to cover it up.   In response, as we should, across party lines, our government took  action and put a series of strict export and transaction prohibitions  on ZTE in mid-April of this year. We did what we should do. A large  international company--it happened to be Chinese in this case--broke  the law, broke a serious law on sanctions and then lied about what it  did, so we took action.   It is pretty galling to learn that early this morning, the Commerce  Department announced yet another agreement with the Chinese  telecommunications giant to enable it to interact with U.S. companies.  They committed that kind of offense, then they lied about that kind of  offense, and now we are saying: It is OK. You can come back into our  country and do business with us.   What gives here? We can't allow a Chinese company or a company  anywhere--I mean, I am not picking on China in this case, but China is  a country we have had difficulty with. It is habitually breaking  international trade laws and seems to have as much trouble with the  truth as some people in the White House have. Yet we have allowed this  Chinese company to violate U.S. law time and again, to lie about it  time and again and get away with it. By turning a blind eye to ZTE's  blatant violations, the Trump administration is putting Chinese jobs  ahead of American jobs, putting Chinese national interests over  America's national security. Why in the world would we do that?   ZTE is a Chinese company best known for making cheap smartphones,  mostly sold in developing countries, although it also sells them here.  That is important. It means a company that knowingly breaks U.S. laws  could have control over information people have on their phones.   It is bad enough that we send this message: OK, you broke the law.  That is bad enough. Then you lied about it. You broke serious  international law, sanctions laws that protect our national security in  part and protect the world from these countries--countries such as  North Korea and Iran, which are bad actors. You broke the law by  helping them, breaking sanctions laws, and then you lied about it. That  is bad enough. Now we are not only not penalizing them, we are giving  them an advantage when these companies could have control over  information people have on their phones.   This company that cheated isn't a company that makes cars; this is a  company that makes telecommunications equipment that can be used in an  insidious sort of way against our own people. This could have real  national security implications if that information is abused. As we  have seen with recent revelations about Facebook giving Chinese telecom  giants access to its data, private firms are not always careful with  how they manage people's private lives and private data.   The administration's new agreement with ZTE reportedly emerged from  direct discussions between President Trump and the President of China.  I can't even imagine what those discussions must have been. Think about  what the President of China had to defend, what his country did, what  his company did. Yet the President of the United States was willing to  say: Oh, we will forgive it. We are not really worried. We love you. We  love your country. We love this company--even though it is prioritizing  Chinese jobs over American jobs, and it is prioritizing Chinese  national security interests over America's national security interests.   In a nutshell, America's national security must not be used as a  bargaining chip in negotiations. I don't know if the President, talking  to the President of China, said: OK, we will do this for you, and you  did this for us. Whatever the ``you did this for us''--I don't know  whether it means the President's business or the President personally  or whether ``us'' means America's national interests, but I have not  seen any of America's national interests that are getting favored in  this whole transaction.   Trading American sanctions enforcement to promote jobs in China is a  bad deal for American workers and a very bad deal for the security of  all Americans.   Let's look at how we got here. Last year in March, ZTE agreed to a  combined civil and criminal penalty and forfeiture of $1.2 billion  after illegally shipping telecommunications equipment to Iran and North  Korea, in direct violation of U.S. sanctions laws. They made false  statements and obstructed justice.   I am not a lawyer. I understand that this is serious stuff--shipping  telecommunications equipment to Iran and North Korea, which are two  really bad actors in the world, two countries that virtually everybody  on this Senate floor has spoken out against at one time or another. It  violated U.S. sanctions laws--laws that this Senate passed close to  unanimously. They made false statements. They obstructed justice. Then  the Commerce Department determined that ZTE then lied about its crimes.  How does it get more serious than that?   Commerce Secretary Ross said recently--the Commerce Secretary  appointed by the President, Secretary Ross. I know him well. I like  some of the things he has done, particularly in Cleveland. He said:  ``ZTE made false statements to the U.S. Government when they were  originally caught and put on the Entity List, made false statements  during the reprieve it was given, and made false statements again  during its probation.''    At least the company is consistent: They lie during this part of the  process, and they lie during that part of the process, and then they  lie during that part of the process. So we know that about this  company's character.   These false statements covered up the fact that ZTE paid full bonuses  to employees who had engaged in illegal conduct, and failed to issue  letters of reprimand.   They break the law. They lie and lie. Then they give bonuses to the  executives who lie. How much more can this company grind Americans'  faces in the dirt as they lie, cheat, and steal, and then the American  President, in a face-to-face meeting with China, says: It is OK. We  don't mind. I speak for the American people. Do it again.   It fundamentally says: If you grind Americans' faces in this muck  after all that China has done and this company has done to America's  national interests and then you say ``We are not going to punish you,''  it pretty much says you are free to do it again.   Secretary Ross said:         ZTE misled the Department of Commerce. Instead of       reprimanding ZTE staff and senior management, ZTE rewarded       them. This egregious behavior cannot be ignored.    The President's Secretary of Commerce has said that we can't ignore  it. He has said that they cheated, they broke the law, they lied, they  lied again, and they lied again. They rewarded those lies and gave  bonuses to those who lied. They never reprimanded them. That is what  the President's Secretary of Commerce is saying. Then the President  said: It is OK. It is OK. We don't mind. We will get something else for  this.   That is why this spring, after Ross's comments, the Department of  Commerce issued a law enforcement decision imposing a broad denial of  export privileges on ZTE for its repeated violations of U.S. sanctions  and export control laws.   These denial orders are law enforcement actions. Any changes to them  should be decided independently. But that ain't happening here. The  President is overruling a law enforcement decision--as he criticizes  the FBI almost daily--made in the interests of America's national  security, in part by people appointed to their offices by the President  of the United States. He didn't just appoint the FBI Director; he  didn't just select his Vice President; he appointed Mr. Wilbur Ross as  his Secretary of Commerce. The Secretary of Commerce is saying,  fundamentally: Mr. President, don't do this. This company needs to be  punished.  [[Page S3286]]    Again, the President overrules a law enforcement decision made in the  interests of America's national security, all in order to save jobs.  That is at least a reason, but the problem with that is that the jobs  saved are in China. They are not in Mansfield, OH. They are not in  Cleveland, OH. They are not in Shreveport, LA, the Presiding Officer's  home State. They are not in Toledo, OH. Think about that. The  administration looks the other way for a company that broke the law,  that threatened national security, and is doing it to protect jobs in  Communist China, in the People's Republic of China. It defies all odds.   Can you imagine China saying: You know, I think we are going to hurt  our national security so we can put some more jobs in Akron, OH. We are  going to compromise our workers' interests so we can put more jobs in  Zanesville, OH. It is OK that China is going to get a little hurt so we  can get some more jobs in Chillicothe, OH.   I don't think they think that way. They do everything in their power.  They steal our technology. They undermine our industries. They put our  companies out of business. And then we do this. The only person I know  who wants to do this is the President of the United States. The  Secretary of Commerce doesn't like this decision. I am sure the FBI  doesn't like this decision. I have yet to meet a Republican or  Democratic Senator who says: Attaboy, Mr. President. Undermine our  national interests. Protect Chinese jobs over jobs in Harrisburg or  jobs in Ann Arbor or jobs in Madison, WI, or jobs in Atlanta, GA.   America's policies toward China--it might be an interesting idea to  put Americans first, that our policies toward China should put our  country first. That is what China does in reverse. That is why Congress  needs to push back on this decision by the President and address it  directly as soon as possible. The National Defense Authorization Act  offers a chance to do that.   Senator Van Hollen inserted language into the CFIUS bill which  received overwhelming support from both parties when we marked it up in  the Banking Committee 2 weeks ago. That legislation is now in this  Defense bill. With the settlement agreement announced by Commerce, that  legislation will require some change, some tweaking, to make sure that  it covers what the administration has already done and at the same time  prevents the President from moving forward with this agreement. Senator  Cotton, a conservative Republican; Senator Van Hollen, a progressive  Democrat; Senator Crapo, a Republican and the chairman of the Banking  Committee; and I, a Democrat and the ranking member of the Banking  Committee, pressed for an amendment that would do that.    This bipartisan amendment would send a clear signal to the White  House and, more importantly, would send a clear signal to the world  that we don't agree with that behavior. It would send a clear signal  that Congress disapproves of this most recent agreement.   It is inexplicable. Unless the President has some personal reason for  doing this--unless it makes the President's business more profitable,  unless it puts money in the pocket of his family or himself--and I am  not accusing him because I just don't know--I can't figure out what all  of this means. Why would you side with Chinese workers over American  workers? Why would you side with Chinese national security over our  domestic security?   I can't figure out why you would unroll, unspool, a decision by your  own Cabinet member to punish this company for breaking the law once,  twice, three times with Iran and North Korea, for lying about it once,  twice, three times, and for giving rewards to those company officials  who broke the law and then lied about it. I can't think of any other  explanation as to why a President of the United States would possibly  make a decision like that unless it was in his own, personal financial  interest.   This bipartisan amendment would send a clear signal that Congress  disapproves of that, so I urge my colleagues to support the Van Hollen- Cotton amendment.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
