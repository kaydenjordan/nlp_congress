 Madam Speaker, I rise today to highlight the positive  accomplishments and ongoing challenges facing healthcare providers in  rural and remote parts of our country, especially in places like  Michigan's First District, my home.   Last week marked the 30th anniversary of the 340B Federal drug  pricing program, which provides discounted pharmaceutical products to  providers that care for a disproportionate share of uninsured and at- risk patients.   In my district alone, we have 20 340B hospitals providing care for  our most vulnerable patient populations and ensuring our rural and  remote communities receive the best possible care available.   This program has been a critical component of healthcare for so many  [[Page H5452]]  Michiganders, and I hope to work with my colleagues to ensure its  continued success, especially as it faces new challenges that could  threaten its efficacy in the future.   As the COVID-19 pandemic has shown us, reliable access to care, along  with the availability of prescription drugs and specialist medical  treatments, is more important than ever.   Our rural and remote providers will continue to do everything in  their power to provide top-of-the-line care to our patients. In turn,  Congress must continue to address those rural health priorities.                            ____________________
