 Mr. President, for many people--not just here in and  around the Capitol but across the country--the past few weeks have been  a wake-up call--a wake-up call to see the stakes of our fight for a  fair judiciary.   From abortion rights to free speech to gun violence, Federal judges  make countless decisions that impact our daily lives. We have been  reminded of that in a very significant way. But our current Federal  bench is not representative of the diversity of our country and our  democracy. We have a lot of work to do to rebuild the judiciary in a  way that deserves the faith of the American people, to build a  judiciary that reflects and represents the diverse Nation that it  serves.   I know we have talked about it before. We have been chipping away at  it, not just through the Judiciary Committee but through a number of  circuit court judges and district court judges across the country,  including in California.   I am certainly proud of the significant step that we took recently  with the confirmation of soon-to-be Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson. But  for all the progress we have made this last year, we still have a lot  of work to do, especially at the lower court level, where almost all  Federal cases are heard. Many are decided there, and that is it.   That is why I continue to work closely with the Biden administration  to recommend and support talented nominees for California's district  courts--nominees who will bring a wide range of professional and lived  experiences to the Federal bench.   So, today, I rise to highlight three outstanding nominees to  California's district courts.   First, the Senate will soon vote on the confirmation of Judge Trina  Thompson to become a judge for the Northern District of California.   Judge Thompson has deep roots serving the community of Alameda  County. After earning her undergraduate degree and her JD from UC  Berkeley, she began her legal career with the Alameda County Public  Defender's Office; and, eventually, she built a successful solo  practice in criminal defense.   Over the next decade, she handled dozens of criminal trials, and she  continued to work with the county public defender's office to take on  pro bono clients in the community. A legal trailblazer, Judge Thompson  became the first Black woman to win election to serve as a judge in  Alameda County. She has continuously demonstrated her sense of  fairness, her commitment to justice, and her dedication to the rule of  law. I know that Judge Thompson will continue to pave the road for  equal justice on the Northern District bench.   I urge my colleagues to support her nomination.   Second, the Senate will also soon vote on Judge Sunshine Sykes'  confirmation to become a judge for the Central District of California.   A member of the Coyote Pass Clan of the Navajo Nation, Judge Sykes is  devoted to pursuing justice, especially for those who have too often  been left behind by the legal system.   Judge Sykes earned her undergraduate degree and her JD from Stanford  University. After law school, she chose to begin her legal career  working for the California Indian Legal Services. There, she built a  tremendous reputation as a skillful adviser and advocate for Tribes on  a wide range of legal matters, from addressing domestic violence to  developing Tribal courts and preserving cultural resources. She also  developed an important expertise in juvenile dependency cases under the  Indian Child Welfare Act.   Recognizing Judge Sykes' outstanding work, then Governor Jerry Brown  appointed her to the California Superior Court in 2013. Over the past 9  years, she has presided over nearly 100 cases.   She will bring an impressive legal record, work ethic, and an  appropriate sense of empathy to her judgeship in the central district.   If confirmed, Judge Sykes will also be the first Native American to  ever serve on a Federal court in California. I will remind us that  California is home to more federally recognized Native American Tribes  than any State in the Nation.   I look forward to her distinguished service in the central district.   Finally, I would like to speak for a moment, as well, about Judge  Sherilyn  [[Page S2561]]  Peace Garnett, who was confirmed last month to serve on the U.S.  District Court for the Central District of California.   Judge Garnett brings an outstanding record as a lawyer, as a jurist,  and a public servant committed to equal justice.   Judge Garnett earned her undergraduate degree from UC Riverside and  her JD from Harvard Law School. After starting her career in private  practice, Judge Garnett became an assistant U.S. attorney for the  Central District of California. She spent 13 years serving that office,  earning numerous awards and rising to a number of leadership positions.   Recognizing her hard work and record of excellence as a litigator,  Governor Brown appointed Judge Garnett to the Los Angeles Superior  Court in 2014.   For 8 years, she served with distinction as a superior court judge  and a justice pro tem on the California Court of Appeal. She now brings  this experience to the Federal bench as a judge for the central  district.   Voices like hers--and the voices like that of Judge Thompson and  Judge Sykes--have been left out of the judiciary for far too long. All  three of these nominations of outstanding women, women of color,  represent important progress. So I celebrate each of these jurists, and  I thank them for their willingness to serve.   With each of their confirmations, we take another important step  closer to the fair judiciary that this Nation deserves, toward the  justice system that our democracy deserves.   Mr. President, I am so proud of the progress we have made in  California. I look forward to working with you and our colleagues and  with the Biden administration to continue this important work.   With that, I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the  Advanced Aviation Infrastructure Modernization Act, which I introduced  today.   Next-generation propulsion aircraft, including electric vertical  takeoff and landing aircraft, are poised to revolutionize how people  and cargo move within and between cities, suburban, and rural areas.  These advanced air mobility technologies also present the potential to  transform how we link historically underserved communities and  [[Page S2588]]  deploy a new type of transportation that does not require physical  roads or rails.   As localities, regions, and States consider how to integrate the  advent of these technologies and the opportunities to relieve traffic  congestion and improve mobility options, a modest Federal investment  can help communities ensure that cutting-edge, clean, quiet aviation  technologies can be best integrated into existing and future  transportation networks.   That is why I am proud to introduce this bill to help States and  localities keep pace with this growing sector. It would establish a  pilot program to help State, local, and Tribal governments to prepare  for anticipated advanced air mobility operations and ensure communities  can take advantage of the potential benefits of the safe integration of  these technologies in our Nation's airspace.   I want to thank Senator Moran for coleading this bill with me, and I  hope our colleagues will join us in support of this bill that will help  communities prepare for the development and deployment of advanced air  mobility technologies and related infrastructure.                                  ______                                         By Mr. PADILLA (for himself, Mr. Menendez, and Mr. Brown):   S. 4247. A bill to amend the Public Works and Economic Development  Act of 1965 to establish university centers to encourage certain  economic development, and for other purposes; to the Committee on  Environment and Public Works.    Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the  University Centers for Growth, Development, and Prosperity Act, which I  introduced today.   The U.S. Economic Development Administration created the University  Center Program to allow institutions of higher education and consortia  to establish and maintain university centers, with the understanding  that our higher education institutions play a critical role in our  Nation's economic growth.   University centers are Federal partnerships that leverage the assets  of higher learning institutions to strengthen regional economic growth  by promoting innovation, entrepreneurship, and job creation. They  encourage economic development in economically distressed regions,  which helps spur job growth, high-skilled regional talent pools, and  business expansion.   Despite EDA's important work, many communities across the country  have yet to benefit from the Agency's programs, including smaller  communities, communities of color, and rural areas experiencing higher  rates of poverty.   The current University Center Program is not specifically authorized  by Congress and is instead part of EDA's Technical Assistance Program.   That is why I am proud to introduce legislation that would codify and  expand the University Center Program, leverage more resources for  minority-serving institutions, and support a greater diversity of  innovation and entrepreneurship in their communities. California has  thriving institutions, including Chico State and Fresno State, that  will be able to scale their impact with new resources. By prioritizing  the establishment of new university centers at colleges and  universities that serve significant populations of underserved  students, we can strengthen regional economies and help close the  racial wealth gap.   Specifically, the bill establishes an EDA University Center Program  to help universities collaborate with economic development districts,  trade adjustment assistance centers, and other economic development  technical assistance and service providers to develop and implement  comprehensive economic development strategies and other economic  development planning at the local, regional, and State levels, with a  focus on innovation, entrepreneurship, and workforce development.   It also prioritizes the participation of minority-serving  institutions as part of the University Center Program. Minority-serving  institutions provide incredible opportunities for so many low-income  and first-generation students. I am proud that my State of California  is home to 174 Hispanic-serving institutions and 51 emerging Hispanic- serving institutions the highest amount in the country.   As a Senator representing one of the most diverse States in the  country, I am proud to work with my colleagues to ensure that we work  to improve the equity of EDA programming and help increase the  participation of minority-serving institutions.   I want to thank Congressman Pete Aguilar for introducing this bill  with me, and I hope our colleagues will join us in support of this  effort.                                  ______                                         By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Ms. Baldwin, Mr. Brown, Ms. Cantwell,          Mr. Carper, Ms. Duckworth, Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. Schatz, Mr.          Warnock, Mr. Murphy, Mr. Blumenthal, Mrs. Feinstein, and Mr.          Whitehouse):   S. 4255. A bill to authorize dedicated domestic terrorism offices  within the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Justice,  and the Federal Bureau of Investigation to analyze and monitor domestic  terrorist activity and require the Federal Government to take steps to  prevent domestic terrorism; to the Committee on the Judiciary.    Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the  Advanced Aviation Infrastructure Modernization Act, which I introduced  today.
