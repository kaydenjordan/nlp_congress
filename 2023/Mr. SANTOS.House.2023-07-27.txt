 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to bring attention to the  state of chaos that the Biden administration's border policies have  created in New York's Third District.   Today, at 1 p.m., there is a press conference taking place back home  in front of the new mega-structure tent being built at Creedmoor Center  across the street from an elementary school, P.S. 18, in Queens.   Mr. Speaker, when I visited the border just a couple of weeks ago, I  toured a similar facility to the one being built in my district. It is  safe to say what is going on at the southern border can be felt as far  north as New York.   This problem is no longer out of sight, out of mind. Thanks to the  Biden administration's policies, all districts are border districts.   I am calling on Mayor Eric Adams to stop this madness, declare a  state of emergency for New York City, and stop taking in these  migrants. The city is overwhelmed by a constant influx of migrants,  alongside being plagued by rising crime.   As the only Republican representing Queens in Congress, I call on my  counterparts on the other side of the aisle to join me in efforts to  end this madness in our county and in our city. New Yorkers deserve a  better quality of life  [[Page H4041]]  than the one imposed by its one-party rule government.                            ____________________
