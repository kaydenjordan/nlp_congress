 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 381) to designate a mountain in the John Muir Wilderness of  the Sierra National Forest as ``Sky Point''.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 381         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) Staff Sergeant Sky Mote, USMC, grew up in El Dorado,       California.        (2) Staff Sergeant Mote graduated from Union Mine High       School.        (3) Upon graduation, Staff Sergeant Mote promptly enlisted       in the Marine Corps.        (4) Staff Sergeant Mote spent 9 years serving his country       in the United States Marine Corps, including a deployment to       Iraq and two deployments to Afghanistan.        (5) By his decisive actions, heroic initiative, and       resolute dedication to duty, Staff Sergeant Mote gave his       life to protect fellow Marines on August 10, 2012, by       gallantly rushing into action during an attack by a rogue       Afghan policeman inside the base perimeter in Helmand       province.        (6) Staff Sergeant Mote was awarded the Navy Cross, a       Purple Heart, the Navy-Marine Corps Commendation Medal, a       Navy-Marine Corps Achievement Medal, 2 Combat Action Ribbons       and 3 Good Conduct Medals.        (7) The Congress of the United States, in acknowledgment of       this debt that cannot be repaid, honors Staff Sergeant Mote       for his ultimate sacrifice and recognizes his service to his       country, faithfully executed to his last, full measure of       devotion.        (8) A presently unnamed peak in the center of Humphrey       Basin holds special meaning to the friends and family of Sky       Mote, as their annual hunting trips set up camp beneath this       point; under the stars, the memories made beneath this       rounded peak will be cherished forever.       SEC. 2. SKY POINT.         (a) Designation.--The mountain in the John Muir Wilderness       of the Sierra National Forest in California, located at       3715'16.10091"N 11843'39.54102"W, shall be known and       designated as ``Sky Point''.        (b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation,       document, record, or other paper of the United States to the       mountain described in subsection (a) shall be considered to       be a reference to ``Sky Point''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, this bill would name a peak in the Sierra Nevada  Mountains after Marine Staff Sergeant Sky Mote as a small token of the  gratitude of our Nation, and as a permanent reminder that, as  Shakespeare put it: ``This story should the good man teach his son.''   On August 12, 2012, Sergeant Mote was at his post in the tactical  operations center of the 1st Marine Special Operations Battalion in  Helmand province. On that day, a so-called Afghan police officer opened  fire on the Marines who had come there to help that country.   When the attack broke out, Sergeant Mote was in an adjoining room. He  could have easily escaped to safety. According to the Navy citation:  ``He instead grabbed his M4 rifle and entered the operations room,  courageously exposing himself to a hail of gunfire in order to protect  his fellow Marines. In his final act of bravery, he boldly engaged the  gunman, now less than 5 meters in front of him, until falling mortally  wounded.''   According to the citation, it was Mote's actions that stopped the  attack, and it was his heroism for which he received the Navy's second  highest decoration: the Navy Cross.   The irony is that Sky Mote was indifferent to the medals he was  awarded during his life: the Navy and Marine  [[Page H710]]  Corps Commendation Medal, the Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal,  two Combat Action Ribbons, and three Good Conduct Medals that he earned  during his 9 years of exemplary service to his Nation.   His father, Russell, recalled that ``He never cared about medals. He  never showed them to us.'' He said: ``Once, I found one in his  laundry.'' But his father also said that although his son was  indifferent to medals, he was intentionally and intensely proud of his  EOD badge, designating his service as an explosive ordnance disposal  technician.   To the EOD technicians, bombs are not something to be avoided but  something to be sought out and disarmed. On one such day, Mote diffused  two IEDs, crawled through a heavily seeded minefield to save the life  of his team member who had been severely wounded by a third, and then  directed the evacuation of his unit. On that day, Sergeant Mote had  earned a Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal with a V for valor.   We come today to the Hall of the House of Representatives to try to  honor a hero who didn't care much about medals.   We do so not for him. Lincoln was right long ago that it is far  beyond our poor powers to add or detract from the honor of his deeds  and the example of his life.   I think we do so in part to acknowledge an irredeemable debt that our  country owes to an eternally grieving family. We need to remember there  are Gold Star families among us who spend their Memorial Days not at  barbecues and beach parties but in solemn ceremonies and quiet vigils  around honored graves. We honor their loved ones in hopes that in some  small way we can fortify them against the loss that they bear every day  of their lives.   But, mainly, I think we do it for ourselves, that we might draw  inspiration from his courage and instruction from his willingness to  sacrifice all to protect the vision of liberty enshrined in the  founding of our Nation.   In consultation with his family, we have identified a mountain in the  John Muir Wilderness of the Sierra National Forest overlooking where  Sky Mote and his family often camped and hiked. This bill proposes that  it forever more be known as Sky Point as a token of our Nation's  respect of his heroism, its appreciation of his sacrifice, its sympathy  for his family, and of its solemn pledge that succeeding generations of  his countrymen will never forget him.   This legislation first passed the House by voice vote in the 114th  Congress, and I urge the passage of this bill.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his kind and  good words and urge adoption of the bill.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 339) to amend Public Law 94-241 with respect to the Northern  Mariana Islands.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 339         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Northern Mariana Islands       Economic Expansion Act''.       SEC. 2. COMMONWEALTH OF THE NORTHERN MARIANA ISLANDS:                     TRANSITIONAL WORKERS.         Section 6 of Public Law 94-241 (48 U.S.C. 1806) is       amended--        (1) in subsection (a)(6), by striking ``$150'' and       inserting ``$200''; and        (2) in subsection (d)(2)--        (A) by striking the period at the end of the first sentence       and inserting ``, except a permit for construction       occupations (as that term is defined by the Department of       Labor as Standard Occupational Classification Group 47-0000       or any successor provision) shall only be issued to extend a       permit first issued before October 1, 2015.''; and        (B) by striking the period at the end of the third sentence       and inserting ``, except that for fiscal year 2017 the number       of permits issued shall not exceed 15,000.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, the House has before it H.R. 339, sponsored by  Congressman Sablan of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.   The House passed an identical bill this past December just before the  conclusion of the 114th Congress. However, that bill was unable to pass  the Senate and make it to the President's desk for signature before the  end of that Congress, and so I am here today to once again urge the  bill's passage through the House and on to the Senate.   The Northern Mariana Islands are benefiting by new investment and  growth of consumer spending, particularly in tourism. Their economic  growth rate is almost twice that of the rest of our country.   To meet this growth, the Commonwealth has to maintain a workforce to  match it. Currently, the Northern Marianas is phasing out the use of  foreign workers by slowly reducing the total number of CW-1 permits  issued by the Department of Homeland Security. Economic growth is  dynamic, but bureaucracy is not. If the CW-1 permits are phased out too  quickly, the islands may suffer a growth-stopping shortage of labor.  This bill would provide flexibility to the Commonwealth in order to  protect its newfound economic prosperity in three critical ways:   First, it would fund ongoing vocational education curricula and  program development to assure a skilled domestic workforce funded from  an increase in CW-1 fees from $150 to $200.   Second, it would limit the CW-1 permits for construction occupation  to those issued prior to October 1 of 2015.   And third, it would temporarily increase the number of CW-1 permits  during this transition period.   Mr. Speaker, these changes will continue to accommodate the economic  growth in the Northern Marianas, while assuring a trained domestic  workforce for the future.   I would urge adoption of the bill.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I would urge the House to finish the  work that it began in December by passing this bill.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 46) to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to conduct a  special resource study of Fort Ontario in the State of New York.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 46         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Fort Ontario Study Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress makes the following findings:        (1) From 1755 until 1814, Fort Ontario and three previous       fortifications built on the site of the Fort in Oswego, New       York, on the shore of Lake Ontario were used as military       installations during the French and Indian War, the       Revolutionary War, and the War of 1812.        (2) The original fort, erected by the British in 1755, was       destroyed by French forces in 1756. The fort was rebuilt and       subsequently destroyed during both the American Revolution       and the War of 1812. The star-shaped fort was constructed on       the site of the original fortifications in the 1840s, with       improvements made from 1863 through 1872.        (3) The United States Armed Forces began expanding Fort       Ontario in the early 20th century and by 1941, approximately       125 buildings stood at the fort.        (4) On June 9, 1944, President Franklin D. Roosevelt       announced that Fort Ontario would serve as the Nation's only       Emergency Refugee Camp during World War II. From August of       1944 until February 1946, nearly 1,000 refugees were       sheltered at Fort Ontario.        (5) Fort Ontario was conveyed from the Federal Government       to the State of New York in 1946; it was used to house World       War II veterans and their families and then converted to a       State historic site in 1953.        (6) A post cemetery containing the graves of 77 officers,       soldiers, women, and children who served at Fort Ontario in       war and peace is situated on the grounds of the fort.        (7) In 1970, Fort Ontario was placed on the National       Register of Historic Places.       SEC. 3. FORT ONTARIO SPECIAL RESOURCE STUDY.         (a) Study.--The Secretary of the Interior (referred to in       this section as the ``Secretary'') shall conduct a special       resource study of Fort Ontario in Oswego, New York.        (b) Contents.--In conducting the study under subsection       (a), the Secretary shall--        (1) evaluate the national significance of the site;        (2) determine the suitability and feasibility of       designating the site as a unit of the National Park System;        (3) consider other alternatives for preservation,       protection, and interpretation of the lands by Federal,       State, or local governmental entities, or private and       nonprofit organizations;        (4) consult with interested Federal, State, or local       governmental entities, private and nonprofit organizations or       any other interested individuals;        (5) determine the effect of the designation of the site as       a unit of the National Park System on existing commercial and       recreational uses and the effect on State and local       governments to manage those activities;        (6) identify any authorities, including condemnation, that       may compel or allow the Secretary to influence or participate       in local land use decisions (such as zoning) or place       restrictions on non-Federal land if the site is designated a       unit of the National Park System; and        (7) identify cost estimates for any Federal acquisition,       development, interpretation, operation, and maintenance       associated with the alternatives.        (c) Applicable Law.--The study authorized under subsection       (a) shall be conducted in accordance with section 100507 of       title 54, United States Code.        (d) Report.--Not later than 3 years after the date on which       funds are first made available for the study under subsection       (a), the Secretary shall submit to the Committee on Natural       Resources of the House of Representatives and the Committee       on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate a report that       describes--        (1) the findings of the study; and        (2) any conclusions and recommendations of the Secretary.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.    I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, Congressman John Katko of New York brings us H.R. 46,  which authorizes the National Park Service to conduct a special  resource study of Fort Ontario in Oswego, New York, to evaluate the  site's national significance and determine the suitability of its  designation as a unit of the National Park system.                                time  1645    Fort Ontario was first established in 1755 to defend Americans during  the French and Indian Wars. You might say it was the first time our  Nation has dealt with organized terrorism. It played a role in the  American Revolutionary War and the War of 1812 and served our country  as a hospital, training facility, and a refugee center in the First and  Second World Wars.   In 1946, after nearly 200 years of active military use, Fort Ontario  was transferred to the State of New York, which has operated and  maintained it ever since. The House passed a nearly identical version  of this legislation in the 114th Congress.   I urge adoption of the measure.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from New York (Mr. Katko), the author of this measure.    Mr. Speaker, this is an important part of American  history. It belongs in the National Park System. I urge adoption of the  bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 374) to remove the sunset provision of section 203 of Public  Law 105-384, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 374         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. DUNGENESS CRAB FISHERY MANAGEMENT.         Section 203 of the Act entitled ``An Act to approve a       governing international fishery agreement between the United       States and the Republic of Poland, and for other purposes'',       approved November 13, 1998 (Public Law 105-384; 16 U.S.C.       1856 note), is amended--        (1) by striking subsection (i); and        (2) by redesignating subsection (j) as subsection (i).     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, the House has before it H.R. 374, sponsored by our  colleague, Congresswoman Jaime Herrera Beutler of Washington.   This bipartisan, consensus-based legislation would permanently  reauthorize the successful management of the Dungeness crab fisheries  of Washington, Oregon, and California by these respective States. They  have been doing so since 1980, and doing it well.   This permanent reauthorization is broadly supported by commercial and  recreational fishing organizations. It is an example of the maxim: ``If  it ain't broke, don't try and fix it.''   I might add that these three States manage these fisheries in both  Federal and State waters, and the management is funded by the  participating States--a relief to the Federal Treasury.   In the last Congress, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that  an identical bill would save up to $1 million in discretionary Federal  spending since State management would continue under this act. This  bill is a win for the American taxpayer, a win for the seafood  consumer, and a win for the three States involved.   I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to  the gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. Beutler), the author of this  legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Graves).    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 538) to redesignate Ocmulgee National Monument in the State  of Georgia and revise its boundary, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 538         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Ocmulgee Mounds National       Historical Park Boundary Revision Act of 2017''.       SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.         In this Act:        (1) Map.--The term ``map'' means the map entitled       ``Ocmulgee National Monument Proposed Boundary Adjustment,       numbered 363/125996'', and dated January 2016.        (2) Historical park.--The term ``Historical Park'' means       the Ocmulgee Mounds National Historical Park in the State of       Georgia, as redesignated in section 3.        (3) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary       of the Interior.       SEC. 3. OCMULGEE MOUNDS NATIONAL HISTORICAL PARK.         (a) Redesignation.--Ocmulgee National Monument, established       pursuant to the Act of June 14, 1934 (48 Stat. 958), shall be       known and designated as ``Ocmulgee Mounds National Historical       Park''.        (b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation,       document, paper, or other record of the United States to       ``Ocmulgee National Monument'', other than in this Act, shall       be deemed to be a reference to ``Ocmulgee Mounds National       Historical Park''.       SEC. 4. BOUNDARY ADJUSTMENT.         (a) In General.--The boundary of the Historical Park is       revised to include approximately 2,100 acres, as generally       depicted on the map.        (b) Availability of Map.--The map shall be on file and       available for public inspection in the appropriate offices of       the National Park Service, the Department of the Interior.       SEC. 5. LAND ACQUISITION; NO BUFFER ZONES.         (a) Land Acquisition.--The Secretary is authorized to       acquire land and interests in land within the boundaries of       the Historical Park by donation or exchange only (and in the       case of an exchange, no payment may be made by the Secretary       to any landowner). The Secretary may not acquire by       condemnation any land or interest in land within the       boundaries of the Historical Park. No private property or       non-Federal public property shall be included within the       boundaries of the newly expanded portion of the Historical       Park under section 4(a) without the written consent of the       owner of such property.        (b) No Buffer Zones.--Nothing in this Act, the       establishment of the Historical Park, or the management of       the Historical Park shall be construed to create buffer zones       outside of the Historical Park. That an activity or use can       be seen or heard from within the Historical Park shall not       preclude the conduct of that activity or use outside the       Historical Park.       SEC. 6. ADMINISTRATION.         The Secretary shall administer any land acquired under       section 5 as part of the Historical Park in accordance with       applicable laws and regulations.       SEC. 7. OCMULGEE RIVER CORRIDOR SPECIAL RESOURCE STUDY.         (a) In General.--The Secretary shall conduct a special       resource study of the Ocmulgee River corridor between the       cities of Macon, Georgia, and Hawkinsville, Georgia, to       determine--        (1) the national significance of the study area;        (2) the suitability and feasibility of adding lands in the       study area to the National Park System; and        (3) the methods and means for the protection and       interpretation of the study area by the National Park       Service, other Federal, State, local government entities,       affiliated federally recognized Indian tribes, or private or       nonprofit organizations.

(c) Results of Study.--Not later than 3 years after the       date on which funds are made available to carry out this       section, the Secretary shall submit to the Committee on       Natural Resources of the House of Representatives and the       Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate--        (1) the results of the study; and        (2) any findings, conclusions, and recommendations of the       Secretary.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.  [[Page H715]]     I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the Ocmulgee Mounds are among the oldest archaeological  sites in our country. The earthworks date back before 1000 A.D., and  the site has evidence of human habitation dating back to the ice age,  some 17,000 years ago. Between the 10th and 12th centuries A.D., the  site was occupied by a sophisticated society that we know as the Macon  Plateau culture, which built earthen mounds up to 55 feet in height,  representing a distinct political and cultural society.   It is believed that Hernando de Soto recorded the site as the  chiefdom of Ichisi in 1540. Just before the American Revolution,  naturalist William Bartram marveled at ``the wonderful remains of the  power and grandeur of the ancients in this part of America.''   H.R. 538, introduced by the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Bishop),  would redesignate the Ocmulgee National Monument in Georgia as the  Ocmulgee Mounds National Historical Park and adjust the boundary of the  historical park to include approximately 2,100 new acres to be acquired  by donation or exchange only.   Additionally, the bill directs the Department of the Interior to  conduct a special resource study to determine the feasibility of adding  the Ocmulgee River corridor to the National Park System. The study will  also examine the national significance of the site as well as the best  methods and means for ensuring protection and interpretation of this  area.   The bill was passed by voice vote in the House in the 114th Congress.  I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of its passage today.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Austin Scott), the cosponsor of this  legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 558) to adjust the boundary of the Kennesaw Mountain  National Battlefield Park to include the Wallis House and Harriston  Hill, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 558         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Kennesaw Mountain National       Battlefield Park Boundary Adjustment Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         The Congress finds the following:        (1) Kennesaw Mountain National Battlefield Park was       authorized as a unit of the National Park System on June 26,       1935. Prior to 1935, parts of the park had been acquired and       protected by Civil War veterans and the War Department.        (2) Kennesaw Mountain National Battlefield Park protects       Kennesaw Mountain and Kolb's Farm, which are battle sites       along the route of General Sherman's 1864 campaign to take       Atlanta.        (3) Most of the park protects Confederate positions and       strategy. The Wallis House is one of the few original       structures remaining from the Battle of Kennesaw Mountain       associated with Union positions and strategy.        (4) The Wallis House is strategically located next to a       Union signal station at Harriston Hill.       SEC. 3. BOUNDARY ADJUSTMENT; LAND ACQUISITION;                     ADMINISTRATION.         (a) Boundary Adjustment.--The boundary of the Kennesaw       Mountain National Battlefield Park is modified to include the       approximately 8 acres identified as ``Wallis House and       Harriston Hill'', and generally depicted on the map titled       ``Kennesaw Mountain National Battlefield Park, Proposed       Boundary Adjustment'', numbered 325/80,020, and dated       February 2010.        (b) Map.--The map referred to in subsection (a) shall be on       file and available for inspection in the appropriate offices       of the National Park Service.        (c) Land Acquisition.--The Secretary of the Interior is       authorized to acquire, from willing owners only, land or       interests in land described in subsection (a) by donation or       exchange.        (d) Administration of Acquired Lands.--The Secretary of the       Interior shall administer land and interests in land acquired       under this section as part of the Kennesaw Mountain National       Battlefield Park in accordance with applicable laws and       regulations.        (e) Written Consent of Owner.--No non-Federal property may       be included in the Kennesaw Mountain National Battlefield       Park without the written consent of the owner. This provision       shall apply only to those portions of the Park added under       subsection (a).        (f) No Use of Condemnation.--The Secretary of the Interior       may not acquire by condemnation any land or interests in land       under this Act or for the purposes of this Act.        (g) No Buffer Zone Created.--Nothing in this Act, the       establishment of the Kennesaw Mountain National Battlefield       Park, or the management plan for the Kennesaw Mountain       National Battlefield Park shall be construed to create buffer       zones outside of the Park. That activities or uses can be       seen, heard, or detected from areas within the Kennesaw       Mountain National Battlefield Park shall not preclude, limit,       control, regulate or determine the conduct or management of       activities or uses outside the Park.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.    I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 558, introduced by the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  Loudermilk), expands the boundary of the Kennesaw National Battlefield  Park by authorizing the Secretary of the Interior to acquire  approximately 8 acres of land by donation or exchange only. The  expanded area includes the historic Wallis House and Harriston Hill.   The Wallis House is one of the few remaining structures associated  with the Kennesaw Mountain Civil War battle, while Harriston Hill was  strategically significant as the Union signal station.   The Battle of Kennesaw Mountain in June of 1864 was critical to the  Union campaign to split the Confederacy, and although it was a tactical  victory for the Confederates, it opened the way for the Union's  strategic victory of taking Atlanta. The sacrifices of more than 3,000  Union troops on Kennesaw Mountain made possible Sherman's famous  telegram to Lincoln 3 months later that ``Atlanta is ours and fairly  won.''   These battlefields remind succeeding generations of Americans of the  price paid by so many for the preservation of our Constitution and the  liberty it protects and the enormous responsibility that each of us has  to maintain and defend that same Constitution today. Nearly identical  legislation passed the House by voice vote in the 114th Congress.   Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of the bill.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the sponsor of this bill, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Loudermilk).    Mr. Speaker, I urge the adoption of the bill.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 560) to amend the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation  Area Improvement Act to provide access to certain vehicles serving  residents of municipalities adjacent to the Delaware Water Gap National  Recreation Area, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 560         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. VEHICULAR ACCESS AND FEES.         Section 4 of the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation       Area Improvement Act (Public Law 109-156) is amended to read       as follows:       ``SEC. 4. USE OF CERTAIN ROADS WITHIN THE RECREATION AREA.         ``(a) In General.--Except as otherwise provided in this       section, Highway 209, a federally owned road within the       boundaries of the Recreation Area, shall be closed to all       commercial vehicles.        ``(b) Exception for Local Business Use.--Until September       30, 2021, subsection (a) shall not apply with respect to the       use of commercial vehicles that have four or fewer axles and       are--        ``(1) owned and operated by a business physically located       in--        ``(A) the Recreation Area; or        ``(B) one or more adjacent municipalities; or        ``(2) necessary to provide services to businesses or       persons located in--        ``(A) the Recreation Area; or        ``(B) one of more adjacent municipalities.        ``(c) Fee.--The Secretary shall establish a fee and permit       program for the use by commercial vehicles of Highway 209       under subsection (b). The program shall include an annual fee       not to exceed $200 per vehicle. All fees received under the       program shall be set aside in a special account and be       available, without further appropriation, to the Secretary       for the administration and enforcement of the program,       including registering vehicles, issuing permits and vehicle       identification stickers, and personnel costs.        ``(d) Exceptions.--The following vehicles may use Highway       209 and shall not be subject to a fee or permit requirement       under subsection (c):        ``(1) Local school buses.        ``(2) Fire, ambulance, and other safety and emergency       vehicles.        ``(3) Commercial vehicles using Federal Road Route 209,       from--        ``(A) Milford to the Delaware River Bridge leading to U.S.       Route 206 in New Jersey; and        ``(B) mile 0 of Federal Road Route 209 to Pennsylvania       State Route 2001.''.       SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.         Section 2 of the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation       Area Improvement Act (Public Law 109-156) is amended--  [[Page H718]]         (1) by redesignating paragraphs (1) through (5) as       paragraphs (2) through (6), respectively; and        (2) by inserting before paragraph (2) (as so redesignated       by paragraph (1) of this section) the following:        ``(1) Adjacent municipalities.--The term `adjacent       municipalities' means Delaware Township, Dingman Township,       Lehman Township, Matamoras Borough, Middle Smithfield       Township, Milford Borough, Milford Township, Smithfield       Township and Westfall Township, in Pennsylvania.''.       SEC. 3. CONFORMING AMENDMENT.         Section 702 of the Omnibus Parks and Public Lands       Management Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-333) is repealed.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.    I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 560, introduced by Congressman Tom Marino, amends  the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area Improvement Act to  allow a highway through the national recreation area to continue to be  used by small commercial vehicles that serve the local communities  adjoining this federally designated land. It is entirely in keeping  with one of our principal objectives for Federal land use policy: to  restore the Federal Government as a good neighbor to the communities  impacted by the Federal lands.   In 1981, a portion of highway 209 was transferred from the  Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to the National Park Service. Two years  later, Congress closed the National Park Service segment of highway 209  to commercial traffic except for commercial vehicular operations  serving businesses or persons located in or contiguous to the  boundaries of the recreation area. Congress also authorized the Park  Service to collect and retain fees from commercial use of the road. A  10-year transition period was established to accommodate impacts on the  surrounding communities until alternative trucking routes could be  built. Congress later passed two additional extensions of the  commercial vehicle permitting authority through September 30, 2015.   As the third extension permitting commercial vehicle use of highway  209 neared expiration, local elected officials requested that Congress  enact legislation to permit access for smaller class commercial  vehicles for businesses physically located in towns adjacent to highway  209. H.R. 560 provides for such an extension, establishes up a fee  structure, and exempts certain vehicles from the fee, thus protecting  residents of these communities from additional disruption and  inconvenience.   Congressman Marino should be commended for his efforts to resolve  this vexing issue for his constituents.   A nearly identical version of this legislation passed the House by  voice vote in the 114th Congress. I urge adoption of this bill.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Marino), the author of the  measure.    I would just add that this and all the bills we heard  today authored by both Republicans and Democrats, which passed this  House in the last session, unanimously, were all stalled in the Senate.  I would only express the hope that the Senate, this year, will act on  these measures and do its duty as the coequal branch of the legislative  department of this government.   I yield back the balance of my time.
