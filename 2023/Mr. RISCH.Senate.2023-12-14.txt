 Thank you, Senator.   I want to join my good friend from Wyoming in this really important  issue.   We are talking here today about enriched uranium, a commodity that is  absolutely critical to America. Not only is it an energy security  issue, it is a national security imperative.   Right now, we get about one-fifth of our enriched uranium out of  Russia. What is that doing? It is doing a number of things. No. 1, it  gives Russia control over the supply, but just as importantly, at the  same time, it is helping finance Russia's war against Ukraine.   It is past time that we end this dependence on or even use of any  kind of Russian-enriched uranium.   Congress took a tremendous step by passing the Nuclear Fuel Security  Act,  [[Page S5984]]  which Senator Barrasso, Senator Manchin, and I introduced to enhance  domestic uranium conversion and enrichment capacity, which is  desperately needed. Now we have to provide a pathway to enhance  domestic nuclear fuel production.   We need to provide certainty both here at home and to the world that  a reliance on Russian fuel is over, once and for all. This is our  opportunity to do it here.   Russia is going to suffer consequences from its attack on Ukraine for  generations to come. I don't think they have fully figured that out  yet. But this is just a tip of the iceberg as to what is coming for  them. We need to cut it off.   I strongly urge my colleagues to pass H.R. 1042, which, as the  Senator from Wyoming mentioned, was unanimously passed out of the House  of Representatives earlier this week. It will be a companion to the  bill that we passed earlier this year.   This is a really, really good step forward and an incredibly good  step forward.   With that, I will yield to Senator Manchin.    Uranium.
