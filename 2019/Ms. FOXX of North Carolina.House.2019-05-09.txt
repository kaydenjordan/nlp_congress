 Madam Speaker, I rise to recognize the  inauguration of the Borealis, Borouge plant in Taylorsville, North  Carolina. It is the first of the company's North American facilities  dedicated to automotive materials production and is well positioned to  source suppliers and original equipment manufacturers in the Southeast  United States.   It is exciting to see another way that progrowth policies adopted by  the North Carolina State Legislature and this body last Congress are  attracting capital and creating new jobs.   The investment by Borealis also says much about the high caliber of  people in Taylorsville. They are entrepreneurial-minded and working  hard to grow their business community. Beginning with 30 new full-time  jobs, Borealis aims to expand in the region through local relationships  and by developing a new generation of talent.   I am very proud to represent the Taylorsville community and to see  new opportunities taking off in its economy.                            ____________________
