 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of continued  preservation and restoration of the Great Lakes through the Great Lakes  Restoration Initiative, a very important initiative for the Great Lakes  system.   For Michiganders, the Great Lakes are directly linked to our  identity, our way of life, our history, and our future.   The Great Lakes basin is home to more than 30 million people, and it  contains 90 percent of the Nation's fresh surface water supply. Many  know that, but they don't always understand the economic impact. That  provides the backbone of a $6 trillion regional economy.   The Great Lakes Restoration Initiative has a strong track record of  success, specifically in west Michigan, where the work to clean up  toxic hotspots in areas like Muskegon is estimated to have increased  property values by nearly $12 million and generated $1 million in new  recreational spending. This holds true across west Michigan and the  entire region, as every dollar invested in the GLRI generates more than  $3 in additional long-term economic activity.   The GLRI is critical to our efforts to protect drinking water,  prevent the spread of invasive species, and to accelerate the cleanup  of areas of concern.   With the threat of Asian carp inundating our waters, high water  levels and erosion threatening our shorelines, and the ongoing threat  of PFAS contamination contaminating our water, we must be committed to  bipartisan solutions to protect this critical resource.   Recently, my Republican colleagues and I had an opportunity to spend  some time with the President, and he recommitted his support for the  GLRI and  [[Page H804]]  towards the Great Lakes, as well as making sure that Brandon Road and  other efforts to keep invasive species out are happening.    Mr. Speaker, the GLRI is a bipartisan example of an  effective and efficient use of taxpayer dollars that protects,  preserves, and strengthens the Great Lakes today and for future  generations.
