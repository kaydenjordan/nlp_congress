 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in remembrance of  Frank ``Sonny'' Seiler.   Sonny died in his hometown of Savannah, Georgia, at the age of 90. He  was a great attorney who was best known for being the caretaker and  owner of the University of Georgia's beloved mascot, Uga.   Seiler started the Uga tradition when he and his wife Cecelia brought  their English bulldog to the season-opening football game in 1956. Ever  since then, Seiler and his family continued the tradition by raising a  line of bulldog mascots for the football team.   Seiler also served as the lead defense attorney for Jim Williams in a  murder case, which served as the centerpiece for the book ``Midnight in  the Garden of Good and Evil.''   His contributions to the University of Georgia as a student and  alumnus were immeasurable and his loyalty to his alma mater was  unmatched.   He was, as we say, ``a damn good dog.''   Mr. Speaker, Mr. Seiler's legacy will live on forever and his impact  will be felt for decades.                            ____________________
