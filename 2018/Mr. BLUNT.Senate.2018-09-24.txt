 Mr. President, I take this opportunity to honor the  work of Ms. Adrienne Arsht on the occasion of the 5-year anniversary of  the Adrienne Arsht Latin America Center at the Atlantic Council.  Throughout her career, Ms. Arsht has worked in and called home New  York, Miami, and Washington, DC. Today, she tirelessly dedicates  herself to promoting artistic, business, and civic growth in these  three cities.   In 2013, Ms. Arsht founded the Adrienne Arsht Latin America Center at  the Atlantic Council to broaden the understanding of regional  transformations with a focus on high-impact work that shapes the  conversation among policymakers, the business community, and civil  society. The center focuses on Latin America's strategic role in a  global context with a priority on pressing political, economic, and  social issues that will define the trajectory of the region now and in  the years ahead. Its work provides an essential forum for navigating  the dramatic economic and political changes defining the 21st century  by informing and galvanizing its uniquely influential network of global  leaders.   In 2013, the Ambassador of Spain to the United States presented her  with the prestigious Spanish diplomatic honor, Order of the Cross of  Isabella the Catholic, for her contributions toward Spanish-speaking  countries. Earlier this year, Ms. Arsht was awarded the distinguished  Order of San Carlos of Colombia by direction of President Juan Manuel  Santos to recognize her deep commitment and support of Colombia.   Ms. Arsht serves as executive vice chair of the Atlantic Council. In  2017, she founded the Adrienne Arsht Center for Resilience to explore  the intersection between people and the geopolitical events that affect  them. From natural disasters and displacement, to global pandemics and  terrorism, the Center for Resilience helps individuals, communities,  and societies navigate the global changes that define the 21st century.   Ms. Arsht has also been an ambassador for the arts in the United  States. She has contributed to the preservation and sustainability of  multiple artistic institutions in the cities she calls home. In Miami,  she secured the financial footing of the city's performing arts center,  prompting its board to rename it the Adrienne Arsht Center for the  Performing Arts of Miami-Dade County in 2008. Her contributions to the  Lincoln Center in New York City were recognized with the dedication of  the Adrienne Arsht Stage in Alice Tully Hall in 2012. In Washington,  DC, she created the Adrienne Arsht Theater Fund at the Kennedy Center  to support a wide variety of musical productions. Ms. Arsht was awarded  the Carnegie Hall 2017 Medal of Excellence, recognizing her visionary  and outstanding contributions to cultural and nonprofit institutions  nationally.   Adrienne Arsht is a philanthropist at heart and an extraordinary  business leader who serves our country and advances international  understanding.                            ____________________
