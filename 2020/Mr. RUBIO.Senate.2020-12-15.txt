 Mr. President, I was alerted that someone in my  household had been in close contact with several people who have tested  positive for Covid-19. In an effort to avoid potentially exposing the  passengers and crew on my flight, and my staff and colleagues in the  Senate, both myself the member of my household took a PCR test in  Florida and are currently awaiting the results.                            ____________________
