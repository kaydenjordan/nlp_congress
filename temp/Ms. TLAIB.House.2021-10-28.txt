 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of Alex  Odeh, a peace activist who worked to promote civil liberties for Arab  Americans in the United States and civil and human rights around the  world.   A Palestinian immigrant, a published poet, lecturer of Arabic  language and Middle East history at Coastline College, Alex was someone  who embodied the best America has to offer.   Through his work with the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination  Committee, he dedicated his life to achieving true equality and equity  for all.   And for daring to push for a better tomorrow, Alex was murdered on  October 11, 1985, when a pipe bomb exploded as he entered his ADC  office in Santa Ana, California.   This horrific act of domestic terrorism targeting Arab Americans was  not new, and I am proud to say it has failed to achieve its objectives.   Arab Americans and Palestinian Americans are still here, loud and  proud, speaking truth to power, and carrying on Alex's fight in his  memory.   Our politics of love are the only response. Those who support  oppressive policies in Palestine that murdered Alex and those who  continue to fearmonger and whip up hate against us to this day will not  win.   We will never give up, Alex. I am proud to be here because of you.                            ____________________
