 Mr. President, how much time do I have?    Thanks very much.   Mr. President, I don't have enough time to respond to everything that  my colleague from South Dakota has said. If I did, it would take a long  while.   I would say this: A couple of years ago, when we passed with only  Republican votes in the House and Senate, signed by President Trump, a  tax-cut bill that was supposed to pay for itself, it didn't. It  increased our deficit by hundreds of billions of dollars.   I think most of us know, with respect to abortion, the law of the  land for many years--over 30 years--has been Roe v. Wade; and,  essentially, after a certain point, when you have viability in the  womb, abortions cannot be performed except in very limited cases,  including rape, incest, and the life of the mother.   The legislation that we passed and considered in the House does not  provide for changing those limitations, and that needs to be made  clear.   The other thing I would say, with respect to the reconciliation bill,  the Build Back Better legislation that the House is considering today  in the Rules Committee, it is paid for. It is actually paid for, and it  is paid for largely by making sure that everybody is paying their fair  share.   Folks don't mind in my State--and other States don't mind--you know,  seeing their taxes raised, but they want to make sure that everybody  else is paying their fair share. As it turns out, there are a lot of  wealthy people in this country and a lot of wealthy corporations who  don't pay their fair share--in some cases nothing--and that is just  wrong.   And the legislation actually cuts taxes for most Americans.                          Vote on Connor Nomination    Mr. President, now to the issue at hand. We are about to vote today  on the nomination of Michael Connor to serve as Assistant Secretary of  the Army for Civil Works.   As we all know, this is a critical leadership position for the U.S.  Army Corps of Engineers. The Corps of Engineers Civil Works program is  the nation's primary provider of water resources infrastructure, and  with the increasing impacts of climate change, having someone of Mr.  Connor's caliber at the Corps is critical.   He has the experience and character to be successful in this role.  During the Obama administration, he served as Deputy Secretary of the  Interior, and he proved himself to be a capable leader. He will bring  that experience to the Corps.   If confirmed, Mr. Connor will lead efforts that dramatically impact  every corner of this country, from coastal to inland to small,  disadvantaged, rural, and Tribal communities.   It is critically important that we get Mr. Connor confirmed now,  today. I urge my colleagues to support his nomination.   I think my time has expired.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     I ask for the yeas and nays.
