 Madam Speaker, as a woman of faith, I am called to love  my neighbor as myself and to bear one another's burdens. My heart is  heavy with the burden, pain, and loss experienced by the Asian American  and Pacific Islander communities.   Unfortunately, we have seen a nationwide rise in hateful and harmful  acts toward Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. Targeted violence  against anyone based on who they are cannot be tolerated. It is not who  we are as a people and goes against everything we represent as a  nation.   Today, I had hoped to be able to support H. Res. 275, condemning the  horrific shootings of the eight Asian women in Atlanta, to honor the  lives of the victims, and recognize the basic American fundamentals  that reject hatred and violence.   Instead, what would have been a fitting and honorable resolution  ended up being just another vehicle for delivering cheap shots against  our former President.   I am disappointed that I cannot support this resolution as written.                            ____________________
