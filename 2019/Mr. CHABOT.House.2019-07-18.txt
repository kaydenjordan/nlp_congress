 Mr. Speaker, as the Representative of Cincinnati, Ohio, I  rise this morning to recognize an Ohioan who was a professor of  aerospace engineering at the University of Cincinnati. Prior to that,  he was a naval aviator, a test pilot, and, later, an astronaut.   Mr. Speaker, 50 years ago, the words he spoke now reside in history:  ``That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.''   Everyone on Earth at that time remembers where he or she was when  Neil Armstrong took that step. His contributions to space exploration  did not end on the surface of the Moon. Neil Armstrong was also on the  team that investigated the Apollo 13 accident, and he was vice chairman  of the commission that investigated the space shuttle Challenger  disaster.   Ohioan Neil Armstrong is a true American hero, and his extraordinary  service to our country--to all of humankind, really--will be forever  remembered.                            ____________________
