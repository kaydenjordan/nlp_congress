 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Virginia for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, it is indeed an honor to speak on behalf of a person I  have come to know and love. In fact, the First District of Texas has  been blessed to be the home of many remarkable individuals who have  gone above and beyond to serve others in Texas and throughout the  world.   It is indeed a privilege to honor a woman from Longview, Texas, who  has dedicated her life to serving and providing comfort for our  Nation's veterans, particularly our prisoners of war. Her name is Helen  Smith, and October 5 of this year marks her 91st birthday.   Helen's caring for our Nation's POWs began with her husband, Gordon  Smith, a survivor of the Bataan Death March in 1942 and a POW until the  end of World War II.   Throughout her long and happy marriage to Gordon, Helen gained a  personal understanding of the struggles many of our veterans and former  POWs endure; but armed with the knowledge of what our veterans and  former POWs face on a daily basis, Helen set out into the world to help  as many of our veterans as she possibly could. She spent countless  hours in VA facilities ensuring veterans, young and old, got the care  they so desperately needed and deserved.   Helen has walked the Halls of Congress advocating for our veterans  and former POWs throughout her life. She is a driving force and was  behind Public Law 97-37, which improved VA benefit programs for former  POWs.   Helen is not slowing down even at her age. At 90, Helen would head  over to the Longview Community Based Outpatient Clinic every morning at  sunrise. She would make a pot of coffee and spend her day talking to  veterans, giving them a sympathetic ear and helping them through the VA  process.   It is a distinct privilege to recognize such a remarkable woman, to  thank her for her tireless service to our veterans and former POWs, and  to wish her a very happy 91st birthday.   Her accomplishments are recorded in the Congressional Record, which  will endure as long as there is a United States of America.   I do thank my friend from Virginia for yielding.                                time  2115
