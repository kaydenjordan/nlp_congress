 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, sexual misconduct is terrible and it is wrong. Those  who engage in it should be held accountable. But this bill, while well  intentioned, is misguided.   For starters, it is a massive Federal overreach. It regulates  contract law that has been and should be handled at the State level.  Some States have decided to regulate confidentiality clauses in  contracts. Others have decided not to. That is how our system of  government works. That is how our Constitution works, States  experimenting to find out what, in fact, works best.   However, this bill creates a new Federal floor that undercuts the  power of States in the process. This is just the beginning of a new  push by Democrats to chip away at States' rights.   The White House said as much this week. In commenting on the bill,  the Biden administration said it ``Looks forward to continuing to work  with the Congress to advance broader legislation that addresses a range  of issues implicated in NDAs and nondisparagement clauses.''   They are not hiding the ball here. Federalism is a serious issue, and  Congress should not be taking power from the States just to impose its  top-down approach.   Additionally, we should take a hard look at the findings included in  the bill as passed by the Senate. House Democrats intentionally left  these findings out of the version of the bill that the Committee on the  Judiciary marked up. These findings include statistics about the  percentage of men and women who have experienced some form of sexual  harassment or sexual assault in their lifetime. It is not clear where  these statistics and new findings come from, but they seem to rely on a  study that uses a broad definition of sexual harassment, very broad,  that included instances of ``misgendering'' as sexual harassment. That  definition goes way beyond existing law.    A finding of Congress that effectively treats ``misgendering'' on its  own as a form of sexual harassment will doubtlessly lead to future  efforts to expand the law in other ways. If Democrats are going to  include findings like this, they should at least have to debate it in  the committee. We should think carefully about these findings before  cementing them in Federal law.   Finally, this bill, as drafted, is too broad and will affect  contractual matters completely unrelated to sexual misconduct. A  confidentiality clause may cover a wide range of information. When the  bill applies, it nullifies the entire confidentiality clause, with just  a few poorly defined exceptions.   As such, it will give trial lawyers an incentive to add unsupported  allegations in litigation so they can void a confidentiality clause and  access and use confidential information unrelated to the sexual  misconduct.   We all condemn sexual harassment and sexual assault, but this is a  flawed bill, and it is going to create problems down the road.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Kentucky (Mr. Massie), my friend and a member of the Judiciary  Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Bishop), a valued member of the  Judiciary Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. McClintock).    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Colorado (Mr. Buck).    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I urge opposition, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
