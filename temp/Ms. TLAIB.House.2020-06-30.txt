 Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Chairman DeFazio, for  his leadership on this bill, and for the leadership of Speaker  [[Page H2951]]  Pelosi, Chairwoman Waters, Chairman Scott, and Chairman Pallone for  fighting to make sure we make historic investments in our country's  crumbling infrastructure.   I rise today in support of amendments No. 41 and No. 42.   The first amendment, which I have proposed with my colleagues Reps.  Barragan, Ocasio-Cortez, and Brownley, prioritizes the public health of  vulnerable communities by adding detailed requirements to H.R. 2's  Climate Resilient Transportation Infrastructure Study.   For too long, the building of roads, highways, and other federal  infrastructure has come at the expense of communities experiencing  environmental injustice.   Our amendment would prioritize areas like Michigan's 13 District,  home to the most polluted zip code in our state, and other communities  that include people of color, migrants, and low-income workers. It  would center our communities are fighting against climate change,  pollution, and environmental racism.   My second amendment ensures proper oversight and transparency of  Community Climate Innovation Grants by requiring the Department of  Transportation to work with the Environmental Protection Agency and the  public.   Parents in my district should not live in fear of their children  playing / outside due to toxic air, and my amendment will ensure  accountability as we seek to significantly reduce greenhouse gas  emissions.   I urge my colleagues to support these amendments to ensure that the  communities that our communities are not ignored and do not bear the  brunt of federal infrastructure environmental discrimination.                                time  1645
