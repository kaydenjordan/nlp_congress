 Madam Speaker, I rise today to urge this body to pass  urgent legislation to help feed our children.   If we do not act, millions of children across the United States and  across New Mexico will lose access to vital school meals--breakfast and  lunches that are helping to address an epidemic of food insecurity that  is impacting every single corner of our State and our country.   Food insecurity has many faces. Like so many children from New  Mexico, I was a school lunch kid. I qualified for 100 percent free and  reduced-price lunch throughout my entire childhood. In fact, one in  four children in New Mexico are facing food insecurity and hunger, and  for many of these kids, school meals are the only reliable meal of the  day.   In New Mexico food is the center of our cultures, of our families, of  our ways of life, and yet, so many of our families are struggling every  single day to put food on the table.   For every family food insecurity looks different. It may mean  skipping meals, not being able to buy groceries every week, relying on  school lunches in order to feed children, and getting help from a local  food pantry and a local food bank.   In many cases, we know the pandemic has caused our families to  struggle even more, made the situation worse, intensified food and  hunger insecurity across our Nation, and that is why the work of this  body here in Congress to expand funding for nutrition programs to  extend these waivers and include school meals for every child in  America is quite literally a lifeline for our families and for our  children.   If Congress, and especially the Senate, do not act, millions of  children across America will actually lose access to school meals that  have carried them through the pandemic. This comes as our Nation is  grappling with disruptions to supply chains, inflation, rising costs,  and putting stresses on families across our country.   In exactly one month--days from now--our country will be facing a  hunger cliff as Federal waivers for school meals are set to expire and  children will lose access to 95 million meals across the country this  summer.   I have worked on food and hunger issues across my entire public  policy career. In New Mexico, we are working every day to reimagine our  food systems, to lift up our State's diverse and crucial food and  agriculture traditions and support our families who are struggling.   As a State legislator, I was deeply proud to partner with our  Governor and my colleagues in the State house and hunger advocates and  agricultural entities across the State to address food insecurity and  to pass a bill to end school meal copays.   Here in Congress, I am proud to continue this work alongside  antihunger champions like yourself, Madam Speaker, and as part of the  Hunger Caucus led by Chairman McGovern.   I am also proud to cosponsor H.R. 3115, the Universal School Meals  Program Act, which would address this crisis permanently by providing  three locally sourced meals a day to every school child in America.   The time to act is now. Our kids are counting on us. During the  pandemic, Congress made a game-changing decision--to feed all children  without barriers, without bureaucratic obstacles.   This is about the dignity and well-being of our families and meeting  the most basic needs of our children.   We have the opportunity to chart a new path forward for our country.  Will we decide to be a nation that lets our kids go hungry or will we  decide to be a nation where no child should ever have to experience  food insecurity again?   This is the choice facing this body, and this, Madam Speaker, is why  we must extend school meals.                                time  1630
