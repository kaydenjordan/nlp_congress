 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, the Democratic Party's motto this year  might as well be ``Free Stuff''--free  [[Page S4781]]  healthcare, free college, free debt relief, free childcare, and free  income. The problem, of course, is that the old adage ``There is no  such thing as a free lunch'' is 100 percent true.   Healthcare has to be paid for by someone. College has to be paid for  by someone. Democrats, of course, think they should all be paid for-- and often controlled--by the government, but what they don't like to  talk about as much is that the government has to get its money from  somewhere, and that somewhere is the American people.   If you ask Democrats how they are going to pay for all of this free  stuff, what they will say is, they will tax the rich. The problem is,  there simply aren't enough people to even come close to paying for the  Democrats' free programs and expansive policy proposals.   Every year, Forbes magazine reports the combined net worth of the 400  richest people in the United States, but if you took every penny from  every one of those people, it would be a tiny drop in the bucket next  to the cost of the Democrats' proposals.   Free healthcare alone--and these are my conservative estimates--would  cost $32 trillion over 10 years. Taking every penny from the richest  people in the United States wouldn't even cover 1 year of that  proposal. In fact, you could take every penny from every billionaire in  the entire world, and it would still only cover roughly 28 percent or  less than 3 years of Democrats' Medicare for All proposal.   That is just free healthcare. That is not the Green New Deal or  guaranteed income or free childcare or anything else. What if we move  away from billionaires? How about millionaires--even millionaires? What  if we taxed every household in the United States making more than  $200,000 at a 100-percent rate for 10 years? Well, we would still  barely have enough to cover free healthcare, much less Democrats' other  proposals.   Let's look at one of the Democrats', what I would say, relatively  smaller proposals, and that is student loan forgiveness and free  college. No one can deny that student loan debt is a problem in this  country. Many graduates emerge with tens of thousands of dollars' worth  of debt that they struggle to repay, and it burdens them for years. It  is a growing problem. Ways to alleviate this burden and encourage more  affordable education are conversations we need to have, but the free  college and debt elimination solutions offered by two leading  Democratic Senators are no solutions at all.   The U.S. Government is not swimming in money. We are deeply in debt,  and we already need to shore up existing programs, like Social Security  and Medicare, both of which are on shaky financial footing.   Paying for a college education for millions of Americans is not  something the government can easily afford. The Senator from Vermont's  plan for free college and student loan forgiveness would cost  approximately $2.2 trillion over 10 years. That may not sound like much  when compared to Democrats' budget-busting plan for government-run  healthcare, but it is still a lot of money.   The entire Federal budget for 2019 is less than $5 trillion, and that  is supposing the Senator from Vermont's proposal comes in on budget,  which seems unlikely. For one thing, when you offer something for free,  demand for it generally increases.   The Senator from Vermont is making his estimate based on today's  numbers, but what happens when demand skyrockets? The Federal  Government can be on the hook for far more than the Senator estimates,  and these proposals would do anything but incentivize colleges and  universities to lower the cost of tuition.   Both the Senators who have proposed free college and debt elimination  plans this year have said they will pay for it. The Senator from  Vermont would impose a financial transactions tax, while the Senator  from Massachusetts would impose what she calls an ultramillionaire's  tax on the very wealthy, but as one Wall Street Journal editor  highlights in a recent column, this is unlikely to cover the costs:         Financial-transaction taxes chronically underperform       estimates of the revenue they'll generate, and wealth taxes       are so ineffective that even France scrapped its version in       despair in 2017. Much heavier middle-class taxation is what       feeds European social-welfare States.    It goes on to say: And ``much heavier middle-class taxation'' is  likely to be the end result of Democratic proposals, like free college  and student loan forgiveness.   Even leaving aside the cost, let's talk about the merits of the  Democrats' proposals--for starters, the sheer unfairness of these  plans. Let's suppose one of these proposals becomes law. Now, suppose  you are someone who has lived frugally for years, and you have just  finished paying off $30,000 in student loans. You are not going to get  a penny back from the Democrats. Meanwhile, someone who has just  incurred that $30,000 in debt is going to get it completely wiped out.  There is no need to live frugally or think about paying off the debt  you have freely incurred; the debt will just be gone.    Then there is the fact that Democratic proposals for free college and  debt forgiveness are not going to solve the education debt problem.   The director of the Education Policy Program at New America--not a  conservative think tank, by the way--recently published a column in the  New York Times, where he noted that the proposals for free public  college from the Senator from Vermont and the Senator from  Massachusetts would ``not eliminate future student debt--not even  close. That's because most student loan debt isn't taken out to attend  undergraduate programs at public colleges and universities. Most loans  are used for private colleges, for-profit colleges, and most of all,  graduate school.''   As the column points out, that is not something that free public  undergraduate education will fix. In fact, the column notes: ``The day  after Senator Sanders `hits the reset button,' as he put it in the news  conference, the national student debt odometer would begin rapidly  spinning again.''   So what can be done to help those struggling with student loan debt?  What can we do to help while still maintaining fiscal responsibility  and preserving a respect for honoring the commitments you have made?  One Democratic Senator and I have a proposal that could definitely  help. The senior Senator from Virginia and I reintroduced our Employer  Participation in Repayment Act earlier this year. Our legislation would  amend the Educational Assistance Program to permit employers to make  tax-free payments on their employees' student loans. Right now,  employers can contribute to their employees' tuition if their employees  are currently taking classes, but they can't help employees with  education debts they have already incurred. Our bill would allow them  to help with employees' already-existing student loan debt.   This would be a win-win situation. It would be a win for employees  who would get help paying off their student loans, and it would be a  win for employers which would have a new option for attracting and  retaining talented workers. Our bill would not be a silver bullet, but  it would certainly help ease the pain of paying back student loans for  a number of young Americans.   I also look forward to seeing other efforts to help alleviate the  burden of student loan debt in a feasible and fiscally responsible way.  I know Republicans on the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions  Committee are working on legislation to make it easier to pay back  student loans.   Another big thing we can do is to make sure that graduates have  access to good-paying jobs. Thanks to Republican economic policies over  the past 2 years, our economy is thriving, good jobs are being created,  and wages are rising at the strongest pace in a decade. All of that can  go a long way toward enabling people to pay off their debt, and  Republicans are committed to building on the economic success that we  are experiencing and expanding opportunities even further.   ``Free College'' makes a great bumper sticker, but it doesn't make  very good policy. We need to address the problem of student debt  without weighing down the economy or hard-working Americans with  massive new government spending and massive new taxes. The Employer  Participation in Repayment Act is a step in the right direction, and I  hope to see it receive a vote in the very near future.
