 Mr. President, before I speak, I just want to take a  moment to speak to the gut-wrenching shooting that occurred in Maine  last night. The situation, I know, is still developing, and I am sure  there will be more to say about what the Lewiston community is going  through and what steps we, as a nation, must take to prevent gun  violence.   But even as we get more information, it is painfully clear this was a  horrific blow to a close-knit community, and I want my colleagues from  Maine and everyone in Maine to know that my heart goes out to them,  everyone who is affected by this tragedy, and I think I speak for all  of us when I say the Senate stands with both of our colleagues from  Maine.                              Amendment No. 1182    Mr. President, now to the task at hand. Last Congress, Senate and  House Committees on Appropriations leaders reinstated the practice of  congressionally directed spending--or CDS--with bipartisan support. CDS  is an important way for Senators to advocate for their States and the  communities they know best through their investments in projects to  improve transportation and drinking water infrastructure, support  workforce development programs, childcare centers, so much more.   So at the beginning of this year, the Senator from Maine and I laid  out a robust process to accept CDS requests for fiscal year 2024, and  that process included extremely important guardrails: requiring each  Senator who requested a CDS to certify neither they nor their immediate  family members have any financial interest in the project, to ensure  that each funded project is clearly identified in the reports with the  requesting Senator's name and posted on our committee website, required  Senators to publish their CDS requests on their own websites,  established an audit process with the GAO, prohibited for-profit  entities from receiving CDS funding, and established a total limit on  the amount of funding that could be dedicated to CDS in our Senate  bills.   Across the three bills in this funding package, the committee  received nearly 7,000 CDS requests from 66 Senators on both sides of  the aisle. Then our staff worked diligently to review all of those  requests to make sure they met Agency eligibility requirements and  complied with Senate rules and the additional guidelines we had set--if  the project met those requirements, eligible for funding.   We respect the projects that Senators choose to request and their  decisions on CDS priorities for their States and their constituents.  And through the CDS process, Congress is exercising our constitutional  power of the purse. After all, we all know better than anyone about the  needs of our States and our constituents.   So I oppose this amendment, and I urge my colleagues to do so as  well.
