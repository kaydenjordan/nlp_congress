 Madam Speaker, on Friday, I completed  an annual districtwide legislative agenda media tour. The issue of  greatest concern was inflation affecting everyday people and gas up 61  percent.   Bidenflation has surged to a 40-year high. It is clear that $4.5  trillion spending bills devastate pocketbooks. Even a recent analysis  from the Federal Reserve of San Francisco agrees that the relief  package has impacted inflation.   Sadly, only 17 percent of workers have received raises that have kept  up with inflation, according to the Democrat New York Times.   The Democrat elite think they are smarter than everyone and think  Democrat voters and Democrat media are ignorant to believe that  trillion-dollar spending bills cost zero dollars.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, who successfully protected  America for 20 years in the global war on terrorism, as it continues  moving from the Afghanistan safe haven to America.   Congratulations to Congressman  Mike Waltz and Dr. Julia Nesheiwat on  the birth on January 7 of Arman ``Armie'' Waltz.                            ____________________
