 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2467,  the PFAS Action Act.   PFAS compounds do not naturally break down in the environment.  Exposure to even small amounts of PFAS has been linked to diseases,  birth defects, and developmental disorders.   These chemicals have been used in consumer products for decades and  have, thus, been allowed to spread and accumulate throughout the  environment, into our air, our water, and our soils.   In my own district, PFAS has been detected in multiple drinking water  systems, which puts the health and safety of my constituents at risk.  The same can be said for millions of people in communities across the  country.   Until recently, the extent of the problem was underestimated in my  home State. With expanded testing, we now know that California is one  of the most impacted States in the country. A recent investigation by  the State Water Resources Control Board showed PFAS contamination in  almost 100 public water systems serving about 7.5 million Californians.   We need a national strategy to prevent exposure to these toxic  substances. This bill sets a deadline for the EPA to take action on  establishing standards, limits the introduction of new PFAS into  commerce and the environment, and provides support for communities to  install treatment technologies. This bill is needed both to clean up  pollution now and to prevent it from getting worse in the future.   I want to thank Representative Dingell and Representative Upton for  their leadership on H.R. 2467 and Chairman Pallone, Chairman Tonko, for  helping to move this important legislation. I also want to thank the  committee staff for their work on this bill.   I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``yes.''
