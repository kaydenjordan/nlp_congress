 Mr. Speaker, for those folks back home and the members  of the news media, when we talk about the number of illegal immigrants  coming here, they basically come in here two ways.   Either they check in with the Border Patrol, say that they are going  to show up for a hearing, eventually, to see whether they are an  appropriate subject for asylum, and then they disappear into America.  At least we know a little bit about them because they check in with the  Border Patrol.   More dangerous is what they call the got-aways who just run through  the many holes of our southern border. We have no idea who they are.  They are more dangerous because we know nothing about them.   It recently came out that there were 73,000 got-aways who entered the  country in November. That is the all-time high. As far as the last 2  years are concerned, it blew by the old all-time high by 22 percent.   I would hope that our slumbering news media would wake up and do a  story about this so the American citizens know what a rapid increase we  have of people coming into this country who don't even get the cursory  examination that people who come here seeking asylum do. So please,  news media, wake up.                            ____________________
