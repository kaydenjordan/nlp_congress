 Mr. Speaker, I rise today with an incredible amount of  pride to speak for the people of New Jersey, to speak for the heroes in  healthcare who have labored around the clock to provide the best care  in the Nation.   I rise for those workers and for the first responders who are running  out of personal protective gear.   I rise for the brave men and women who are going through these tough  times to help us: the grocery store workers, delivery people, and  volunteers bringing food to the elderly and the sick.   I rise for our manufacturers, our researchers, and our State and  local officials.   I rise for everyday families, small business owners, and laborers who  are losing their jobs and are not sure what the future holds.   I rise for everyone in my great State to tell you that, together, we  will beat this.   In Congress, I will continue to work to get you the relief you need.  In this Nation, we, as a people, have always come together in a crisis,  and I have seen firsthand that this time is no different.   I rise today to ask that God bless this House, God bless the State of  New Jersey, and God bless the United States of America.
