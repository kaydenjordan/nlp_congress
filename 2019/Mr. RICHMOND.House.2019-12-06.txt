 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding.   Let me just pick up where they left off. Whether it is a  reauthorization, whether it is a restoration, it does not matter. What  this is, is fixing the stain on America that prohibited and stopped  African Americans and other minorities from voting.   I rise today torn because, on the one hand, I am elated that this  House is finally moving H.R. 4 so that we can protect the right to  vote, but on the other hand, I am disappointed because we have to do it  by ourselves, that this is not a bipartisan effort to ensure the  precious right to vote.   Many people may say that it is a burden on the States. What about the  burden that the States put on us?   In the spirit of Goodman, Chaney, and Schwerner, who were killed so  that I could vote, and   John Lewis and others who crossed the Edmund  Pettus Bridge, who were beaten so that I can vote, Mr. Speaker, I rise  today to ask for everyone to support H.R. 4. We should join hands and  do it together.
