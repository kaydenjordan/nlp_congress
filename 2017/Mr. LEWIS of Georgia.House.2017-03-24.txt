 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to oppose this bill.   As elected Representatives, we have a mission, an obligation, and a  mandate to fight for each and every American.  [[Page H2427]]    I ask you, Mr. Speaker: Who will stand for the American people? Who  will speak up for those who have been left out and left behind?   Mr. Speaker, I have said it time and time again: Health care is a  right. It is not a privilege reserved for a wealthy few, for what does  it profit this body to pass this bill and lose our soul?   This bill is a shame. It is a disgrace.   Mr. Speaker, today my heart breaks for the disabled, for women, for  seniors, and for working families. My heart aches for those who are  living paycheck to paycheck. My heart mourns for innocent little  children whose very lives depend on if their families can pay the  bills.   This is the right and wrong of it. This is the heart and soul of the  matter.   We cannot abandon our principles, Mr. Speaker. We cannot forget our  values. I have fought too hard and too long to back down now.   I will fight any bill that turns the clock back to a darker time. I  will fight every single attempt to turn a deaf ear, a blind eye, and a  cold shoulder to the sick, to our seniors, and to working families.   Mr. Speaker, I will fight every day, every hour, every minute, and  every second. I oppose this bill with every breath and every bone in my  body. We must not give up. We cannot--I will not--give in, not today,  not tomorrow, not never, ever.   On this bill, there is only one option, and that option is to vote  ``no.'' We can do better. Mr. Speaker, we must do better. Vote ``no''  on this bill.
