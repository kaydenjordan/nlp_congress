 Mr. Speaker, I thank my chairman.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this bill sponsored by my  friend, Representative Sean Duffy.   He has worked tirelessly in crafting a solution here, along with  Representative Luetkemeyer, Representative Ross, and our full committee  chairman, Mr. Hensarling.   While the National Flood Insurance Program provides needed insurance  coverage, it has numerous problems as currently constructed, and the  21st Century Flood Reform Act seeks to implement much-needed reforms in  this program.  [[Page H9230]]    In addition to reauthorizing the flood program for 5 years, this bill  provides increased transparency to the public, provides more  information to people living in harm's way about past damages and the  risk of flooding, ensures mapping is timely and accurate, ties rates to  risk, gives consumers greater choice in flood insurance options, and  incentivizes mitigation and risk reduction.   Currently, in Arkansas, we have one private insurer that offers flood  insurance. A second underwriter is near approval by our Insurance  Commissioner Allen Kerr.   The benefits to the consumer through private insurance are  significant, as noted by the Milliman study.   For example, one private insurer in Arkansas covers up to $2 million  in coverage per occurrence, Mr. Speaker, as opposed to the NFIP, which  limits coverage to $250,000, across all rating categories at premiums  substantially below the NFIP.   Further, this private insurer can offer replacement value,  reimbursement for living expenses if an individual or family is  displaced by a flood. The NFIP does not.   For almost 50 years, the experiment in government-provided flood  insurance has proven to be ineffective, inefficient, and indisputably  costly to hardworking taxpayers. The time for action is now.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record USA Today, Washington Post,  Washington Times, and Chicago Tribune articles.                    [From the USA Today, Sept. 7, 2017]                  Make Flood Insurance Reflect Actual Risk   after hurricanes, taxpayers can't absorb ever increasing tabs: Our view         In 1968, in the wake of Hurricane Betsy, Congress decided       it had enough. Flooding was destroying too many homes,       leaving financial and physical devastation in its wake.        So lawmakers created the National Flood Insurance Program,       a government-run insurance fund for homeowners in flood-prone       areas.        And that's when things got really bad.        The NFIP has been losing money ever since. The program is       nearly $25 billion in the red and is running annual deficits       in the range of $1.4 billion. That's because it's a creation       of Congress and therefore sets its premiums according to what       is politically convenient rather than what is actuarially       sound.        With Hurricane Harvey devastating the Houston area, and       Hurricane Irma bearing down on the Southeast coast, the       program is certain to take a massive loss this year.        What's worse, the NFIP's woes are self-generating. Because       the premiums are well below what should be charged, this       effectively subsidizes construction in flood-prone areas. And       that means its losses grow as more flood-prone land is       developed.        Hurricane Katrina, which ravaged the Gulf Coast in 2005,       exposed just how costly and counterproductive the program had       become. In 2012, after years of debate, Congress enacted a       law that made flood insurance rates more reflective of actual       risks and expanded the areas considered flood-prone.        This generated Category 3 blowback from homeowners and the       real estate lobby, and in 2014 Congress passed another law       undoing much of the first.        Now, with catastrophic losses mounting and sea levels       rising, it's time to revisit the issue.        Making federal flood insurance more reflective of reality       would only go so far in dealing with the problem of building       in flood-prone areas. That's because many homeowners don't       have flood insurance and because much of the damage that the       government eventually pays for is not covered by the program.       (Private insurance typically covers damage from wind but not       water.)        With Katrina, for instance, the flood insurance payout was       $16.3 billion. But Congress passed supplementary spending of       more than $100 billion to provide intensive relief and       temporary housing, as well as fix broken levies.        With Harvey and Irma, the federal tab beyond of flood       insurance is likely to be even higher. Only an estimated 20%       of homeowners in the area affected by Harvey even bothered       with flood insurance, a number that has been dropping in       recent years. But making flood insurance reflect actual risks       is a vital first step in coming to grips with reality.        In the past several decades, Americans have flocked to       coastal communities, many of them in parts of the country       prone to hurricanes. With the hit to taxpayers growing and       the danger increasing, restraint--even some reversal--of this       trend is needed.        While people in the hurricane zones deserve disaster       assistance and the nation's sympathy, taxpayers can't simply       absorb ever increasing tabs for flood losses. The government       needs policies that encourage people to build their homes in       safer places. Harvey and Irma are just the latest sobering       wake-up calls with that message.                                   ____                  [From the Washington Post, Aug. 30, 2017]                 After Harvey, Flood Insurance Needs Reform         Congress must be generous in helping to repair the damage,       to lives and to property, from Hurricane Harvey. The full       extent of the destruction may not be known for a long time       but is evidently catastrophic, just as the damage wrought by       Katrina and Sandy was. Even as they demonstrate that they       have a heart, lawmakers must also show that they have some       brains. Specifically, the United States is long overdue for       smart reforms to one of the major government institutions       designed to help people cope with the risk of natural       disaster: the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), which       has underwritten a total of 5 million policies providing       homeowners and some businesses $1.2 trillion in coverage.        Now almost half a century old, the NFIP grew out of what       was, at the time, a basic reality of the insurance business:       Flooding risks were actuarially imponderable, so insuring       against them was uneconomic for the private sector,       especially in places such as the hurricane-prone Gulf of       Mexico. To fill the gap, the federal government offered       coverage on two conditions: that local communities would take       appropriate land-use and other measures to prevent       development in risky low-lying areas; and that homeowners       would pay actuarially sound premiums.        Elegant in theory, the plan gradually succumbed to real       estate interests, with the result that flood insurance       enabled rather than managed development along coasts and in       other flood-prone areas--ultimately putting more people and       property at risk than might otherwise have been the case. As       it happens, well-to-do people benefit disproportionately from       this program; they're the ones who tend to build big houses       on the beach. The NFIP has spent many millions of dollars to       repair properties that have been repeatedly flooded.        Prior to Katrina, the NFIP was nevertheless generally able       to pay for coverage through the premiums it collected.       Massive losses from that storm and Sandy, however, have       driven it into de facto bankruptcy; the program has been       forced to borrow more than $24 billion from the treasury to       pay claims, a debt that was nearly unpayable even before       Harvey hit. At the moment, the program has $1.7 billion on       hand, plus $5.8 billion left on its line of credit with the       Treasury--and some 373,000 policyholders in the Harvey flood       zone who will expect to get paid.        Coincidentally, the program is due for reauthorization on       Sept. 30. Ideally, this deadline would galvanize Congress to       ensure enough money is available to pay current commitments,       while reforming NFIP for the future. What's needed are       tougher flood-risk mitigation requirements, more realistic       premiums and encouragement for private-sector involvement in       the business, based on modern technology that may enable       insurance companies to underwrite risks they could not have       underwritten in the 1960s.        Recent history, alas, doesn't make us optimistic: Congress       did reform the program on a bipartisan basis in 2012, only to       see much of that undone under pressure from coastal-state       lawmakers in 2014, after Sandy. ``There is a tide in the       affairs of men, which taken at the flood, leads on to       fortune,'' Shakespeare wrote. Congress, though, tends to go       with the political flow.                                   ____                  [From the Washington Times, Sept. 6, 2017]                  Fixing Flood Insurance in Harvey's Wake            private insurers could help in matching cost and risk         Hurricane Harvey took the most devastating flooding in the       city's history to Houston, and the cost of repairing the       damage will be astronomical. Sadly, the federal flood       insurance program is already underwater and Harvey will only       add to the flood of red ink. It's clear that Congress must       reform the program so the premiums property owners pay more       closely reflect the flood risk. Until that happens, nature's       frequent fury will continue to undermine the finances of       everyone.        With the angry water from the Category 4 hurricane damaging       200,000 Houston-area homes and business firms, early       estimates place the cost of restoration as high as $190       billion. That would eclipse the $108 billion loss in the 2005       Hurricane Katrina and Superstorm Sandy in 2012. President       Trump expects Congress to quickly approve a $7.9 billion down       payment for emergency relief.        The National Flood Insurance Program, designed to wield the       financial muscle of the federal government to protect flood-      prone property, has proved to be a money sieve. It covers       about 5 million flood-prone properties nationwide, worth       about $1.2 trillion, and collects about $3.5 billion annually       in premiums. The program was $25 billion in the red before       Harvey hit--a clear indicator that overall, property owners       who are required to carry flood insurance are not paying for       the risk.        Among the existing program's shortcomings are its policy of       grandfathering older structures built in low-lying regions       before accurate floodplain mapping began, encouraging owners       to renovate rather than demolish. Between 1978 and 2004,       these risky properties comprised 1 percent of the program's       insured properties but accounted for 38 percent of the damage       claims, according to the Government Accountability Office.       The federal program is subsidizing insurance  [[Page H9231]]       for expensive waterfront property along the Southeastern       coastline, favoring the wealthiest homeowners.        Congress has made several attempts to put the insurance on       a sustainable financial footing, without success. The program       will expire at the end of this month, which offers       legislators an opportunity to resolve the unintended       consequences of the program.        Several constructive bills were reported out of the House       Financial Services Committee in June. Among the proposals are       provisions giving more leeway to private insurers who       currently offer only federally approved policies. Doing so       would allow insurers to set premiums tailored to individual       properties, resulting in a closer match of insurance cost and       flood risk. Other provisions would limit claim payments for       repeatedly flooded properties and require the use of       replacement cost in setting insurance rates.        The House is seeking a five-year reauthorization of the       National Flood Insurance Program and the Senate version calls       for a 10-year term to ensure continuity. Both versions back       provisions to allow a gradual increase of private-sector       involvement in flood insurance. It's an idea endorsed by the       free-market Cato Institute, which says ``the ideal `reform'       to the [program] would be to fully privatize flood insurance.       That would be more likely to fix the system in a way that       would limit the long-run government liability than any       alternative legislative approach.'' Allowing private insurers       to have a larger role in future flood protection is sensible.        No one could have foreseen the once-in-a-lifetime deluge       that swamped Houston, but actuaries make their bones       calculating risk, including in their calculations such       unpredictable natural disasters as tornadoes and earthquakes.       Insurance premiums undistorted by Washington rules would give       consumers a clearer picture of flood hazards, helping them       avoid the mistake of building in the path of storms like       Hurricane Harvey. With monster storm Irma bearing down on       Florida, the need is urgent for Congress to safeguard       Americans from future property loss and new heartbreak.                                   ____                  [From the Chicago Tribune, Sept. 7, 2017]            The Folly of Paying Americans To Live in Harm's Way         In the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey's hit on Texas, and       with Hurricane Irma threatening Florida, let's all       acknowledge one reason for the vulnerability of Americans who       live in low-lying coastal regions of the Sun Belt: The       federal government has been paying people to locate there.        Not explicitly, of course. But an abundance of inexpensive       housing is a big attraction. And a big factor in the low cost       of housing in the Houston area is that developers are free to       build almost anywhere, including marshy, low-lying areas       where land is cheap.        The chance of being swamped deters some people, but the       government offers flood insurance to pay for repairing and       rebuilding. The owners of a Houston home that flooded 16       times in 18 years got more than $800,000 in payments--for a       house worth just $115,000.        The folly of the government's flood insurance program has       been evident for decades, and some Midwestern communities       have been in on the action. We've written about how federal       flood insurance has serially benefited many of those who       refuse to move from river flood plains, sometimes to a fault.       After the Mississippi River flood of 1993, one Grafton, Ill.,       resident explained to a reporter that he had collected       $24,000 in federal insurance for damage to his small house       from floods in 1979, 1982, 1986 and 1992. For '93, he       expected an additional $32,000. His total insurance premiums       since buying the house in 1975: $6,000.        Houston, according to a new study by the National Wildlife       Federation, accounts for more than half of all the properties       that are flooded and paid for over and over. It has ``managed       to host three `500-year floods' in the past three years,''       notes Michael Grunwald of Politico. Each one costs taxpayers       large sums. Yet development in these precarious spots       continues apace.        ``Why are we writing flood insurance (policies) for new       construction in flood zones?'' asks Craig Fugate, who headed       the Federal Emergency Management Agency in the Obama       administration. ``Think about it: If you're going to build a       new structure in the flood zone, the private sector can       insure it. And if they can't insure it, then why is the       public subsidizing the risk?''        It's a big subsidy. Thanks to past storms, the flood       insurance program has a $25 billion deficit. The       Congressional Budget Office found that coastal counties at       risk from tropical storms make up just 10 percent of all the       counties with federal flood insurance policies--but generate       75 percent of the claims and most of the deficit.        So why is the public subsidizing the risk in these places?       Because the people living there, the politicians they elect,       the businesses they patronize and various interest groups       (such as homebuilders and the real estate industry) have       strong stakes in preserving this program. They've been able       to prevent the sort of reforms needed to make it actuarially       sounder and closer to self-sustaining.        In 2012, Congress passed a modest package of sensible       changes that would have raised costs to the flood-prone. But       two years later, feeling the political heat, lawmakers       backtracked.        Homeowners located in areas that are expected to flood       every 100 years are required to buy flood insurance if they       want federally insured mortgages. But they pay rates far       lower than the risks warrant.        That gap deprives builders of incentives to stay out of       low-lying areas that are vulnerable to flooding--or to       elevate structures to keep them dry when the waters rise. It       also promotes the destruction of wetlands that could reduce       flooding. Oh, and it helps to tilt migration toward       vulnerable coastal regions like those of Texas and Florida.                                   ____
