 Mr. Speaker, this coming Sunday marks  the 26th anniversary of the House of Representatives passing the North  American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA.   This agreement with our two closest trading partners, Canada and  Mexico, has become outdated as time has passed, markets have  diversified, and economies have flourished. We are in desperate need of  updating NAFTA to meet modern-day economic demands.   I know many of us have staff who are younger than NAFTA, and we can  all agree that the world has changed an awful lot in the last three  decades. Congress needs to bring the United States-Mexico-Canada trade  agreement, or USMCA, to a vote immediately to keep trade free and fair.  A vote on USMCA is long overdue.   It has been more than 400 days since President Trump announced this  historic agreement, and Mexico and Canada have already given USMCA the  green light. For farmers, ranchers, manufacturers, and everyone in  between, we must follow suit. So many different industries can benefit  from a modern trade agreement.   In Pennsylvania, nearly 43,000 jobs depend on manufacturing exports  to Canada and Mexico. Last year alone, Pennsylvania exported $15  billion worth of products to Canada and Mexico.   There is no telling what economic potential lies ahead with a new  revamped trade agreement.   In Pennsylvania, agriculture--and dairy, in particular--is the  backbone of the Commonwealth's economy. USMCA's elimination of Canada's  Class 6 and Class 7 dairy pricing programs would be a big win for dairy  farm families. These programs have unfairly limited our export  potential over the years.   The signing of USMCA into law will also signal to other major trade  partners, like China and Japan, that we are serious about these kinds  of deals and we are committed to a bright future for American exports.   There is no reason why we cannot pass USMCA before the end of the  year. USMCA will create more jobs, boost wages, and spur the Nation's  economy.   What are we waiting for? Each day that passes without a vote is a  missed opportunity. Let's get to work and hold a vote immediately.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule  I, I demand a vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the  Journal.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on  the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order  that a quorum is not present.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight  the unfortunate position this institution has been placed in over the  past several weeks. Long before Speaker Pelosi launched this  impeachment inquiry, many of my colleagues had already made it clear  that their number one priority was impeaching the President.   Congress should rightfully use its oversight powers to ensure laws  are executed faithfully, but this exercise has shown itself to be the  ultimate manipulation of the legislative branch's oversight to achieve  political gains.   I caution my colleagues from placing political expediency ahead of  moderation. A vote for impeachment will forever change this  institution. Imagine a future where this body utilizes the most severe  of its constitutional tools to continually put the minority party on  trial.   Mr. Speaker, the American people have elected their representatives  to be their voice and vote on matters most important to this country.  We must collectively focus on these issues, not the political impulses  of a few.   For the sake of this institution, and for the good of the Nation,  this cannot become the new normal.                            ____________________
