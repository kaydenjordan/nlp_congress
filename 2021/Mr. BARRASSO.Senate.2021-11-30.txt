 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I come to the floor today to talk about  the need for more American energy, not energy that the President is  begging to OPEC or Russia to produce for America but American energy.   Last week, President Biden ordered the release of oil from the  Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The President, by doing that, in my  opinion, is just pretending to show concern about the high cost of  energy in this country. I will get into why I think he is only  pretending to show it because the amount he released is so very little.  In reality, this President's call to release energy oil from the  Strategic Petroleum Reserve was an admission of failure of this  President and this administration.   Releasing oil from the Reserve is something that Presidents did in  the past during times of war, the Iraq war, after Hurricane Katrina,  and during the Arab Spring. In other words, it is something Presidents  do in times of crisis.   Well, President Biden doesn't want to admit that he has created an  emergency crisis in our country, but his actions of calling on the  release from the Strategic Reserve--the actions speak louder than his  words. By releasing oil from the Reserve now, the President is  admitting what every American knows, that America has an energy crisis  and it is not for lack of the fact that we have plenty of energy  reserves here in the United States.   Last week, an estimated 50 million people over Thanksgiving weekend  took to the roads. Those who drove paid the most for gasoline that they  have in 7 years. Gasoline and diesel fuel prices are sky-high, and they  have increased more than a dollar a gallon since Joe Biden took office  just in January.   Why is it happening? Well, it is economics 101, really. You have  demand; you have supply. Demand is up; supply is down. With the end of  the lockdown, demand for gasoline has increased as people took to the  roads. Yet domestic supply is still below the peak that we reached  under President Trump.   The Biden administration wants us to believe that releasing oil will  solve the problem when he taps the Strategic Reserve, but I don't even  think President Biden believes it. I am not sure they actually know  what they are doing. If you watched that press conference with the  Secretary of Energy last week, she was asked how much oil the American  people use. She admitted she didn't know. She said: I don't have a  number in front of me. She didn't  [[Page S8832]]  know how much oil, how much energy Americans use. The Nation's top  energy official doesn't know how much oil the American people use so  how can she then know that the amount to call for the release is the  right amount or not? She is President Biden's top lieutenant in the war  on American energy. She doesn't know how much we use.   Well, the media has broadly reported that the total amount that Joe  Biden is releasing from the Petroleum Reserve is what the American  people use every 2\1/2\ days--every 2\1/2\ days. That is the total  amount that is being released. It is the amount that we in the United  States use every 2\1/2\ days. This is a drop in the bucket when it  comes to oil prices and energy prices and what people are paying at the  pump.   It is not a long-term solution. It is not even a short-term solution.  It is just a carefully created sound bite. Oil production is down by  nearly 2 million barrels a day compared to the peak under President  Trump. It is not a surprise when you take a look at the attack on  American energy that President Biden and this administration have  continued to do since day 1, when he killed the Keystone XL Pipeline.   The administration also announced last week, without any fanfare,  without the President making a statement at the White House--the  Department of the Interior said: Oh, by the way, American people, we  are going to do this the day after Thanksgiving, when you are busy  doing other things, maybe going shopping, doing other things and not  paying attention to the news of the day. This administration called for  additional fees, more taxes, more expenses on oil and gas leases on  Federal land. That impacts my State dramatically. This is in addition  to the fees that the President is also including in this massive tax- and-spending bill that the Senate is going to be considering.   This is also economics 101. Higher fees on the cost of producing oil  means higher prices for people at the pump--astonishing--making it  harder to produce and more expensive to produce American energy.  Begging OPEC and Russia to produce more to sell to us is a jackpot for  Vladimir Putin. So if President Biden and his Department of the  Interior get their way, the prices will go up even higher. Inflation is  here to stay under the Democrats.   The American people deserve better. They deserve real solutions in  this energy crisis that this administration has created. Higher fees  are only going to get passed on to consumers. Instead of spending our  savings, we should be producing more American energy. Why are we  sending this money to Vladimir Putin and begging him to produce more so  we can send him even more money? That is the policy of this  administration.   Today, I am introducing legislation that says an administration needs  to develop a plan to increase oil and gas production anytime an  administration taps the Reserve unless there is an energy supply  emergency like Katrina, like a war. Those are the things that are  legitimate reasons to release energy from the Strategic Reserve. The  Reserve is for emergencies, not for sound bites. It is not supposed to  be a bandaid for bad policies.   If the President is tapping the Reserve, he also ought to increase  American energy production. So I urge my colleagues to return to the  policies that gave us the best economic times in my lifetime, return to  the policies that made us energy-independent as a nation for the first  time in 70 years, return to the policies that made us the No. 1  producer of petroleum in the world. We are much stronger and better as  a nation if we are selling American energy to our friends than if we  have to buy it from our enemies. Apparently, the President does not  fully grasp that or believe in that or he would not be begging Vladimir  Putin to produce more energy; he would be encouraging America to  produce more energy, which we have here.   It is time to stop the restrictions on energy production, time to  stop the rush to raise billions in taxes, time to stop the President  and the Democrats' declared war on American energy.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I come to the floor today to talk about  the need for more American energy, not energy that the President is  begging to OPEC or Russia to produce for America but American energy.
