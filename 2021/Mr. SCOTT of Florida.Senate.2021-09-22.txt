 I yield the floor.    Mr. President, currently, America's debt is  barreling toward $30 trillion. This $30 trillion is hard to imagine. So  think about it this way: That is more than $233,000 of debt for every  American family.   On July 31, the suspension on the Federal debt limit expired, and now  the Democrats in Congress, who continue to pursue a purely partisan,  reckless tax-and-spending spree, are pushing this as a decision point  with only two options: to vote to suspend the debt limit or increase it  with no reforms to control excess Federal spending. They want us to  write the government a blank check to spend more money that we don't  have. The Republicans have been clear: We will not do it.   Now, my Democratic colleagues will say that the debt ceiling  shouldn't be a partisan issue, and I completely agree,  [[Page S6627]]  but what we have seen from the Democrats this year has been purely  partisan even by Washington's broken standards.   First, they passed a nearly $2 trillion so-called COVID bill that  spent less than 10 percent of its funding on actually fighting COVID,  without any Republican votes, and now they are pushing forward a $5.5  trillion reckless tax-and-spending spree--again, without a single  Republican vote. This insane Democratic spending means we are on the  dangerous path of reaching $45 trillion in Federal debt by 2031. That  is not my number. That is what the Democrats' own bill says. The  Democrats' own projections have their reckless spending taking the U.S.  debt to $45 trillion in the next 10 years.   There are major consequences to this financial irresponsibility. Like  any borrower, the Federal Government pays interest on its debt. When  you rack up nearly $30 trillion in debt, that means hundreds of  billions of dollars in interest. Who pays for it? The taxpayers. Right  now, even with interest rates at historic lows, the U.S. Government is  already spending nearly $345 billion yearly on interest. Instead of  funding important infrastructure, defense, or the environment, nearly  $345 billion in hard-earned tax dollars is just paying interest which  provides zero return for American families. Just imagine how much that  will grow when the U.S. reaches $45 trillion in debt. And when interest  rates return to normal levels, things will get even worse.   Let's look at this.   Right now, about 11 percent of what we are going to collect this year  will go to pay the interest. There is no return for taxpayers on this  interest. Let's look at what is going to happen by 2031, and this is  the Democrats' budget: 23 percent of total Federal receipts will go  toward paying the interest. Now, that is assuming that interest rates  stay low. Why would we believe that interest rates are going to stay  low? Let's just look. We are having unbelievable inflation right now.  When inflation goes up, interest rates typically follow. Assuming we  have low interest rates stay low, like the Democrats do, we could be  spending over $1 trillion on just interest by 2031. Imagine, if  interest rates return to historical averages, our payments will be  astronomical. The Federal Government brings in less than $4 trillion in  revenues. So we will be spending roughly a quarter of all tax revenue  on interest that does nothing--nothing--for taxpayers.   How can Congress justify that?   It is clear: Democratic spending has caused this massive Democratic  debt, and it is time for liberals in Washington to own the debt crisis  they have created.   Republicans have been clear: We won't stand for it. We won't vote to  bail out the Democrats' out-of-control spending. We won't cut radical  liberals in Congress more blank checks to bury our country in more  debt, to drive up America's interest expense, and to fuel an already  raging inflation crisis, hurting families across my State and across  this country.   Just last week, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the  Consumer Price Index was up 5.3 percent in 1 year--from August to  August, 5.3 percent. Year-over-year comparisons show that inflation has  gone up each month of Biden's Presidency. Government doesn't feel the  Biden inflation, but everyday Americans do.   I am hearing from families all across my State--a father of three in  Jacksonville, a mother of four in Wauchula--and small businesses in  Miami. Another family in Kissimmee told us about how hard it is to keep  food on the table because everything is getting so expensive. They are  having trouble keeping their car because of the cost of maintenance and  gas. Of course, without a car, they won't have a way to get to work and  provide for their family.   It is heartbreaking to hear these stories. I can relate to this. I  grew up in a poor family. My mom would take in ironing for extra money.  She would give us exact change to go to the grocery store, and if the  price of something went up, we just simply couldn't get it.   In the face of this hardship felt by so many families in Florida and  across this great Nation, President Biden and Democrats here in  Congress have zero interest in reducing the national debt and cutting  their insane spending. Democrats have shown a heartless disregard for  the struggles so many families in Florida and across America are  dealing with right now.   It is time we bring accountability to Federal spending. Unlike our  Democratic colleagues, Republicans have a solution-focused approach to  fixing America's debt crisis. We know that the Federal Government can  and must pursue practical measures to make it easy and relatively  painless to cut spending. We can start that right now.   Earlier this year, I introduced the Federal Debt Emergency Control  Act, which prevents Washington from mindlessly spending by requiring  that two-thirds of the Senate vote to increase the debt before  approving any bill with deficit spending, terminating any unobligated  funding from the stimulus bills and sending it back to the Treasury  General Fund for deficit reduction, and fast-tracking any bill reducing  the debt by at least 5 percent over 10 years.   Today, I am joining my friend Senator Pat Toomey to reintroduce the  Full Faith and Credit Act. This bill ensures that the U.S. Government  does not default on its debt while also prioritizing certain payments  to our seniors, military, and veterans.   It is commonsense policy like this that will move the United States  forward and out of the massive debt crisis we are clearly already in. I  welcome all fiscally responsible colleagues to join me to say: We don't  accept the status quo. We won't watch in silence as Democrats try to  spend us into oblivion. We can get spending under control.   While I was Governor of Florida, we paid down one-third of State debt  by living within our means, all while cutting taxes. We can do it here.  We have to start acting responsibly, and the time to do that is now.   Politicians in Washington want you to think this is so complicated.  They want you to think that dysfunction is inevitable. That is a lie.  It is a lie that a broken system and failed politicians up here have  been telling you for decades, and it is time for that to end.   Getting America back on track is simple. It starts with passing  commonsense reforms that rein in reckless spending, stop Congress from  getting paid when it shuts down the government, and force Congress to  stay in session until it passes a balanced budget. We keep our Nation  on the right financial path by making sure Congress is constantly held  accountable for its spending of taxpayer money. It is taxpayer money,  every dollar of it.   It is time to stand up for those on fixed incomes and, of course,  families whose income can't keep up with inflation. It is time to stand  up for our grandkids, whose futures are being mortgaged by out-of- control Washington spending.   This isn't political. It is good government, and it is common sense.  The longer we ignore the debt problem, the worse it will become not  just for us but for future generations.   A debt crisis is here today. It will be American families who feel  the effects of their government's lack of fiscal responsibility through  inflation, higher costs, and rising taxes. That is not the America  anyone wants. American families deserve better. Through smart  legislation and responsible choices, we can be truly accountable to the  American people and bring some stability back to the Federal  Government's bank account.                            ____________________
