 Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I rise in support of my bipartisan  amendment to H.R. 6147, the Interior Appropriations Act, which I am  proud to introduce with my friend and colleague from Michigan,  Congressman  John Moolenaar.   Our amendment would provide funding to continue and advance the great  science that is being done in the U.S. Geological Survey's Fisheries  Program. We need more research to protect important ecosystems, like  the Great Lakes, from invasive species and better understand how to  conserve and protect important fishery resources.   The Great Lakes Science Center, which is strategically located near  access fishery resources in communities across the eight Great Lakes  States, would be an appropriate recipient of these additional  resources.   The Great Lakes are a way of life for so many across Michigan and  many other States, including agriculture, commercial and sport fishing,  transportation, shipping, power generation, recreation, and tourism.   Whether you live, work, or vacation on the Great Lakes, we all  benefit in preserving and conserving the Great Lakes for future  generations.   The Great Lakes Science Center would be able to adopt cutting-edge  technologies to support fisheries management, native prey fish  restoration, and invasive species control by deploying autonomous  underwater systems to assess impacts of bottom-dwelling invasive  species on economically important fisheries and recreational resources.   The Science Center would continue to do their work on piloting gene  silencing techniques to control zebra and quagga mussels in lakes and  rivers with nationwide applications.   Fisheries science has been broadly recognized as a national and  regional priority for many years, and nearly every action in the past  has been to either maintain or increase the funding for the USGS  fisheries assessments in the Great Lakes.   The Great Lakes Fishery Program also has enjoyed long bipartisan  support from Congress.                                time  2045    The Great Lakes are a treasured national resource, with more than 20  percent of the world's freshwater, 9,000 miles of shoreline, and  supporting a $16 billion outdoor recreation economy.   It is critical we maintain funding to continue the United States  Geological Survey's research and to enhance exploration in cutting-edge  technologies to support fisheries management, native prey fish  restoration, and invasive species control that is being done at the  Great Lakes Science Center.   Madam Chair, I urge all of my colleagues to support this important  bipartisan amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I thank the chairman and I thank the  ranking member, Representative McCollum, who shares the love of the  Great Lakes with me.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
