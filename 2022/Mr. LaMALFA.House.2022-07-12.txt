 Mr. Speaker, our Strategic Petroleum Reserve is meant to  be preserved for an actual emergency, such as in the case of  catastrophic weather or in times of war. But President Biden has  started the largest ever loan from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.   From that loan, we have seen he has shipped 5 million barrels of oil,  not for lowering the prices, as they thought that putting some of that  oil on the market might affect the price. No, they are actually  shipping it to foreign countries, including China. A million barrels of  oil is allegedly going to China out of our Strategic Petroleum Reserve,  which is supposed to be for us in case of emergency, not playing  markets, not trying to make some money.   It is unreal. Since day one, President Biden walked into office and  started shutting down our energy industry, the pipeline, exploration  permits and leases. They have gone this direction.   That makes our fuel more expensive for everybody on the whole supply  chain: Farmers, manufacturers, people taking their kids to school,  people going to the store. It is hurting everybody.   They are sending it now to China.   Whose side is President Biden on?                            ____________________
