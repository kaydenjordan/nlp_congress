Madam President, I rise today to speak on a matter of  great importance to the foreign policy of this country: our  relationship with Russia and the efficacy of international sanctions to  achieve our international security goals.   The reports of the past 24 hours are extremely troubling. But one  thing we now all agree on is that Russia is behind the hacking of our  election, as even the President-elect has now just said. This makes it  even more important that we not only keep the existing sanctions in  place but that we institute a new, tough sanctions regime in response  so Russia can't get away with what they did and other countries will  know as well that they will suffer penalty if they try to interfere  with our elections.   Unfortunately, this morning's Cabinet hearing on Mr. Tillerson's  nomination is a very troubling sign of things to come. In one breath,  Mr. Tillerson said that the invasion of Crimea is a violation of  international law, and in the next, amazingly enough, he declined to  commit to maintaining the existing sanctions regime against Russia. He  said he wants to get classified briefings first and then consult with  the President-elect. But I remind the  [[Page S224]]  country, as my friend the Senator from Florida, Mr. Rubio, from across  the aisle, did, that these sanctions are a result of past crimes.   We don't need a classified briefing to know what Russia has done in  the past. To duck the question and to refuse to commit to continuing  these sanctions is tantamount to sweeping Russia's flouting of  international laws under the rug. It sort of says: Go ahead, interfere  in our elections again; nothing will happen to you. It says the same to  China and Iran or to any other country that might try to hack.   Secretary Nominee Tillerson has also not committed to new sanctions.  Just yesterday, a bipartisan group of Senators, including the Senators  from South Carolina, Maryland, Florida, California, Nebraska,  introduced a tough, new sanctions-on-Russia bill for their interference  in our elections. I support this effort. I believe the Senate should  act soon upon it. I am very concerned that thus far the President- elect, Mr. Tillerson, and Senator Sessions have not endorsed these  tough new sanctions.   The Senator from Florida--not from my party--also pressed Mr.  Tillerson on a series of war crimes committed by the Assad regime and  the Russian military in Syria. These crimes have been reported in the  press and detailed extensively by people on the ground and discussed at  length by my friend, the Republican Senator from Arizona, Mr. McCain.  Mr. Tillerson will not even acknowledge these violations of human  rights and war crimes.   Finally, I am very concerned that despite the fact that we have  registered lobbying disclosures from ExxonMobil itself, documenting  their involvement in lobbying against Iran sanctions, Mr. Tillerson  said this morning that Exxon did not lobby on sanctions, to his  knowledge.   This comes on top of recent reports that Exxon avoided Iran's  sanctions by dealing with Iran and other state sponsors of terrorism  through a European subsidiary. This, too, is very concerning. It raises  real questions as to whether the President-elect and his Cabinet are  prepared to stand up to Putin, stand up to Iran, and represent the  interests of the American people and defend our democratic allies  around the world.   My friends on the other side of the aisle have nearly universally  criticized this President, Mr. Obama, for his policy on Syria and for  not being tough enough on Vladimir Putin. Republicans have always  called themselves the party of Reagan. I don't need to remind any of  them of his famous speech in West Berlin. Now, it seems, this  fundamental tenet of Republican foreign policy, and indeed our national  policy for the last few decades, is eroding before our very eyes. Now,  it seems, the President-elect and his Cabinet may never address the  international security policy challenges posed by Russia and state  sponsors of terrorism like Iran and Syria. If Mr. Tillerson cannot even  say that he will support the existing sanctions, what kind of Secretary  of State will he be? I am worried.   Madam President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

First, Mr. President, let me thank my dear friend and  colleague from New York, not only for her  [[Page S229]]  great remarks today and her amendment but for her passion,  intelligence, and success in fighting for equality for women. I very  much appreciate those efforts.          Senator Booker's Testimony Before the Judiciary Committee    Right now Senator Booker, my friend from New Jersey, is beginning his  testimony before the Judiciary Committee. Senator Booker sought to  testify before this panel, and it was unprecedented. My friend Senator  Booker is a leading voice, not just in this caucus but in this body, on  civil rights and so many other issues. He speaks with a passion and  eloquence and intelligence on these topics and with a knowledge and  depth from which we all benefit.   I regret that a sitting U.S. Senator has to fight to earn the right  to speak at the Judiciary hearing on Thursday, and I regret the manner  in which he was treated--he and his colleagues from the House--being  placed on the last panel today. Traditionally, Senators want to speak  early on. That was the case, and I am glad he is testifying.   He is speaking right now, and I would urge my colleagues and all of  America to tune in and watch because what Senator Booker has to say  will be very important for all of us to hear.   I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, I wish to speak briefly and pointedly  about the budget resolution before us which will, at some late hour,  culminate in a final vote. Whether that vote is tonight or in the dark  hours of early morning, with it, Republicans are taking their first  step into a box canyon.   Now, I hear my Republican colleagues talking more and more about  doing repeal and replace together, but let me be very clear. This  budget resolution is not repeal and replace. It is one thing and one  thing only: the first step of repealing the Affordable Care Act,  ripping health care away from tens of millions of Americans, and  throwing our health care system into chaos. It will, as many have  repeated across the land over the last few weeks, make America sick  again.   Over the past few weeks, this fact has made some of my more  thoughtful colleagues nervous. I understand that. I would be nervous if  I were them too. My friends, the Senators from Maine, Arkansas,  Tennessee, and Kentucky, have all quite forcefully voiced their concern  with repealing health care reform without a scrap of a plan of what to  do next.   Now the President-elect has tweeted that they should do repeal and  replace at the same time. Today he said Republicans would repeal and  replace the law essentially simultaneously, but that is not what this  budget resolution would do.   We are here because the Republicans are flummoxed. It is a bit like  an  [[Page S248]]  Abbot and Costello show. Republicans in Congress and the President- elect are pointing at each other, waiting for the other one to come up  with the plan--``You do it. No, you do it''--because no one can come up  with a repeal plan that keeps the benefits of ACA.   This confusion of the Republicans makes sense because the Republicans  are in a pickle and driving into that box canyon. They promised every  conservative group and audience in the country for the past 8 years  that they would repeal health care reform ``root and branch,'' but  actually it is only their base that wants repeal. Most Americans want  us to keep the law and work to improve it.   In a recent Politico/Morning Consult poll, only 28 percent of  Americans support repealing the law if there is no current plan for  replacing it--less than one-third. This is the Republican base.   Two-thirds of Americans support the provisions that prevent insurance  companies from denying coverage to patients with preexisting  conditions, 63 percent support letting kids stay on their parents' plan  until they are 26, and there are similar numbers on the other major  benefits of health care reform. Those are the key features. Those  aren't extraneous. Those are the heart and soul of the Affordable Care  Act. The Republicans are in a pickle. They cannot please their base and  the broader public at the same time so President-Elect Trump says to  Congress: You come up with replace.   The Congress says to the President: You come up with replace.   Abbot and Costello.   No replace. We haven't seen one yet, and it has been 6 years.   From a policy perspective, our Republican friends can't repeal a law  and keep in place the provisions that are overwhelmingly popular with  the majority of Americans. That is why they are in such a pickle.   The Affordable Care Act is not despised by the American people, only  the hard right of the Republican base, which is fervently anti- government. It is an ideology. It doesn't matter how much ACA helps  people. If the government did it, we don't want it. They oppose health  care because they oppose everything that government does. They oppose  Medicare, Medicaid, even Social Security.   If Republicans go forward with this plan, they may mollify their  base--the base will stop complaining--but they will ostracize and hurt  the American people and ultimately lose in the court of public opinion.   There is a much more responsible course of action that I urge my  friends on the other side of the aisle to consider: abandon repeal.   We Democrats are willing to work with our Republican colleagues on  improving the existing law. We will even look at a comprehensive  replacement plan if they can come up with it. We don't care about  credit. You can call it McConnellCare or RepubliCare or RyanCare or  TrumpCare. It doesn't matter so long as it covers as many people as the  ACA, so long as it helps bring health care costs down, and so long as  it doesn't move our health care system backward.   We haven't seen one so far. I am skeptical that we ever will, but we  will look at one if they can come up with it. Unfortunately, that is  not the road we are on. The vote tonight is the first step on the road  to repeal, which leads straight into that box canyon.   I just want to sincerely urge my Republican colleagues, especially  those who have rightly expressed concern about the very serious  consequences of repealing without replacement: Vote against this  resolution. Put this irresponsible and rushed repeal plan aside. Work  with us Democrats on a way to improve health care in America, not set  it back 8 years. Don't make America sick again. Don't put chaos in  place of affordable care, which is what you will do if you follow  through on this resolution.   The consequences of throwing our system into chaos, which the  Republican plan will do, are enormous: denying 30 million Americans  health coverage, blowing a $1 trillion hole in our deficit, depriving  the college graduate from staying on their parent's plan, preventing  women from getting fair treatment, and telling the family whose  daughter has a preexisting condition that they can't get coverage, and  they will have to watch her get sicker.   That--all of that--falls entirely on the shoulders of my Republican  colleagues. I think that is a scenario we all would like to avoid. So  turn back before it is too late because you will regret going forward.   Thank you, Mr. President.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.    Mr. President, will my friend from Wyoming yield for a  question?    Since the amendment by Senator Coons from Delaware is  not going to be offered, I believe that the Hatch amendment was a side- by-side to Coons and we don't need that. Is that true?    Mr. President, on behalf of the tens of millions of  Americans who will have their costs go up--   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Debate is not in order during a rollcall vote.   --whether they are in the exchange or not, if ACA is  repealed, I vote no.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader is not in order.   Debate is not in order during a vote.   The Senator from Illinois.
