 Mr. Speaker, in the decades-long fight to end hunger,  last September's White House Conference on Hunger, Nutrition, and  Health was a major turning point.   I thank the Biden-Harris administration for convening antihunger and  nutrition stakeholders from across America to come up with an ambitious  yet achievable plan to end hunger and reduce diet-related illnesses by  2030. The national strategy put forward will serve as our guide.   Now, it is time to put plans into action. I am thrilled that the  Biden-Harris administration remains laser-focused on maintaining the  momentum coming out of the conference.   We have already achieved big wins, like permanently expanding summer  food benefits for families with kids and signing into law the Food  Donation Improvement Act, a bill I championed to make it easier for  businesses to donate food.   Our work is just beginning, and I urge every American to join us in  creating a healthier, hunger-free future for all. I have more faith  than ever that, working together, we can and will end hunger now.                            ____________________
