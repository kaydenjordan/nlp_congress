 Mr. President, we have a series of Senators who are going  to be speaking about what is happening as a result of climate change  and sea level rise, which is having its effects in my State of Florida,  particularly.   Few States are as vulnerable to climate change than what we find  particularly in South Florida, Miami Beach being Ground Zero. What is  happening as the sea level is rising--and these are not projections,  they are not forecasts; these are actually measurements, measurements  by NASA and NOAA over the last 40 years that the sea has risen in South  Florida 5 to 8 inches.   We see the effects of that at the seasonal high tides--now, more  increasingly, along with the cycles of the Moon each month. Water,  typically, is sloshing around in streets and sloshing over the curves.  As a result, the city of Miami Beach has had to spend tens of millions  of dollars on huge, expensive pumps and has also had to raise the level  of the roadbeds.   NOAA's most recent worst-case scenario projections predict a 2-foot  sea level rise by 2060 and, if we take it all the way to the end of the  century, 6 feet by 2100. Needless to say, in a peninsula that sits in  the middle of what we know as Hurricane Highway, 6 feet would inundate  so much of the coastal areas. By the way, the population of Florida is  21 million people, and 75 percent is along the coastal regions. That  puts all of the entire Nation's low-lying coastal cities at risk of  major flooding, not to mention our military installations along the  coast.   The seas are not just rising; they are also warming, and they are  rising because they are warming. Of course, I have explained this  several times on the floor of the Senate: As the Sun's rays come in and  hit the Earth, some of the heat is absorbed, but some of it is  reflected off the Earth's surface and is radiated out into space.   When you put up an extra abundance of greenhouse gases--mainly carbon  dioxide and methane--and they move into the upper atmosphere, they  serve like a glass ceiling of a greenhouse; thus, the term, the  ``greenhouse'' effect. Then, as that heat is reflected off the Earth  that would normally radiate out into space, it is trapped and, thus,  the entire Earth starts to heat.   Two-thirds of the Earth's surface is covered by oceans, and 90  percent of that heat is absorbed into the oceans. What happens to water  when it is heated? It expands. So we see the reasons that warmer water  means the sea levels rise.   Do you know what else it produces? More frequent and more ferocious  hurricanes. After the back-to-back punch of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma,  and Maria, imagine how much we would have to spend in Federal disaster  aid if we had a hurricane season like last year every year. That is why  it is so critical to continue funding climate and weather research and  to keep improving NOAA's hurricane models.   This information can make the difference in a life-or-death  situation. We saw what havoc the hurricanes visited upon Texas and then  Florida after it had already crossed Puerto Rico, but then along comes  Maria, and it hits the island directly. As of today, 5, going on 6,  months after the hurricane, the poor island of Puerto Rico--our fellow  American citizens--17 percent today do not still have electricity. So,  indeed, there has been a lot more loss of life as a result of  hurricanes.   Our coastline in Florida is blessed, as a hurricane is approaching,  with a natural breakwater. It is called the Florida Reef Tract. It is  along the southeastern coast. Of all the major barrier reefs in the  entire world, Florida has the third largest. It starts south of Key  West and continues all the way up the Keys, north, up to Fort Pierce,  FL.   This Florida reef is the only barrier reef in the continental United  States. Healthy reefs are able to reduce storm damage by taking a lot  of the impact, but climate change, ocean acidification, and an  unprecedented coral disease outbreak are hurting Florida's reefs and  diminishing their ability to act as a shoreline buffer. I am not even  talking about all the other things that reefs do--which is the natural  place for all the fish and critters of the sea to gather, swimming in  and around and among all of the coral reefs.   That is why, last week, I wrote a letter to the Secretaries of  Commerce, Agriculture, and Health and Human Services calling for an  interagency strike team to be formed to finally diagnose the coral  disease in an attempt to save the remaining reefs.   I want to show an example of the difference between a healthy reef  and a diseased reef. Look at the difference. Here is the healthy coral.  Look how the diseased reef has actually been bleached out. So time is  running out on this third largest barrier reef on the planet. We have  to respond to the causes and effects of climate change now. The longer  we put it off, the harder and more expensive it is going to be to  mitigate.   I thank Senator Whitehouse and my fellow colleagues who are speaking  out on this critical mission.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, Florida recently approved the placement of  a statue of a truly inspirational woman, Dr. Mary McLeod Bethune, in  the National Statuary Hall here in Washington, DC.   Dr. Mary McLeod Bethune was an American educator, stateswoman,  philanthropist, humanitarian, and civil rights activist. In 1904, Dr.  Bethune founded Literature and Industrial Training School for African- American students in Daytona Beach, FL, now Bethune-Cookman University.  She founded and was the president of the State Federation of Colored  Women's Club, where she led the fight against school segregation and  healthcare inequality. Dr. Bethune also served as president of the  National Association of Colored Women's Club and founded the National  Council of Negro Women.   Dr. Bethune became the first African-American woman to head a Federal  agency when President Franklin D. Roosevelt appointed her  administrative assistant for Negro Affairs of the National Youth  Administration. She advised the President on concerns of African  Americans and helped deliver his message and achievements with the  African American community. Dr. Bethune became known as the First Lady  of the Struggle because of her commitment to improve the lives of  African Americans.   Dr. Bethune maintained high standards and attracted tourists and  donors to Bethune-Cookman College. She was president of the college  from 1923 to 1942 and 1946 to 1947, one of the few women in the world  to serve as a college president at that time.                            ____________________
