 Madam President, the Senator from Missouri is exactly  right. We are going to hear so much about this, and the reason is, as  the American people hear about this so-called election bill, what they  are realizing is, it is not something that is going to make their local  election safer. It is something that is going to put that power in  Washington, DC.   Now, what we are hearing from the majority leader and the Democratic  leadership is that they have got to get rid of the filibuster in order  to push forward this election bill, adding States, packing courts--all  of this laundry list of a socialist agenda that they are planning to  execute.   So what I want to do today for a couple of minutes is just walk us  down memory lane as to what people have had to say, what our Democratic  colleagues have had to say about the filibuster.   In May of 2005, then-Senator Joe Biden came to the floor and he  vigorously jumped into the middle of a debate over the filibuster. He  said that things would go very wrong if his colleagues decided to blow  up the rules to get their way. What is interesting about Senator  Biden's position is that it had almost nothing to do with his policy  goals.   Here is his quote:         Folks who want to see this change want to eliminate one of       the procedural mechanisms designed for the express purpose of       guaranteeing individual rights, and they also have a       consequence, and would undermine the protections of a       minority point of view in the heat of majority excess.    He understood, at that point in time, the importance of preserving  the Senate's institutional power and abiding by standards that not only  welcome but require deliberation and compromise.   Well, what a difference a few years and a Senate majority can make.  Today, we are having the exact same debate, but the power my Democratic  colleagues won in the last election has changed their minds about  breaking the Senate to get their way. The problem is, the Senate is not  broken. It does not need their changes.   But the rules no longer matter to the majority leader, even though he  said as recently as 2017:         [L]et us go no further down this road. I hope the       Republican leader and I can, in the coming months, find a way       to build a firewall around the legislative filibuster, which       is the most important distinction between the Senate and the       House. Without the 60-vote threshold for legislation, the       Senate becomes a majoritarian institution like the House,       much more subject to the winds of short-term electoral       change.    Well, my, my, my, how about that? He understood the dangers of  legislative whiplash, even when he was in the minority. So did my  colleague Senator Durbin, who said in 2018 that he believed that ending  the filibuster would ``be the end of the Senate as it was originally  devised and created, going back to our Founding Fathers.''    Well, I am going to ask the Senators from New York and Illinois: What  happened here? What changed their minds so drastically? They have done  a 180.   I would ask the same question of many of my Democratic colleagues. In  2017, 32 Senate Democrats--yes, that is correct, 32, many of whom are  still serving in this Chamber today--signed onto a bipartisan letter in  support of the filibuster. Now, they, too, have changed their minds. It  makes you wonder: What is everybody on the Democratic aisle drinking  these days?   This is no way to run the world's greatest deliberative body, but it  is a great way to destroy it. Between 2017 and today, many Senate  Democrats  [[Page S173]]  changed their minds about how to handle the filibuster.   Over the past year, we have watched Joe Biden and the Democrats  attack more than one institution forming the foundation of this Nation.  The Supreme Court, the First Amendment, the Second Amendment, limits on  the power of the Executive, and, now, the Senate rules have all proved  to be inconvenient to their agenda and ended up on the chopping block.  That is where they are putting them.   My Democratic colleagues may be frustrated, but that is just too bad.  The Senate was not designed to rubberstamp legislation that is so  belligerently foolish it can't tempt a single Republican vote--not one.  No.   The Senate was designed to protect the American people and the  institution itself from shortsighted leadership.   My colleagues claim that all they are asking for is one teeny little  carve-out--just one. But I would remind them that there is only so much  carving you can do before you reduce the entire thing to dust. And  based on their track record, we have no reason to trust that they will  stop carving and put down the knife rather than use it to hold the  Senate hostage the next time they can't scrounge up the votes to check  something off their to-do list.   I yield the floor.
