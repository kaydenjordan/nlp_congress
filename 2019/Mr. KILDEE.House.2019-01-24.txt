 Madam Speaker, every day I hear from constituents about  how this manufactured crisis is hurting them and hurting their  families. Mitch McConnell's and President Trump's refusal to reopen  government has consequences for real people.   A Marine veteran from Bay City, Michigan, won't receive his monthly  housing allowance this week that he needs to pay his rent and make his  car payment. His words to me were this: ``I never thought the President  would be putting us veterans that he says he loves so much in harm's  way just to get money for his harebrained immigration solution.''   That is from a United States veteran who served this country and is  now being treated by the President of the United States as a pawn in a  political game to get something that he is not willing to submit to the  legislative process.   Shame on this President. Shame on him. Open this government. Do it  now.                            ____________________
