 Madam Speaker, Ranking Member, and Chairwoman Lowey,  I rise today to lend my strong support to all of the appropriations  bills that will be before us today, but specifically as the ranking  member on the Homeland Security Subcommittee of the Appropriations  Committee, I am here to speak about the Department of Homeland Security  Appropriations Act, specifically.   As we have heard today from speakers on both sides of the aisle, this  is not an ideal bill, but I think it is a very good and strong bill. It  is a good bill crafted in a difficult environment--probably one of the  most difficult environments I have seen in my almost 10-year tenure. I  tell you, Madam Speaker, it is worthy of our support, as are all the  bills here today.   I specifically, though, as the ranking member, the highest Republican  on  [[Page H10382]]  this subcommittee, want to thank Chairwoman Roybal-Allard. She is the  head Democrat and we have worked well together. We don't view the world  and we don't view this bill in total agreement, but we got it done, and  that is very important, again, in these trying times.   This Homeland Security bill before us provides nearly $1.4 billion  for continued construction of border barriers in high-priority areas  identified by Customs and Border Protection and provides funding for  the same level of detention beds as we had in fiscal year 2019. It also  maintains the same transfer and reprogramming authorities.   The Department of Homeland Security is a vast agency and, looking at  the bill beyond the investments in border and immigration enforcement,  there are so many activities, programs, and initiatives that we all  agree on across the aisle, across the Capitol, and really across the  great United States of America. As I have said before, 90 percent of  the funding in this bill we all can agree on.   We have solid investments in our great United States Coast Guard, and  let's remember, Madam Speaker, this is the one branch of the military  that did not get paid during the government shutdown last year, but the  men and women of the Coast Guard bravely continued their missions. For  the Coast Guard--the military branch with so many domestic missions on  top of its contributions to the Nation's defense--this bill provides  desperately needed new air and marine assets as well as reinvesting in  personnel.                                time  1145    We have plus-ups for the Secret Service to continue leading law  enforcement on national special security events and protection for all  the Presidential candidates.   We have plus-ups for the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security  Agency to help keep our government's IT system secure, as well as  providing for technical assistance to States, Tribes, and localities.   We have more than $17 billion for FEMA disaster relief to ensure that  we are ready for whatever storms hit our homes plus increases of over  $90 million for grants to State and local communities to prepare for  and mitigate disasters.   Further, as our loved ones travel over this holiday season, the bill  provides an increase of over $210 million for the operations and  equipment of TSA in fiscal year 2020.   Madam Speaker, finally, I thank the staff who have worked so hard  together. I thank, especially, the staff on both sides, majority and  minority, Darek, Kris, Bob, Karyn, Mike, Elizabeth, Rachel, Victoria,  Dena, and Kristin, plus Daniel from my own staff, for all of their hard  work to put together this good bill.    Madam Speaker, again, I want to thank Chairwoman  Lowey and Ranking Member Granger, also Ranking Member Simpson.   Today, I rise, again, in support of another one of our great  appropriations bills, the Energy and Water and Related Agencies bill.   As the Speaker knows, I spoke earlier in very fervent support of the  Homeland Security bill. The Energy and Water bill is robust. It is  well-funded.   I just actually spoke with a member of the press outside, and the  gentleman asked me, over the past few years, why the Energy and Water  bill had been increased so much. The answer is clear: It is because  Republicans and Democrats in the House and the Senate and the  administrations, including this administration as well, understand that  the Nation needs what the Department of Energy is doing.   Now, obviously, I have a bit of a bias. I represent, I think, one of  the greatest Department of Energy reservations at Oak Ridge. We have a  national lab. We have the Y-12 plant. We are building the uranium  processing facility. I thank the chairwoman for the robust funding for  that great construction project.   Also, legacy cleanup all across the United States of America--not  only in Oak Ridge, but in Savannah River; in Hanford, Washington; in  Los Alamos, New Mexico. Republicans and Democrats and communities are  working together cleaning up legacy waste.   There was a time in America when we were not as careful--during the  Cold War and prior to and during World War II--when we manufactured  these weapons and there was legacy waste out there. It is the  obligation, I think, of the Federal Government to clean it up. It is  high time that we do it, and we are doing it with our funding  priorities.   So whether it is our great national labs--there are 17 of them all  across the United States: the NNSA, the Office of Science--it hearkens  me, again, at a time when we see a divided nation, a divided Capitol,  that we can come together in very strong, fervent, and robust agreement  to support this funding bill for the Department of Energy and its  related agencies. That means our locks will be funded with the Army  Corps of Engineers and all of our key DOE functions will continue to be  supported at the highest level.   This keeps America at the forefront. We lead the world in  supercomputing. We lead the world in materials research. We lead the  world in advanced manufacturing.   So I thank my colleagues for their robust support of this bill, and I  urge its support with the other bills in this plan.
