Mr. Chairman, I wish we were considering bills under  regular order, but I hope that in the weeks ahead we can work together  to raise the budget caps and enact bipartisan bills we can all support.   I thank Chairman Frelinghuysen, my friend; and Kay Granger, the  chair; and, of course, Pete Visclosky for your hard work on this bill.   However, this is not the regular way to proceed. I urge my colleagues  to vote ``no'' on this bill which would waste $1.6 billion on Trump's  border wall, use fraudulent defense numbers, gut critical investments  in clean energy, include poison pill riders, and leave the remaining  spending bills with no path forward.   Mr. Chairman, as I conclude, I thank again all of the Members, all of  my hardworking staff on both sides of the aisle. On this bill, I urge a  ``no'' vote.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.  [[Page H6507]]         Vacating Demand for Recorded Vote on Amendment Offered by Mr. DeSantis
