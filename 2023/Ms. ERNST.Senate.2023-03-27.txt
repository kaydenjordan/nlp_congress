 Mr. President, as ranking member of the Senate  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize  an outstanding Iowa small business that exemplifies the American  entrepreneurial spirit. This week, it is my privilege to recognize  Legacy Manufacturing of Marion, IA, as the Senate Small Business of the  Week for the week of March 27, 2023.   When it came to everyday construction and household tools, the Weems  family was unsatisfied with the current products on the market. In  1986, the family decided to take matters into their own hands and  opened a small manufacturing company to develop products they  considered to be lacking in the market. Through decades of dedication  to crafting innovative products, the Weems family business has grown  into Legacy Manufacturing, a company that makes high-quality, long- lasting tools and equipment for professional and consumer use. Legacy  Manufacturing is a prime example of the two things that make America  great: entrepreneurial spirit and family.   For almost 40 years, Legacy Manufacturing has kept smart engineering,  quality materials, and top-notch production standards at the forefront  of their company. Starting off as a small manufacturer in eastern Iowa,  Legacy Manufacturing has received national recognition for their  uniquely designed innovative hose, which they named the ``Flexzilla.''  The Flexzilla is a staple in their product line and can be found across  global markets. The Flexzilla is lighter and has a more durable outer  cover than the traditional water hose. Additionally, the entire hose is  drinking water safe, so kids on a hot Iowa summer day can enjoy a  refreshing drink, and parents can rest easy knowing that the Flexzilla  is made with this in mind.   Legacy Manufacturing's commitment to quality products has paid off.  The Flexzilla hose has consistently been ranked the best garden hose  for years. Recently, it was ranked as one of the best garden hoses of  2023 by People Magazine and NBC News. Ultimately, it was ranked as the  best garden hose overall for 2023 in an independent review by USA Today  and was named one of the ``best of the best'' garden hoses by  BestReviews LLC in 2022.   The Weems family's leadership has been integral to revolutionizing  the consumer experience and has emerged as a unique market leader for a  wide range of tools. When a customer buys a product from Legacy  Manufacturing, they can be assured that they are getting the best  product on the market in terms of quality, innovation, and product  safety. Legacy Manufacturing offers a wide range of professional grade  service and maintenance equipment for the automotive, industrial,  contractor, agricultural, and marine markets throughout North America.  The motto of the company is ``taking the work out of work.'' This means  that they make sure each of their products are made from quality  materials and ensure that they are built to last. Legacy Manufacturing  currently is home to six different brands: the Legacy brand, Flexzilla,  ColorConnex, SmartFlex, Lock-n-Load, and Workforce. All of these brands  have a different focus to diversify the product line and ensure that  every customer is satisfied with their product. They have gone so far  that they even created YouTube videos that demonstrate to consumers how  each of their products work.   For over 40 years, Legacy Manufacturing has been able to achieve  success in eastern Iowa. In 2016, they completed their 133,000-square- foot facility in Marion, IA. In 2017, they were able to start a  200,000-square-foot expansion of their facilities in Marion, thanks to  the Iowa Economic Development Authority--IEDA--grant program. The  expansion adds to the growing reshoring movement in an effort to bring  back manufacturing jobs to the United States. The expansion created 13  new jobs which brought the number of people employed by Legacy  Manufacturing to about 75 employees. Overall, the company brings hope  and prosperity to Iowa as more manufacturing jobs return to the United  States.   Not only has the company received wide acclaims by industry experts  for their high-performing products, Legacy Manufacturing and the Weems  family have been recognized for their commitment to employing Iowans  and growing the local economy. I want to commend the Weems family and  the entire team at Legacy Manufacturing for their commitment to  innovation and for their perseverance in growing their manufacturing  company in the United States. Congratulations, I look forward to your  continued growth and success in Iowa.                            ____________________
