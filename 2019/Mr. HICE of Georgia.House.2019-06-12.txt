 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding.   As one who just returned from the border, and having personally seen  the enormity of the crisis there, I ask unanimous consent to call up  H.R. 3056, an emergency supplemental to provide critically needed  funding for the humanitarian crisis at the border, and I ask for its  immediate action and consideration.
