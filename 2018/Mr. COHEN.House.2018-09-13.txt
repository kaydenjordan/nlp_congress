 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this body's action  to pass HR. 5439, a bill I introduced to designate the U.S. Postal  Office at 1320 Autumn Ave. Memphis, Tennessee as the ``Judge Russell B.  Sugarmon Post Office.''   I want to thank my colleagues from the Tennessee House delegation,  Representatives Roe, Duncan, Fleischmann, DesJarlais, Cooper, Black,  Blackburn, and Kustoff, all of whom cosponsored this legislation  honoring a great American. I also want to thank Chairman Gowdy and  Ranking Member Cummings for reporting this bill favorably out of the  House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform.  [[Page H8249]]    Born in Memphis, Tennessee in 1929, Judge Russell B. Sugarmon is  heralded for his contributions to the City of Memphis and his work to  reverse the tide of racism in Tennessee, paving the way for future  black leaders in the area and inspiring their efforts to increase their  representation in elected, Democratic bodies.   Working alongside notable Memphis pioneers and leaders in the fight  for racial justice and equality, Judge Sugarmon was instrumental in  using the courts to desegregate public transportation, restaurants and  public facilities and the desegregation of Memphis public schools.   As a trailblazer for African-Americans in public office and a leader  in the Civil Rights Movement, it is only fitting that we enshrine our  recognition of Judge Sugarmon's contributions to the City of Memphis  and the African American community by naming the 1320 Autumn Ave. Post  Office in Memphis, Tennessee in honor of his legacy.   I thank my colleagues in the House for voting to pass this measure  honoring Judge Russell B. Sugarmon, an exemplary American and titan of  his time.   I urge my colleagues in the Senate to quickly take up this bill and  send the legislation to the President's desk.   The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, was read  the third time, and passed.   The title of the bill was amended so as to read: ``A bill to  designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at  1325 Autumn Avenue in Memphis, Tennessee, as the `Judge Russell B.  Sugarmon Post Office Building'.''.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________
