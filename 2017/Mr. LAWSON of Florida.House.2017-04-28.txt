 Mr. Speaker, we have heard a lot of big ideas  and promises from the President, but we haven't seen much intangible  action from the Republicans over the last 100 days. We know we need to  continue to improve health care in this country, yet Republicans have  failed to come up with a reasonable solution.   As someone who has spent over 36 years working in the insurance  industry, I stand willing and ready to work with my colleagues to  improve health care for my constituents and the American people,  especially in the Fifth Congressional District.   What we really need is for my colleagues to focus on energy and  creating jobs. That is so important here in America.   What we don't need is to continue with more of the antics from the  President who is more focused on selling scores from the campaign trail  than finding real solutions for the American people.   It really is a sad day in America when Congress can't come together  to make real progress for the American people. Real progress. We need  to put aside the bickering and roll up our sleeves in order to get the  work done for the people in America.   That is something we should all be able to do within the next 100  days. There has been so much concern about what is happening with the  present administration over the next 100 days. So since that is  prevalent and the American people have heard about it, now the  concentration is on what Congress and the President are going to do for  the next 100 days for the American people.   I urge my colleagues to join me in doing what is right--right for  their constituents, right for the American people.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the remainder of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now  adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 1 o'clock and 9 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until Monday, May  1, 2017, at noon for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
