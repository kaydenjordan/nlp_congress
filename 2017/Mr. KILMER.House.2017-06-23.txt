 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 7, line 10, after the period, insert the following:       ``Such recommendations shall include recommendations on how       to address employment-related challenges in rural areas and       among members of federally recognized Indian tribes.''.    The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 396, the gentleman from  Washington (Mr. Kilmer) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Washington.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I am here this morning to talk about the biggest thing  on the minds of the folks that I represent: jobs.   I am glad that we are having a discussion today about how to help  people land a job that they can be proud of.   Whether I am at a VFW or a county fair, in a lot of the parts of the  region that I represent, this is the concern that I hear more than  anything else.   Today's bill would help people who are looking for work acquire  skills that help them land a bigger paycheck and a better career. I am  glad to offer an amendment with a fellow member of the Bipartisan  Working Group, Representative Valadao, to make sure that the bill that  is passed does some good for rural communities and for our tribal  partners as well.   I know firsthand the challenges that small towns across America are  facing. I grew up in a timber town in Washington State and watched some  of the parents of my friends and some of my neighbors lose their jobs  as mills shut down. These men and women are the hardworking Americans  that want work, want training, and want careers. In short, they want a  shot at a better life.   That is what this bill will do. I commend Mr. Curbelo and Mr. Davis  for bringing it forward. With our amendment, we can make sure that shot  is extended to all communities, no matter their ZIP Code.   Our amendment directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to  take a look at how to address employment challenges in rural areas and  those challenges facing members of federally recognized Native American  Tribes. It directs the Secretary then to provide recommendations to  Congress on what fixes actually work best.   When it comes to providing the training to get folks into quality  jobs, we want to make sure that we are not flying blind. Our amendment  makes sure that we have all the information we need to make the right  decisions and give folks who want a quality job a shot at that.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for his support. And,  again, I thank Representatives Curbelo and Davis for their work on the  underlying bill, and the cooperation of Mr. Valadao for working to  address this challenge.   Mr. Chairman, I urge adoption of the amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
