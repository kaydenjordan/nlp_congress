 Madam Speaker, today I rise to urge my colleagues to pass  the Honoring our PACT Act to give our veterans the healthcare they  earned.   Over 3.5 million veterans have been exposed to toxins, such as burn  pits, during deployment, causing horrific health impacts. To add insult  to injury, the disability benefit claims process places the burden on  our vets themselves to jump through hoops. This is a shameful problem-- a shameful problem--one we are determined to fix.   This legislation, which includes my FASTER Presumptions Act, will  help cut the red tape and streamline procedures for veterans who have  earned it to access their healthcare benefits faster. Our veterans  served our country with honor and we have to honor their service.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to honor our PACT through this  bill, and I thank Chairman Takano for his leadership.
