 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4607, the  Comprehensive Regulatory Review Act.   I want to thank Chairman Hensarling and the entire Financial Services  Committee for their continued critical work on financial regulations.   As chairman of the House Small Business Committee, I consistently  hear from Main Street businesses, small businesses from all over the  country, that overregulation is preventing business expansion and job  growth.   Just last week, I chaired a hearing on a recent report by the  nonpartisan Government Accountability Office that explored whether  financial regulations were adversely impacting community banks and  credit unions. One of the major takeaways from that report was that we  need to improve the tools available to financial regulators to reduce  those burdens.   Because small businesses most often rely on conventional bank  borrowing to finance their development, any additional red tape that  reduces access to capital can be a monumental problem for the Nation's  smallest firms. The bill that we have before us today, which would  reform the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act of  1996, is a move in the right direction.   Making sure all financial regulators have a comprehensive process in  place to review regulations will strengthen our financial sector and  make it more possible for America's small businesses to have access to  the capital that they need to grow and expand and create more jobs for  more Americans. Mr. Speaker, I therefore urge my colleagues to support  the commonsense reforms that are in H.R. 4607, and I urge them to  support this legislation.
