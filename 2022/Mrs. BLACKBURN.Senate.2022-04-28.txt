 Mr. President, last week, my beautiful mother  Mary Jo Morgan Wedgeworth passed out of this world and into the arms of  our Lord. She left with all those who were blessed to know her a  lifetime of wonderful memories and a legacy of love, friendship, and  service.   My mother was a lifelong resident of Laurel, MS. During her youth,  she was the 1944 winner of the National 4-H Club Girl Achievement award  and the President's Trophy. This was awarded to her at the National 4-H  Club Congress in Chicago. She continued to be an active participant in  Mississippi 4-H Club programs, serving in numerous leadership roles and  always serving as a local 4-H club leader. She served on the  Mississippi 4-H Club board and as president of the Mississippi  Extension Service Homemakers and FCE Club.   She was a member of First Baptist Church and active in women's  programs and Sunday school. She especially loved providing beautiful  flower arrangements made with cuttings from her garden for church  events.   She was active in the Mississippi Council of Garden Clubs, where she  served as president, and the Deep South Garden Club Council as a  nationally accredited flower show judge and in the Waynesboro Drive  Garden Club. She was known for her entertaining and educational  programs on flower-arranging, gardening, and recycling. In  [[Page S2217]]  1987, she was honored by Keep America Beautiful with the lifetime  achievement award for her exceptional efforts to keep our Nation  beautiful. Some of her efforts included working to develop the Avenue  of Magnolias at each of Mississippi's interstate State-line entrances  and also the garden club wildflower program.   In 1976, she was honored with the Mississippi Volunteer Activist  award for the thousands of hours she gave in volunteer service to her  community. Indeed, her community activism began early with organizing  victory gardens to support America's efforts during World War II.   She was active in the Jones County Republican Party, holding various  offices and serving as chairman of both the Jones County Republican  Women and the Mississippi Federation of Republican Women.   She was a docent for the Lauren Rogers Museum of Art, where she so  enjoyed giving tours and teaching children about the collections at the  museum. For decades, she served on the board of the Red Cross and  always had helping hands to assist victims of hurricanes and disasters  who sought shelter from the storm. During the aftermath of Hurricane  Katrina, she and my father Hilman welcomed and served meals to hundreds  who fled to the Red Cross shelter in Laurel.   Throughout her long life, my mother strung together more than a few  pearls of wisdom for the benefit of her 3 children, 7 grandchildren,  and 16 great-grandchildren, but the one that rests at the top of my  mind is this: ``Leave things in better shape than you found them.''  Whether it was through the flowers in her garden or the gentle  encouragement that banished my fear and doubt, my mother took her own  words to heart every day of her life. I will miss her terribly, but I  find comfort and inspiration when I remember that the world she left  behind for me is a far more beautiful place today than it was when she  made her grand entrance 97 years ago.                            ____________________
