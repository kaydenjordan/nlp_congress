 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of this amendment to preserve  the Job Corps Civilian Conservation Center, CCC, program.   Last month the Trump administration, in a shortsighted manner,  announced plans to permanently close nine of the centers and hand the  remaining 16 facilities over to private contractors by the end of the  year.   This is an incredibly successful program. They have a unique mandate  within Job Corps to help conserve, develop, manage public natural  resources and areas and to respond to natural disasters. The 25 CCCs  operate in 17 national forests and grasslands across 16 States and  train thousands of at-risk youth every year.   Many of these young adults, being at risk, come from rural  communities, and these programs provide them with cutting-edge  vocational training and pathways out of poverty in addition to  providing critical opportunities to struggling rural areas.   Beyond this, CCCs provide essential capacity for the Forest Service  to fulfill its mission. During the height of the 2017 fire season,  1,200 students provided 450,000 hours of wildfire support, and after  Hurricane Harvey, the students provided 5,000 hours of support to  impacted communities.   This is wrong for our rural communities, wrong for the Forest  Service, and it is wrong to abandon at-risk youth by killing this  program. Now is the wrong time to be reducing capacity.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this  amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Oregon  (Mr. Schrader).    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro).  [[Page H4542]]         Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Bishop).    Mr. Chair, may I ask for the remaining time on either  side.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself 30 seconds.   I doubt the gentlewoman has ever visited one of these programs. I  have, numerous times. I have seen the hotshot teams. These kids are so  proud. They were on a bad path, and now they are on a good path.   So, if you want to talk about at-risk youth, if you want to end up  having them get on drugs and go to jail, kill the program. If you don't  kill the program, we are going to save these kids' lives and make them  into productive citizens.   On the plane one day, I sat next to a guy just coming back from one  in Idaho. He had learned to cook there. He got his certificate. He was  offered four jobs when he came back. Before that, he was a dead-end kid  with no high school degree.   These programs have great results for these youth. Do not be cruel  and kill it.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
