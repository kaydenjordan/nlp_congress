 Madam President, today I wish to commemorate the 150th  anniversary of the town of Fort Kent, ME. The motto of our State's  northernmost community, ``The Little Town That Could,'' describes a  past of hard work, courage, and determination. ``The Little Town That  Can'' describes Fort Kent today: a wonderful place to live, work, and  raise families.   Located where the Fish River joins the St. John River, Fort Kent has  a rich history. For thousands of years, the region has been the home of  the Micmac and Maliseet. French explorers, led by Samuel de Champlain,  first visited the area in 1604. In the early 1800s, French-speaking  Canadians began settling in the area, laying the foundation for the  robust Acadian culture that is so important in Maine, New Brunswick,  Nova Scotia, and as far away as Louisiana.   The Acadian settlers created a vibrant community. They cleared  farmland, established lumber and grain mills, schools, and churches.  The namesake of the town is the Fort Kent Blockhouse, a fort named for  then-Governor Edward Kent and carefully preserved today, which was  built in 1839 during a long-running border dispute between the United  States and British Canada. Settlement to the region increased  dramatically when the ``Bloodless Aroostook War'' ended peacefully with  a treaty in 1842.   Fort Kent's dedication to education began shortly after the town  became established. In 1878, the Madawaska Training School was  established in Fort Kent, one of the first institutions in Maine  dedicated to preparing students for careers as bilingual educators.  That school continues today as the University of Maine at Fort Kent,  which in 2019 was named for the 14th consecutive year as one of the  best  [[Page S4852]]  northeastern colleges by the Princeton Review. As the only institution  in the United States located at the center of French culture in  northern Maine, the University of Maine at Fort Kent offers  opportunities for students of all heritages to study and live in a  bilingual community.   Today, more than 60 percent of the town's residents speak French, and  they continue to uphold the Acadian traditions of great food, music,  and dance, and of close-knit families and lasting friendships. The  Maine Acadian Heritage Council continues to help preserve these  traditions and is working to teach the next generation about the  Acadian heritage through programs like the Youth Renaissance.   The can-do spirit of Fort Kent is evident today. It is an  agricultural powerhouse. and the potato industry remains an essential  part of its economy. The town is home to an Olympic biathlete training  center and frequently hosts world-class biathlon competitions. For 26  years, the Can-Am Crown International Sled Dog race has attracted teams  from around the world. The International Muskie Fishing Derby  highlights the valuable fishing grounds and the pristine environment  the people of the community work to preserve. The Fort Kent Ploye  Festival celebrates the pancake-like dish that is a staple of Franco- American-Canadian cuisine.   To my Franco-American friends, it is a pleasure to congratulate you  on this landmark anniversary. Across the generations, you have worked  hard and worked together to create a community that combines your rich  heritage with the values that define our State and our Nation.   The celebration of Fort Kent's 150th anniversary is not merely about  the passing of time. It is about human accomplishment. We celebrate the  people who pulled together, cared for one another, and built a great  community. ``The Little Town That Can'' has a fascinating past and a  bright future.                            ____________________
