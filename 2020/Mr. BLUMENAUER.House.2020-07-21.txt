 Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor today with a heavy  heart. I see Donald Trump's administration declaring war on my hometown  of Portland, Oregon.   After failing the American people in the coronavirus, in the face of  6 months of not just weak leadership, but virtually no leadership at  all, there are tens of thousands of people dying unnecessarily.   It is hard to focus on the unprecedented assault on our environmental  protections that they have unleashed, but now they are declaring war on  America's cities, sending in an occupying force drawn from Homeland  Security, particularly the Customs and Border Protection patrol,  ostensibly to protect monuments and statues.   What about protecting the American people and their constitutional  right to protest?   Don't attack our people with tear gas without warning, seriously  injuring people exercising their right to protest, things that people  can see on video with their own eyes; watching the gentleman hit with a  projectile, requiring serious surgery, inflicting facial injuries; a  person just asking what was going on having officers assault him,  breaking his hand.   They can't be that inept. It must be purposeful, taking a very  challenging situation in my hometown and making it worse.   But make no mistake. This isn't just about Portland, Oregon.   We watched what they did in Lafayette Park across from the White  House, again assaulting innocent protestors in  [[Page H3593]]  order to have a photo op for the President of the United States.   There are indications that they are moving to Chicago, Atlanta,  Kansas City, Seattle. Who is going to be next?   Talking about the challenges that have been taken in Philadelphia  with a reforming district attorney, Larry Krasner, and somehow holding  him up as an example of breakdown in law and order and an assault on  the American public. It is just crazy.                                time  0915    Portland, Oregon is not out of control. To be sure, there are some  people who have strong feelings, and there are some who have done  things that are inappropriate and unlawful. But that is the challenge  of our local and State officials to manage it; not having somebody  unwelcome, uninvited, and unprepared coming in to take this difficult  situation and make it worse.   I deeply appreciate the congressional leadership, chairmen of the  Armed Services Committee, Adam Smith, the Judiciary Committee, Jerry  Nadler, Bennie Thompson, Homeland Security, who have decried this  activity.   It is important that we deal with Trump's weaponizing law enforcement  for his own agenda, not driven by people's needs, but by his poll  numbers, and becoming an occupying force in our community and, sadly, I  fear, elsewhere.   We need to move forward dealing with what they are doing. We want to  pursue legislative initiatives, spending limitations, oversight  hearings. This needs to be front and center. At a time when we have so  much to deal with, people cannot ignore what is happening in Portland  and what may be coming to their city.   With the administration becoming more hysterical in their charges  leading up to the election and falling poll numbers, there is no  community that is safe from this interference. We must do all we can to  not just spotlight but push back.   Our democratic process and our constitutional rights are literally at  risk, and you can see it in terms of what has been happening in  Portland, Oregon.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I fear that people don't really  appreciate what is going on in my hometown of Portland, Oregon, with  the Federal interference, so let's put a face on it.   Christopher J. David, a 53-year-old Navy veteran, graduate of the  Naval Academy, college wrestler, was concerned about the Pinochet-type  behavior of Federal officials in our community--uninvited, unwelcomed,  and unprepared.   He felt that their actions as Federal agents was in violation of  their oath to support, uphold, and defend the Constitution, which our  new colleague just accepted.   When he asked officers how they justified what they were doing with  their oath of office, he didn't get an answer; he got pepper sprayed.  He was beaten. His hand was broken. He is facing surgery to install  pins, screws, and plates.   This is the face of the Trump administration's unprecedented  interference in our community, taking a difficult situation and making  it worse.   Madam Speaker, I hope my colleagues will take a hard look at what is  going on here, because the Trump administration is trying to overshadow  its other failures with tactics like this. There is more on the  horizon.                            ____________________
