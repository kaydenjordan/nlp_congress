 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr. Jeff Cole for  his 30 years of distinguished service to the citizens of Florida,  culminating this year with his retirement as the Lake County manager.   Mr. Cole began his public service career in 1990, supporting the  Brevard County Board of County Commissioners. In 1994, he embarked on a  21-year journey with the St. Johns River Water Management District,  overseeing intergovernmental affairs and public and media outreach.   His long record of accomplishments brought him to Lake County in  2016, where he took on heightened responsibilities and focused on  enhancing government efficiencies and accountability, while improving  the quality of life in Lake County.   Through challenges ranging from Hurricane Irma to COVID-19, Mr. Cole  remained accessible and demonstrated unwavering leadership and  dedication to our community.   Mr. Speaker, I wish Jeff and his wife, Audrey, the very best in the  next chapter of their lives together. From the bottom of my heart, I  thank Jeff for his commitment to our citizens and the legacy that he is  leaving behind. He will be missed.                  Remembering Specialist Alexander J. Miller     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember Specialist Alexander  J. Miller, a young soldier who served our Nation in the Armed Forces  and was, sadly, killed in combat in Nuristan province, Afghanistan, on  July 31, 2009.   Alex attended East Ridge High School in Clermont, Florida and, soon  after graduation, enlisted in the U.S. Army, being assigned to the 1st  Battalion, 32nd Infantry Regiment, 3rd Brigade Combat Team, 10th  Mountain Division, Light Infantry, based in Fort Drum, New York.   Alex hoped to attend the University of Central Florida after  completing his tour of duty, but that dream vanished when insurgents  attacked his unit.   Miller was awarded two medals posthumously: the Purple Heart and the  Bronze Star.   May his memory and sacrifices be a reminder to all of us of his  service and love of country.   Our thoughts and prayers remain with the entirety of the Miller  family and his community these many years later.                Remembering First Lieutenant Ivan D. Lechowich     Mr. Speaker, today I rise to celebrate the legacy of a  local resident and hero of Florida's 15th District, First Lieutenant  Ivan Lechowich.   Lieutenant Lechowich was a devoted husband and loving father who  served his country in uniform and was, sadly, killed in Ghazni  province, Afghanistan, on September 28, 2011.   Lieutenant Lechowich graduated from the International Baccalaureate  Program at King High School, earned his undergraduate degree from the  University of Florida in 2007, and, after joining the U.S. Army in  2009, deployed to Afghanistan 2 years later.   Ivan was serving as a Sapper Platoon leader for the 515th Sapper  Company out of Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri, when an improvised  explosive device took his life.   Ivan was awarded the Purple Heart, Bronze Star, Army Commendation  Medal, and NATO Medal.   To his beloved wife, Jenn; daughter, Natalie Marie; and the rest of  the Lechowich family, our district and community still mourns the loss  of Ivan these many years later. May his memory and many sacrifices be a  reminder of his love for his family and his Nation.                  Remembering Sergeant Daniel McKinnon Angus     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in memory of Sergeant Daniel  McKinnon Angus, a local hero in Florida's 15th District, who was killed  in action in Afghanistan on January 24, 2010.   Daniel graduated from Armwood High School in 2000 and, in 2003,  joined the U.S. Marine Corps where he knew he belonged and hoped to  make a career of serving his community and country.   Daniel stood out among his peers and received the Combat Action  Ribbon, two Good Conduct Medals, the Afghanistan and Iraq Campaign  Medals, the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, and a number of  service decorations.   Daniel loved spending time with his wife, Bonnie, and his 1-year-old  daughter. Now 11 years old, may she always know and treasure the  knowledge of her father's heroism.   Men and women like Daniel who are willing to lay down their lives in  defense of our country and in support of others many miles away are  what make our Nation the greatest on Earth. Let us never take their  sacrifice or that of their surviving families in vain.                            ____________________
