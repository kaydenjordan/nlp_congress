 Madam Chair, I join my colleagues in support of the  Wildfire Response and Drought Resiliency Act. I support this bill  because we are in the midst of a crisis. After decades of severe  drought, the Colorado River, which supplies water to 40 million people  across seven States, is on the brink of collapse. The future of Arizona  and the entire American Southwest depends on how we respond.   Bold action to protect our water supply has never been more  important, and the Federal Government needs to act with the urgency  before it is too late.   The Wildfire Response and Drought Resiliency Act is a necessary step  to help our communities deal with the impacts of climate change and a  drier future. It builds on the investments in the bipartisan  infrastructure law to use our water more efficiently, and it includes  my legislation to provide $500 million for immediate action to protect  critical water levels in Lake Mead and Lake Powell.   Time is of the essence. We must act now. We cannot allow this crisis  to turn into a catastrophe. I urge my colleagues to save the Colorado  River, save the American Southwest, and support this bill.
