 Mr. Speaker, we are hearing about the issues that farmers  face. I have 8,000 farmers in my district. Workforce, we hear about  comprehensive illegal immigration reform, yes, indeed. But, Mr.  Speaker, border security first. Border security first, then we can help  our farmers and others with comprehensive illegal immigration reform.  That never seems to be on the table. Rural broadband, absolutely. We  have been talking about it for far too long, and it is way late in  coming.   Mr. Speaker, this WOTUS, waters of the U.S., never have I heard such  a clamor from my farmers. This is such an insult, and it shows just  simply how out of touch those that would propose something like this  are when it is related to my farmers and the farmers throughout the  United States.   Mr. Speaker, we know that every day farmers live in an uncertain  climate, to say the least, to say it literally. The Biden  administration's proposal here is a far, far more burdensome regulation  that will create a higher level of uncertainty, increase compliance  costs for farmers during a time that costs are escalating.    This rule will literally lead to puddles and ditches on farmers'  property being regulated under the Clean Water Act. Temporary puddles,  temporary wetlands that evaporate in a few days they could be  responsible for, very often when it is miles away from navigable  waters.   If this rule goes into effect, small businesses--and landowners as  well--will be forced to spend thousands of dollars on consultants and  lawyers to determine if they need a Federal permit on their own land or  risk expensive penalties or even jail time.   The Supreme Court will be hearing this case soon. They will certainly  reverse any rule made. No WOTUS before SCOTUS.
