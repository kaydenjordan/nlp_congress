 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in  order to call up the Crapo-Wyden amendment No. 1562, as modified with  the changes at the desk; and that following disposition of the Rubio  amendment No. 1802, the Senate vote on amendment No. 1562 with 60  affirmative votes required for adoption.    Madam President, speaking against this amendment, I  know the Senator from Florida probably, given his intelligence work,  wants to be well-meaning, but this amendment is not ready for the focus  that we need to give on issues of counterintelligence.   This amendment, as drafted, literally says that the Director of  National Intelligence should look at and certify whether any of the  entities given this money--including NASA, which would be given money  under this bill--that they would have to certify for a 10-year period  of time.  [[Page S3839]]    So, literally, every institution, every organization that gets money  under this bill would have to certify for a 10-year period of time that  they didn't have anything to do with a Chinese investment.   I am all for investigating theft and intellectual property. In fact,  the Senator from Mississippi and I added several provisions to our  legislation. Other people have added things to this legislation. But do  I want the Director of National Intelligence calling every university  in the United States that might get money from this program and asking  them to verify for the last 10 years what did they ever take as far as  Chinese investment?   I have news for you. I want the Director of National Intelligence to  be focusing on cyber security. If somebody didn't see, we have just had  a major pipeline incident. It is not the first incident; it is many  incidents in which foreign governments have threatened our Nation, our  sources of power, basically, by infiltrating our system.   I want the Director of National Intelligence to focus on Iran, to  focus on Russia, to focus on North Korea, to focus on Syria, to focus  on threats of terrorism. I want them to focus on monitoring our  organizations nationwide. I do not want them spending their time  calling university presidents and NASA officials asking them what they  have done for the last 10 years and to verify before they can get the  needed research dollars.   Now, I know the Senator is trying to be well-meaning, and I am happy  to work with him on this issue. But I know this: The race is on in  semiconductors. The race is on in quantum computing. The race is on in  AI. The race is on in other areas of manufacturing. And we cannot  afford to have our Director of National Intelligence spending his time  calling up these people when we have already implemented the securities  in this legislation.   I am happy to keep working with anybody on this issue. But, by God, I  am telling you, we are going to be committed to doing more on our  international threats on cyber security because, as you can see from  this recent pipeline incident, that is where we should be spending our  time and our focus, from a security perspective.   I ask my colleagues to table the Rubio amendment.                               Motion to Table    Madam President, I ask for the regular order. And I ask to table the  Rubio amendment No. 1802 and ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I come to follow my colleague from Texas  to talk about the very issue that he brought up, which is where is  America going with semiconductor manufacturing, design, and  development.   On this last point, I am pretty sure we see things differently. I am  pretty sure that the majority--probably all of the Democrats would be  enthusiastic about supporting both manufacturing in the United States  as well as making sure that if Federal dollars are used, prevailing  wage should be applied. I am sure we will differ on that point.   But I think that we are, at least on our side of the aisle,  supportive of this concept that chip fabrication, chip manufacturing in  the United States of America is an important sector and that we are  facing a chip shortage and that we should do something about it.   If you think about it, semiconductors are like the oil of the 21st  century. They have become an essential aspect. They can be found in  children's toys, in appliances, computers, cell phones, our  telecommunications networks, and advanced national security technology,  as my colleague was mentioning. They enable healthcare, artificial  intelligence applications, financial services, and certainly in the  area of defense.   They have transformed how we communicate, how we learn, how we  socialize. Yet they are so complex and manufacturing so expensive, it  can cost anywhere from $5 to almost $20 billion--$20  [[Page S3847]]  billion is one number I have heard--just to build these facilities.  This is why this issue has become so important.   The United States has had strong leadership in the semiconductor  area, but massive investments from other nations put us at a  disadvantage when it comes to manufacturing. They are subsidizing and  getting tax benefits up to 40 percent to build in Korea than in the  United States of America. The Endless Frontier Act tries to address  that because it really is a national security and telecommunications  policy   In the 1990s, the United States produced over 37 percent of the  global chips supply. As you know, here in the United States, we have 48  percent of the world's aircraft production, but now with these  challenges, as we look at the chip supply, they are down to 12 percent.   I noticed in the Wall Street Journal they said: Why do we care? Why  do we care? They basically are saying that chips in fabrication have  become a commodity and that we don't have to worry about it anymore. As  long as we are winning on the design side, we don't care where it is  manufactured.   Well, if you ask me, that is so 1980s--I mean, the idea that you  could design a product here and then have it manufactured somewhere  else. Maybe that works with shoes or outdoor clothing, but it doesn't  work with something as sophisticated and changing as a high-tech  innovation product like semiconductors. In fact, I would say, if you  really think that type of thinking works, just look at what happened.  It is really pro-COVID thinking. We thought we could have the design  done here and, basically, some of these devices that we use here, like  ventilators, we will just produce them overseas. What could possibly go  wrong? Well, we figured out what could go wrong. If we are not  manufacturing ventilators here in the United States, something could go  wrong, and it did.   The question is, What is going to go wrong if we don't manufacture  chips in the United States of America? The thing I don't think that the  Wall Street Journal quite got right is that they don't understand that  in today's innovation cycle, having a cluster of design, of  manufacturing, of supply chain, of customers--everybody working  together is the new way to have an economic advantage.   In fact, there is a recent study done by a Chicago research  organization. I am going to read from this report. Basically, it is all  about clusters and why clusters are so important:         An industry cluster is a group of firms, related       stakeholders, and supportive institutions that gain       productive advantages from close geographic proximity and       related economies of scale. As groups of related industries       grow and develop, clustering can help lower business costs       and increase the extent of benefits of specialization. Deeper       labor pools, better access to customers and suppliers,       knowledge spillover--these and other advantages are derived       from an environment of balanced competition and       collaboration.    I could go on. I will submit it for the Record. That is what is  happening with semiconductors.   The Asian market has, basically, now become the epicenter for this  level of production, and the question is, Are we just going to forgo  that and end up, basically, with not 12 percent of market share here  but 6 percent of market share? Then our suppliers are going to continue  to go where the investments and the energy and the ideas are.   That is why in the United States of America, where we still have  clusters in various parts of the United States--my colleague from Texas  knows this well because he has a cluster in Texas. My colleague from  Oregon, who was out here earlier, knows because they have a cluster  there. There are clusters in places like Arizona. This is about whether  the United States of America is going to continue to make this  investment ourselves.   Chips are essential to our national security and to  telecommunications. In 1990, we produced over 37 percent of global chip  supply, and we need to continue to make sure that we are going to be an  investor in chip fabrication today.   Today, as I said, we are at an inflection point because of what is  happening in a global basis. According to Goldman Sachs, 169 industries  in the United States have products with embedded semiconductors, and  there will be a 20-percent shortfall of components needed for those  products.   Last month, Caterpillar, headquartered in Illinois, said it  anticipated the chip shortage impairing its ability to meet growing  demand of construction and mining equipment. We are not just talking  about kids' gaming consoles or computers. We are talking about many  sectors of our economy that depend on this.   National security experts argue that if there were a greater trade  war or military conflict, the United States would not be able to fill  its demand for chips for national security and critical infrastructure  needs.   That means people like car manufacturers, appliance manufacturers--if  you think about 5G and new technology--the post-pandemic economy won't  be able to keep moving forward.   The shortage also forced the auto sector to cut 27,000 jobs in April  alone. Earlier this year, General Motors temporarily shut down three  North American plants due to the shortage. Ford cut back Michigan  production of F-150s and the popular Explorer. And Dodge is reducing  worker schedules in a Nevada plant producing the Jeep Grand Cherokee  and Dodge Durango. These are having real-life impacts on us today.   The question is, We had a ripple of this just because of COVID. What  if we had a ripple of this because somebody decided not to supply  things to us? These are things we have to worry about just in a  national security perspective. You have to worry about whether we are  going to get a supply chain that we can depend on. We really are at an  inflection point. We are at an inflection point where we need to do  something about this sector.   One of the issues also is that chip fabrication and private R&D make  huge investments. What we are talking about here represents a very  small R&D investment partnership with the private sector as it relates  to this. We are talking about trying to get more manufacturing jobs  here in the United States.   My colleague was just discussing this sector, overall, and one of the  things that people should think about--and I am pretty sure people at  home won't be able to see this--but these jobs in production and in  various aspects of design and even on some of the other aspects, even  in management and computer, these are all well-paying jobs. These are  jobs that, literally, are the types of jobs we want to be producing in  the United States.   I heard this story about Idaho. Micron, a big company that used to be  a major chip fabrication--they are still doing chip fabrication--but  the number of jobs in Boise, ID, has fallen off, probably in the  thousands, because this production has gone to other places. Now we are  replacing them with call center jobs.   The question is whether we are going to make this investment in a key  technology critical to our national security--critical to a lot of  applications of the technology future, whether it is 5G or AI or  various things--and whether we are going to be a competitor in this  area of a supply chain and cluster that continues to innovate.   We know for a fact that semiconductor jobs in the production area are  literally $94,000 a year. That is why we are fighting for this because  it is a sector, in just the production end, that is high-paying jobs.   So are we going to spend time letting things go overseas and  basically saying, ``OK, they will allow us to have call centers,'' or  are we going to fight for these high-paying jobs in the semiconductor  space that we know will help us maintain our expertise and skill in the  United States?   I ask my colleagues to just think about the fact that this notion  that we design something here and ship it overseas for cheap production  does not fit this bill. That is not what we need to do to maintain  competitiveness, in the information age, on something as important as  semiconductors.   I think our history is rich with people like Thomas Edison and the  Edison Park, which is what we established in New Jersey, or Menlo Park,  or what now exists in Seattle or in various places. People get that  innovation happens in clusters. So, if we are going to innovate, we  have to make sure the United States is attracting this investment. We  have to make sure that we are doing this here, on our shores, with the  expertise and support.  [[Page S3848]]    A lot of my colleagues might say: Well, do you know what? Let's just  have the private sector do this R&D.   As I said, the private sector spends a lot on R&D. In fact, we think  the private sector spends about $377 billion a year on R&D. Yet, as we  know, R&D isn't just done by the private sector for its specific  interest. Basic science and lots of advanced research and applied  science are done by the United States. That is why this bill is  plussing up this number here from the National Science Foundation. We  had discussions here about plussing up the number from the Department  of Energy. Obviously, we had a vote in the Senate of even increasing  the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and its dollars.   What works about the United States of America is that we are an  ecosystem. We are not a top-down. It is not like we are basically the  government, saying: This is what is going to be done. We create an  ecosystem that is really based on American know-how--our ingenuity in  how to get things done.   What we are asking for, as it relates to not only NSF funding in  order to continue the work of R&D as it relates to semiconductors, is  also to make sure that we are going to continue the focus of  manufacturing and design and R&D and development and clustering and  supply chain and companies working together.   I know how important this is because, in the Seattle area, in  Washington State, we are a leader in aerospace technology. We are 49  percent, in the United States, of aerospace manufacturing. If you don't  keep manufacturing, do you think the supply chain will stay in Seattle?  Do you think the supply chain would stay in Seattle forever--all of  those companies? We have hundreds of companies that make products for  Boeing. Do you think they would stay there if it were not there? They  will end up moving where the manufacturing is.   That is what the information age is about, and it is certainly about  that when it comes to technology products. The technology products are  developed faster, quicker, and with the innovation and the input from  their customers. That is why, if you look at these centers around the  United States, they are also the places at which you will find the  biggest users of this technology. They are there, and they are there  because they want to be close to their customers. They want to  understand their customers' needs. They want to have interaction. They  want to have collaboration.   That is what innovation is today. Innovation is doing design and  manufacturing close together. That is how we win. That is why we need  to pass this legislation as it relates to an investment in chip design  and manufacturing R&D and so we continue to attract manufacturing in  the United States.   Back to my colleague from Texas, who I know agrees with this  principle in an underlying way, when the Federal Government wants to  make an investment in actual construction, we say that we should apply  prevailing wage. I have talked to many of these people in the  semiconductor manufacturing-design space. They say: Do you see how  expensive it is to do these plans? Do you see how expensive the  equipment is? It is very expensive; so we need the best workforce. So  guess what. We pay prevailing wage.   So we are saying, because we are putting Federal dollars on the  table, we should pay prevailing wage. They think we should also pay  prevailing wage. I am not speaking for them, but, in general, they feel  like that is when they get their best product.   I know where my side of the aisle is. We are going to be here to make  an investment in this particular sector. We are going to figure out how  to be competitive against Asia in semiconductor manufacturing. We are  going to continue, as Andy Grove said, to be paranoid because we know  that this is a changing landscape, and we are going to follow our  colleagues who have made these decisions and make an investment for the  future.   I ask our colleagues to turn down the motion to strike the underlying  bill, as the underlying bill already has this provision in it, and  let's get about this business of waiving a budget point of order and  deciding to make the investment that we need to make to be competitive  in a key sector of the U.S. economy. If we do that, I guarantee you we  will be well-positioned to continue to move forward, and our national  security will be more secure because we will have made this decision.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I wanted to commend and thank the  Senator from Mississippi for his hard work. I have the great pleasure  of working with him on the Commerce Committee, and I can tell you we  are here tonight--not at this very moment at 10 o'clock but at the  advent of getting to this moment where we can proceed to such important  legislation--thanks to him and his great work as the ranking member on  the Commerce Committee.   I want to personally thank him for that because I think the Senator  described the actual process pretty well. We have two colleagues who  have had a lot of foresight and thought about this issue--Senator  Schumer, who for a long time has discussed America's competitiveness  and what we need to do about it, particularly as it relates to shifting  change and demographics on a lot of foreign policy issues, and our  colleague from Indiana, who has also in the last 2 years put a lot of  work into thinking about the future of AI competitiveness,  manufacturing, and what we need to do to be competitive in the United  States of America. So the Schumer-Young proposal is not new to this  Congress. It was proposed before. And so this is work for many, many,  many months I do think, as Senator Wicker stated, that we should thank  them for their foresight.    I think, depending on what part of America you are from, you have a  perspective about the economy of the future and how we are going to  compete. For me, I am very blessed to represent the State of Washington  with much innovation and really longtime work to get to the point where  we are today.   One thing I would like to depart with is that we didn't get to the  Northwest economy overnight. A lot of thought went into the education  system and the workforce training issues. Sometimes I just say we are  blessed to have people there who stayed and innovated with the  companies that they innovated in.   Where we are today represents decades and decades of work, but it  also gives you a little bit of foresight into the importance of  research and development. The University of Washington is a leader in  research and development with NSF and with predecessors here in the  Senate who--Warren Magnuson specifically--focused on both NIH and NSF  dollars. With the size of an institution with 40,000 students, it is  also a premier research institution.   So that has given us a good footing for the future, the work they  have done and the advent of Microsoft and so many companies with  executives who then also put more into the University of Washington so  we could grow our skill set and keep investing. So it is a long-term  investment.   Our colleague from Indiana and our colleague from New York basically  challenged us to think about what is our R&D investment for the United  States of America and are we competing. Senator Wicker knows that this  is something the Commerce Committee twice before had considered, in  2007 and 2010. He said: By God, we are going to double the R&D budget,  and we are going to compete.   Believe it or not, it was George Bush as President who first authored  a report that said America needs to have a more aggressive  competitiveness policy. He was probably looking to Asia and seeing what  was happening and saying we needed to do more.   The advent of that is, we started down the right road. We tried to  make a commitment. We didn't completely follow through because of the  downturn in the economy. Instead of doubling that R&D budget in a short  period of time--5 to 7 years, and then we thought 11 years--well, it  has turned into 22 years, and we really haven't quite done the job.   To our two colleagues, I thank them. I thank the Senator from  Indiana. I certainly thank the Senator from New York because I think  that without his continued heft behind this issue, saying that it is a  priority--I told him he must have read Andy Grove's book ``Only the  Paranoid Survive'' because he has clearly adopted that attitude as it  relates to America's competitiveness and making sure we make  investments in the semiconductor area--an area he knows well. He really  does believe it needs the R&D investment and focus. I applaud him  because really, without his major push, I don't think we would be here  on the Senate floor tonight.   As my colleague Senator Wicker said, this bill includes a massive  investment in the NSF budget and in the DOE budget, which is kind of  tandem. That is what has happened every time we have had this  discussion. NSF and DOE, the Department of Energy and the National  Science Foundation, have been our key tools for research and  development in key areas that keep manufacturing competitive, keep our  energy sector competitive, and keep our technology competitive. They  have been major investments.   The challenge that we faced is that we also were asking ourselves-- besides trying to double our investment in these areas, we also said we  want to get more out of the investment we have today. We want to  basically get more out of the technology that we are creating and get  it translated into more innovation right away.   This legislation does that by creating a new Tech Director at the  National Science Foundation to, if you will--we have basic research,  applied research--to have translational or user research to more  quickly aid in the adoption of technologies that will help our economy  grow. That was a pretty big step in the legislation.   Of course, Senator Wicker and I believe that investing in the  workforce that we would need with STEM education was also a priority.  So there was a pretty big, hefty boost in science, technology,  engineering, and math in this underlying bill, including saying that  women and minorities in the sciences have to be a priority and we have  to do more to encourage that.   I want to thank Senator Wicker especially for his insistence on a key  provision that I think is also important. Part of this is saying that  we need to be competitive and increase the R&D budget. Part of it is  saying that we need to have more translational science, get more out of  our universities, and have them protect their intellectual property  better. But this is also about having all of America better prepared  for the economy of the future and compete.  [[Page S3862]]    Senator Wicker said: I want 20 percent of this bill, the  legislation--the R&D dollars to go to States that are called EPSCoR- qualifying States. They are regions of the country where we have  identified that we need to strengthen our research capacity. So the 25  States that are qualified as EPSCoR States know, and it is a program  that has been built around strengthening their research and  development. Senator Wicker's insistence on this provision will help  those States grow their research muscle for the future, their research  ecosystem, strengthen their universities, and strengthen the dollars  that go to them. I applaud him for that dedication.   The head of the NSF, the National Science Foundation, will tell you  that our motto for this bill overall or our goal as a nation is to be  for innovation everywhere, connected to opportunities everywhere,  connected to universities. With the provision that Senator Wicker  proposed, we are literally taking another step towards building  that infrastructure everywhere. If you are in Fairbanks, AK, or you are  in Mississippi or some other part of the country, those institutions  will get an extra focus and push to get more research and development.    I like to say that you never know what is going to come out of that.  You never know what is going to come out of one individual at one  institution with a great idea that really charges forward in a new  area. So I think it is a great provision of the legislation.   We have, I think, with the other provisions our colleagues worked  on--Senator Warner and Senator Cornyn--on trying to, in the last NDAA  bill, make us crisply focused on the immense competition that we face  in the semiconductor industry, we really have, I think, before us the  shape of the debate about America's competition. We are not afraid to  put research dollars on the table as a country. Our Nation believes in  that more than other nations. Our people believe that is what has made  our Nation great, and they know that if we keep making that investment,  we are going to grow jobs and the economy. So we have made that  commitment in this legislation.   We have made the commitment to diversify our research, to get more  out of our research and translate that faster. We have made a  commitment to skill and educate a workforce, not only with the  diversity we like to see in science but the geographic diversity we  like to see as well.   We didn't spend a lot of time talking about what is in here for the  Department of Energy. It is not specific as to what the Department of  Energy will do for this, but it is safe to say the Department of  Energy's innovation program and ARPA-E are basically trying to help us  with the next generation of energy technology. But it also includes  carbon sequestration and a whole variety of other areas, nuclear power  and a whole translation of various energy sciences.   I really believe we will be working together. I believe DOE, NSF, our  National Laboratories, our universities--the collaboration that we  heard about in committee will be the kind of growth that comes out of  this legislative effort.   To many Americans at home, all I can say is, we are making another  investment in American know-how, the ability to use our scientific  skills to help create the next generation of work and effort.   I, too, want to thank our staff. I certainly on my side want to thank  our staff director David Strickland and Melissa Porter, Richard-Duane  Chambers, Mary Guenther, and Stacy Baird.   I, too, want to thank the Senator's staff--John Keast, Cheri Pascoe,  and James Mazol--because they have been a great team to work with.   I also want to thank, on Senator Schumer's staff--Mike Kuiken and Jon  Cardinal--because they have been a constant source in all of this.   Of course I thank all the floor team who have been out here working  on this. I know there are other people from this room.   I also thank Senator Wicker's staff, Crystal Tully and Steven Wall.   On my staff, I thank Jonathan Hale and David Marten and Amit Ronen,  who worked on a lot of the energy stuff that was part of this  underlying stuff.   I am sure we will have more to thank later. This is a wish by Senator  Wicker that this would be the wrap-up. I know we are not quite at the  wrap-up, but we are hoping that we will hotline a managers' proposal. I  hope our colleagues will look at that. I hope that our colleagues will  allow us to move forward on that. If they are not going to let us move  forward on that, I wish they would come down to the floor and tell us  that. It is time to move forward on getting the rest of this  legislation through the Senate and move to whatever discussions we are  going to have with the House.   It is safe to say this represents a lot of work by a lot of people.  In the committee, I think we processed before we even got to the  legislation something like 52 amendments prior to the actual day. With  the substitute, I think we processed another 40 or 50 amendments. I  think we had dozens of rollcall votes. That was all in committee.   Out here, we processed lots of legislation to be part of the  managers' amendment. It is safe to say that practically every Member of  the U.S. Senate has had some part or discussion or legislative  suggestions that are a part of this bill. It is, as Senator Wicker  said, a very regular order process, albeit quick at times.   I think we have a lot to do. We have been very challenged as a  Congress to deal with a lot of issues--COVID specifically--but the  competition is not waiting and the competition has different tools. We  have a different government and we believe in collaboration, and  collaboration, yes, takes a little more time.   I think it is going to strengthen us in our ability to compete  because we are going to be on the same page about what we need to get  done. I hope our colleagues will indulge us to move ahead. I hope that  we can get this next managers' amendment and other things voted on very  soon.   I yield the floor.                                 Quorum Call     Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I have a package of amendments that have  been agreed to by both leaders and by the chairs and ranking members of  the relevant committees, so I ask unanimous consent that the following  amendments be agreed to en bloc: Collins 1583, Fischer 1637, Johnson  1701, Shaheen 1758, Rubio 1777, Thune 1851, Wicker 1943, Hagerty 1958,  Cotton 1964, Blunt 1988, Scott of Florida 2000, Ernst-Hassan 2017,  Romney-Menendez 2025, Johnson 2048, Lujan 2082, Rosen 1768, Merkley  1823, Warnock 1980, Murray 1981, Hassan 2001, Warren-Rubio 2104,  Collins 1622, Wicker 1801, Leahy-Tillis 2093, Van Hollen-Tillis 2049,  Blackburn 2085, Cortez Masto 2083, Lankford 1945, Baldwin-Braun 2026,  Hyde-Smith 1933, Hyde-Smith 1841, Merkley-Rubio-Romney 2103, Ossoff  2105, Barrasso 2094, Rubio 2106, and Kaine 2090.    Mr. President, I know my colleague knows the Commerce  process, knows that we went through a very elaborate process in  Commerce, and I know that he has amendments in this proposal. Some of  these have been available since 11, 12 hours ago. People have been  talking about these amendments. So it is time for us to honor the  request of our colleagues to move forward on a managers' package worked  out by the leaders and the relevant chair and ranking member, so I  object to the modification.    Mr. President, my colleague also knows the work of the  Commerce Committee because he is on the Commerce Committee, and this  bill came out of the Commerce Committee 24 to 4. So I know the Senator  knows the work of that legislation.   The remarkable aspect of this legislation is that it did compile  product from various committees, and those committees did their regular  order process. In fact, this process for the last several--you could  say 24 or 48 hours was held up because one committee's product wasn't  considered, and your side said it wanted it considered before we could  move forward. And, guess what, we accommodated that.   So we now have a work product that is, I think, ready to be voted  on--again, in a bipartisan fashion, working together with both leaders  and with committee chairs and the ranking members. So I object to the  modification.    Mr. President.    Mr. President, to recap this process, I respect every  Member's right to express their opinion. That is what regular order is  about.   In committee, we had 233 amendments filed. My colleague from Utah  filed 130 of those. So, yes, the Commerce Committee staff worked  through 130 of Senator Lee's amendments. That is a lot of amendments to  work through. I guarantee you, I am sure we probably would have liked a  little more crystalized concerns and opposition than 130-plus  amendments. We ended up putting 14 of them in the managers' amendment.  We ended up voting on five more during the committee process. So, yes,  I could have been frustrated with that, but we worked through those  amendments.   Now there is this process on the floor where my colleague is  concerned and upset over 900 pages that he voted to accept. The moment  to be concerned about those 900 pages, he could have objected, but he  didn't but now wants to revisit that decision.   So I can propound many requests here, and we can continue to discuss  these, but our colleagues--our leadership on both sides of the aisle  have worked through a process of regular order with our colleagues on a  host of 36 different amendments where--I am looking at this list--many  of them are bipartisan, and I think those Members deserve to have a  vote on their amendments.                         Amendment No. 1527 Withdrawn    Mr. President, I withdraw amendment 1527.
