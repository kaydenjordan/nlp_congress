 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for bringing this  terrific bill to the floor.   Mr. Speaker, the unemployment rate in our great State of Maine is 2.7  percent. This is the lowest rate since the 1950s, and jobs, Mr.  Speaker, are available everywhere for hardworking Mainers who now have  bigger paychecks.   This growing economy, Mr. Speaker, is because taxes are lower and  regulations are fewer. We must keep these reforms going. That is why,  Mr. Speaker, I ask everyone, Republicans and Democrats, to vote ``yes''  on S. 2155.   This bipartisan bill includes two provisions which I have been  pushing for 3 years. First, the Small Business Capital Formation  Enhancement Act makes it easier for small businesses to borrow money  when they need to grow, and that creates more jobs, bigger paychecks,  more opportunity, and more freedom for our families.   Mr. Speaker, secondly, the Senior Safe Act helps protect our  vulnerable seniors against financial scams. The legislation allows, for  example, bank tellers, insurance agencies, and financial advisers to  warn our seniors against draining their savings accounts and wiring the  money to some distant location because someone is pretending to be  their granddaughter in trouble. This bill, the Senior Safe Act, makes  it easier to stop financial scams before they hurt our seniors.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague, Senator Susan  Collins from Maine, for advancing this initiative in the Senate.  Together, we pushed this commonsense provision in both the House and in  the Senate.   I ask everyone, Mr. Speaker, to please vote ``yes'' on this  bipartisan bill, S. 2155, and I thank the chairman for this  opportunity.
