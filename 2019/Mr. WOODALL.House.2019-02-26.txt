 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want you to know it flatters both me and the  gentlewoman from California that you have made it your habit to be down  here during Rules Committee time. It is good to know that you respect  what we do upstairs as much as the members of the committee do.   I always enjoy coming down for the Rules Committee debate, because it  is the only debate on all of Capitol Hill where the Reading Clerk reads  every single word of the bill that we are about to consider.  Ordinarily, we waive that, but the rules don't let you waive it. You  have to read the rule so folks will understand what is happening today.   I happened to time the Reading Clerk today. I didn't put him up to  anything special. He read as he always does. It took him 1 minute and 6  seconds to read the resolution that is before us.   I heard my friend from California talk about the important  constitutional questions that are here before us today. I heard my  friend from California equate our President to discredited despots  around the globe and how we must stand up to prevent that behavior here  in America. I heard my colleagues who took to the floor this morning  for 1 minutes be sanctioned by the Chair and advised to cease engaging  in arguments of personality and attacks against our President.   One minute and 6 seconds it took to read the resolution before us  today, Mr. Speaker, and that is 1 minute and 6 seconds longer than this  resolution has been considered in total in every committee throughout  this Capitol.   I want to say that again. You heard my colleague talk about how  critically important this resolution of disapproval is as it relates to  our constitutional powers. You heard it described as a power grab  equivalent to those of discredited despots. And we haven't talked about  it at all in this Chamber. In committees, not one witness has  testified.   One minute and 6 seconds is how much we have invested in these  nationally important matters.   I listened, Mr. Speaker, as you cautioned Member after Member to  cease engaging in personal attacks on the President during their 1  minutes this morning. Mr. Speaker, I am concerned that that is exactly  what we are doing here today.   If you want to have a debate about Article I and Article II powers  and how we ought to retrieve the power that has slid down Pennsylvania  Avenue through administration after administration after  administration, I am not just your willing partner, I am your  enthusiastic partner and passionate advocate. But that is not the bill  we have before us today. It is not the debate we are going to have  today.   This is another in a long string of measures that have been brought  to the floor of this House that could have been brought in a bipartisan  way. I don't mean one Republican; I don't mean two Republicans; I mean  the majority of Democrats and the majority of Republicans standing  together to speak with one voice on behalf of the American people. But  time and time again, we are missing that opportunity.   This isn't a constitutional issue today, Mr. Speaker, though you  would not know that, because we have not had any witnesses testify.  This is a legislative issue before us today.   There is, in fact, a National Emergencies Act that allows the  President to do extraordinary things if he or she decides there is a  national emergency. That is not unconstitutional. Congress passed the  National Emergencies Act; the President signed the National Emergencies  Act. Perhaps the Supreme Court one day will decide that was an  unconstitutional delegation of power by the Congress, but the Congress  delegated that power in the National Emergencies Act.   The way we talk about this issue, Mr. Speaker, you would think this  is the first time you and I have seen this in the few years we have  been in Congress. Of course, you and I know that is nonsense.   There are 31 other national emergency declarations in effect today-- 31 other national emergency declarations. National emergency  declarations from the Obama administration are still active today.   If we are so concerned about Article I and Article II power grabs,  perhaps these emergency declarations that have been on the books since  the last administration, Congress should deal with those affirmatively  here on the floor.   There are national emergency declarations still in effect from the  Bush administration. There are national emergencies still in effect  from the Clinton administration. Mr. Speaker, there are national  emergencies still in effect from the Carter administration. This House  has made not a single effort to draw back that power from 1600  Pennsylvania Avenue.   Those are legitimate questions. Those are important questions. Those  are things that bring us together as the people's representatives in  this House, not bills designed just to poke a stick at a President who  has real passion and real conviction about issues of real importance.   Do you know what is in this resolution today, Mr. Speaker, what is in  this disapproval resolution today, that will make a difference on the  border in terms of ending human trafficking? Not one thing.   Do you know what is in this resolution today that, if we come  together to pass, will make a difference in terms of drug trafficking  on the border? Not one thing.    What about if we come together to pass this resolution today for the  very serious issue of weapons trafficking across our border? Do you  know what we will do today to fix that? Not one thing.   Victims of sexual assault as they are being trafficked into this  country, do you know what we are going to do to fix that today? Not one  thing.   Do you know how many Dreamers are going to have their hopes realized  today with a pathway to permanency here in the United States of  America? Not one.   Man, we are good at bringing issues that are designed to poke each  other in the eye. We are so good at bringing issues designed to try to  embarrass one and boost another. But I have to tell you, Mr. Speaker,  we are not so great with actually solving real problems.   For the first time in my congressional career just last Congress, Mr.  Speaker, we brought a bill to the floor that would have provided  permanency  [[Page H2114]]  for our Dreamers and that would have provided solutions on our border  for human trafficking, for weapons trafficking, and for drug  trafficking. You know how many Democratic votes we got on that bill,  Mr. Speaker? Not one.   Now, to be fair, it wasn't one bill; it was two bills. Folks said,  hey, if this one is not the right one, let's bring another one. Maybe  this is going to bring people together.   Do you know how many votes we got on the second bill, Mr. Speaker,  from the other side of the aisle? Not one. The only bills that have  come to the floor to provide a pathway for Dreamers in my 8 years in  Congress, and we got not one vote from the other side the aisle.   Is that because the other side of the aisle doesn't believe in those  solutions? No, that is not why. It is because the other side of the  aisle, in its wisdom, deemed that to be a resolution not designed to  support the Dreamers, but designed to divide. I disagree with that  conclusion, but that is the conclusion that was made. Thus, the only  opportunity in a decade we have had to support Dreamers, not one  Democrat stood up and said yes.   I call that a failed opportunity, and I am not interested in figuring  out who is to blame for that failed opportunity.   This is a failed opportunity today, too, Mr. Speaker. Sadly, it is  another in a series of failed opportunities here in 2019.   I believe my colleagues are going to see through the divisiveness of  this resolution, through the charade of constitutionalism right down to  the very core of partisanism that underlies this resolution.   But just remember, 1 minute and 6 seconds, Mr. Speaker. Before I took  to the microphone today, 1 minute and 6 seconds from the Reading Clerk  is all the time this new Congress has dedicated to an issue that you  are going to hear from my colleagues again and again is one of critical  national importance, international importance, constitutional  importance. How can those things be true?   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, it is my great pleasure to yield 3 minutes  to the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Brooks).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Burgess), a member of the Rules Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an  amendment to the rule to bring up the text of H.R. 962, the Born-Alive  Abortion Survivors Protection Act.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, if we pass the resolution, as my friends on  the other side of the aisle have presented it, we will save not one  single life. If we defeat the previous question and move on to H.R.  962, we will, in fact, save lives.   Mr. Speaker, to speak to that issue, I yield 4 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. Wagner), my friend and a great leader  in our conference.    Mr. Speaker, at this time, I yield 4 minutes to the  gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Cole), an appropriator and ranking member  of the Rules Committee.    Mr. Speaker, at this time, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Reed), a member of the class of 2010.  [[Page H2117]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, you just heard an impassioned plea from my friends on  the other side of the aisle about the important constitutional  questions that are before us today, about how the President's emergency  declaration violated those sacred constitutional principles.   Candidly, I don't know if my colleagues are right or not because we  have not had one legal expert come to talk about the National  Emergencies Act. Most of us were not in Congress when it passed several  decades ago, but it is a delegation of authority from Congress to the  executive.                                time  1315    You just heard my friend from New York come to the well and say,  listen, we have been working in a bipartisan way to offer a bill to  rein in those authorities. I think that is important work. I think that  is work that we ought to all be able to agree on. We should be doing  that work first.   I told you earlier, Mr. Speaker, the sum total of all of the time  this institution has spent working on these important constitutional  questions is the 1 minute and 6 seconds our Reading Clerk Josef spent  reading us the resolution today.   We will vote on this rule today. We will vote on the underlying  disapproval today, having never had the committees of jurisdiction hold  even a single hearing.   Now, lest you think there is just no time in the calendar, this  resolution is referred to the Transportation Committee on which I sit.  In fact, I had to leave a Transportation Committee hearing in order to  come up here to do the rule today.   We are working on the Green New Deal in the Transportation Committee  today. We are working on electric vehicles and how to reduce carbon  emissions across the country. Now, I am not saying that is not  important work, but I have not heard one of my colleagues talk about  the dearth of electric vehicles and how that is threatening the future  of our land.   I have heard my colleagues talk about this important constitutional  question that this disapproval brings before us, and, yet, there was  not one hearing on it.   Now, lest you think, Mr. Speaker, that if we deal with this today, we  won't deal with it again. No. We are going to have some hearings on  this resolution. When? Later in the week after it passes.   Now, I don't know if that is a pattern that we are going to get into.  I hope that it is not. Having had no hearings and no witnesses testify  on this issue, we are going to have an Appropriation Subcommittee  hearing later this week to talk about exactly these issues, where the  money is coming from, what the impact of that is, and whether or not it  is wise.   We are going to have a hearing later this week in the Judiciary  Committee talking about the National Emergencies Act, and whether or  not it permits this kind of activity, and what kind of changes ought to  be made.   This resolution will have already been considered. This vote will  have already been taken, but we will eventually get around to having  thoughtful conversation about this.   Mr. Speaker, I close where I began. There is more that unites us as  Americans than divides us. And even in politics, there is more that  unites this institution than divides us. Making sure that 1600  Pennsylvania Avenue only is exercising those authorities delegated to  it by either the Constitution or this Congress, is a shared value.   But if you listen to the debate here on the floor, from the Speaker's  chair, you had to caution our colleagues against engaging in attacks of  personality against the President. We heard debate, not of thoughtful  constitutional principles, but of hateful administration policies.   Mr. Speaker, I will tell my friends, I don't believe those words,  those actions, or those efforts are going to bring us one bit closer to  the shared values that we have in this institution.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to reject the rule today and vote  against the previous question so that we can bring up a bill that will  save lives. This bill will save not one life; will prevent not one drug  trafficker from coming into the country; will protect not one migrant  family. It will do nothing, Mr. Speaker, to solve real problems that  face this country.   If we defeat the previous question, we can at least take a  commonsense step toward doing exactly that. Vote ``no'' on this rule,  vote ``no'' on the previous question, and let's commit ourselves to  finding a way to come together.   If you believe there is more that divides us than unites us, these  first 45 days of this session have been just perfect for you. But if  you believe, as I do, that we can do better, let today be the end of  the partisan attacks. Let today be the end of bringing bills to the  floor designed to make a point instead of make a difference, and let's  make tomorrow better.  [[Page H2118]]    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
