 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the INVEST in  America Act.   This bill provides funding that will accelerate road repairs, reduce  congestion, and shore up our water systems, all while creating good- paying jobs and building sustainable, green infrastructure.   Under the INVEST in America Act, Georgia will receive a $2.6 billion  increase in funding for core infrastructure programs over the next 5  years, a 38 percent increase. With such an investment, we need to be  innovative, forward-looking, and climate conscious.   The bill includes many of my FutureFit The Suburbs initiatives,  providing funding for the expansion of greenways, express lane transit  options to decrease congestion, renewable energy projects, innovative  wastewater technology, and more.   The INVEST in America Act will jump-start innovation that will lead  to economic growth in small towns, big cities, and suburban areas like  mine.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote in support of the INVEST in  America Act.
