 Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Nadler for the time.   I served the first 3\1/2\ years of my legal career in the police  department. I had a badge and a gun. I know policemen as well, if not  better, than almost anybody in this body.   I tried to give them a gun yesterday because there was a bill on the  floor to let them take their revolvers with them when they retired in  good standing, but the Republicans had it amended to where they could  also take automatic weapons and didn't have to be in good standing. We  can't do things purely for the police.    In this situation, I offered an amendment to advocate the positions  of the International Association of Chiefs of Police and other police  organizations to say that we should have limits on weapons on the  streets, on armor-piercing bullets, and on assault weapons.   Police don't want those on the streets against them. Yet, it wasn't  allowed to be heard. It was offered twice again by Mr. Cicilline. It  wasn't allowed to be heard.   Just like when children are killed, when people are killed in clubs,  when people are killed in churches, when people are killed in Las Vegas  on the streets, this is thoughts and prayers because the NRA and the  concern of people having guns and bullets comes before police and their  protection.   This is thoughts and prayers, and it is police memorial week lite.
