 Madam Speaker, I support this rule and commend the  chairs who worked diligently to produce funding bills that reflect our  goal to ``Build Back Better'' for the American people.   As vice chair of the Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human  Services, Education, and Related Agencies, I am delighted that this  bill lives up to its reputation as the ``People's Bill,'' thanks to the  work and commitment of its chair, Rosa DeLauro.   The bill has strong outlays in job training and apprenticeship  programs, increased funding for childcare and worker protections,  transformative investments to help adults in all communities access  post-secondary educational opportunities, and critical investments to  ensure our children can return to school safely and receive high- quality education to overcome the pandemic setbacks.   The Labor, HHS, and Education bill has historic investments to  strengthen our public health system and ensure the infrastructure and  resources needed to address future public health challenges.   This includes increased investments in REACH, the Childhood Lead  Poisoning Prevention Program, the Climate and Health Program, and the  Chronic Disease Education and Awareness Program.   As co-chair of the Maternity Care Caucus, I am grateful for the  strong investments in mothers and babies, like the large increases in  the MCH block grant, the Healthy Start Program, and Safe Motherhood  programs. I am also pleased the bill expands the capacity of the  Maternal Mental Health Hotline, the SAMHSA Pregnant and Postpartum  Women Program and midwifery education funding within the Scholarships  for Disadvantaged Students.   Madam Speaker, President Biden said: ``Don't tell me what you value.  Show me your budget, and I will tell you what you value.''   I thank all the subcommittee chairs for outlining our values so  distinctly in their appropriation bills, and I urge passage of the rule  and this minibus.
