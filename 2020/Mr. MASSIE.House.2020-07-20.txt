 Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the Langevin  national cyber director amendment, which would expand an already  bloated administrative state by creating a new position within the  White House, basically, a resident lobbyist for big tech vendors and a  legion of 75 unaccountable career government bureaucrats. This new  department is like a self-licking ice cream cone, paid for by taxpayers  and accountable to virtually no one.   The President opposes this new position, as should anyone who  believes that laws should be written by elected Congressmen and carried  out by an elected President.   Madam Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.  [[Page H3503]]
