 Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, it has been a treat listening to my colleagues  with their newfound respect for private business and not wanting to  have regulatory interference with private business.   Well, here we are talking about the REINS Act. What we are trying to  do is ensure that you can't have unelected bureaucrats making decisions  that have massive economic impacts and have major impacts on the lives  of the American people.   With all due respect to the ranking member from Judiciary, what we  are talking about is not saying you are ending what the folks in the  administrative state are saying about regulations. What we are saying  is that they have got to come to Congress if it is going to have a  major impact. They have got to come demonstrate what it is they are  proposing.   If they have got some issue that involves radiation, if they have got  some issue that involves some complexities, come make the case if you  are going to have a massive economic impact, like $100 million.   Here I am offering an amendment that goes a little bit beyond that;  not just the economic impact, but the impact on our society, the impact  on businesses to be able to function, the impact on people to be able  to go out and carry out their lives.   Amendment No. 14 that I am offering here expands the definition of a  major rule in the REINS Act to include any rule that references one of  President Biden's major so-called diversity, equity, and inclusion  executive orders.   This means that Congress would vote up or down on any rule  promulgated by the executive branch that pushes radical gender or  racial ideologies regardless of whether it is estimated to carry a  fiscal or economic impact.   Why? Because the American people are tired of this stuff. They are  tired of seeing this radical agenda being promoted by the Federal  Government and pressed upon the private citizens of this country.   The executive orders covered in this amendment are meant to sow  division among the American people in pursuit of radical racial and  gender ideologies. For example, Executive Order 13985 is designed to  ensure racial equity and support for underserved communities throughout  the Federal Government.   That sounds nice in a title, but the fact is, it has directed every  Federal agency to conduct equity assessments to determine whether new  policies, regulations, or guidance documents may be necessary to  advance equity in agency actions and programs. It has effectively made  diversity, equity, and inclusion one of the most important factors,  including at the Department of Defense.   We are not focusing on making sure our Department of Defense can  defeat China; we are focusing on making it a social engineering  experiment wrapped in a uniform. I wonder why we are having trouble  recruiting people.   It has been referenced that CMS rules on health equity flirt with  forcing providers to prioritize healthcare based on race. There are  news articles about this. It has been referenced that the EPA and the  Department of the Interior have rules that advance so-called  environmental justice. Executive Order 13988 is titled: ``Preventing  and Combating Discrimination on the Basis of Gender Identity or Sexual  Orientation.'' Again, the title sounds, oh, that must be all nice and  good. Well, it led to an HHS proposed rule that could compel hospitals  receiving Federal funds to perform gender-affirming care, including  surgeries. It has been used to justify moves by the VA to provide  [[Page H2914]]  gender-affirming care to veterans on taxpayer dollars.   Executive Order 14021 is titled: ``Guaranteeing an Educational  Environment Free From Discrimination on the Basis of Sex, Including  Sexual Orientation or Gender Identity.'' However, the problem is, it is  discriminating against women, which Riley Gaines knows all too well  because she was forced to swim against a dude, and we all know she was  forced to swim against a dude.   It was referenced in the Department of Education's proposed rule to  leverage Title IX to restrict schools' ability to prohibit biological  males from competing in girls' sports. Ironically, the rule recognizes  schools may need flexibility to issue such a restriction for ``fairness  in competition or preventing sports-related injury.''   The fact is, the American people are sick and tired of politicizing  our entire culture through the executive actions that are being  executed by this President without check from Congress, which we don't  believe would have a chance of getting through the people's House.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, if my Democratic colleagues support these  executive orders so much, if they believe that these are the best  things since sliced bread, that we need to have all of these orders  that are turning our entire society upside down, that are redefining  traditional roles in society that we understand the difference between  men and women; if they are so excited about those policies, then why  are they worried about voting on them? What is the problem?   Why must they just be executed by a faceless bureaucrat at the other  end of Pennsylvania Avenue or in the alphabet soup of agencies in this  town?   Why shouldn't this body, the people's House, and the Senate, speak?  That is all we are talking about in the REINS Act and these amendments.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, with respect to what the gentleman was just  talking about with the marriage vote last year, regardless of one's  belief and vote on the outcome of that policy, the point is, Congress  voted.   The fact is, here we have rules being promulgated by bureaucrats that  the people's House never gets a chance to speak to other than through a  Congressional Review Act, which you are only allowed to do in a minimal  amount of time. The REINS Act actually gives power to the people's  House and Article I under the Constitution.   I want to do that here on another issue.   We would like to expand the definition of ``major rule'' to include  any rule likely to result in an increase in mandatory vaccinations.  This means Congress would vote to approve any rule promulgated by the  executive branch to push mandatory vaccines.   Last Congress, remember, we were told to wait for the courts to save  the American people from an unconstitutional vaccine? While we fiddled  and waited for the courts to catch up, millions of Americans were  forced to choose between their job and a jab, that they likely didn't  need and that didn't stop transmission.  [[Page H2915]]    On September 29, 2021, President Biden announced vaccine mandates for  upwards of 100 million Americans, forcing Americans to choose between  their jobs and a jab.   On March 11, 2023, Biden finally ended his unconstitutional vaccine  mandates at the end of the COVID emergency, frankly, because we were  forcing it and forcing the question.   The OSHA mandate, which was struck down by the Supreme Court and  formally withdrawn on January 28, 2022, a year prior, required all  businesses with 100-plus employees to either vaccine or test.   Why should we wait on the Supreme Court to check the  unconstitutional, unlawful, and tyrannical actions by an executive  branch that shut down the greatest economy in the history of the world,  forcing people to choose between their livelihoods, their ability to  make money, their families, their ability to go to school, the ability  of a nurse to be able to go in and perform her job in a hospital? We  did that. Let's not forget that we did that.   We watched Secretary Becerra fumbling yesterday, fumbling in a  hearing, unable to answer the question: Can you tell me, sir, whether  or not it was any benefit whatsoever for 2-year-old kids to be forced  to wear masks and we had mandates through the Head Start program? He  refused to answer the question in committee because he knew full well  he had no good answer to that question.   He knows it, and everybody in America knows it. This is about  wrestling power away from a bureaucratic state that shut down this  economy, harmed the American people, and it should never happen again.   That is the point of the REINS Act, to wrestle power back from  Article II and the executive branch no matter who is there.   The Trump administration's hands: Unclean.   The Biden administration's hands: Unclean.   This is a nonpartisan statement.   The people's House should speak. We should stand up to the tyranny of  an executive branch that overstepped its bounds and restricted the  freedom and liberties of the American people and harmed them.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1345     Madam Chair, well, I am tempted to yield all my time to the  gentleman from New York because he is basically making the case for me  more effectively than I can.   The gentleman from New York is basically acknowledging everything  that I am here saying that I am trying to do to protect the American  people from the tyrannical state of the executive branch, but in this  case, my Democratic colleagues on the other side of the aisle.   I want everybody in America to understand what they just heard from  the ranking member of the House Committee on the Judiciary in the  United States House of Representatives.   Your 2-year-old should be forced to be masked.   That is what the ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee just  said here on the floor of the House of Representatives, that the power  of the government, the full power of the Federal Government should be a  part of ensuring and forcing your children, your 2-year-old child to be  masked.   We heard it yesterday when the Secretary of HHS refused to actually  answer that question, so I am really glad to hear that the ranking  member of the House Committee on the Judiciary acknowledges what  everybody in America understands, which is that the Democratic Party  led by the President and by my Democratic colleagues in the House and  the Senate are fully comfortable with the power of the government being  used to shut down your businesses, force you out of work, unless you  take an experimental vaccine that has not been proven to actually do  what the gentleman just said, which is with respect to transmissions.   More importantly, my father, who is 80 years old, is dealing with the  ravages of polio. I firmly understand the importance of vaccines, and I  am proud that my children and I have been able to be protected by those  vaccines, fully tested after years of testing.   To say that this politicized vaccine should have been used to shut  down the economy and to kill the ability of my constituents to be able  to go about their lives, and to force children into the corner wearing  masks to get set back years in their education, that is precisely why  this amendment matters. It is precisely why we are here reining in the  Federal Government, and it is precisely why this amendment would make  this a better piece of legislation, and why I hope my colleagues would  support it.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I move that the Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Waltz) having assumed the chair, Mrs. Gonzalez-Colon, Acting Chair of  the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported  that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 277)  to amend chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, to provide that  major rules of the executive branch shall have no force or effect  unless a joint resolution of approval is enacted into law, had come to  no resolution thereon.                            ____________________
