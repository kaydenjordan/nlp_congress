 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (S. 760) to enable registered apprenticeship programs to  better serve veterans, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                   S. 760         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Support for Veterans in       Effective Apprenticeships Act of 2019''.       SEC. 2. IMPROVED APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM COORDINATION BETWEEN                     THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR AND THE DEPARTMENT OF                     VETERANS AFFAIRS.         (a) Definitions.--In this Act:        (1) Registered apprenticeship program.--The term       ``registered apprenticeship program'' means an apprenticeship       program registered under the Act of August 16, 1937 (50 Stat.       664; commonly referred to as the ``National Apprenticeship       Act'').        (2) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary       of Labor.        (b) Additional Registered Apprenticeship Program       Requirements.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law,       for any program applying to become a registered       apprenticeship program on or after the date that is 180 days       after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary       shall--        (1) acquire from the program sponsor a written assurance       that the sponsor--        (A) is aware of the availability of educational assistance       for a veteran or other individual eligible under chapters 30       through 36 of title 38, United States Code, for use in       connection with a registered apprenticeship program;        (B) will make a good faith effort to obtain approval for       educational assistance described in subparagraph (A) for, at       a minimum, each program location that employs or recruits a       veteran or other individual eligible for educational       assistance under chapters 30 through 36 of title 38, United       States Code; and        (C) will not deny the application of a qualified candidate       who is a veteran or other individual eligible for educational       assistance described in subparagraph (A) for the purpose of       avoiding making a good faith effort to obtain approval as       described in subparagraph (B);        (2) in accordance with paragraphs (5) and (12) of section       29.5(b) of title 29, Code of Federal Regulations (as in       effect on the day before the date of enactment of this Act),       require the program sponsor, to the extent practicable, to       provide standards that contain provisions to grant advanced       standing or credit, and provide increased wages commensurate       to such standing or credit, for any veteran or other       individual eligible for educational assistance under chapters       30 through 36 of title 38, United States Code, who--        (A) is enrolled in the registered apprenticeship program;       and        (B)(i) has a demonstrated competence applicable to the       apprenticeship occupation; or        (ii) has acquired experience, training, or skills through       military service that is applicable to the apprenticeship       occupation; and        (3) when the Secretary approves the registered       apprenticeship program, provide a copy of the program's       certificate of registration to the State approving agency       designated under chapter 36 of title 38, United States Code,       in the State where the program is located.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks, and insert extraneous material on S. 760, the Support for  Veterans in Effective Apprenticeships Act of 2019.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of S. 760, Support for Veterans  in Effective Apprenticeships Act. This legislation is a commonsense  approach to helping men and women who have laid their life on the line  for our freedom.   So many of our veterans transition to civilian life and need to  develop a skill to get good-paying jobs. Yet, many are not suited for  traditional education pathways. This is where registered apprenticeship  programs are so important, and this legislation takes important steps  to increasing veterans' access to complete financial assistance they  can use to connect to a registered apprenticeship program.   Registered apprenticeships are our Nation's most successful federally  funded workforce development with a 94 percent placement rate for  workers who complete a registered apprenticeship, and an average  starting salary of $70,000 a year. The bill would ensure more veterans  access to these high-quality programs by:   One, requiring the Department of Labor, DOL, to ensure employers are  working with their State veterans affairs agencies to obtain education  benefits available for veterans;   Two, improving the coordination between the DOL and the VA, requiring  the DOL to provide information to the VA on newly registered  apprenticeship programs to enable the VA to be more proactive in  outreach to registered apprenticeship programs not yet approved for GI  bill benefits; and   Three, ensuring that employers grant advanced standing or credit, and  provide increased wages commensurate to such standing or credit to  veterans or  [[Page H1575]]  other eligible individuals who can demonstrate competencies or  experience, training or skills through their military service.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this  important legislation, which will take real steps to improve veterans  and their families access to high-quality registered apprenticeship  programs.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, if the  gentleman from Kansas is, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   The Support for Veterans in Effective Apprenticeships Act, S. 760,  will assist our veterans and their families in accessing the high- quality pathways that registered apprenticeships provide.   As I said before, we owe it to our brave veterans to set them up for  a life of self-sufficiency and dignity. This legislation does not  create another bureaucratic layer that veterans must navigate, instead,  it requires coordination. Coordination between the DOL and the VA that  will reduce barriers for employers and veterans and accessing financial  assistance they can use in connection with the registered  apprenticeship program.   We have all heard stories of veterans having to navigate complex  requirements to access benefits that, quite honestly, they have earned  and deserve. This legislation proves that this Congress has heard our  veterans, and we are taking concrete steps to reduce barriers by  cutting red tape.   Mr. Speaker, I don't know why anyone would be opposed to that, which  is why I urge my colleagues to support the legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (H.R. 3598) to amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 to  automatically discharge the loans of certain veteran borrowers, and for  other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3598         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Federally Requiring Earned       Education-debt Discharges for Vets Act'' or the ``FREED Vets       Act''.       SEC. 2. AUTOMATIC LOAN DISCHARGE FOR CERTAIN VETERAN                     BORROWERS.         Section 437(a) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20       U.S.C. 1087(a)) is amended--        (1) by striking paragraph (2) and inserting the following:        ``(2) Disability determinations.--With respect to a       borrower who has been identified under clause (i) or (ii) of       paragraph (4)(A), the Secretary shall--        ``(A) consider the borrower permanently and totally       disabled for the purpose of discharging the loans of the       borrower under this subsection;        ``(B)(i) notify the borrower of the intent of the Secretary       to discharge the loans of the borrower under this subsection;       and        ``(ii) only if section 108(f)(5) of the Internal Revenue       Code of 1986 does not apply to such a loan discharge for the       calendar year, include as part of such notice a statement       informing the borrower that such loan discharge may be       includible in the gross income of the borrower for purposes       of such Code;        ``(C) provide the borrower with an opportunity to opt-out       of such loan discharge during the 60 day period beginning on       the date on which the Secretary transmits the notice required       under subparagraph (B) to the borrower; and        ``(D) after the expiration of such period, discharge the       loans of the borrower under this subsection, without any       further action by the borrower (except that this subparagraph       shall not apply to a borrower who opts  [[Page H1576]]       out of such discharge under subparagraph (C)).''; and        (2) by adding at the end the following:        ``(4) Matching program.--        ``(A) In general.--Not less than twice per year, the       Secretary of Education and the Secretary of Veterans Affairs       shall carry out a computer matching program under which the       Secretary of Education identifies a borrower--        ``(i) who has been assigned a rating of total disability by       the Secretary of Veterans Affairs for a service-connected       disability (as defined in section 101 of title 38, United       States Code); or        ``(ii) who has been determined by the Secretary of Veterans       Affairs to be unemployable due to a service-connected       condition.        ``(B) Minor discrepancies.--With respect to each borrower       who would have been identified under clause (i) or (ii) of       subparagraph (A) but for a minor discrepancy between the       information of the borrower maintained by the Secretary of       Education and the Secretary of Veterans Affairs (such as a       name discrepancy post-marriage, a missing hyphen, a       transposed number or letter, or other typo), the Secretary of       Education and the Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall work       together to correct such minor discrepancy of such       borrower.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and insert extraneous material on H.R. 3598, the FREED Vets  Act.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I rise in strong support of H.R. 3598, the Federally Requiring Earned  Education-Debt Discharges for Vets Act or FREED Vets Act.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues, Conor Lamb, Brian Fitzpatrick,  and all the other coleads for their work to ensure that those who have  served our Nation, and are now totally and permanently disabled, do not  face additional burden to get relief from their student loan debt.   This legislation will improve the lives of nearly 40,000 veterans who  have a service-related disability by requiring the Secretary of  Education to automatically discharge their Federal student loan debt.   The Higher Education Act of 1965 requires the Secretary of Education  to discharge the Federal student loans of individuals who are totally  and permanently disabled but does not establish a process. For too  long, veterans with a service-connected disability have fallen through  the cracks. Because of that, they have been forced to navigate a  complicated and confusing system, while being straddled with debt. We  owe our disabled veterans a better option.   So, in 2018, the Department of Education launched a data-sharing  initiative with the Department of Veterans Affairs to identify  borrowers eligible for relief from their student loan debt.                                time  1315    In 2019, the Department of Education started to automize loan  discharge for these veterans, but it has been stalled. This bill will  require the Secretary to continue matching borrowers with data from  Veterans Affairs to identify and automatically discharge the debt of  matched individuals, eliminating burden on our veterans.   These brave individuals who served our country and are now totally  and permanently disabled should not have to carry the burden of their  debt, especially when we have the information and the ability to  eliminate all sorts of bureaucratic and, quite frankly, unnecessary red  tape.   I am proud to support this legislation which creates a clear process  for disabled veterans to receive the relief they are entitled to under  the law.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Connecticut (Mr. Courtney).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman  from Pennsylvania (Mr. Lamb), the sponsor of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   As my colleagues have heard today, this legislation would require the  Department to continue ensuring that veterans who are totally and  permanently disabled can have their student loan debt discharged  without unnecessary complexity.   Think about it, without unnecessary complexity.   All this legislation does is streamline a process so those who have  been totally and permanently disabled can have peace of mind and  economic freedom. We owe it to those who have served our country to  make this process as simple as possible, and I urge my colleagues to  support this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
