 Mr. Chairman, Republicans and Democrats agree: Americans  pay too much for prescription drugs. We agree we need to do something  about it. We agree our friends and loved ones need access to lifesaving  cures and treatments.   Americans want us to work together in a bipartisan way to get things  done; yet, today, we are considering Speaker Pelosi's partisan bill.  This is an exercise in futility. Not only will it stop an estimated 100  new lifesaving drugs, it has no chance of being signed into law.   I care about the millions of Americans, like my late grandmother,  living with Alzheimer's and the thousands of Americans diagnosed with  cancer every single day and the children who face life-altering  diagnoses, like spinal muscular atrophy, epilepsy, or cystic fibrosis.  I want them to have hope, and I want them to have access to the very  best medicine. That is why we introduced H.R. 19, bipartisan  legislation that could be signed into law by President Trump this year.   So let's stop the partisan theatrics and get serious about the  problem that people are begging us to fix.
