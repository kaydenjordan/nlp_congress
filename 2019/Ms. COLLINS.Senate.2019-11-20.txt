 Mr. President, I rise to join my colleague, the senior  Senator from Vermont, in introducing the Runaway and Homeless Youth and  Trafficking Prevention Act. This bill would update and reauthorize the  Runaway and Homeless Youth Act programs, which have provided life- saving services and housing for America's homeless youth for more than  forty years.   Homelessness is affecting youth in unprecedented numbers. According  to a recent study by Voices of Youth Count, an estimated 4.2 million  young people experience homelessness at some point each year. Some of  these youth may stay away from home for a few nights, while others have  been living on the streets for years. Approximately 73 percent  experienced homelessness lasting more than one month. The study also  found that homelessness is just as prevalent in rural communities as it  is in urban communities.   And sadly, these statistics likely underestimate the scale of this  problem. This month, I met with teachers and specialists from Lewiston,  Maine, who work directly with young people in Lewiston High School  whose families experience homelessness. We talked about the pressures  that student homelessness places on teachers, school administrators,  and their already strapped resources, and, of course, on the children  and teens themselves. Although schools often serve as a first stop for  assistance, the Runaway and Homeless Youth and Trafficking Prevention  Act would reauthorize and strengthen the programs that help homeless  youth meet their immediate needs, and it would help secure long-term  residential services for those who cannot be reunified with their  families safely.   The three Runaway and Homeless Youth Act programs--the Basic Center  Program, the Street Outreach Program, and the Transitional Living  Program--help community-based organizations reach these young people  when they need support the most. These programs help runaway and  homeless youth avoid the juvenile justice system, and early  intervention can help them to escape victimization and trafficking.   As Chairman of the Senate Housing Appropriations Subcommittee,  working to end the scourge of homelessness--among both youth and  adults--has been one of my top priorities. Along with Senator Jack  Reed, I created a grant program to reduce youth homelessness. According  to the National Alliance to End Homelessness, there has been a 15  percent drop in chronic homelessness since 2007. We must build on this  success. Homeless youth should have the same opportunities to succeed  as their peers, and this bill is an important step in that direction.   In Maine, our homeless shelters are critical partners in the fight to  end human trafficking. Earlier this year, I hosted U.S. Secretary of  Housing and Urban Development Ben Carson in Lewiston. We visited New  Beginnings, where we saw firsthand how Runaway and Homeless Youth Act  resources are  [[Page S6721]]  providing essential safety nets for young people in need. Staff at New  Beginnings help young people with case management, find referrals to  local and State agencies, assist with housing needs and access to  shelter, and connect them to local educational and employment programs.   These programs produce results. In 2015, I held a hearing during  which Brittany Dixon, a former homeless youth from Auburn, Maine,  testified about her personal experience with New Beginnings. After  becoming homeless as a teenager, New Beginnings gave her the help and  support she needed to develop critical life skills and become self- sufficient. She went on to earn a college degree and obtain a full-time  job as an education technician at an elementary school.   Mr. President, teens run away and become homeless for many reasons.  They are also at high risk of victimization, abuse, criminal activity,  and even death. The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children  estimates that, in 2017, one in seven of nearly 25,000 youth reported  to them as runaways were sex trafficking victims. In Maine, recent  reports show that of the more than 10,000 reported human trafficking  cases last year, 26 percent involved minors. Several hundreds of these  victims identified as runaway or homeless youth. This population is at  greater risk of suicide, unintended pregnancy, and substance abuse.  Many are unable to continue with school and are more likely to enter  our juvenile justice system.   Our bill focuses on this tragic problem by supporting wrap-around  services for victims of trafficking and sexual exploitation. Congress  has passed legislation in recent years to combat these horrific crimes  and support survivors, and the policies and tools included in the  Runaway and Homeless Youth and Trafficking Prevention Act are important  pieces of the Federal response to human trafficking.   The data also show that a growing number of homeless youth identify  as LGBT. According to the Voices of Youth Count report, LGBT young  people are twice as likely to be homeless. Our bill would ensure that  those seeking services through these Federal programs are not denied  assistance based on their race, color, religion, national origin, sex,  sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability.   Mr. President, the Runaway and Homeless Youth and Trafficking  Prevention Act will support those young people who run away, are kicked  out, or are disconnected from families. A caring and safe place to  sleep, eat, grow, study, and develop is critical for all young people.  The programs reauthorized through this legislation help extend those  basic services to the most vulnerable youth in our communities.   I thank Senator Leahy for his leadership on this bill and urge my  colleagues to support it.                                  ______                                         By Mr. DURBIN:   S. 2922. A bill to permit Amtrak to bring civil actions in Federal  district court to enforce the right set forth in section 24308(c) of  title 49, United States Code, which gives intercity and commuter rail  passenger transportation preference over freight transportation in  using a rail line, junction, or crossing; to the Committee on Commerce,  Science, and Transportation.
