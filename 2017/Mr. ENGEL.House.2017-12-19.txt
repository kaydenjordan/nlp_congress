 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from New York. You know, I  have been here a long time now, and I have to say: This is one of the  worst pieces of legislation I have ever seen; one of the worst  processes I have ever seen. You know, when you were a kid, and you went  to high school and college, and you learned how a bill becomes a law,  well, take that and throw it out because the Republican leadership here  doesn't want to work with Democrats.   The reason no Democrats are working with you is you shut us out. You  won't let us have any input. You won't do anything with us, and this is  not the way to govern, absolutely not. You know, someone near and dear  to me once said: The Republican Party is the party of the rich person,  and the Democratic Party is the party of the working person.   If that was ever true, it certainly is true today. Rich people do  really, really well. Middle class and the poor people don't do well at  all. In fact, the corporate tax breaks last for years and years and  years, and the other tax breaks for the middle class expire in 5 years.  This helps the rich; it hurts the poor; it helps the middle class.   Even Ronald Reagan tried to be bipartisan and have Democrats work  with him. And whatever happened to my friends on the Republican side,  lectures about fiscal responsibility? This blows a hole in the budget.  It is irresponsible. My State of New York, which is a donor State, is  getting screwed. That is all I can say.
