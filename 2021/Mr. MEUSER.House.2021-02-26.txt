 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas for  yielding.   Madam Speaker, over the past year, Congress has allocated nearly $4  trillion to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. Now Democrat leadership  is following through on a campaign promise made by President Biden to  spend another $2 trillion.   Madam Speaker, further assistance is appropriate for those  individuals, families, and businesses who have been hit the hardest,  including restaurants; but this bill fails to recognize the improving  economic conditions, as well as the fact that more than $1 trillion  from previous relief packages remains unspent.   Just 9 percent of this bill goes towards combating the virus, and  just 1 percent is directed for vaccines. Instead, the apparent  priorities for Democrat leadership include a bailout for mismanaged  States, pension funds, an increase in the minimum wage, and half a  billion dollars for the arts and humanities.   Madam Speaker, Congress has already provided $68 billion for our  schools, more than double the CDC's highest estimate of what it would  take for our schools to open safely. We should be able to unite in  supporting an economic recovery, open our schools, increase testing,  and ensure the efficient distribution of vaccines.
