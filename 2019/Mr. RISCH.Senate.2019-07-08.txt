Special armor vulnerability data for both       chemical and kinetic energy rounds are classified SECRET.       Engineering design and manufacturing data related to special       armor are also classified SECRET.        3. AGT 1500 Gas Turbine Propulsion System. The use of a gas       turbine propulsion system in the MIA2T Abrams tank is a       unique application of armored vehicle power pack technology.       The AGT-1500 engine and X-1100 transmission are not       classified. Manufacturing processes associated with the       production of turbine blades, recuperator, bearings and       shafts, and hydrostatic pump and motor, are proprietary and       therefore are commercially competition sensitive.        4. Compartmentation. A major survivability feature of the       Abrams Tank is the compartmentation of fuel and ammunition.       Compartmentation is the positive separation of the crew and       critical components from combustible materials so that in the       event the fuel or ammunition ignites or is detonated by an       incoming round, the crew is fully protected. As demonstrated       during the Abram Live Fire tests, compartmentation       significantly enhances crew survivability and substantially       reduces the likelihood of the tank being immobilized by an       ammunition explosion and fire. Sensitive information (SBU)       includes the performance of the ammunition compartments as       well as the compartment design parameters.        5. The CROWS-LP (M153A2El) is a commander's weapon station.       It allows for under armor operation of weapons--M2HB, M2Al,       M240B and M240. The CROWS-LP is an updated version of the       M153A2 CROWS and is approximately 10 inches lower in height.       The CROWS-LP increases crew visibility over the weapon       station. The fire control system of the CROWS-LP allows an       operator to fire on a target from either a stationary or       moving platform. The CROWS-LP integrates a day camera (VIM-      C), thermal camera (TIM 1500) and laser range finder (STORM/      STORM-PI) is UNCLASSIFIED.        6. M76 Infra-Red (IR) Grenade. The M76 InfraRed (IR)       grenade is UNCLASSIFIED but sensitive. The grenade uses a       brass particle fill that is specifically designed, when       shattered by a high explosive shock wave, to disperse in a       cloud of specific sized particles. These particles obscure       the visual through the far infrared portions of the       electromagnetic spectrum. As a result, this grenade defeats       night sights, thermal viewers, laser designators, laser       rangefinders, and any other equipment that relies on visual       or infrared active or passive technologies. The properties of       the brass fill are easily reverse engineered, and therefore       could be used to defeat U.S. imaging and targeting systems on       the battlefield. The highest level of information that could       be transferred with the sale of this round is UNCLASSIFIED.        7. 120mm Kinetic Energy-Tungsten (KE-W) ammunition. This is       a commercially developed item and is not warranted by the US       Government. All components of the cartridge, 120mm Kinetic       Energy-Tungsten are UNCLASSIFIED. The capabilities of this       cartridge, to include the terminal effects, target impact       dispersion, and armor defeating capabilities, are classified       CONFIDENTIAL, except for armor penetration test results       against Special Armored Targets, which are classified SECRET,       or the same level of classification as the target, whichever       is greater. The tungsten processing and penetrator       manufacturing methods are sensitive data. No technological       information regarding the tungsten penetrator material will       be supplied with the cartridges being considered for foreign       military sales. The highest level of information that could       be transferred with the sale of this round is UNCLASSIFIED.        8. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain       knowledge of the hardware and software elements, the       information could be used to develop countermeasures or       equivalent systems which might reduce system effectiveness or       he used in the development of a system with similar or       advanced capabilities.        9. A determination has been made that the recipient can       provide substantially the same degree of protection for the       sensitive technology being released as the U.S. Government.       This sale is necessary in furtherance of the U.S. foreign       policy and national security objectives outlined in the       Policy Justification.        10. All defense articles and services listed in this       transmittal have been authorized for release and export to       the recipient.                            ____________________     Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute.

In Idaho, small businesses  employ 68 percent of workers in the food services sector. As a member  and former chairman of the Senate Committee on Small Business and  Entrepreneurship, I am proud to recognize Snake River Grill as the  Idaho Small Business of the Month for July 2019. Located in Hagerman,  Snake River Grill has provided exceptional service and quality food in  a welcoming environment for more than two decades.   Like many Idahoans, Kirt Martin fell in love with the beautiful  scenery and the genuine people in the Gem State and decided to call  Idaho home in 1988. Kirt served our country in Vietnam as a member of  the U.S. Navy and developed an appreciation for culinary practices  around the world during his tour of service.   After graduating from the College of Southern Idaho and Le Cordon  Bleu culinary school in Ottawa, Canada, Kirt capitalized on his  passions and opened Snake River Grill in 1995. As a third-generation  cook and an avid fisher and hunter, he uses his expertise in French  cuisine to put a unique spin on classic Idaho meals. Snake River Grill  offers dishes such as Idaho sturgeon, steelhead, trout, and alligator.  Chef Kirt uses locally sourced fish, game, and seasonal ingredients  from local farmers markets. Kirt hosts a weekly wild game dinner at his  restaurant, bringing specialty dishes to patrons from across the  region.   When he is not on the job, you can find Chef Kirt hunting and fishing  and spending time with his triplet sons, Daniel, Andrew, and Benjamin.  Kirt's wife, Carol, helps him run Snake River Grill and even makes all  of the homemade pies herself. Chef Kirt is often found catering events  and teaching cooking classes throughout the Magic Valley. He has been  known to teach at the College of Southern Idaho and Hagerman High  School, as well as overseas in Macau and Hong Kong. He starred in the  PBS Outdoor Channel television series, ``Cooking on the Wild Side,''  which featured hunting field trips through Idaho followed by lessons  from Kirt on how to cook wild game. He has authored cookbooks and  produced cooking videos so people everywhere can learn how to prepare  wild game.   The State of Idaho is proud to be a home for creative small  businesses like Snake River Grill. Chef Kirt's commitment to providing  unique meals and experiences allows his customers to enjoy an excellent  product produced in their own community. I would like to extend my  sincerest congratulations to Chef Kirt Martin, his wife Carol, and to  the employees of Snake River Grill for being selected as the July 2019  Idaho Small Business of the Month. You make our great State proud, and  I look forward to watching your continued growth and success.                            ____________________
