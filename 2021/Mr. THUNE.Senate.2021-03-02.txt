 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, Democrats continue to push forward with  their partisan COVID legislation. The House of Representatives passed  the Democrats' $1.9 trillion partisan wish list on Saturday, and the  Senate is expected to take it up later this week.   Just weeks after the President expressed his commitment to unity at  his inauguration, he and his party are forcing through exclusively  partisan legislation despite Republicans' clear willingness to  negotiate. When it comes to Democrats' COVID bill, President Biden  keeps asking, ``What would you have me cut?''--as if there is no way  anyone could dispute the necessity of anything in this legislation.   Well, as I said last week, I have some suggestions because this bill  is rife with unnecessary and problematic provisions. Democrats are  presenting this as a COVID relief bill, but a lot of this bill has  little to do with responding to the pandemic. In fact, less than 10  percent of the bill is directly related to combating the COVID health  crisis.   If President Biden would like to know what to cut, let me suggest  starting with the bill's $350 billion slush fund for States. Now, there  is no question that COVID has placed additional pressure on States,  which is why Republicans supported targeted funding for States in  previous COVID legislation. But at this point, the vast majority of  States are not in crisis.   A number of States actually saw higher tax revenues in 2020. The  majority of States, including my home State of South Dakota, have the  resources they need to weather the rest of the pandemic. Even if the  Federal Government bailed out those States that are still struggling-- some, at least partially, because of their own mismanagement--$350  billion far exceeds the amount that would be needed. Democrats are  simply providing a large and unnecessary giveaway to States with the  distribution formula heavily weighted in favor of blue States.   Then there is the bill's funding for schools. Now, Republicans are  committed to getting schools reopened so our kids can get back to the  in-person learning that they need. It is why we voted for $68 billion  in COVID funding for K-12 schools last year. But right now, schools  don't need additional funding. So far K-12 schools have spent just $5  billion of the $68 billion that we provided them. Yet the Democrats'  bill would provide nearly $129 billion in additional funding. And  despite all that additional and unnecessary money, nothing--nothing--in  the bill would require schools to actually reopen. Schools could  collect this money while still depriving students of the benefits of  in-person learning.   And another thing, Democrats are billing this legislation as a COVID  relief bill and suggesting that it is providing urgently needed  funding. Yet 95 percent of the funding for schools--95 percent--would  be spent after this year. That is right. Just 5 percent of this  ``emergency funding'' would be spent in 2021. The rest would be spent  between 2022 and 2028. Are we really supposed to believe that money  that would be spent in 2028--years after the pandemic is likely to be  over--is somehow urgently needed COVID relief funding?   Well, I could go on for a while here with suggestions for what to cut  in this bill. I am pretty sure that $100 million for a Silicon Valley  underground rail project doesn't have a lot to do with getting our  country out of the COVID crisis. Or how about the $1.5 million for a  bridge in the Democratic leader's home State?   And then there is the $86 billion bailout for multiemployer pension  plans, billions--billions--for environmental policies, and a provision  to ensure that Planned Parenthood and labor unions can apply for  Paycheck Protection Program loans designed to help small businesses--I  am not sure how far that will go toward helping our economy,  [[Page S969]]  but it will certainly help build the coffers of some of Democrats'  political allies.    If Democrats were really just focused on COVID relief, this would be  a much smaller and targeted bill, but Democrats' ambitions were much  larger than just addressing the COVID crisis. As a Democrat political  operative famously said, ``never allow a good crisis to go to waste.''   Well, Democrats have taken that advice and are using the COVID crisis  as cover for a whole list of partisan priorities with potentially very  negative consequences. The Democrats' COVID bill runs a very real risk  of overstimulating the economy, as evidenced by the large increase we  have seen in money supply which could, among other things, drive up  prices on the goods that Americans use every day--in other words,  inflation. Even some liberal economists have sounded the alarm over the  size of the Democrats' coronavirus legislation.   And then, of course, there is the danger posed by driving up our  debt. We had to borrow a lot of money last year to meet the demands of  the coronavirus crisis, and while it was money we needed to borrow, we  need to be very aware of the fact that we added a substantial-- substantial--amount to our already very large national debt. We need to  be very careful about any additional borrowing and ensure that we are  only borrowing what is absolutely necessary.   I think it goes without saying that the more that we borrow, the more  debt we have to retire. If something negative happened on interest  rates and interest rates normalized--went back to a more normal  setting--the interest itself on that amount of debt would literally  dwarf anything else we do in our budget, including defending the  country.   And that, I believe, is a very, very real threat, because if you look  at what is happening right now with the economy and with all the money  that we have flooded out there so far and another $2 trillion, if the  Democrats have their way in this particular proposal, and all that  money out there starts pushing up those costs and we start seeing  inflation in the economy, it doesn't take very long for interest rates  to go with it. In fact, they already are. If those interest rates start  pushing up very quickly on the amount of debt that we are piling up,  financing that debt--the amount of interest, the cost of interest on  that debt--would be absolutely overwhelming and devastating to this  country.   So we need to be very, very careful about any additional borrowing  and ensure that we are only borrowing what is absolutely necessary.  That means making sure that anything we do in terms of additional  pandemic relief is targeted and fiscally responsible, and that does not  include money for a bridge in New York or a taxpayer bailout for  mismanaged States.   It is deeply disappointing that Democrats chose to turn their backs  on bipartisanship. Republicans were ready to work with Democrats on  additional targeted relief.   As I have pointed out before, the pandemic has been an issue on  which, at least up until now, there has been very much bipartisan  support. Last year, when Republicans were in the majority, we did  five--five--coronavirus bills, all bipartisan, all done at the 60-vote  threshold that governs most legislation that moves through the Senate  in a cooperative way.   In this case, the Democrats are plowing forward, pushing this  legislation in a very partisan way, and I think that is unfortunate  given our history on this issue of bipartisanship and the importance of  making sure that we are doing the right things on behalf of the  American people to help them get through this pandemic.   Choosing to pursue a partisan process allows Democrats to stuff the  bill with unnecessary spending and political payoffs, but that is not  the way to help our country or our economy recover.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator  from Tennessee (Mrs. Blackburn).
