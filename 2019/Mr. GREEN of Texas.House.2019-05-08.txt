 Mr. Speaker, I rise today because there are some  things that I must call to the attention of the Congress.   Some news sources have indicated that somebody has said that we are  in a crisis, a constitutional crisis. Mr. Speaker, I am that somebody.  We are in a constitutional crisis.   Mr. Speaker, we currently have the executive branch and the  legislative branch in a standoff, a standoff because the President of  the United States of America has refused to cooperate and has  encouraged others to do so, refusing to allow subpoenas to be properly  honored--subpoenas properly issued, I might add. He has indicated that  he, as President, will continue to do so in his words and his deeds.   So, Mr. Speaker, I still rise, and I do so because there is a crisis.  But I also do so because this obstruction by the President continues to  this day.   As I speak currently, the President is engaged in obstruction. This  policy that he is implementing of not allowing persons to testify if he  can prevent them from doing so, thwarting the investigation that is  taking place--lawful investigations, I might add--is a form of  obstruction in and of itself. He continues to obstruct.   Mr. Speaker, I rise, also, because many have said that the soul of  the country is at stake. Mr. Speaker, I would amend this. I would agree  that the soul of the country is at risk, but I would also say that the  soul of the Congress is at risk.   The Congress of the United States of America must do its job, Mr.  Speaker, the Congress of the United States of America, many of whom, as  Members, have indicated that the President has committed impeachable  acts but then go on to say that we should not impeach him.   Mr. Speaker, we cannot say that a President has committed impeachable  offenses and then not impeach. To do so would legitimize the  President's actions. This Congress cannot allow this President to  continue to do what he is doing, say that he ought to be impeached, and  then step back from impeachment. That would say to the President that  he can go out now and claim legitimacy.   He can say that, if I were a person guilty of impeachable offenses,  the Congress would have impeached me. He will say that one party had  enough votes to do it without the assistance of the other party. He  will say to the country, ``I have done nothing wrong,'' and that would  be wrong, in toto, for him to say such a thing because he has done many  things that are wrong.   We as a Congress have a duty to bring before the body the President  of the United States for impeachment purposes. This is the only place  where such an action can take place, and the longer we delay, the  greater the opportunity for the President to obfuscate, to confuse the  country, to give people the impression that it is just a witch hunt.   It is not a witch hunt. It is the proper thing that we should do,  pursuant to Article II, Section 4 of the Constitution of the United  States of America; and our failure to do so will only allow us to give  the President reason to go forward and say that he has been vindicated  when the truth is he has committed impeachable acts, starting with the  firing of Mr. Comey and continuing through his efforts to deny the  House of Representatives, by and through its lawful investigative  authorities, to look into and bring witnesses before investigative  bodies.   Mr. Speaker, this is a sad day in the history of our country. It is a  red letter day, but there is hope, and I assure you that this President  will not--will not--go unchecked. There will be Articles of Impeachment  brought before this body. I assure you there will be Articles of  Impeachment.   I pray that we can get this done through the proper committees, but  if nobody else does it, each Member of Congress is accorded the  authority to come to the floor, the ability, and to bring Articles of  Impeachment.   I don't want to do it. This is not something that I came to Congress  to do. But I love my country, and I will not watch and allow such a  thing to happen before this country without my  [[Page H3480]]  taking appropriate action. I will bring Articles of Impeachment if  nobody else does.   And finally, I will say more about this this evening. I should have  30 minutes of time. I will speak to a greater extent on the issue that  I have called to Members' attention now.    Mr. Speaker, and still I rise. I rise, Mr.  Speaker, because I love my country. I love what it stands for.   Mr. Speaker, I am a person who sings the national anthem. I salute  the flag. But I also respect those who, as a matter of principle,  choose not to do as I. I love my country.   I believe that one of the hallmarks of our justice system is the  concept that no person is above the law--no person. It doesn't matter  where you were born; it doesn't matter where you happen to be in life;  it doesn't matter what office you happen to hold. No person is above  the law.   This is something that people revere us for the world over, the  belief that in this country you will not be above the law. But they  also understand that, in doing this, no person will be beneath the law.  The law applies equally to all in the United States of America.   I believe in this concept to the extent that I will stand alone and  say that the President of the United States is not to be above the law.  And I will stand alone because, on some things, it is better to stand  alone than not stand at all.   So I will stand alone and say to the world that, in this country,  wherein we indicate in the Pledge of Allegiance liberty and justice for  all, in this country, wherein we recognize that all persons are created  equal and endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights, in  this country, no person is above the law.   When it comes to the law as it relates to the President of the United  States of America, the place where the President is brought before the  bar of justice is this House of Representatives. This is the place  where the law and the President will come together.   And in this place, because of the Constitution of the United States  of America, Article II, Section 4, if a President commits impeachable  acts, the President is brought before this bar of justice--not brought  here in person, but those acts are called to the attention of the House  of Representatives.   Each Member of the House can do so, and in so doing, each Member can  have what is called a privileged resolution presented. When this  resolution is presented, a President who is believed to have committed  an impeachable act can be brought before this House, this bar of  justice. Those acts can be voted upon.                                time  1445    This is the only place on the planet Earth where a President of the  United States can be brought to justice while in office, in this House  of Representatives.   This is why I have stood my ground. I have said that this President,  who has committed impeachable acts, must be brought before the House of  Representatives for his impeachable acts, his impeachable behavior.   I marvel at those who would say that the President has done things  that merit his impeachment but would then go on to say, ``But I don't  think we should impeach him.''   They will say they don't think so because if we do so, the President  won't be convicted in the Senate.   The Constitution of the United States of America does not require a  conviction in the Senate before there is impeachment in the House. The  House acts first, and then the Senate is given the opportunity to give  its response.   In this House of Representatives, it is imperative that we let the  world know because the world is watching. The world is watching the  United States of America, which means it is really watching this House  of Representatives.   They want to see if we are going to allow a President who has  committed impeachable acts--they want to see if we are going to allow  him to escape the long arm of the law. They want to see whether or not  we truly believe that no one is above the law, and that includes the  President of the United States of America.   We must act.   Mr. Mueller has taken up the cause. We outsourced the investigation  to the executive branch of the government, which was not the  appropriate thing to do. The Framers of the Constitution never intended  that the agents of the executive branch investigate the chief executive  officer, which would be the President, for impeachment purposes. That  was never contemplated.   They gave us Article II, Section 4, so that we, the Members of this  august body, would take up our duty, our responsibility, and our  obligation.   They gave us the way. The question is, do we have the will?   Mr. Mueller has done his job. He has submitted to us his report. That  report alone is enough for us to bring Articles of Impeachment.   That report is based upon persons giving statements that were subject  to the penalty of perjury if they should give untruthful statements.   It is clearly a roadmap to impeachment. Mr. Mueller has so much as  said--not in these exacts words, but when you understand the import of  his language, he has so much as said that  [[Page H3496]]  if he could bring the President to justice, he would.   But they have a rule. They have a mandate in the Justice Department  that they will not indict a sitting President. Whether you agree with  that or not, that is the rule that Mr. Mueller believes in, and they  followed it.   He went on to say that he is not exonerating the President by not  bringing the President before the bar of justice. He is simply saying  to us: I have done what I am allowed to do. Now, Congress, it is up to  you. I have given you what I believe is the evidence. You take this  evidence and do with it what you believe to be appropriate.   If Congress takes this evidence and simply sits on it, if we engage  in the paralysis of analysis--a phrase that I borrow from Dr. Martin  Luther King--if we investigate until someone will eventually say,  ``Well, it is too late to go on with impeachment. It is too late now.  It will look political. Let's just wait until the next election,'' that  is not what the Framers of the Constitution intended. They intended for  us to have the will to follow the way that they accorded us in the  Constitution.   We made it clear that we wanted to wait on the Mueller report. Well,  we waited. Now there are persons who are saying let's wait until the  next election.   I refuse to wait until the next election. I refuse to send the world  a message that, as a Member of this body, I allowed the President to go  unchecked, that I did not bring Articles of Impeachment.   Mr. President, I want you to know that the hand of justice awaits  you. I want you to know that this body is going to take up impeachment.   And here is why: If we fail to do so, we will allow the President,  who has committed impeachable acts, to go out and market himself as a  person who has been vindicated by our inaction. He will say to the  world: If I committed an impeachable act, they surely would have  brought impeachment before the House of Representatives.   After all, one party has more than enough Members to bring  impeachment before the House without the help of another party. He will  tell the world that there was no collusion, and he did nothing that  would merit impeachment.   This is what he would say. He would have that liberty. Even if he  doesn't say it, he would have the liberty. My guess is that he would.  That is what I believe.   We must bring impeachment before this body so as not to allow a  President who has done things worthy of impeachment to go out and  contend that he is not subject to impeachment and that he should be  considered a person who has been vindicated by our inaction.   What are some of the things that the President has done that would  merit his impeachment? Let's just start with Mr. Mueller's report. I  won't go through everything in its entirety.   He lists some 10 possibilities. I am just going to mention trying as  best as he could to get people to have the investigation terminated by  having the person who is performing the investigation fired, having  that person resign, having that person cease and desist.   The President started this with Mr. Comey when Mr. Comey was  investigating the President's association, by and through his campaign,  with Russia, interference in our elections.   This kind of thing is something that we would want to have  investigated. That was the genesis of it.   Then we can move forward to the latest rendition that Mr. Mueller has  given us as it relates to the counsel to the President and his desire  to have the counsel have word given to certain parties that the  President desires--probably not say that, but that was his desire--to  have the lawyer who was investigating, Mr. Mueller, removed.   This is not acceptable. This is obstruction. Obstruction takes place  when you attempt to do such a thing.   There are other things in between. As important as these are, I  believe separating babies from their mothers as a policy is impeachable  when you add it to the many other things that he has done with  reference to people of color.   To say that the countries in Africa are s-hole countries and then  develop policies, immigration policies, if you will, that address  immigration from these countries, you are putting your bigotry into  policy.   To say that there were some nice people among the racists, the  bigots, the xenophobes, the Islamophobes, the homophobes, the Klansmen,  the neo-Nazis who marched in Charlottesville where a person lost her  life, where others were injured, to say that there were some very fine  people among them, very, very nice people, if you will, among them, if  I said that, I assure you there would be a penalty for my doing so. If  any Member of Congress said such a thing, there would be a penalty for  doing so.   I am not above the law. Members of Congress are not above the law.  And the President cannot be above the law.   To say this gives these persons who were screaming ``blood and  soil,'' and, ``Jews will not replace us,'' to say that we will not take  up this cause in this House is to say that the President is above the  law when we know if one of our Members did it, we would take up this  cause in the House of Representatives.   The President cannot be above the law. No Member of this House can be  above the law. No judge can be above the law. No police officer can be  above the law. The law applies equally to all.   The President has engaged in these invidious acts, harmful acts,  harmful to society, telling members of the constabulary, the police,  that when you have persons in your custody, you don't have to be nice  to them.   We know about how many persons have been mishandled in the hands of  the police. Not all police do this, but some have. In fact, many have  gone to jail. That doesn't mean all law enforcement officers are bad.  It just means that those who did it are, and we don't want to encourage  others to do such a thing.   The President has committed impeachable acts. These impeachable acts  can be brought to this House, and they must be brought before the House  of Representatives.   Right now, the President is committing obstruction by causing persons  who should appear before Congress' various committees--by doing all  that he can to cause them not to appear. He is continuing to obstruct.   He does not want congressional committees to perform their lawful  duties, the duties that have been accorded them. He is standing in the  way, thwarting as much as he can. He wants to thwart subpoenas. He  wants to make impotent the subpoena power of the Congress of the United  States of America.   This is a continuation of his obstruction. His obstruction has to be  checked. This is where it is checked.   There is currently, as I stand and speak to you, a constitutional  crisis taking place. There is a standoff between the executive branch,  wherein the President is at the helm, and the House of Representatives.  A standoff exists, as I speak to you.   This is a constitutional crisis. The President is creating this  constitutional crisis.   The President ought to be brought before the bar of justice for  obstructing, for what he is doing right now to create this  constitutional crisis.   Don't let anybody kid you. I have heard persons on these news  programs say that somebody has said that there is a constitutional  crisis. Well, I am that somebody. I have said it.   Then they go on to say something that would minimize the fact that  there is a crisis.   They will be saying that there is a crisis soon. The very persons who  are saying now, ``Well, don't worry about that,'' they will be saying  it soon because the crisis is only going to intensify under this  President.   They will be saying there is a constitutional crisis. It is just a  matter of time. When they say it, somehow, it is going to have greater  legitimacy than it does now when I am saying it.   I believe that we must speak truth to power. I didn't come to  Congress to do this. It is not my desire to be the canary in the coal  mine. It is not my desire to take on the President of the United  States, the most powerful person in the world.   I do it because I love my country. I do it because we cannot allow a  reckless, ruthless, lawless President to remain in office. He has to be  impeached.   I do it because I believe that we cannot allow political expediency  to  [[Page H3497]]  trump the moral imperative to do that which is right.   I do it because we have to make these talking points that we have an  action item. That action item is to bring the President before the bar  of justice.   Mr. Speaker, I love my country. I promise those who believe as I do  that you will see the President have his day in court right here in the  Congress of the United States of America, where the Framers of the  Constitution intended that we hear the calls and take a vote.   We will all have to vote. I don't lobby people. I simply say, ``Vote  your conscience.''   But I do know this: I believe that history is not going to be kind to  us if we take no action. We must act. I will act.   I love my country. For this reason, I would do so.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now  adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 3 o'clock and 7 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Thursday, May 9, 2019, at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
