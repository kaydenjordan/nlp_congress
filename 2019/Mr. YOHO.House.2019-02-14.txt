 Mr. Speaker, today, I would like to honor the memory of a  friend, a man from Ocala, Florida, a man I consider a friend of mine,  Mr. Al Dunlap.   I had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Dunlap at a charity event in my  district, where he and his wife of 50 years, Judy, were providing  scholarships for local schoolchildren. A self-described ``nothing kid  from the slums of Hoboken, New Jersey,'' he was a tough guy, a shrewd  businessman known around the world, but a man with a big heart.   Mr. Dunlap earned a degree in engineering at the United States  Military Academy, West Point, and served our Nation in the U.S. Army.  He went on to lead many successful businesses around the world and had  dined with kings and queens and just wealthy people around the world.   He moved his work down to the Ocala, Florida, area, where I live. But  it is not his work in the business world that he will be most  remembered for. Mr. Dunlap was an important part of his community and  was always there to lend a helping hand to his friends, his neighbors,  and his community.   He supported my rival university in our State, Florida State  University, to the tune of over $40 million, and we always had fun  ribbing each other about the Gators and the Seminoles.   During his lifetime, the kindness and selflessness of Mr. Dunlap and  his wife, Judy, touched many lives, and he will be greatly missed.                      Honoring the Life of Murrel Hines     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a man who was a pillar  in our community and in the agricultural community, Mr. Murrel Hines. I  have known Mr. Hines, Murrel, for more than 35 years. In fact, I knew  him before I became a veterinarian and was able to work on their family  farm.   He and the rest of the Hines family had a profound impact on my  professional career as a large animal veterinarian but also as a  person. The Hines family farm is a generational farm that goes back to  the 1850s. Today, the Hines family is the cornerstone of the Gilchrest  community.   When you look at farm families in America, they are the salt of the  Earth. Mr. Hines and his family were those people. They were the salt  of the Earth. They would do anything for you at anytime, anywhere, any  day, and ask nothing from you in return.    Some of my earliest memories as a young veterinarian, not even out of  vet school yet, included working with the Hines family on their farm. I  can recall working cows in their pens in the morning and joining the  family for lunch, where there was no shortage of homemade biscuits by  his wife, Ms. Betty Jo. Jokes and stories ran wild, and we always had a  great time. He was the pillar of the family, the patriarch.   One thing about Mr. Murrel, there was never a shortage of work ethic  in the man. I saw him working cattle up into his 80s every day, from  morning until night. In fact, he said he had retired, but he would show  up at 7:30 and work until 9 at night.   Despite quitting school at the age of 13, Mr. Murrel had more common  sense and business acumen than most who go all the way through college.  He successfully grew watermelons, tobacco, peanuts, hay, grass, and  cattle. He also grew his father's cattle operation beyond what others  said could be done.   Mr. Murrel knew, according to the Scriptures in the Psalms, that the  Lord had no need for a bull or a goat, for every beast of the forest  was His, as were all the cattle on a thousand hills. Murrel himself  sure knew what it was like to have that many cows. But seriously, he  was a proud caretaker of the Lord's land and a man of conviction and  faith.   Just last year, he was presented the Conservation Stewardship Award  for his work in best farming practices. To him, recognition and awards  weren't necessary. He just always did what was right.   He was, in every sense of the word, a true cowboy. A vise-like grip,  an easy smile, a man of great faith but of few words, he was a family  man. Married to his wife, Betty Jo, for over 70 years, he was an  example to us all when it came to family, work, common sense, giving  back, and, ultimately, life.   It is my honor to have known him and worked beside him and to have  shared so many memories with him and the rest of the Hines family over  the years.   Mr. Speaker, in honor of my friend and mentor, Mr. Murrel Hines, I  would like to close with ``The Cowboy's Prayer.''   ``Heavenly Father, I pause, mindful of the many blessings You have  bestowed upon me. I ask that You will guide me in my life. Help me,  Lord, to live my life in such a manner that when I make that last ride  to the country up there, where the grass grows lush and the water runs  cool, that You will take me by the hand and say, `Welcome home,  cowboy.' Amen.''                            ____________________
