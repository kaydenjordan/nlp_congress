 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  [[Page H3324]]  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the topic of my Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to lead a Western Caucus Special  Order to voice our vehement opposition to H.R. 9, which aims to prevent  President Trump from withdrawing from the fundamentally flawed Paris  Agreement.   In 2015, more than 170 countries signed a nonbinding agreement at the  United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris. While  most countries set a target reduction of carbon emissions below its  2005 level, the Obama administration sought to dramatically reduce the  United States' carbon emissions by between 26 and 28 percent below its  2005 level by 2025.   Before I proceed any further, I yield to my good friend, the  gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Biggs). He is a tireless advocate for small  businesses in his district, many of whom have been harmed by this type  of legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Biggs for his  comments.    H.R. 9 seeks to mandate implementations of those same technically  implausible and unrealistic emissions goals in order to appease  extremists. The bill also seeks to prevent Federal funds from being  used to withdraw from the flawed Paris Agreement.   Americans for Tax Reform estimates the Paris Agreement will cost the  U.S. an estimated 6.5 million jobs by 2040 and reduce our gross  domestic product by over $2.5 trillion.   NERA Consulting estimates those numbers are even higher and that the  Paris Agreement will cost the U.S. an estimated 31.6 million jobs by  2040 and reduce our GDP by over $3 trillion.   In June of 2017, President Trump announced he will withdraw the  United States from the Paris Agreement, stating: ``The Paris climate  accord is simply the latest example of Washington entering into an  agreement that disadvantages the United States to the exclusive benefit  of other countries, leaving the American workers and taxpayers to  absorb the costs in terms of lost jobs, lower wages, shuttering  factories, and vastly diminishing economic production.''   There are other significant flaws of the Paris Agreement. MIT found  the Paris Agreement will only result in a global temperature reduction  of 0.2 degrees Celsius by 2100. Under the Paris climate agreement,  China and India will actually increase emissions until at least 2030.   The Climate Action Tracker, a group of European research  organizations, found that participating parties will not meet their  commitments, and those are the goals of the Paris Agreement.   The European Climate Action Network reported that no single country  in Europe is performing sufficiently to meet Paris Agreement goals, and  those that have been making the most progress on their promises did not  make large commitments in the first place.   A recent United Nations Emissions Gap report found all participating  countries will have to at least triple their efforts in order to meet  the Paris Agreement's basic goals.   Given how unrealistic and illogical the Paris Agreement is, the U.S.  should not inflict monumental harm on our economy chasing a white  unicorn.   Fortunately, there is an alternative. Members of the Western Caucus  support personal responsibility, less government intervention in our  daily lives, and freedom. They defend property rights and believe that  private ownership of property is a fundamental right in America. Our  vision encourages innovation and less burdensome mandates.   Members of the caucus support local control and believe that  stewardship of our environment and natural resources is best  accomplished by empowering local stakeholders, not victimizing them.   The people who depend on the land to provide security for their  families and communities understand these resources best. States and  municipalities are best suited to deal with local issues than the  distant, out-of-touch Washington bureaucrats.   The caucus seeks to promote access to our Nation's energy and  resource potential while pursuing a truly all-of-the-above energy  approach that aims to ensure the U.S. is a global energy leader.   Our vision utilizes the current energy renaissance and the American  energy dominant policies currently being implemented by the Trump  administration. America's energy renaissance is the backbone of our  economy; it is a story of freedom, prosperity, and opportunity.   After decades of reliance on other countries to meet our energy  needs, the U.S. Energy Information Administration projects that America  will export more energy than it imports starting in 2020. We are no  longer dependent on volatile foreign sources produced in Russia and  Saudi Arabia.   Recent innovations and technology improvements associated with  hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling have allowed shale  resources previously deemed uneconomical to be developed and the main  reason the U.S. was the world's leader in carbon emissions reductions  in 2015, 2016, and 2017.   That is right. Fracking, demonized by environmental extremists  without justification, has proven to be the best energy solution for  our environment.   Abundant oil and natural gas have reduced electricity bills, kept gas  prices low, and provided the largest share of U.S. electric power  generation in recent years.   The United States is the world's top energy producer, and the  American Dream is thriving. Passing H.R. 9 and staying in the Paris  Agreement threatens that dream.   This is not a partisan issue. This is about doing what is right for  America and about protecting freedom and opportunity for our children  and grandchildren. I urge all Members on both sides of the aisle to  reject H.R. 9.   Now, with that, I yield to my friend from Utah (Mr. Bishop). As the  Republican leader on the Natural Resources Committee and previously as  its chairman, he has been one of the biggest leaders in promoting  American energy dominance.  [[Page H3325]]                                     time  1430     Mr. Speaker, to the Member, to the gentleman, we are also  getting another benefit because the catastrophic wildfires that we are  seeing out West are a contributor. There is more carbon and pollution  that occurs during these catastrophic wildfires in one day than in a  year of exhaust from cars.   What we do is we get a benefit there because we have a much more  dynamic forest, much more dynamic interfaces. The fires are smaller.  They are not as catastrophic, so we don't go further in debt.   This is something that the Natural Resources Committee has been  pushing under Mr. Bishop's watch, and I thank the gentleman. There is  plenty of benefit in regard to understanding the natural cycle of  plants and trees.    Mr. Speaker, I also want to bring up the point that the  Western Caucus was dynamic in going to Houston to see Petra Nova in  Texas. It is the only carbon sequestration coal plant in the United  States, one of only two in the world.   Basically, what they do is they capture the carbon sequestration and  pressurize it into pipes. They pipe it down to their oil fields. Once  they frack the oil fields, they take this pressurized carbon and force  it into the oil field. What it does is it forces out the rest of the  gas and oil with it that is still remaining and then solidifies in the  ground.   What amazing technology. Once again, going back to the whole  application that technology, innovation, the private sector is right  there to answer the call.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. LaMalfa).  Mr. LaMalfa knows firsthand the negative effects that policies like  H.R. 9 can have, given the proposals that have gone into effect in  California.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Idaho (Mr.  Fulcher). With his background in the technology industry, he knows  firsthand how businesses in his district and across the country are  already innovating and helping to reduce our carbon emissions.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Idaho for those  remarks. You can see where this is going. The right way is not this  Paris accord, but through technology and through innovation.   Mr. Speaker, a point that has been brought up multiple times by my  colleagues is how the Paris Agreement is a direct violation of our  Nation's sovereignty. I could not agree more. Article II, section 2 of  the Constitution states that the President ``shall have power, by and  with the advice and consent of the Senate, to make treaties, provided  two-thirds of the Senators present concur.''   President Obama took unilateral action when he signed the Paris  Agreement back in 2015 and failed to consult Congress. There were no  committee hearings leading up to the adoption of the agreement and no  vote was held by the Senate, as mandated by our Constitution.   Members on the other side will say that the Paris Agreement does not  constitute a treaty. But when the Foreign Affairs Committee held a  hearing on this very bill, every witness believed the agreement was a  treaty. This included multiple Democratic witnesses.   The practice of avoiding congressional approval was nothing new for  the Obama administration when it came to natural resources and energy  policy.   Fortunately, Members will have a chance to correct this  unconstitutional action by voting for my amendment that was made in  order this week instructing the Senate to take a vote as to whether the  Paris Agreement is a treaty or not.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to enter into a colloquy with the gentleman  from Virginia (Mr. Griffith), my good friend. He has some background on  this information.    Russia.    Absolutely. The one road initiative. They are taking and  leveraging resources across the world and, at the same time, being paid  for it. And I dare you not keep up with your payments because it  rescinds right back to them.   Going back to your first point, the gentleman from Virginia, what you  are telling me is that this body will have that opportunity, with my  amendment, to get this right, instructing the Senate to take a vote on  the Paris accord to actually see if it can become a treaty, would you  agree?    So, what you are really telling me is when you have good  process, you build good policy, which builds good politics. It is kind  of that simple, isn't it?     The gentleman brings up that when we look at coal, the  separation of rare earths, that is the technology that is so important.  This is the technology that is driving this renaissance of technology  in our country, that plethora of energy where we can geopolitically  decide to help other countries become more independent, away from  China's and from Russia's jurisdiction.   The entrepreneurial spirit is bred with having energy independence.  This H.R. 9 kills jobs.   I also want to bring up to the gentleman, with technology, there is  another technology at the same time that takes up pulverized coal and  infuses it into oil. When they burn it, they get a 50 percent  additional Btu factor and a cleaner burning application, once again  reducing the carbon footprint.   Once again, talking about new technologies is what saves us. It is  that entrepreneurial spirit making things better. The infusion of new  technology helps us get an advancement of cleaner technology.    That is right.    The gentleman brings up a great point, along with the  former chairman of the Natural Resources Committee, not only in the  grazing application but in the stewardship of our natural resources  called our forests, dynamic forests. Instead of being victims of these  catastrophic wildfires that put so much of the emissions and pollution  into the air, we then relegate it, so when we do have fires, it is  relegated to low-level type fires that are not as devastating and  catastrophic.   I want to bring up one other point. Included in the Paris Agreement  was the creation of a slush fund called the Green Climate Fund, which  the Obama  [[Page H3329]]  administration unconstitutionally utilized to shift $1 billion in  taxpayer funds without authorization from Congress. Once again, we were  imposed upon by having the money, Uncle Sam Warbucks.   The Green Climate Fund was a goal of raising $100 billion a year  through voluntary contributions from countries that signed the Paris  Agreement. While developed countries are expected to finance their  respective agreements under the Paris Agreement, the Green Climate Fund  aims to subsidize the agreements of developing countries that cannot  afford the commitments they made when signing the Paris Agreement.   In fact, since the United States ratified the United Nations  Framework Convention on Climate Change in 1992, the United States has  given hundreds of millions of dollars to developing countries to help  them mitigate climate change. Amazing.   We know that much of the money we have given over the years has gone  to some of the most corrupt countries in the world. My question is, how  can we rely on these countries to spend the money properly? When you  look, for example, in 2014, the top recipients for climate funds all  received failing grades in Transparency International's Corruption  Perceptions Index. Amazing.   What has been the return on investment for the money that we were  giving to these countries? It is nice to be able to fund this, but what  are the results? What are we getting from that?    The facts are that carbon emissions from the developing  countries have gone up. We know that much of the money was not used to  reduce carbon emissions.   Once again, we are not solving it.   It is clear that H.R. 9, that is what it will do. It will put the  country back on the road to job losses, higher electric bills, and more  government regulations while wasting significant amounts of taxpayer  money in the process.    We become victims in this economy. We should be leading the way.  Freedom comes with technology and opportunity, and that is what the  American people want.   This is something where we should show the way by leadership, by  saying: Listen, follow us by the way that we do things.   That seems like a better approach, doesn't it, to the gentleman from  Virginia?    Right, the carrot versus the whip. What you are looking at  is the opportunity for solutions, that incentivization to find a new  opportunity. I think that is the value. We are protecting 6.5 million  jobs here.   It scraps the unconstitutional application of the treaty, and it  ensures safe, reliable, affordable energy.   Everybody has to have energy. When we start looking at this Paris  accord, it is accomplished in so many different ways that H.R. 9 is not  something that is a valid or constitutional agreement.    Having said that, the Paris Agreement may have been their  most egregious breach of constitutional authority. Many Members on the  other side have stated in the past that President Trump does not have  the authority to unilaterally withdraw the United States without the  consent of Congress.   By virtue of the executive's role as the sole organ of the government  charged with making official communications with foreign states, it is  responsible for communicating the United States' intention to withdraw  from international agreements and political commitments.   In the case of this executive agreement, President Obama had  independent authority to enter into an executive agreement. President  Trump may also independently terminate the agreement without  congressional approval.   In addition to there being no congressional input on the agreement,  there was no congressional input when drafting the agreement. This is  not the way an agreement as wide-reaching as the Paris Agreement should  have been agreed upon.   Passage of H.R. 9 will bring us back to the foreign policy of  President Obama and the practice of putting other countries' interests  above our own. This is the same foreign policy that brought us  Benghazi, the rise of ISIS, and the disastrous Iran nuclear agreement.   President Trump's promise to withdraw the United States from the  Paris Agreement marked a dramatic change in America's foreign policy-- for the better, I might add. The Paris Agreement fails to put America  first, and President Trump is right to withdraw us from this  sovereignty-sacrificing agreement.   Mr. Speaker, the facts are becoming clearer about the realities and  failures of the Paris climate agreement.   First of all, let's talk about the good news. The United States  reduced its carbon emissions by 40 million metric tons in 2017. Yes,  our emissions did rise slightly in 2018 due to increased domestic  manufacturing, but the U.S. Energy Information Administration projects  that our carbon emissions will continue to fall in 2019 and 2020.   Now for some bad news. The United States' reductions in carbon  emissions are totally erased when you account for China's dramatic  increase in carbon emissions. Several speakers have talked about that.  In fact, China's increase in emissions is three times larger than the  U.S.'s decrease in emissions.   Mr. Speaker, this highlights two of the fundamental failures in the  framework of the Paris Agreement, which is the fact that there are no  mechanisms in place to hold countries accountable for not reaching  their emissions reduction targets, and there are no requirements or  required countries to establish equitable emissions reductions over the  same period.   It is not just China, either. India, for example, saw its emissions  rise 4.8 percent in 2017. Forty-seven of the 50 most polluted cities in  the world are located in either China or in India.    Well, you may say, let's look to Europe. They are probably on the  forefront of following the standards set forth in the agreement.   People would think that, but that would be wrong, as all EU countries  are off-target in reaching the goals set forth by the Paris Agreement.  Germany, for example, has spent almost  [[Page H3330]]  $600 billion in renewable energy subsidies and has seen no meaningful  decrease in carbon emissions.   Mr. Speaker, the United States was already a leader in reducing  carbon emissions before the Paris Agreement was signed. Since 1970, the  United States has reduced six key air pollutants by 73 percent and has  seen the largest absolute reduction of CO2 of any country in  the world since 2000.   Instead of focusing on bringing us back to the past, we should focus  on encouraging innovations that we are already seeing in the energy  sector today. Whether it be carbon capture technology, clean coal, or  taking advantage of the liquid natural gas revolution that is taking  place across the country, the private sector is leading the way in  creating a cleaner energy future for this country.   That is the way it should be, not through a heavy-handed government  imposing unrealistic, top-down mandates.   Requiring the U.S. to follow the requirements of the Paris Agreement  will stifle innovations and return us to the policies of the past when  energy was more expensive and economic growth was abysmal.   It appears that I am running out of time, so what I will do is  implore my folks to, first, relook at this.   I thank all the Western Caucus members who contributed to the Special  Order. It is truly a privilege to be chair of the caucus, which is now  74 bipartisan members strong.   Mr. Speaker, we will continue to lead the fight against the extreme  agenda, which is why we organized the Special Order in opposition to  H.R. 9.                                time  1515    Mr. Speaker, I will close with a quote from the National Federation  of Independent Business, who oppose this legislation.   Under this legislation,         Small businesses would face significant future government       mandates, additional regulatory and legal burdens, and       unworkable government policies that would result in       skyrocketing energy prices.        At a time when the small business economy is booming with       small business owners reporting record hiring of new       employees and historically strong compensation increases for       their employees, Congress should be considering policies that       will allow this economic boom to continue, not bring it to a       halt.    I hope this legislation is voted down by the House this week and we  get serious as a Congress about promoting energy dominance for the  betterment of our economy, energy consumers, the environment, and  geopolitically across the world.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
