 Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the  Reproductive Choice Act with my colleague and friend Senator Lisa  Murkowski, which would codify the protections for reproductive rights  established by the Supreme Court's decisions in Roe v. Wade in 1973 and  affirmed by Planned Parenthood v. Casey in 1992. We are introducing the  Reproductive Choice Act as a substitute amendment to the Women's Health  Protection Act before us today and as a standalone bill for future  consideration.   Unfortunately, the Women's Health Protection Act goes far beyond  codifying Roe and Casey. Among other issues, this legislation would  severely weaken protections afforded to healthcare providers who refuse  to perform abortions on religious grounds. Rather than just codifying  Roe's protections, the bill would undercut Federal and State laws that  have been in place for decades and call into question basic conscience  protections.   The Reproductive Choice Act that Senator Murkowski and I are  introducing today would simply codify the essential holdings of the  U.S. Supreme Court's 1973 decision in Roe v. Wade and 1992 decision in  Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey. Our bill  carefully tracks the Supreme Court's language and would provide  reassurance to women that the reproductive rights they have relied on  for nearly 50 years will continue to be the law of the land.   Specifically, the Reproductive Choice Act would make clear in Federal  law that States may not impose an ``undue burden'' on the ability of a  woman to choose whether or not to terminate a pregnancy prior to  viability. It would still allow States to enact regulations to further  the health or safety of a woman seeking to terminate a pregnancy, while  stating that regulations that have the purpose or effect of presenting  a ``substantial obstacle'' to a woman seeking to terminate a pregnancy  would be considered an ``undue burden.''   As is currently permitted under Roe and Casey, our legislation would  allow individual States to impose restrictions on terminating a  pregnancy after fetal viability, except when necessary to preserve the  life or health of the woman. Notably, unlike the Women's Health  Protection Act, our bill would not restrict laws regarding conscience  protections, including laws that protect healthcare providers who  refuse to provide pregnancy termination services for moral or religious  reasons.   Women should be assured privacy in making their reproductive choices,  and I oppose efforts to overturn the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in  Roe v. Wade. It is my hope that the Reproductive Choice Act will be  enacted to ensure that women in this country are able to make their own  reproductive choices as established in the landmark Roe decision.
