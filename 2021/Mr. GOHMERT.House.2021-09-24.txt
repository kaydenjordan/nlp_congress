 Mr. Speaker, we had a bill today regarding abortion; and  when I think about saving lives of innocent babies, one name that comes  to mind is Henry Hyde, and another name that comes to my mind is Chris  Smith.   We have some people that have worked tirelessly, selflessly on this  issue, and one of those people is Chris Smith. He is a leader.   I am proud to yield to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith).    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate so much my friend Mr. Smith's  dedication to this important--it is not just an issue; it is an  important cause. It is so important.   We are told in law school that there can be nothing more noble than  speaking up for those who are unable to defend themselves, and that is  what I see when I see my friend, Mr. Smith.   This bill we took up today, to vote on, allows abortion right up to  the moment of birth. I struggle with that. I mean, I understand there  are people that really believe it is not a child; it is just a mass of  tissue. But when the child can be seen, as we were talking about  earlier before we began the Special Order, when you look at the TV  screen, you know that is your child. And it is a child. You can make  out all the parts. Then it is not just a mass of tissue.   But for heaven's sake, when it is a viable, living child, capable of  living completely on that child's own--I have seen some tough things as  a felony judge, some pictures, which I wish I had never seen. But to  see what is done to a living child in the name of a right is just  heartbreaking.   I appreciate so much my friend's heart on this issue.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to my good friend, if he cares to share anything  else.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate so much my friend talking  about loving the ones alive, the baby, the mother, because so often the  focus is only on mothers that have had an abortion and good for them  and not on those times when their hearts are deeply broken and that  love needed to nurture and care for them.   I am just grateful that we worship a God that believes in second  chances, and there is nothing that we can do to separate us from that  love.   I had the privilege of hearing a lady named Ramona Trevino. I was  guest-hosting somebody's radio show, and I had her on so that more  people could hear her story.                                time  1315    It is amazing. She is a brilliant, brilliant person. She was top of  her class in high school, and I believe it was at 15 that she became  pregnant. In the Hispanic community they had looked at her as a rising  star, going to be a great leader, and then she became pregnant, and  there were those who encouraged her to go ahead and have an abortion.  She didn't.   But she was so smart. Eventually there was an opening she saw for  director of Planned Parenthood in Sherman, Texas, and so she applied.  And because she was obviously so smart, she got the job. And she  continued to raise her daughter.   But they were teaching the people who worked at Planned Parenthood  that the most important statistic that the directors reviewed in their  directors' meetings were how many young girls are you able to get on  birth control pills. That was a more important number than how many  abortions you did that month.   The big money came from the abortions, of course, but the numbers  that they really pushed at the directors' meetings: How young are you  getting them on the pill? And how many are you getting on birth control  pills?   And to do that, they were trained to tell the child: Look, your  mother obviously, I am sure, will not approve of this, and you don't  have to tell her. This is between you and me, and I will keep your  confidence. I will let you know that I am your friend, and I will be  here for you.   It was building to, as they were taught, the younger you get a girl  on birth control pills, the more likely she is to forget some day and  become pregnant, and that is when they made the big bucks, off the  abortion. It began to bother Ramona so much that they were teaching  their employees to come between somebody like her and her own daughter.   And then to really affirmatively get young girls on birth control  pills because they were more likely to forget and get pregnant,  encouraging them to have a really wild sexual life so that they could  get pregnant became more than she could take, and she had to leave her  position. It was just too much. She sounded the alarm on that for  years.   But just the idea that you use dishonesty to try to make a customer-- not a patient, but a customer--out of a young child and our laws all  over the country say this person is not legally eligible to make a  binding contract without adult advice and supervision; and yet that is  where the focus is, get those girls pregnant so that we can make money  on an abortion.   I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey.    I appreciate my friend so much. Thank you.   I saw a podium out on the steps. There was going to be a great  celebration for women. I was a little surprised because I was thinking  we weren't supposed to talk about genders like men and women, father,  mother, and all that under Speaker Pelosi's rules, but  anyway, apparently it is okay today.    But it is hard to think about rejoicing when we are going to keep  taking the lives of the most innocent among us.   I know the big hearts of some of my friends on the other side, and  knowing their big hearts it is sometimes amazing to think: You surely  can't feel good about this.   In a Judiciary hearing some years back, we had a doctor testify who  did late-term abortions, up until his daughter was in a car wreck, and  he became so nauseous when he went to do another abortion that he  couldn't do them anymore.   I have said, in my days as a judge, I have seen pictures I wish I  could get out of my mind. I recall one young lady that was a victim,  and she had been put in a 50-gallon barrel to try to hide her body,  lime poured on, and they couldn't tell, was this limb removed while she  was alive or was it from deterioration.   But this doctor said, when it comes to the late-term abortion, the  child is clearly too big to remove from the womb without assistance,  and he described--in much more detail than I will be able to go into-- taking a clamp and feeling inside the womb until you find what you know  is a limb, arm or leg, clamping on, ripping the arm or leg from the  child at a time, like Mr. Smith said, they absolutely do feel great  pain, perhaps more than an adult. Ripping one. Then you continue to  feel for a limb and rip off another until you have done that four  times. And then, in his words, you feel for something bulbous at that  point. Then you know you have the child's head. You crush the head, and  then pull what is left out and dispose of it.   There are just too many big hearts on the other side of the aisle not  to at some point realize that that is something we probably should not  be doing. Very, very tragic.   I remember, you know, reading in the Bible as I was young and the  verses from the Old Testament about parents putting their child in an  idol's hand, flames leaping up so that the child could be burned to  death and that they began to be desensitized to the screams of the  children as they burned to death. And I thought that is inconceivable,  especially that a parent could do that to a child.   But when you hear about late-term abortions and you hear some of the  things that our society is doing in the name of freedom and rights--I  believe in God, but hypothetically, let's say anybody that doesn't, you  just believe in karma, don't believe in God. Is it conceivable that  good karma could come from tearing arms and legs off an innocent child  who hasn't done one single thing wrong?   Even if you don't believe in God, you can't surely think that is  going to bring you a lot of good karma. And, certainly, as you  celebrate the ability to continue to take innocent lives, that surely  can't bring good karma.   For people who believe in God, such as me, it is easy to understand  why that is described as being so very, very infuriating to a loving  God.   But that was passed today. I don't think it is constitutional. I  think that surely there are people on the Supreme Court, hopefully five  or six anyway, that have believed for years that should have been left  to the States and the people.   And so for the Federal Government to jump in and say they are taking  over, and they are knocking out all the power of the States and the  people to legislate--as Mississippi or Texas or other States have-- surely now that will end up being found to be unconstitutional by this  body. That is the hope and prayer.                                time  1330    When it comes to being callous, sometimes this body just is. And I  heard my friend, the majority leader, say that Republicans don't like  voting to pay the bills, and he is not quite right on that. I know he  means well and wouldn't deceive intentionally, so this isn't engaging  in personalities, but he doesn't have that quite right. What  Republicans don't like voting on and voting for, rather, is our great- grandchildren having to pay our bills.   And if this body next week becomes successful in adding $3 trillion  more to our national debt in the shortest amount of time in all of  American history, debt that we can never pay back--well, I say never.  Actually, the only way we can pay back the kind of debt that is being  heaped up is if the Biden administration creates such runaway inflation  that we start having the kind of inflation that Weimar Germany had  where people were having to carry wheelbarrows full of cash just to buy  a loaf of bread. If we had that kind of inflation then, yes, money  would be so devalued that we probably could pay back our debt. But  unless we go through something like that that is so economically  destructive that there would be Democrats and Republicans alike wanting  to have a revolution, we don't want that, we don't need that. We should  never allow ourselves to start down that road of having that kind of  runaway inflation. Even though it would enable us to pay back the debt,  it would be at the cost of total destruction of the Nation we love.   So Republicans, we don't mind paying our own way. A good example is  how many Republicans were upset back when President Bush was in his  last couple years of office--and it may have been the last year we were  in the majority as Republicans--but I remember we were $160 billion  approximately in the red that year, about $106 billion or so in the red  that was going to be added to the national debt.   And my Democrat friends across the aisle appropriately pointed out  that we should have balanced the budget. We were within $160 billion or  so. They were right. We should have balanced the budget. Some of us  were upset that we didn't. We were so close. Why not just do it and set  that marker and continue down that course?   So with a promise that Democrats would be balancing the budget they  won back the majority, and who would have ever dreamed that that 160 or  so billion-dollar debt in 1 year, in President Obama first year, would  become  [[Page H5169]]  1.5 to $1.6 trillion debt in 1 year? Who would have ever believed that  the people that said, oh, you had $160 billion in debt, we are going to  balance it, we are going to fix it, just put us in the majority; they  got the majority, and we ran up nearly $1.6 trillion in debt in 1 year.   And it was following that a year or two later Standard and Poor's  said you can't keep running up this debt without us having to downgrade  the quality of your debt, which means you will end up paying more  interest, and you will end up having to pay more, a higher percentage  of your overall revenue for just interest, which means less for  Medicare, less for Social Security, less for those that are really in  need and we need to help. And Standard and Poor's did exactly that.  They downgraded our debt. And as I understand it, if any other rating  service had downgraded our debt at the same time, interest rates would  have shot up for the U.S. Government. But fortunately we got a break.  That didn't happen. Didn't get another service. Maybe they were being  dishonest in not downgrading our debt because they were right; under  those Democratic majorities we were not being true to ourselves and our  generation and future generations. We were creating debt that would be  passed on for generations to come.   And I thought back then and said as much years ago, that would be  like an adult going in to a bank and saying I need this massive loan.  Well, what is it for? It is because I cannot control my spending. I  just can't stop spending. I am out of control. So I need a big loan.  Well, what do you have for security, for collateral? Well, I brought my  children and grandchildren in here, and so I am going to make them sign  off so that they will guarantee all the debt I am running up because I  can't control my spending. Well, no banker in their right mind would  loan money, but as the Federal Government we don't have to have a  banker agree to it, we just agree to it.   And we even have people who become jubilant, wow, we were able to  just add another $3 trillion to the backs of our great-great- grandchildren some day. Why? Because we just can't control our  spending. That is surely immoral. That is what Republicans don't like  voting for; putting more debt on future generations' children.   And so Republicans were wrong. We should have balanced that budget  when we were within $160 billion of doing so instead of failing to do  that, which enabled the Democrat majority to run up 1.5, $1.6 trillion  in 1 year; and, boy, did that blow the lid off the debt. And, yes,  after that both parties were just busy raising the debt, raising the  debt, all kinds of gimmicks to raise the debt, but at some point we are  going to have to either say this has got to stop or we are going to  finish destroying this country.   And, again, I think it is a moral issue. Are you moral enough not to  make future generations pay for what you refuse to? And I hope the  answer is, no, we are not going to do that, we are going to at some  point start being responsible.   But here in Washington it is a malady that seems to set in for so  many, for either party that gets here and then finds, wow, we have got  so much power, look what we can do. Since we know so much better than  anybody else in the country, even though their IQ may be 40 points  higher than our own, gee, we need to make decisions because overall we  are smarter.   So it is hard not to get very cynical here in Washington. And I have  used the quote before that, you know, Washington saying no matter how  cynical you get, it is never enough to catch up. I think my chief of  staff has caught up now. She has gotten pretty cynical.   But when you see the hundreds of billions of dollars that are at  stake for pharmaceutical companies, who I have applauded the way the  Trump administration got the red tape out of the way to get to a  vaccine in record times, even though the current President and Vice  President said as long as Trump was President they wouldn't trust it,  now they are not only trusting what President Trump got done, but  forcing people to have the vaccinations who have serious reservations,  who are familiar with the issue of informed consent. One of the  greatest developments in the history of healthcare that--maybe it has  been only 100 years in the whole history of man out of the thousands of  years of recorded history, maybe 100 years is all we have had--some  medical historians say of living at a time when you had a better chance  of getting well after seeing a doctor than of getting worse.    So you think about the thousands of years where you had a better  chance of getting sicker after seeing a doctor than getting well. And  we have now lived through an incredible handful of decades where not  only do you have a better chance of getting well, you are likely to get  well. And that continues to be the case as more and more lifesaving and  life-enhancing developments are made in medical care, in healthcare.   And yet the concept I am talking about that was such a great  development for not only healthcare but for freedom is called informed  consent.   So we are going to be filing next week a bill that addresses this:  The National Informed Consent Exemption, the NICE bill, N-I-C-E, that  will allow people--in fact, mandate that each individual will make  their own decision about vaccination after consulting with their own  physician about their own biology of their own body, what they are at  risk for, which conditions are more likely to occur with a particular  vaccine, which vaccine to use, whether any of them are good for that  particular person to use.   It troubled me deeply when I was told, gee, if an employer does what  President Biden is mandating and says you are not going to work here  unless you get a vaccination. And last I saw there were over 7,000  deaths that occurred right after getting a vaccination. CDC is careful  to say, yeah, but that doesn't mean that just because they died right  after the vaccination, that the vaccination caused it. Okay. But some  of them surely did.   A friend in Carthage lost her husband after he got the vaccination.  She said she didn't think he should, it wasn't a good idea because of  his condition. He got it, died. And when they opened him up he was just  full of blood clots, which was one of the risks for the vaccination he  took. And she said: ``He would be with me today if he had not been  vaccinated.''   Well, those are things a patient needs to talk about with their own  physician, make those decisions, and then give informed consent to get  the vaccination. That is what a free Nation should do instead of  mandating things that could cause death or problems.   Thankfully, that is not the high percentage of what will happen, but  it depends on your makeup what the discussion would be.   So I hope that we will get this bill passed at some point, whether it  is in the next year and a half or in the session after that, but we  need to get back to giving people freedom to make informed decisions  rather than mandated decisions from a bloated Washington bureaucracy  that doesn't know one thing about the biology of an individual patient  about their risk of death.   But I started to mention, I was surprised even apparently from what I  have been told that even if your employer mandates you cannot work here  unless you get a vaccination, you are totally on your own. Even  worker's compensation--from what I was advised, even worker's comp will  not help you or your family if you become disabled from the  vaccination. If you are one of the 7,000 plus that dies, nothing.                                time  1345    I would like to see it changed, but Congress has protected the  pharmaceuticals, so you can't sue them.   Maybe we need to make it where any government official that mandates  a vaccination that causes death or disability, maybe that government  official--maybe we should open that up to tort reform that allows  pursuit of that government official that forces somebody to get a  vaccination. Because when somebody is forced into something and they  are not allowed to have any input whatsoever, they, of course, lost  their freedom. But at least give their family a chance, if you are  going to force them to do something that kills them, at least allow the  family a chance to recover for the loss of the person that the  government official or the employer mandated take action that took  their life.   Of course, we have the President--here is a story on September 21 by  [[Page H5170]]  Charlie Spiering--that Joe Biden boasted to the United Nations he  restored the commitment to the World Health Organization. Well, for  those that have not been following the news, that means that President  Biden has restored the commitment of the United States to the best  interests of the Chinese Communist Party because the Chinese Communist  Party clearly has tremendous control over the World Health  Organization.   That was one of the things President Trump found shocking, that we  paid hundreds of millions of dollars to the World Health Organization  and they did not act in accordance with the best interests of the  United States. China paid, it seems like it was $30 or $40 million, and  the World Health Organization helped cover up what occurred in Wuhan.  They continued to lie for the Chinese Communist Party. They continued  to do the bidding for the Chinese Communist Party.   This story makes clear that, actually, President Biden now has made  sure that the United States is now fully supportive with and for the  Chinese Communist Party along with the World Health Organization.   A great article from Justin Haskins with The Federalist discusses Joe  Biden's vaccine mandate as blatantly unconstitutional, and then the  article says it is flatly unconstitutional. It truly is, but we have  come to a place in American history, which I guess these things have  happened before, there have been ridiculously inane decisions about the  Supreme Court in our history.   Well, until the Supreme Court acts, this blatantly unconstitutional  action by the Federal Government is allowed to continue to keep taking  place. So we will see what happens in the future.   But we keep hearing from the other side about how uncaring and  hardhearted Republicans are because of our position about our borders.  Well, it wasn't that important to have secure borders before we started  providing welfare benefits to American citizens. Once that started  occurring, as Milton Friedman pointed out, you must have borders if you  are going to have a welfare state; otherwise, it will be a very short  time before your country will cease to exist.   I understand the strategy. The more millions of people we get into  this country, especially those that are easily duped and don't speak  English, they are seen as new voters for the Democratic Party. I get  that. But for Heaven's sake, have a little heart about and for the  people that are being lured into this country. The 15,000, 16,000  Haitians that just came in recently weren't coming from Haiti. They  were Haitians originally, but they had gone to South America--most of  them, some Central America. When they got word that the Biden  administration was slinging open the border, letting anybody come in-- terrorists, give us your tired, your poor. Terrorists that want to  destroy our country, come on in. This administration is going to help.   Heck, we will even load up planes in Afghanistan and bring people  that we are now hearing are likely terrorists. We will bring them on in  because they may vote Democratic at some point.   But a caring person would understand these people left Haiti because  they couldn't live under the conditions in Haiti. They went seeking a  better life and found it in one country or another until they got word  that the border is open: You can come into America because President  Joe Biden is not going to send us back.   Then for 1,400 of those 15,000 to 16,000 Haitians, they were not sent  back where they came from seeking a better life. They were sent back to  Haiti where they hadn't lived in years. That is why you see some of  them crying, weeping on television: How could they do this? They  brought me back where I couldn't live. I couldn't make a living. I  couldn't live. We left here. We were doing better. And then we come to  the U.S. because you lured us up there, and now you send us back to the  place where we couldn't make a living.   I mean, what kind of country does that? What kind of political  leaders do that?   Well, the answer is this administration. If we had enough compassion  for the people of Mexico, Central America, South America, if we had the  right kind of compassion, truly caring about the people of those  countries, what we would do is secure the border.   The hell going on in Mexico because of the corruption from the drug  cartels doesn't need to be happening. Why is it happening? Because the  United States of America, the home of the brave, the land of the free,  we are sending tens of billions of dollars to the drug cartels in  Mexico.   They are getting money for bringing people into the U.S. illegally  from the people they are bringing. But they don't have enough, most of  them don't have the money to pay the whole debt, so they are told you  can work it off, because when you get where we are sending you, and we  are going to get the U.S. Government to pay to send you where we, the  drug cartels, need you to work.   As we have been told in testimony here on the Hill before, there are  drug cartels in every city in America. The U.S. Government, as the  border patrolmen told me down there, they call us their logistics. The  drug cartels get them across the border, and then we ship them wherever  the drug cartels want them to go.   This has to stop. This is an existential threat to America. As some  friends from around the globe have said, we get upset with the United  States but you have to understand, we see your light, light of freedom,  we see your light going out. You have to understand, when the light of  freedom goes out in America, it will go out around the world.    Reagan said no generation that lost freedom got it back in the same  generation. I am telling you, if we are not more careful in this body,  that light will be extinguished, and I don't think it will ever come  back until the end of time.   We have to be careful what we are doing. We have tremendous  responsibility. To whom much is given, much is required. We have an  awesome obligation, and we are not filling it when we run up a $3  trillion debt, nor when we legislate to kill the most innocent among  us.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
