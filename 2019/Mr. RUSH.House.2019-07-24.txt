 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address the crisis that is the  growing racial wealth gap in the United States.   A recent report from the Institute for Policy Studies noted that the  median wealth for Black families, adjusted for inflation, declined from  $7,323 to $3,557 between the years 1983 and 2013.   Mr. Speaker, if these alarming trends continue, the average Black  household is on track to own $0 in wealth by the year 2053.   This stands in sharp contrast to the average wealth of White  households, which increased by nearly $14,000 during the same period,  to an average of $137,000 by the year 2053.   Zero dollars for the Black families, $137,000 for the White families  by the year 2053.   The wealth disparity between Black and White families persists across  nearly all levels of income and education.   White middle-class households have almost eight times more wealth  than a Black household in the same income bracket.                                time  1045    Mr. Speaker, even a 4-year degree cannot remedy these disparities. A  2014 census survey found that a Black family whose head of household  has obtained a master's degree owns an average $37,600 of wealth,  compared to an average of $181,220 in a comparable White household, a  difference of nearly $150,000.   Mr. Speaker, the racial gap in our Nation must be addressed, as it is  a critical concern for all of our Nation.   The barriers between Black families and White families must be  addressed. The barriers preventing Black families from accumulating  wealth drive up poverty rates and stifle America's economy.   This is not just a Black issue; this is an American issue.   The inability to secure your future no matter how hard you work runs  contrary to our basic American principles. We must do more in this  House of Representatives to alleviate this critical issue, this crisis,  and we must continue to make our Nation, these United States of  America, the land of opportunity for all of its citizens.                            ____________________
