 Mr. President, I congratulate the American Legion on its  100-year anniversary.   On March 15, 1919, the first American Legion caucus was held. Later  that year, Congress established the American Legion as a federally  chartered corporation with purposes that include ``to cement the ties  and comradeship born of service; and to consecrate the efforts of its  members to mutual helpfulness and service to their country.'' The  original membership to the American Legion was extended to those who  served in the Armed Forces during World War I, which had ended a few  months before the organization was started. Over the past 100 years,  its membership has grown to nearly 2 million, with more than 12,000  posts.   I recently joined fellow Senators in cosponsoring S. 504, the Let  Everyone Get Involved in Opportunities for National Service, or LEGION,  Act, which would enable the American Legion to establish its own  membership criteria instead of requiring an act of Congress to change  eligibility requirements. In this legislation, we recognize the  American Legion ``provides invaluable services to its members and  supports the community of veterans who sacrificed in service of the  United States,'' and it ``has aided, assisted, and comforted the  families of the men and women who were called to serve or volunteered  to serve . . .''   I join many others across our country, including local posts, in  recognizing the American Legion's century of representation of American  veterans. In Idaho alone, there are approximately 9,750 Idaho members  of the American Legion as of 2018.   Thank you to the American Legion and its membership for your  outstanding service to our country and America's veterans.  Congratulations on 100 years of achievements on their behalf. I look  forward to our continued work ahead to ensure veterans have access to  the highest quality services worthy of their remarkable dedication to  our Nation.                            ____________________
