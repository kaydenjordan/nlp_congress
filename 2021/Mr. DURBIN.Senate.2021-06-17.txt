 Mr. President, in the city of Chicago, which I am proud  to represent, there is an organization called Life Span. This is an  incredible group of people who dedicate their  [[Page S4605]]  lives to providing comprehensive services for the survivors of domestic  violence and sexual assault.   Every day they respond to horrifying cases of abuse. They help  thousands of women and children access the support they need to address  trauma and to rebuild their lives.   For example, Life Span recently assisted a woman after her teenage  daughter was sexually assaulted by the woman's husband. Life Span was  able to help the mother and daughter navigate the overwhelming  challenges of pursuing justice against the abuser and offer support to  the daughter throughout this horrible process.   When the mother pursued a divorce from the abuser, Life Span filed a  petition and is representing the mother as she navigates issues of  child support and allocation of custody.   The three Life Span staffers that the mother and daughter have  interacted with all provided critical bilingual and bicultural support.  They have provided this crucial service for this family during an  incredibly traumatic experience. And all three of these staffers are  funded by assistance provided through the Victims of Crime Act, or  VOCA. Life Span told me that without VOCA funding, ``none of these  personnel . . . would be able to have done this job.''   Congress passed the Victims of Crime Act in 1984 to establish the  Crime Victims Fund. This fund provides grants to State victim  compensation and assistance programs, which assist victims with  expenses like medical bills, funeral expenses, and the loss of wages  during recovery.   How often I have heard Members of Congress come to the floor and in  committee speak about the plight of the victims of crime. This is an  effort--an overt effort by Congress--to make sure that we are there  when they desperately need us.   The fund also provides funds to thousands of victims service  providers, like Life Span, across the Nation. These providers offer  programs serving victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, child  abuse, trafficking, and drunk driving.   The Crime Victims Fund doesn't receive a dime of taxpayer dollars.  How about that? It is funded through criminal fines, penalties,  forfeited bail bonds, and special assessments collected by the Federal  Government.   Historically, most of the money in the fund comes from those criminal  fines. But in recent years, deposits into the fund have dropped  significantly, as the Justice Department began relying more on deferred  prosecutions and nonprosecution agreements.   Monetary penalties from these deferred prosecutions and  nonprosecution agreements are currently deposited into the general  Treasury instead of this fund, and, as a result, this shift has had a  devastating impact on the fund and the services available to crime  victims in America.   That is why a bipartisan, bicameral coalition of Members of Congress  worked with the advocacy organizations on a fix to the VOCA law to  sustain the Crime Victims Fund.   Our bill would stabilize the depleted fund by redirecting monetary  penalties from deferred prosecutions and nonprosecution agreements to  the victims and service providers that desperately need help.   The reduced deposits into the fund have already had a devastating  impact. Victim assistance grants have been reduced by more than $600  million in 2021, and more cuts are looming if we don't do something.   The executive director of Life Span in Chicago told me that VOCA  funds 44 percent of the agency's services--about $1.6 million annually.  A substantial loss in VOCA funds would mean that they would have to cut  back staff who provide legal services, affecting an estimated 880  clients   Life Span is not alone. Advocates across the State of Illinois and  across the country have reached out and shared what these cuts would  mean for their agencies and the victims they serve.   The Center for Prevention of Abuse in Peoria, IL, noted:         We never want to be in a position where we are made to turn       away people who need [our] specialized services and whole-      hearted, dedicated care. Our teams are already stretched thin       as they live the promise of our mission day in and day out.       Fewer VOCA dollars means less staff and a lessened ability to       help those who need to find safety, food, shelter,       empowerment, freedom, and peace.    There is no time to waste. Every day that goes by, we miss an  opportunity to help replenish this fund. In 2021, the fund has already  missed out on approximately $400 million in deposits. We are not even  halfway through the year. Imagine how much more money the fund may lose  if we don't do something.   That is why it is imperative that the Senate immediately pass this  bill. The House already did it in March, with broad bipartisan support,  and here in the Senate we have a bipartisan coalition of 56 Senators-- 36 Democrats and 20 Republicans--cosponsoring the legislation. We could  send this bill to the President's desk today. We should have sent it to  him weeks ago. Unfortunately, there is an objection that has prevented  us from moving forward.   In a recent letter to Leader Schumer, victims' rights and law  enforcement organizations said that, ``The objectors are, in effect,  holding victim services hostage in an ideological quest to overhaul the  Appropriations process by eliminating budgetary offsets.''   What a target to choose if you want to change the procedure of the  committee--crime victims?   I agree with the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence and so  many other groups. More than 1,700 that are begging us to do something  and stop holding this critical legislation.   The passage of this legislation today would ensure that victims are  able to maintain these critical services. Don't we owe it to them after  the promise of help to come through?   At this point, I would like to turn to my colleague Senator  Murkowski.   And I ask unanimous consent that Senators Murkowski, Toomey, and I be  able to complete our remarks prior to the vote.    Mr. President, I want to thank the Senator from Alaska  for her heartfelt remarks.   There are innocent people who are victims of domestic violence whose  fate depends on what we do right here and now. This is an important  budgetary debate that the Senator from Pennsylvania is raising. I ask,  please don't use these people in this desperate situation as a pressure  point. Let's try to reconcile this on a rational basis without  jeopardizing them.   As if in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 1652, which was received  from the House and is at the desk; further, that the bill be considered  read a third time and passed and that the motion to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, in reserving the right to object, I am  disappointed that the Senator from Pennsylvania is adamant in his  position, even though we are dealing with victims of crime, victims of  domestic violence, and victims of child abuse. Like Illinois,  Pennsylvania has experienced a nearly 70-percent cut in VOCA funding  since 2018, and more cuts are on the horizon because of his strategy.   Here is what it boils down to: If you listen carefully to what the  Senator from Pennsylvania has said, he is not suggesting that the money  is being spent for other purposes but is suggesting that it could be.  In fact, there is a conscious effort by the Appropriations subcommittee  to make sure, if all of the money is not spent in 1 year, that enough  will be maintained to stabilize the fund for future years. That is  thoughtful, and that is what we like to hear, but we are in a desperate  moment now wherein we need the money and need it at this moment.   I understand my colleague's concern about the scorekeeping in the  budget. It is an important issue, even though it is esoteric. But to do  it in relation to the Crime Victims Fund seems entirely misplaced.  While this adjustment does not, in fact, transfer money from the fund  to other priorities, it is just a budgeting gimmick that he is  suggesting.   This is not the right place or time to do this when thousands of  people across the United States are in desperate need of shelter to get  out of an abusive home; of help for their children who have witnessed  murders; and of dealing with court proceedings that may be  unintelligible to the average person to try to protect their families  and themselves. To think that we are engaged in this high-level budget  debate at this moment at their expense is just not right.   I urge my colleague to withdraw his amendment and allow the  legislation to proceed. We can debate the budget within the budget  resolution and the appropriations process but not at the expense of  crime victims across America. If he will not withdraw his amendment, I  must object.    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.    I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Booker)  and the Senator from Michigan (Mr. Peters) are necessarily absent.    I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Booker)  and the Senator from Michigan (Mr. Peters) are necessarily absent.    I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Booker)  and the Senator from Michigan (Mr. Peters) are necessarily absent.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 2124         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.
