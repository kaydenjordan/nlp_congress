 Mr. Speaker, it is an honor for me to welcome to the  United States Capitol my pastor, William Hild, who led us in the  opening prayer today.   Pastor Hild is not only a tremendous community leader in my hometown  of Sarasota, Florida, but he has been a great friend to Sandy and me,  and a resource to me and my family, for nearly 18 years.   Since 1997, Pastor Hild has served as the pastor of FirstSarasota,  the Downtown Baptist Church. Under his leadership, the church has  grown. It is very dynamic. It makes a big difference in my community.  Also under his leadership, we have seen the incredible outreach that he  has done in terms of strengthening and encouraging people on our  beautiful Gulf Coast.   My wife Sandy and I want to personally thank Pastor Hild for what he  has done for us in our life and what he continues to do in our  community to make it a better community. It is a privilege to have  Pastor Hild and his family here today.                            ____________________
