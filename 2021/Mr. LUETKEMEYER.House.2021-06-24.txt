 Madam Speaker, I rise today to discuss S.J. Res. 15,  House Democrats' attempt to limit the ability of our Nation's banks to  serve consumers by overturning the true lender rule.   The true lender rule was finalized by the OCC in 2020, in an effort  to clarify who was the true lender in national bank third-party  relationships. By providing this clarity, these third-party entities  were able to provide financial services in partnership with financial  institutions with the protections of legal precedence.   Partnering with third parties like fintechs gives financial  institutions the ability to increase access to credit, especially for  low- and moderate-income consumers and small businesses.   Unfortunately, the bill before us is nothing more than a politically  motivated attempt by Democrats to make it more expensive and difficult  for banks to serve customers, and its passage will have long-term  consequences.   According to the Congressional Review Act, if this legislation is  passed, the OCC will not have the ability to issue a similar rule down  the road. This will leave bank-fintech partnerships in limbo with a  great deal of uncertainty regarding the loans they make and who is the  true lender in the relationship.   Democrats are constantly putting their disdain for America's banks  ahead of the needs of their constituents, and this bill is another  prime example of this unfortunate practice.   I firmly oppose this bill and its prevention of widespread financial  inclusion, especially for low- and moderate-income consumers.
