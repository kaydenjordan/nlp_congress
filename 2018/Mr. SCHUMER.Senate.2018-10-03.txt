 Mr. President, first, I am glad that the majority leader  and I get along. I am glad we are able to do certain things together,  like the opioid bill and the appropriations bill, but that cannot hold  me back from responding to the blatant falsehoods he tells day after  day after day on this floor.   First, from the man who singlehandedly delayed the filling of Justice  Scalia's seat for 10 months to complain about a 1-week delay to get the  truth--give me a break. It is classic, diversionary, blame-the-other- person tactics, when he himself is the master of delay. It is galling  and appalling day after day to hear the majority leader get on his high  horse about delay, when he almost invented the word when it comes to  judicial nominations.   Second, he blames Democrats for the delay, which is about the most  blatant falsehood I have heard uttered on the floor in a long time. The  majority leader knows darn well that he has the sole power to determine  when to put the Kavanaugh nomination on the floor. He could have done  it 2 weeks ago. He could have done it last week. He is now insisting he  will do it this week.   Democrats have no say. He talked about an agreement that caused a  week's delay. Who was the agreement with? Three Republican Senators.   The majority leader knows--knows--that it was Republicans who caused  him to delay, both for the FBI investigation and for Judge Kavanaugh  and Dr. Ford to testify. He didn't have to do that. He had the power.  He is to blame for the delay, but he couldn't do anything otherwise  because his own Republicans insisted on it.   Again, it is a blatant falsehood. I am so tempted to use the L word,  but he is my friend. To say that Democrats caused the delay--Mr.  Leader, assert your power to determine what is put on the floor, and be  a man. Man up and say it is your decision, not ours. We have nothing to  do with it.   Third, he says he is one of the most qualified nominees we have ever  seen. We know what is going on here. Everyone--everyone--including the  majority leader himself, knows that Kavanaugh is a deeply flawed  candidate for a whole lot of reasons. Knowing that, the majority leader  and the Republican majority have to divert attention from Kavanaugh. So  they are focusing on people who did nothing wrong, like Senator  Feinstein, like the Judiciary Democratic minority, and like the  Democratic Party.   It is outrageous, but they know that Kavanaugh is not very good, and  they know his testimony hurt him across America. I was talking to a  CEO, a Republican of a major company. He said his board was watching  the debate, and every one of them changed their mind after seeing  Kavanaugh testify. They said: This guy doesn't belong on the bench. We  can do better. That is the overwhelming reaction of Americans.   Judge Kavanaugh hurt himself dramatically and permanently by his  screed--his nasty, partisan screed. That is something of a new,  unschooled, two-bit politician, not someone who wants to be on the  Supreme Court of the United States.   He hurt himself. Leader McConnell knows that. The Republican  leadership knows it. Donald Trump knows it, but they have to get the  focus off of Kavanaugh. So they come up with these straw men and women.  They come up with these false innuendos, distortions, and dishonesty.  It is not going to work. It is not going to work.   Now, let me turn to the President, and in the strongest possible  terms, let me condemn the comments by President Trump last night about  Dr. Ford. President Trump's outright mockery of a sexual assault  survivor, riddled as it was with falsehoods, was reprehensible, beneath  the office of the Presidency, and beneath common decency from one  person to another. President Trump owes Dr. Ford an immediate apology.   For too long--far too long--survivors of sexual assaults have been  afraid to come forward because they thought that powerful men would  shout them down and destroy their character. The President of the  United States, the most powerful man there is, confirmed those fears  for millions of women in the most despicable way possible.   President Trump should send a message to the women of America right  now that he is sorry for saying what he said about Dr. Blasey Ford and  that survivors of sexual assault should not only be heard but treated  with dignity and respect and compassion.   You don't have to believe everything Dr. Ford said--and I do--to  refrain from the nasty and vicious attacks, riddled with lies, in sort  of a mobocracy-type way, and yet Donald Trump shows no restraint and no  regulator. He is the prime example of why the norms in America,  regardless of politics and regardless of party, are declining, and we  don't hear a peep out of my colleagues on the other side, with a few  notable and noble exceptions.   He is ruining the norms of America. He is so degrading the way people  treat each other. It is pathetic, and it does permanent damage to this  Republic, unless his own party members or others close to him speak up.   Anyone who watched Dr. Blasey Ford saw a credible and courageous  woman, who elected to relive the worst night of her life because she  felt a civic duty to come forward. That action took immense courage.   She is not the first. It is not unusual anymore. We know thousands of  women who were hurt and then afraid to come forward mainly because they  thought they would be ridiculed and disbelieved, just as President  Trump appallingly, despicably, and lowly did last night.   Dr. Ford's actions took courage. She is a woman who is far more  honest than Donald Trump. She admitted that she was ``terrified'' to  speak in public about her very private pain and trauma.   I have been disappointed by President Trump's comments before, but  this is a new low. I repeat, President Trump should apologize  immediately.   Now, what will my colleagues on the other side do? They will ignore  President Trump's comments, sidestep President Trump's comments, and  spend their time blaming Democrats, even though we had no say in the  delay. The delay was through Republicans. We know what they will do. It  is shameful.   The President is day by day tearing down the norms that have built  this country up. We have had the greatest norms, the greatest  character, and the greatest behavior of any Nation ever, but it is  declining now because people of goodwill allow Trump to do it without  criticizing him. It is about time they did. It is about time they did.   Now, shifting focus back to events here in Congress. We have to get  back to reality and truth and focus on treating the Supreme Court  nomination debate the right way. When all is said and done, this is  about the nominee's credibility and temperament.   I have said it before, and I will say it again: There are many who  say what happened when someone was 15 and 18 doesn't indicate their  personality and what kind of person they are when they are 53.   Well, I believe Dr. Ford, and I believe what she said is very  relevant. There are many who don't want to consider that, but there is  an issue that should matter even to them, and that is the credibility  and temperament of Judge Kavanaugh.   This is what he is at 53. If he can't tell the truth about previous  encounters, engagements, behavior, and activity, which we have found  over and over  [[Page S6458]]  with Judge Kavanaugh, he doesn't deserve to be on the bench. He doesn't  deserve to be on the bench.    That is why we need an FBI investigation. That is why Republicans  stymied Leader McConnell in his head-long rush to have a vote and  demanded an FBI investigation--it wasn't Democrats, we know that-- because they wanted to get to the truth, because credibility of a  Justice on the Supreme Court is a very, very important characteristic,  right below it is temperament, and then lack of partisanship.  Unfortunately, at least from initial indications, Judge Kavanaugh is  not high on any of those three lists. That is why we need the  investigation, and that is why we need it to be thorough, but we still  don't know how thorough of an investigation the FBI is conducting.   As of last night, Dr. Blasey Ford and her list of corroborating  witnesses have not been interviewed. While Deborah Ramirez has  reportedly been interviewed, her attorney says her list of  corroborating witnesses have not. NBC News is reporting that more than  40 people with potential information for the investigation have not  been contacted for interviews by the FBI. I heard this story over and  over. People call the tips line--that is what they are supposed to do-- and they don't get a call back. This may be vital information. We want  to know the truth. It can all be done in a week, the week Senator Flake  and Senator Collins and Senator Murkowski asked for, not the Democrats  asked for--although we certainly agree with them--but that is not what  caused Leader McConnell to delay, and every Republican Senator knows  it. So that is why we need this to be a thorough investigation.   Without a clear sense of what the White House has told the FBI to  look at in this investigation, we have no idea if the FBI is doing a  real investigation or simply preparing a figleaf--at the direction of  the White House--for Republicans to vote yes.   I understand the difficulty for the FBI. I have a great deal of  respect for Director Wray. He has been pushed around. They have been  ridiculed by the President--the brave men and women who risk their  lives for us as part of law enforcement, but the FBI has a duty to do,  and Director Wray has a duty to their reputation. If he is being  constrained by the White House, he has an obligation to let us know,  and certainly Counsel McGhan has an obligation to let us know what  constraints he has placed upon the FBI.   So here is what needs to happen: First, the White House must publicly  release in writing what the White House Counsel has instructed the FBI  to pursue. If the FBI is not interviewing these witnesses that Ms.  Ramirez's attorney presented to them because Counsel McGhan or Donald  Trump has said don't do it, we ought to know that, and certainly not  just we ought to know that, the Senators who requested the FBI  investigation ought to know that.   Second, Leader McConnell should arrange an all-Senators briefing from  the agent in charge of the investigation before the vote. We should  know what he did and what he didn't do and why.   Third, the findings of the FBI investigation, upon completion, should  be released publicly, with any personal information redacted. This is  not the usual practice, but it has been done in the past when it is  needed, and it is sure needed now. The FBI should do it.   These three steps would go a long way to ensure the public's faith  that the investigation has been conducted fairly, fully, and properly.   This debate, this nomination, is about whether Judge Brett Kavanaugh  has the character, the credibility, and the impartiality to serve on  the Nation's highest Court. In order to be an effective judge at any  level, you need to be impartial. You need to be dispassionate. We don't  ask our judges to be perfectly neutral, but we can't tolerate judges  who are nakedly partisan either. Judge Kavanaugh himself has said that  ``most obviously, a judge cannot be a political partisan.'' Those are  his words, but that is just what he has shown us he is, through his  long history and now with his recent rant.   The testimony Judge Kavanaugh prepared for the Judiciary Committee  last Thursday--prepared testimony, this was not just on the spur-- showed who he was, and it was steeped in partisan resentment and  acrimony. He tried to implicate sitting Senators in a ``calculated and  orchestrated political hit job.'' That is what he said to the Senators  he was being interviewed by. He denounced ``left-wing opposition  groups'' who don't have close to the power the hard right has had in  pushing our Republican colleagues around to rush this nomination  through, but we don't hear about them. Then, topping it off, he  portrayed the recent allegations against him as ``revenge on behalf of  the Clintons.''   I dare say, Dr. Ford didn't have the Clintons on her mind once when  she wrestled and struggled with whether to come forward. It is an  absurd charge--absurd.   He even told Democratic Senators: ``What goes around comes around,''  which, to many here, sounds just like a threat. A judge telling people  ``what goes around comes around''? A judge, a Supreme Court Justice  says that when he is nominated? We can certainly do better. Even if  someone who has the same ideology as Kavanaugh is chosen, someone who  doesn't do things like that should be before us. I hope that person  will not be chosen, of course, if he has Judge Kavanaugh's ideology,  which is one of the main reasons I was against him to begin with.   We should never forget it is likely Judge Kavanaugh will greatly  impede or eliminate a woman's right to choose. It is likely--it is very  likely--he will get rid of healthcare, including preexisting  conditions. It is likely he will allow Presidential overreach. Those  three substantive bases motivated most of us to come out against  Kavanaugh, even before his awful testimony.   I understand Judge Kavanaugh felt his character was under assault. I  understand how he is feeling angry and upset. I understand responding  to questions in the heat of the moment with words you might later  regret, but these were prepared remarks. It takes a partisan to see a  partisan conspiracy against him.   As conservative fellow at the Brookings Institute and former  Kavanaugh defender Benjamin Wittes wrote in a column entitled ``I know  Brett Kavanaugh, but I wouldn't confirm him'':         Judge Kavanaugh's opening statement was an unprecedentedly       partisan outburst of emotion from a would-be judge. I do not       begrudge him the emotion, even the anger. . . . But I cannot       condone the partisanship--which was raw, undisguised, naked,       and conspiratorial--from someone who asks for public faith as       a dispassionate and impartial judicial actor. His performance       was wholly inconsistent with the conduct we should expect       from a member of the judiciary.    That is from somebody who is a conservative and a Kavanaugh  supporter. The courage that a good number of both Kavanaugh's friends  and observers like Wittes are showing and realizing that this guy is  too much, I wish we saw a little more of that from the Republican side  because they know, deep in their hearts, this guy shouldn't be on the  bench. We know they know.   Now, the judge's partisanship at a hearing raises questions, as I  have mentioned, but the biggest issue against Judge Kavanaugh, in my  judgment, is credibility. It is the No. 1 issue. Does Kavanaugh always  tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth? Whatever  you think of what he did as a 17- or 18-year-old, what Judge Kavanaugh  has said as a 53-year-old matters, whether you think the 17- or 18- year-old behavior should be part of the decision, which I do, or  whether you don't.   The harsh fact is, Judge Kavanaugh has repeatedly--repeatedly--danced  around the truth on issues large and small in 2004, his first  confirmation hearings; in 2006, his second; and now again in 2018. On  things such as what happened when he was in high school and college and  law school, to things such as grand jury proceedings and White House  controversies, again, he has danced around the truth, never been  direct, and often tried to mislead. We cannot have a Supreme Court  Justice whose credibility is in doubt. That will hurt the Nation for a  generation.   So I ask my colleagues, whatever you think about what Judge Kavanaugh  did at 17 or 18, think about what he said at age 53. Think about the  credibility of the man now as a grown adult and a judge. Think about  whether you want to put someone who has been so partisan, with  questionable credibility, on the Court or whether there is someone  better.
