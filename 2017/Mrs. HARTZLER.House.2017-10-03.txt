 Mr. Speaker, I am proud today to stand and support  this rule that will allow for the passage of the Pain-Capable Unborn  Child Protection Act, which is also known as Micah's Law. The  underlying legislation will protect thousands of unborn babies from the  excruciating pain of abortion.   Twenty weeks post-fertilization is an incredible milestone in  pregnancy for moms and their unborn babies. Children at this stage in  development have fingers and toes, and they have well-developed  neurological structures that can feel pain. In fact, babies at this age  are hypersensitive, feeling pain more acutely than you and me.   Preemies, children born at the beginning of the sixth month, just  like Micah, can survive outside the womb. These babies are the future  doctors, nurses, scientists, teachers, law enforcement officers in our  country.   H.R. 36 protects this next generation of America's children. Our  country is unified in protecting life at 20 weeks. Six in ten Americans  support the pain-capable legislation, and 20 States have passed similar  legislation.   Let's put an end to the abortion of these potential children. Let's  support this rule.
