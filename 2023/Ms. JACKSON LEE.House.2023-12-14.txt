 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2670,  the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2024.   Congress has the solemn duty to ensure that those who wear the  uniform of the United States--and those civilians who provide  logistical and operational support--have the equipment, training, and  resources needed to carry out and complete their mission.   And we must never forget that a grateful nation has a sacred  obligation, in the words of President Lincoln, ``to care for him who  has borne the battle, and for his widow and his orphan.''   Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Chairman Rogers, Ranking Member  Smith, and the committee staff for their diligent work that resulted in  this bipartisan, bicameral report, which includes my legislation, the  Foreign Extortion Prevention Act.   I was pleased to work with Senator Whitehouse to help negotiate the  inclusion of this legislation, which will be the most significant  international criminal anti-corruption legislation since 1977.   The Foreign Extortion Prevention Act will finally enable U.S. law  enforcement to indict foreign kleptocrats for extorting U.S. businesses  and Americans.   The harms caused by foreign bribe demands are innumerable and include  foreign officials who demand bribes and extort individuals in  furtherance of trafficking of children and drugs into and out of the  United States.   These crimes largely go unpunished.   With the passage of FEPA (through the NDAA), however, those who  violate the provisions of FEPA could face a criminal fine of up to  $250,000 and a prison sentence of up to 15 years.   As reported by Transparency International U.S. in May 2023, a recent  survey by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development  found that foreign officials who demand or receive bribes are only  criminally punished by their home governments some 20 percent of the  time.   As many of you are aware, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA)  prohibits U.S. companies from bribing foreign officials.   But it does not protect U.S. companies from predatory foreign  officials who solicit bribes--and then partner with the Chinese state- owned enterprises (SOEs) that are more than willing and able to pay  them.   China does not appear to have ever enforced its own version of the  FCPA, despite the Communist Party's continued crackdowns on companies  it perceives to be corrupt or disloyal.   FEPA, by making it a crime for a foreign official to demand a bribe  from a U.S. company, would therefore not only help to level the playing  field for U.S. companies--but it will also deter and hold accountable  corrupt officials who, by betraying their oaths for Beijing's bribes,  become complicit in the Communist Party's global campaign to subvert  rule of law and upend the security order.   By joining with the United Kingdom, Germany, France, and other  democratic allies who have already enacted similar legislation to  protect their own businesses, the United States can set an alternative  example to China's use of corruption as a tool of foreign policy--one  that, in promoting honest competition and rule of law, will ultimately  benefit our national security.   In order to restore competitiveness, the United States must double- down on the rule of law.   The kleptocrats that extort U.S. companies also cheat their own  people out of economic development and prosperity.   The United States must stand with these victims of kleptocracy.   This means combating the demand side of bribery--we must make  kleptocrats think twice before they demand a bribe.   Already, the U.S. Department of Justice is attempting to deter the  demand side of bribery with the tools that it has.   However, without a specific authority to prosecute foreign extortion,  we are leaving the DOJ without the key tool that it needs to achieve  this goal.   It is long overdue that we expand our foreign bribery laws to capture  the malfeasance of foreign kleptocrats--in this age of globalization,  we can wait no longer.   Please join me in passing the FY2024 National Defense Authorization  act, which includes my legislation, the Foreign Extortion Prevention  Act, which protects rule-abiding companies, and stands up for the  victims of kleptocracy around the world.   It is time that we expand our foreign bribery laws to capture the  malfeasance of foreign kleptocrats--in this age of globalization, we  can wait no longer.   This legislation will protect rule-abiding companies and stand up for  the victims of kleptocracy around the world.   So, I look forward to the NDAA being signed by the President of the  United States and becoming law.

Yes, and we have reaffirmed diversity, equity, and inclusion, as well  as the personal rights of our soldiers to have reproductive care.   In addition, my bill, the Foreign Extortion Prevention Act, was  included, which stops Americans from being extorted overseas. It will  finally enable U.S. law enforcement to indict foreign kleptocrats for  extorting U.S. businesses and Americans individually that basically  stops the prosperous work that we are doing.   Mr. Speaker, as well I stand here supporting the Biden-Harris  administration, because inflation is going down and retail purchases  are going up. We are spreading broadband across America, and, yes, we  are standing together to fight against denying women their reproductive  rights.   Biden and Harris are going forward with this Democratic Congress, and  we are standing here working for America. We will never leave you  alone. We will always stand with you.                            ____________________
