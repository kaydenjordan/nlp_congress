 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, we are in a day--in fact, yet another  day--of fast-developing, dramatic events. The news today that LTG  Michael Flynn, who served until recently as National Security Advisor,  may be culpable of lying to the FBI and therefore prosecutable for a  Federal criminal violation adds urgency to the need for a special  independent counsel to investigate all of the events surrounding his  conversation with the Russian Ambassador and who knew what about it  when and what was done.   The severity of this potential constitutional crisis--and we are  careening toward a constitutional crisis--makes it all the more  necessary that we have an objective and independent investigation, that  Attorney General Jeff Sessions recuse himself, and the White House  guarantee that documents are preserved--as we have requested in a  letter sent by Members of the Judiciary Committee, including myself-- today.   The severity of this potential constitutional crisis cannot be  exaggerated. Still we are in the early days of a new administration but  already the turmoil and turbulence throw into question almost all of  the proceedings here on other issues, urgent and important issues-- whether infrastructure, trade policy, job creation, economic growth,  all of the pressing issues of our day. They also raise potential  conflicts of interest on the part of other officials before us now,  including the nomination of Scott Pruitt. News that we have also  learned very recently, in this day of fast-developing events, increases  the importance of deliberate and thoughtful consideration of this  nomination.   Just within the last hour, a judge in Oklahoma has ordered the  release of thousands of emails sent by this nominee, Scott Pruitt, the  attorney general of Oklahoma, relevant to his dealings with oil and gas  interests in his State and elsewhere on relevant legislative and  litigation issues. This development really requires a delay in this  vote so we can review those emails and know what those conflicts of  interest were, what they may continue to be, and whether his answers to  our colleagues in his testimony at his confirmation hearing were  completely accurate and truthful. We need to delve into those emails,  know their contents, examine the contents, in fairness to him and in  fairness to an administration that may be appointing for confirmation  yet another official like General Flynn, who was forced to resign just  days after his appointment.   The interests of the Trump administration, as well as this body,  would be well served by delaying this vote so we can review those  emails. I call upon the Republican leadership to delay this vote, give  us a chance to review the emails, and give the American public a chance  to understand how those emails reflect on the qualifications of Scott  Pruitt and the potential conflicts of interest that may disqualify him  from serving in this all-important role.   I am here to oppose the nomination of Scott Pruitt, but whether we  oppose or approve of this nomination, we owe it to ourselves--I say to  my colleagues--we owe it to the United States Senate to delay this vote  so the potentially explosive material and contents of these emails can  be fully considered. If we fail to delay, we are, in effect,  potentially confirming a nominee who may be compelled to resign after  his disqualifying conflicts of interest are exposed to public view. We  have an obligation in advising and consenting to be as fully informed  as possible. If there were no such emails, if there were no such court  order, there might be an excuse for rushing to judgment as we are on  track to do now. There is no excuse for a rush to confirmation. Our  obligation to advise and consent implies also an obligation to review  these emails as comprehensively and fully and fairly as possible before  we make this decision.   The President has nominated Scott Pruitt as the next Administrator of  the Environmental Protection Agency to serve a mission, which is to  protect human health and safeguard the environment. Even before  disclosure of these emails, which involve his contacts with oil and gas  interests, he came before us as perhaps one of the least-qualified  people in the United States of America to serve in this position. I  don't make this statement lightly. It may sound like hyperbole or  exaggeration, but the fact is, anyone who studies Scott Pruitt's record  as attorney general of his State--and I served as attorney general of  mine so I know his position pretty well--can see that his record is  antithetical and hostile to the mission and purpose of this Agency.   He is a potential Administrator who will take office at a critical  juncture for our planet. Sea levels continue to rise, long-established  weather patterns  [[Page S1263]]  have begun shifting, and the average global temperature is rapidly  approaching 2 centigrades Celsius above preindustrial levels. That is  an increase which many climate scientists believe may be a point of no  return--no return for the planet, no return for us, no return for  generations to come. We are at a historic moment.   The question will be whether Scott Pruitt will be dedicated to doing  something about climate change, about the pollution of our air,  streams, rivers, and oceans, whether he will be committed to enforcing  the rules and laws that protect us against those dangers of degradation  of our environment--degradation of the air we breathe, the water we  drink, the open spaces we enjoy.   That is the same Scott Pruitt who was pressed by our colleagues  during his confirmation hearing and could not name a single regulation  designed to protect clean air or water that he supports--the very same  Scott Pruitt, who was asked by our colleague Jeff Merkley whether he  agreed with the statement, ``Warming of the climate system is  unequivocal,'' and he dodged and equivocated. When he was questioned  about hundreds of thousands of dollars he has received in campaign  contributions from energy companies, he basically refused to answer. He  dodged the question. That is the Scott Pruitt who would become  Administrator of the EPA, and it is the same Scott Pruitt who, as  attorney general of Oklahoma, fought the tremendous progress made by  the Obama administration at every turn, taking legal action against the  EPA no fewer than 14 times.   While he was in office, he worked hand in hand with Oklahoma's  largest energy companies to roll back regulations that are vital to the  health and well-being of the American people, not just the people of  Oklahoma, as bad as that would be, but of all Americans, all of our  plant.   When he worked hand in hand with the Oklahoma energy industry, those  common bonds of purpose and work would be well illuminated by these  emails that today will be disclosed. In fact, maybe some of those  conflicts of interest will be revealed and dramatized by those emails.  That is why we must wait to have this confirmation vote.   He sued to try and block efforts to reduce nationwide emissions of  methane, a greenhouse gas roughly 30 times more effective at trapping  even carbon dioxide. He block the Clean Power Plan. He took three  separate actions against the EPA's mercury and air toxic rule,  targeting standards that the EPA estimates will save 45,000 lives.  Those are three more actions, it should be noted, than he took to  proactively promote clean air and clean water on behalf of the people  of Oklahoma in his entire time in office. Why did he take those  actions? Who helped him do it? How and why? The emails will help tell  that story and answer those questions.   Taken alone, even without the emails, these actions hardly show a  record of someone dedicated to promoting and protecting the  environment. Not once during his confirmation process did Mr. Pruitt  demonstrate to me a convincing willingness, let alone eagerness, to  uphold the mission of the Agency he now hopes to run, nor has he shown  an intent to be open and responsive with Members of this body. Most  troubling of all, he has, in no uncertain terms, failed to give any  indication that he will be a champion for our environment and that he  will advance scientifically sound policies to protect the public's  health.   The only thing Attorney General Pruitt has made abundantly clear is  that he holds a derisively dismissive attitude toward the Agency he now  seeks confirmation to lead. His nomination is an affront to the EPA,  but even more, it is a threat to our health, a threat to our  environment, a threat to the quality of our air and water, and a risky  gamble on the world we will leave to our children and our  grandchildren.   There is a very real concern about whose side Scott Pruitt will be  on. The question is, Whose side will he be on when and if he is  Administrator of the EPA? He has already shown a willingness to use the  power of whatever office he holds to advance an extreme agenda and to  malign opponents. Polluters do not need another champion in this  administration, and our environment does not need another foe. We have  enough foxes guarding henhouses as it is in this administration.   Mr. Pruitt's coziness with the firms that he will be required to  regulate--again the emails will tell the story about his relationships  with special interests. That is critically important, and, in fact,  even on the record we have now, it should disqualify him from this  position.   He doubts the effects of climate change and the extent to which our  rapidly warming climate is as a result of human activity, calling this  debate ``far from settled'' and placing himself well outside mainstream  opinion. His denials are rooted in the promise of funds from  corporations and interest groups that think it is far better for their  bottom line to pretend that incontrovertible climate change simply  doesn't exist.   He is a beneficiary of the denying corporations and special  interests, and those contentions are not only regressive and fallacious  but dangerous. If he is a prisoner of those special interests, as these  emails may show him to be, my colleagues will regret voting for him-- another reason that delaying his confirmation vote is appropriate and  necessary now.   The scientific evidence of climate change and human involvement is  overwhelming. You don't have to look hard to see it. Most of us in this  Chamber would need to speak only with a handful of our constituents-- the men and women who sent us here--to see the real impact this crisis  is having.   My home State of Connecticut has experienced a major rise in storms  that have cost hundreds of millions of dollars in damage as well as  several lives. It seems that as soon as our State begins to rebuild  from one storm, another wreaks havoc on many of the same devastated  communities. These monster storms have become the new normal.   In Connecticut and around the country, weather disasters are rapidly  becoming part of a way of life, tragically, for innocent people caught  in their wake. In just 6 years, Connecticut has weathered the damage  and destruction of a freak October snowstorm, Superstorm Sandy, and the  force of numerous nor'easters. Severe storms like these, as well as  other disasters--floods, tornadoes, droughts--are happening at a rate  four times greater than just 30 years ago.   I am not here to argue climate change. I am here to argue that Scott  Pruitt is unqualified to fight climate change because he denies it is a  problem, and he denies the mission and purpose of the EPA as a vital  purpose and mission of our Federal Government.   The people of Connecticut understand climate change, and they get it.  They understand that it is happening and that it is happening in their  everyday lives. They see its effects. They know its causes, and they  know the truth. It will get worse. We need to take action.   This body is on the verge of action that should be postponed so that  we can consider vitally important information in those emails that  reflects on conflicts of interest, ties to special interests, influence  on Scott Pruitt, benefits to him in the past, and debts that he may  owe, literally and figuratively, to those special interests that may  impact his performance as Administrator of the EPA.   As attorney general of my State, environmental protection was a  priority to me. I will be honest; I sued the Federal Government, just  as Scott Pruitt did. I sued the Federal Government so that  environmental protection would be made more rigorous and stringent and  people would be protected, not to slow down the EPA but to speed it up  to provide impetus for its action and, in fact, to compel it to carry  out its mission and purpose.   Scott Pruitt has acted in exactly the opposite way, and the reasons  for his antipathy and hostility to the EPA may well be illustrated even  more dramatically and directly by these emails that we should consider.   I urge the Republican leadership to postpone and delay this vote so  that we may, in fact, consider those emails.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I am proud to recognize and  celebrate the 25th anniversary of Alexion Pharmaceuticals, a company  that has brought life-transforming therapies to patients around the  world from its headquarters in New Haven, CT. Since its establishment  by Leonard Bell in 1992, Alexion has become a global leader in  discovering, developing, and delivering therapies for people with  devastating and rare disorders. I have always been honored to call  Alexion a Connecticut company, and I applaud the life-changing gains in  medicine that it has made from the city of New Haven since 1992.   Even while maintaining a commitment to developing new therapies that  impact the lives of patients with rare disorders throughout the world,  Alexion has always remained committed to its community in Connecticut.  Whether it is helping connect individuals who are homeless with  temporary work assignments in New Haven, partnering with scientists at  the University of Connecticut, or subsidizing public transportation to  help students get to their classes at Gateway Community College,  Alexion has proven time and time again that its commitment to the  people of Connecticut and to its over 1,000 employees in the State is  as strong as ever.   On its 25th anniversary, I applaud Alexion and the people who work so  tirelessly for Alexion's values and commitment each and every day.  Alexion continues changing lives through its medical breakthroughs, and  I am so pleased to know that they call Connecticut home. Thank  you.                            ____________________
