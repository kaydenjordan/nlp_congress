 Mr. President, last week, I travelled overseas as part of  a congressional delegation conducting meetings on Russian aggression,  security, and food security, among other things. Our delegation was  scheduled to return on Monday, April 25, but due to mechanical problems  with our aircraft, we were delayed for a day.   As a result of that delay, I missed two votes. I take seriously my  duties in service to the people of Pennsylvania, including voting on  policies and nominations. Accordingly, I wish for the record to show  that, had I not been absent due to mechanical difficulties with the  plane, I would have voted yea on the following votes: yea on vote No.  135, on the motion to invoke cloture: Lael Brainerd to be Vice-Chairman  of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System; yea on vote  No. 136, on confirmation: Lael Brainerd, to be Vice-Chairman of the  Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.                            ____________________
