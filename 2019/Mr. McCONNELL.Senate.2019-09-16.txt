 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, this weekend saw a brazen attack by  Iran on a critical oil facility in Saudi Arabia. This is not just an  isolated drone strike with the prospect of regional escalation but an  attack with significant repercussions for the entire global energy  market.   We are fortunate that advances in U.S. oil and gas production have  made the United States more energy independent and have added capacity  to global markets, but the impact of this attack could still be  substantial. For this reason, I welcome the administration's  preparations to potentially release oil from our Strategic Petroleum  Reserve, if needed, to stabilize global markets. I hope our  international partners will join us in imposing consequences on Tehran  for this reckless, destabilizing attack.                            ____________________     Mr. President, now on another matter, when the Senate  returned last week, we anticipated our top priority would be conducting  the appropriations process and avoiding a lapse in government funding.  We had a clear roadmap, a bipartisan, bicameral agreement negotiated by  the President's team and the Speaker of the House. It set top-line  funding targets for both defense and nondefense, and it laid out ground  rules to protect the process from partisan politics.   There has actually been reason for optimism. This week, we hope to  move to the House-passed bills for Defense, Energy and Water, Labor- HHS, and State and Foreign Ops. This would be our first procedural step  to getting the process moving for all of our priorities on both sides.   There is nothing controversial about this particular grouping of  bills. In fact, it was Speaker Pelosi who combined this grouping of  bills to move first. Furthermore, if any of the funding measures were  going to be handled earnestly across party lines, surely it  [[Page S5486]]  ought to be the bill funding the Department of Defense. Our fundamental  obligation is to provide for the common defense of our country, and all  Members feel our responsibility to keep the Nation safe.   Fortunately, the caps agreement specifically allows us to increase  defense funding to meet the growing threats our Nation faces. Yet here  is where we are: One week in, our Democratic colleagues tried to  stonewall the defense funding bill in committee and are now indicating  they may even filibuster a motion to begin considering the House-passed  defense funding bill later this week.   There is only one way to read this. Some of our Democratic colleagues  have determined they would rather stage a political fight with  President Trump than secure the resources that our uniformed commanders  urgently need to do their jobs. National security is taking a back seat  to partisan politics.   Let's be absolutely clear about the concerns and the priorities that  our Democratic friends are de-prioritizing. The defense spending  measure would bolster efforts to modernize our forces and build the  U.S. military of the future. Russia is actively modernizing its own  forces, just as we have seen the Putin regime step up its brazen steps  to exert its destabilizing influence well beyond its borders. In China,  the last decade has seen military spending nearly double. Our regional  partners continue to feel the tightening grip of the Chinese Communist  Party on trade and strategic activity throughout the Indo-Pacific  region while the technological ripples of Chinese cyber meddling are  felt right here at home.   In the face of surging great-power adversaries, simple upkeep is not  enough to keep America and our allies safe from aggression.  Comprehensive funding for research, development, and readiness programs  is what is needed. In Afghanistan, Syria, Somalia, Yemen, and beyond,  we continue to face sustained threats from terrorist organizations. In  the Middle East, we have seen how Iran's bid for regional hegemony and  its investment in terror, missiles, and cyber activities threaten the  United States, our allies and partners, key shipping lanes, and global  energy markets.   This bipartisan Defense bill would help us to adapt to meet these new  threats while ensuring our commanders can prosecute existing operations  without being consumed by the instability of short-term continuing  resolutions. Yet our Democratic colleagues would rather provoke a  partisan feud with the President. They would rather have a fight with  the President than stick to the agreement we all made. At least that is  where we are as of the moment.   I remain hopeful that my friends on the Democratic side will join us  in honoring the terms of the agreement that has been struck by the  President and the Speaker and help us to reboot a bipartisan funding  process. The readiness and modernization of America's military and the  safety of the American people should not play second fiddle to our  Democratic colleagues' political strategy.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on a completely different matter, for  anybody who has been reading the news over the past few days, it has  probably felt a little like Groundhog Day because over the last couple  of days, leading Democrats have tried to grab on to yet another poorly  sourced, thinly reported, unsubstantiated allegation against Justice  Brett Kavanaugh. There they go again. Call it a 1-year anniversary  reenactment with Senate Democrats reopening the sad and embarrassing  chapter they wrote last September.   The latest allegation was blasted out by a major newspaper despite  the apparent lack of any corroborating evidence whatsoever. The  reporting was so thin that the story ran not in the news section but on  the opinion page. In fact, they have already had to issue an enormous  correction. The writers conveniently failed to note that the supposed  victim herself declined to be interviewed, and several of her friends  say she has no memory of any such thing happening.   We all remember this pattern from the last time around: Shoot first,  and correct the facts later. Here is another familiar pattern: Just  like last September, little things like facts and evidence didn't stop  the Democrats from rushing to exploit this. Even as the media was  trying to backpedal, a number of the Democratic Presidential candidates  were hysterically calling for Justice Kavanaugh to be impeached on the  basis of this flimsy, uncorroborated story. They were calling for  Justice Kavanaugh to be impeached. That includes several of our own  Senate colleagues. Even after the massive correction, no one in that  group has backed off his ridiculous threat.   This laughable suggestion is already earning scorn throughout the  country and across the political spectrum. A majority of Senators and  the American people rightly rejected the politics of unsubstantiated  personal destruction just last year. It is just as transparent and  self-serving today, 1 year later.   Yet it would be a mistake to dismiss this as a bad case of sour  grapes. This is not just a leftwing obsession with one man; it is part  of a deliberate effort to attack judicial independence. Six of the  Democratic Presidential candidates--plus one who has now quit to run  for the Senate--have publicly flirted with packing the Supreme Court-- Court packing. Today's bold, new Democratic idea is a failed power grab  from back in the 1930s.   Just a few weeks ago, some Senate Democrats nakedly threatened the  Supreme Court Justices in writing. Our colleagues sent the Court an  outlandish brief, gravely intoning that the ``Supreme Court is not  well,'' they said. ``The Supreme Court is not well.'' Here was the  punch line: Either issue rulings we like or we will pack the Court.   This is not normal political behavior. These are the actions of a  political party whose agenda is so alien to the Constitution that it  feels threatened by fair and faithful judges.   This is what I would say: When the simple notion that judges should  be faithful to the Constitution looks like an attack on your agenda,  maybe it is your agenda that needs a makeover, not our independent  judiciary. When you are this willing to launch unhinged personal  attacks, you reveal a whole lot more about your own radicalism than  about the men and women you target.   This is my commitment and the commitment of all of my Republican  colleagues: As long as we remain in the Senate, we will fight to  preserve our fair and independent judiciary.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I move to proceed to Calendar No. 140,  H.R. 2740.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that  notwithstanding rule XXII, the postcloture time on the Rakolta  nomination expire at noon on Tuesday, September 17; further, that if  cloture is invoked on the Howery nomination, the postcloture time  expire at 3:30 p.m., and if either of the nominations are confirmed the  motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table and  the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action; finally,  that notwithstanding rule XXII, following disposition of the Howery  nomination, the Senate vote on the cloture motions for the Destro,  McIntosh, and Callanan nominations.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session to be in a period of morning business,  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, Dr. James Middleton has spent nearly  every day of his adult life caring for others. As a family physician in  Hart County, KY, he has dedicated himself to promoting the health and  well-being of his community. When he inherited the family farm and its  150-year-old history, James also made a pledge to conserve that land  for all those who might enjoy it.   Recently, my friend was recognized for the exceptional care he has  provided to his community with the Kentucky Leopold Conservation Award.  I would like to take a moment to congratulate him on this prestigious  recognition and to thank him for his years of conservation to protect  our environment and benefit Kentucky communities.   Our Commonwealth is blessed with a rich ecosystem and picturesque  landscapes. James' home, including the years-old tobacco farm, is near  two of our most remarkable natural treasures: the Mammoth Cave system  and the Green River. In an effort to help protect these magnificent  features, James chose to participate in the Tobacco Buyout, which was  created by legislation I introduced to free Kentucky farmers from a  Depression-era tobacco quota system. He set out on a new agricultural  path and focused on crops that would protect his region and one of the  most bio-diverse rivers in the world.   James designed a new style of land management specifically to benefit  the natural environment of his community and our country. He began  growing hay, raising pasture-fed cattle, and harvesting hardwoods. By  his estimation, he has planted more than a million trees, and the  majority of his farm is now forestland. As a result, his 600 acres of  vegetation have formed a natural barrier to protect the Green River  from runoff and other threats.   I would like to congratulate my friend for his remarkable leadership  in Hart County and his important conservation work that has benefited  Kentucky and our environment. He is certainly deserving of this  distinguished award, and I ask my Senate colleagues to join me in  honoring Dr. James Middleton for his passionate protection of our  heritage.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of S. Con. Res. 25, submitted  earlier today.    I further ask that the concurrent resolution be agreed  to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m., Tuesday,  September 17; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the  morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved  to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later  in the day, morning business be closed, and the Senate proceed to  executive session and resume consideration of the Rakolta nomination  under the previous order; finally, I ask unanimous consent that the  Senate recess following the cloture vote on the Howery nomination until  2:15 p.m. to allow for weekly conference meetings.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order, following the remarks of Senator Whitehouse.
