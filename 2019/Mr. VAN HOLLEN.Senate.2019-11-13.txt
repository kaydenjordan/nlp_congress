 Mr. President, I rise to object to the nomination of  Chad Wolf to serve as DHS Undersecretary of the Office of Strategy,  Policy, and Plans.   This nomination is yet another example of the Trump administration's  chaotic and inhumane approach to immigration issues. DHS is the third  largest Federal agency, and under the Trump administration, it has had  four directors in less than 3 years. It has been widely reported that  Republicans are rushing to confirm Mr. Wolf so that President Trump can  then appoint him Acting DHS Secretary. He will be the fifth DHS  Secretary and the third Acting. Rather than go through the normal  channels of selecting a nominee and allowing Senators to properly vet  and question the nominee, Republicans are going along with Trump's plan  to circumvent Federal law.   When asked directly by my colleague, Senator Rosen, about his role in  formulating the family separation policy, Mr. Wolf denied any direct  knowledge of that policy. Leaked emails later revealed that, as  Secretary Nielsen's chief of staff, he presented her with a memo with  options to deter migrants coming to the border. Separating parents from  their children was the second option on that list. The family  separation policy is repugnant to our country's values.   The timing of this nomination is especially concerning in light of  the Supreme Court oral arguments this week on DACA. The Trump  administration ended DACA and then rejected compromise legislation,  written by a bipartisan group of Senators, that would have given over  700,000 Dreamers who have grown up here stability and, ultimately, a  path to citizenship. When those Senators were negotiating an  immigration deal, in an unprecedented action, DHS Secretary Nielsen  sent a letter lambasting the negotiations and accused them of  undermining U.S. security.   The Trump administration has weaponized and poorly managed DHS, and I  cannot support this nominee.
