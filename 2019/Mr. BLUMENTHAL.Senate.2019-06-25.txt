 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order of the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Rules Committee be discharged from further consideration of S. 1247;  that the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration; that the bill  be considered read a third time and passed; and that the motion to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no  intervening action or debate.    Madam President, the reason for this request for  unanimous consent is very simply that this legislation is based on a  straightforward, commonly accepted idea: If you see something, say  something.   The Duty to Report Act, this measure, would require campaigns,  candidates, and family members to immediately report to the FBI and the  Federal Election Commission any offers of illegal foreign assistance.  It is simply a duty to report illegality. It codifies into law what is  already a moral duty, a patriotic duty, and a matter of basic common  sense.   It is already illegal to accept foreign assistance during a campaign.  It is already illegal to solicit foreign assistance during a campaign.  All this bill does is to require campaigns and individuals to report  those illegal foreign assistance offers or solicitations directly to  the FBI.   I never thought--and few would have guessed--that there is a need for  this kind of legislative mandate to do what is a patriotic and a moral  duty. With the 2020 election on the horizon, we need to do everything  we can to safeguard the integrity of our election.   The President has made remarks that are truly historically  astonishing. He made those remarks just recently, which highlighted his  own moral and patriotic depravity. He was asked whether he would accept  help in 2020 from foreign governments or foreign nationals, and he  simply said: ``I'd take it.''   That is very much reminiscent of what his son said when he was  offered assistance from Russian agents with dirt on Hillary Clinton. He  said, ``I love it.'' That kind of receptivity to illegality is not only  un-American, it ought to be explicitly illegal, and all of us in this  Chamber would reject it, I am sure. In fact, many of my colleagues on  the other side of the aisle were severely critical of President Trump's  remarks.   His remarks are also reminiscent of what his son-in-law, Jared  Kushner, said in a television interview--that he didn't know whether he  would contact the FBI in that same kind of situation, again, that  Donald junior encountered with offers of assistance from Russian  agents. He didn't know whether he would. It is a hypothetical.   Well, we really know what both the President and Jared Kushner, as  well as his son Donald junior think about this issue. According to the  Mueller report, when a Kremlin-linked individual, Dimitri Simes,  offered to provide Kushner with damaging information on Hillary  Clinton, he took the meeting. That is not the only example. When George  Papadopoulos, the Trump foreign policy campaign staffer, convicted on a  Federal charge of lying to the FBI, was told by a Maltese professor  that the Russians had dirt on Hillary Clinton in the form of thousands  of emails and were willing to provide them to the Trump campaign, what  did he do? Rather than go to the FBI, he eagerly alerted others on the  campaign.   Just last week, Hope Hicks, Trump's Communications Director for a  while, was interviewed by the House Judiciary Committee. She said that  she ``knew that the President's statement was troubling''--in her  words, ``knew that the President's statement was troubling'' and  ``understood the President to be serious'' when he made those remarks.   The President's remarks should alarm every American and everyone in  the law enforcement community. Our legislative efforts stem from this  basic principle. The American people--not Russia, not China, and no one  else--should decide who the leaders of our country are and the  direction our democracy should go.   Eighty percent of the American people across the political spectrum-- or more--support this legislation--Republicans, Democrats, and  Independents. All we are doing is asking that Mitch McConnell avoid  blocking this important legislation and allow a vote on the Senate  floor. This bill has 19 cosponsors in the Senate, including Senators  Whitehouse, Booker, Harris, Warren, Gillibrand, Klobuchar, Sanders,  Heinrich, Udall, Markey, Leahy, Murray, Casey, Smith, Cardin, Murphy,  Wyden, Merkley, and Hirono. It has been introduced in the House by  Congressman Eric Swalwell, and it now has 30 cosponsors there,  including the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Jerry Nadler.   I invite my Republican colleagues to support me in passing this  legislation. Republicans ought to stand up for the rule of law. They  ought to speak out  [[Page S4490]]  for our national security. They should refuse to tolerate these kinds  of words and behavior from an American Commander in Chief   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I am pleased and honored to be on the  floor with my colleague, the Senator from the great State of Rhode  Island. We share a border, and we share many common views, one of them  being a commitment to our environment. Senator Whitehouse has been a  historic champion of action against environmental degradation, as well  as climate change--global warming--which brings us to the floor today.   We are here to call attention and call for action in connection with  the effects of climate change on the waters off our State and the east  coast of our Nation.   There is a palpable, historic consequence to the warming of those  waters, among others, to drive fish populations northward in search of  cooler waters. The Northeast has already experienced some of the  highest levels of ocean warming and sea level rise in the United  States. They are only projected to exacerbate and exceed the present  levels.   There are storms our States--Rhode Island and Connecticut, and others  up and down the East Coast and all around the country--have  experienced. Those new superstorms are becoming the new normal in our  Nation, the most recent being the unprecedented hurricane and then  Superstorm Sandy.   Connecticut and Rhode Island are poised to lose land to sea level  rise. Scientists predict an almost 2-foot increase in the level of Long  Island Sound by 2050. My colleague Senator Whitehouse has been here  more times than I can count--I think more than 200 times--to call our  attention to the effects and the causes of this historic and  catastrophic trend of climate change in our Nation and on our planet.   What brings us here today is the very discrete and disastrous  consequence of those waters warming and changing fish populations that  are available to a group of our citizens and residents who have been an  economic mainstay and backbone for our States. They are the fishermen  who carry on a great profession and way of life, despite an outdated  and Byzantine quota system that has failed to adapt to those movements  of fish stock, like black sea bass, summer flounder, and scup from  their waters northward and then new fish populations from the Mid- Atlantic States to our waters.   These fish quotas fail to take account of changing fish populations.  The fish are smart biologically. They know when the waters are warming.  They seek cooler waters further north, but the quotas fail to keep  track. So the fish that are caught by our fishermen are not the same  kinds as they caught before, and they are not the same kinds that are  contemplated by the present quotas. They are catching fish they are  required to throw back even after they are dead. So this quota system  is failing at every level. It is failing environmentally if the goal is  to enhance and save fish populations; it is failing economically  because it is driving these fishermen out of their way of life; and it  is failing in public policy by failing to provide a rational and  informed way to set those quotas.   There is a solution because this whole system is governed by the  Magnuson-Stevens Act, which, by the way, is under the Commerce,  Science, and Transportation Committee, where I sit. There have been  proposals to reform and change it. The current Byzantine system of  quota setting is really a relic of a long-gone era, and it should be  reformed. Right now, immediately, the Secretary of Commerce can  intervene. The statute says the law governing the management of  fisheries requires that the Department of Commerce must ensure fishery  management plans adhere to several national standards, including the  use of the ``best scientific information available to decide catch  limits.'' It also says that any management plan ``shall not  discriminate'' between residents of different States and must allow  quotas that are ``fair and equitable.'' This system is failing those  standards.   I agree with fishermen of Connecticut and, I believe, of Rhode Island  who are saying this current system is nonsensical. It is outdated. It  is irrational, and it is worthless. It fails to give them fairness and  justice. It is time for action.   The Commerce Department should use its power--extraordinary as it  is--to impose emergency regulations and create a more equitable system.   As Bobby Guzzo, a fisherman from Stonington told Greenwire recently:         Things have changed--the fish have moved north, but the       quotas have not changed to  [[Page S4498]]       keep up with it. The science has to be better. They've got to       get more of a handle on it.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Greenwire article be  printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                               [June 4, 2019]          As Fish Move North, `Things are Getting Weird Out There'                            (By Rob Hotakainen)         Stonington, Conn.--Here in one of New England's oldest       fishing communities, there's a longing for the old days, long       before climate change and the federal government's quota       system got so complicated.        Convinced that Congress and NOAA will never allow them       larger quotas, many fishermen want to take their grievances       straight to the White House, hoping the commander in chief       will intervene and allow them to catch more fish.        At his fish wholesaling business, Mike Gambardella reached       for his iPhone to find one of his prized photographs: a       picture showing him wearing a white T-shirt bearing the       message, ``President Trump: Make Commercial Fishing Great       Again!''        Bobby Guzzo, Gambardella's friend, who's been fishing here       for more than 50 years, has the same sign on a bumper sticker       plastered on the back window of his pickup.        ``It used to be you'd go catch fish, come in and sell       them,'' Guzzo said. But now the system is needlessly       complicated, he said, with too much bookwork and a quota       system that's hard to decipher, adding, ``Now you've got to       be a lawyer.''        ``If you get ahold of the president, tell him to come see       us,'' Gambardella tells a visitor.        With a lack of fish, Gambardella said, it's gotten to the       point where it's even difficult to get trucks to come through       Stonington any more. He tells the story of a friend in the       business who killed himself.        ``We don't have enough fish--and it's not a Connecticut       thing; it's all of us,'' Gambardella said. ``And little by       little, we're all going out of business. The Lord gave us       that ocean, and he put fish in that ocean for us to eat. And       now we can't even get the fish.''        The struggling commercial fishermen in Stonington, a small       town that was first settled in 1649, are doing all they can       to get Trump's attention.        When the president showed up in nearby New London, Conn.,       to address the Coast Guard Academy class two years ago, they       got as close as they could, parking a boat that bore a simple       sign: ``Please help us.''        Gambardella even left his cellphone number on the Twitter       paqe of Linda McMahon, a former professional wrestling       executive who until recently served as the head of the Small       Business Administration.        ``We've been trying to get to the president,'' Gambardella       said. ``We like his style. . . . He sat down with the coal       miners. He sat down with the farmers. It's time to sit down       with the fishermen.''        Without intervention, the fishermen only see their plight       worsening as climate change forces more fish to move to       cooler waters and regulators scramble to adjust quotas.        ``Things have changed--the fish have moved north, but the       quotas have not changed to keep up with it,'' Guzzo said.       ``The science has to be better. They've got to get more of a       handle on it.''        That's easier said than done, under a byzantine regulatory       system that's often slow to adapt. It has also forced       fishermen to learn the new language of Washington, D.C.,       navigating a world of catch shares and stock assessments, of       fish mortality rates and maximum sustainable yields.        While they're upset with the quota system, many fishenmen       and politicians are also angry that fishermen must throw away       the ``bycatch,'' the fish they bring in by accident but are       not licensed to catch.        Gambardella said he's particularly eager to tell the       president that Americans are eating too much ``chemical       shit,'' consuming imported seafood while millions of pounds       of healthy wild seafood gets discarded every year.        ``He's going to be shocked to know that we import over 90%       of our seafood, and we have fish in our backyard here that       we're throwing overboard,'' Gambardella said. ``I don't       understand--we're throwing good wild seafood overboard that       we could sell or have the kids eat healthy food. It's sad,       really, really sad. . . . The whole thing is so screwed up.''        Lawmakers from coastal states have long argued the case on       Capitol Hill, with no luck in winning any changes.        At a hearing last fall, Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal       (D) said ``there is something profoundly unfair and       intolerable'' with a management system that forces fishermen       to discard so much seafood while many people across the world       go hungry.        ``They are compelled to throw back perfectly good fish that       they catch as a result of quotas that are based on totally       obsolete, out-of-touch limits,'' he said. ``And meanwhile,       fishermen from Southern states come into their waters and       catch their fish,'' he said of fishermen in more northern       points.        In a speech on the Senate floor last year, Sen. Sheldon       Whitehouse (D-R.I.) said fishenmen in his state are now       routinely sharing anecdotes of catching increasing numbers of       tropical fish early in the summer season.        ``As fishermen in Rhode Island have told me, `Things are       getting weird out there,' '' Whitehouse said. ``As new fish       move in and traditional fish move out, fishermen are left       with more questions than answers.''        In Washington, members of Congress are trying to figure out       how to best respond.        ``Climate change is throwing some real curveballs at       fisheries management,'' said Rep. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.),       chairman of the House Natural Resources Subcommittee on       Water, Oceans and Wildlife, adding that he intended to       schedule ``some roundtables with folks who are living through       this.''        The issue is sure to come up when Congress examines the       Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, the       nation's premier fisheries law, first passed in 1976. The law       created eight regional fishery management councils to develop       fishery management plans, working with NOAA on ``a       transparent and robust process of science, management,       innovation and collaboration with the fishing industry.''        But there's disagreement over who's best equipped to change       the rules: regional boards, which are dominated by state       interests, or Congress, which has its own share of political       pressures.        ``You need some strong federal guidance,'' said Dave Monti,       a charter boat captain and fishing guide who operates in       Wickford Harbor in North Kingstown, R.I., and the vice       president of the Rhode Island Saltwater Anglers Association.        ``Local needs circumvent the needs of the people of the       United States of America. I'm a firm believer that those fish       in the water don't belong to me and they don't belong to       Rhode Island. Someone living in Minnesota or Kentucky owns       these fish as much as anyone else does.''        Chris Batsavage, who represents North Carolina on the       Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission and the Mid-      Atlantic Fishery Management Council, said regional boards       have struggled to find the right allocations for years. But       he said they're capable of doing the job.        ``It's still a work in progress--no one has found a silver-      bullet solution,'' Batsavage said. ``But I think we're going       to get to go where we need to go. Allocations are always one       of the most contentious things a management agency has to       deal with.''        Huffman said regional councils remain ``part of the       critical framework'' and that he's not interested in taking       their power away. He said Congress' role will be to set the       policy and leave implementation to regional fisheries       officials.        ``I don't want to undermine the councils,'' Huffman said.       ``And what I don't want to do is a whole bunch of       micromanaging.''        But while many fishermen and politicians complain about       U.S. fishing rules, NOAA boasts that the nation has become an       international leader in fisheries management.        In 2017, Chris Oliver, who heads NOAA Fisheries, told a       congressional panel that the law clearly had worked and that       the United States had ``effectively ended overfishing.''        NOAA Fisheries tracks 474 stocks or stock complexes in 46       fishery management plans. Of those, 91% had not exceeded       their annual catch limits, known as ACLs, according to a       report NOAA sent to Congress in 2017.        Under federal law, fisheries managers must specify their       goals and use ``measurable criteria,'' also known as       reference points, to get there. That requires a stock       assessment, which is a scientific analysis of the abundance       of fish stock and a measure of ``the degree of fishing       intensity.''        Once an assessment is done, fisheries managers must       determine if a stock is overfished, measuring the ``maximum       sustainable yield.'' That's the largest long-term average       catch that can be taken from a stock.        Fisheries managers then have different ways to reduce       fishing, including the use of ``catch limits'' or ``catch       shares.'' Catch limits measure the amount of fish that can be       caught, while catch shares are an optional tool used to       allocate shares to individual fishermen or groups.                     keeping `an eye on the big picture'         As they adjust quotas, NOAA officials walk a fine line in       making sure fishermen follow the law while cooperating with       regional officials to make any changes.        The Trump administration has already shown deference for       listening to local fishermen, overriding regional decisions       to shorten the season for the red snapper in Gulf Coast       states and to limit catches of summer flounder for New Jersey       fishermen.        ``It's our job in that setting to also keep an eye on the       big picture, and not just all of the regional and small-scale       interests,'' said Mike Fogarty, senior scientist at NOAA's       Northeast Fisheries Science Center in Massachusetts.        Fogarty, who has studied climate issues since the early       1990s, said one idea under consideration is to no longer set       regulations for individual fish species but to instead focus       on their role in an ecosystem, such as whether they're part       of a prey or a predator group.        ``You could set quotas for the predator groups, prey groups       and bottom-feeder groups,'' he said. ``Individual species       could change over time, but their roles would remain intact.       That could reduce tension between states.''        While many fishermen want NOAA to be more flexible,       environmental groups want regulators to adhere to the federal       law and to adjust fishing quotas as soon as populations       change. A study published in the ICES Journal of Marine       Science in April  [[Page S4499]]       showed that adapting fishing intensity to the health of fish       populations would make fisheries more climate-resilient. The       study suggested automatically reducing the catch percentage       when managers detect decreases in biomass, allowing more       immediate responses to changing conditions.        ``If a catch limit is too high and too many fish are taken       out of the ocean, the ecosystem suffers,'' said Jake Kritzer,       senior director with the Environmental Defense Fund's oceans       program and lead author of the study. ``If a limit is too       low, with more fish than can be caught sustainably left in       the water, fishermen suffer.''   So it is past time for an update for a system that takes advantage of  science and research. We owe it to our fishing industry, but we owe it  to ourselves as members of this ecosystem, as policy centers, and as  legislators to keep faith with the fishermen of Rhode Island and  Connecticut. Really, it is with the fishermen of America. As fish  stocks shift north, fishermen from other States are going to encounter  the same challenges. They will be sailing north to seek fish stocks off  Connecticut's coast. Their quotas around their States are as outmoded  and outdated as ours. The longer trips they will undertake will mean  more carbon pollution, which will lead to more atmospheric carbon  dioxide, climate shifts, and acidification of the ocean.   There is some good news amidst all of this gloom and doom in that we  are already mustering the awareness and the resolve to take action.  That is why we are here today. It is not only to wake up but to keep up  this kind of fight.   I thank my colleague, the Senator from Rhode Island, for leading this  great effort.    Mr. President, after that eloquence, I hesitate to  even add anything, but the urgency of his plea and the need to hear the  voices of these fishermen brings to mind this photograph, which was  taken from the Greenwire article. In fact, it is of a boat in  Stonington Harbor during a visit by President Trump in 2017 to the  Coast Guard Academy in New London. The banner on this boat reads:  ``Please help us.''   We need help for the fishermen of our Nation, whether they be in  Louisiana or Rhode Island or Connecticut, because of this completely  obsolete, obscenely outdated system that is depriving them of decent  livelihoods, depriving our Nation of sufficient fish nutrition, and  depriving our Nation and our world of an end to climate change.   I would ask my colleague from Rhode Island very briefly, does he  believe that the administration is heeding that message, not only  behalf of the fishermen of Stonington in Connecticut--please help us-- but on behalf of the planet to please help us stop global warming and  climate change? Is this administration acting sufficiently?    Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Rhode Island  and I look forward to coming back to the floor with him and expanding  on this colloquy in the future. I will be a proud partner of his in  advocating for the measures, and I join him in praising our fishing  community because they have stood strong in the face of adversity.
