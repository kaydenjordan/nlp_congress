 Mr. Speaker, at least Robin Hood stole from the rich and  gave to the poor, but my Republican colleagues, with this Republican  tax bill, are stealing from the poor and the middle class and giving to  the rich. It is absolutely disgraceful. The tax bill boosts the rich  and burdens the middle class.   I can say I have been here a long time, and this is one of the worst  bills I have ever seen in all my years in Congress.   What happened to the Republican Party talking about fiscal  responsibility? This blows a $1 trillion hole in the Federal deficit  and puts the burden on our children and grandchildren.   So let's not look at this tax scam. People should be getting together  on both sides of the aisle. Tear up this one-sided bill, and let's put  our heads together and come up with something good.   It was done during the Ronald Reagan years in a bipartisan way. Why  can it not be done that way now?   My particular State of New York, my home State of New York, gets  really attacked by this. High cost-of-living States get really  attacked.   It is not right to play political games. You take a look at this, and  you notice that blue States get attacked with this terrible bill.   Tear it up. Let's work together and come up with something good.                            ____________________
