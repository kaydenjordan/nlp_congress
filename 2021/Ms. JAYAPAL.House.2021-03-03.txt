 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to strongly support the George  Floyd Justice in Policing Act and to say Black Lives Matter.   I rise for Charleena Lyles, Che Taylor, Manuel Ellis, Tommy Le, Tony  McDade, George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Eric Garner, Atatiana Jefferson,  Ezell Ford, Tanisha Anderson, Tamir Rice, Walter Scott, Philando  Castile, Gabriella Nevarez, Botham Jean.   I rise for all of our Black siblings who have been killed by law  enforcement, because there are far too many to say all of their names.   I rise for the Black Lives Matter protestors who were met with  aggression, tear gas, and force while White domestic terrorists were  met with none of these things.   I rise to answer the call of millions of people led by Black voices  who have taken to the streets demanding transformative change.   I rise because that change begins today by once again passing the  George Floyd Justice in Policing Act.                                time  1845
