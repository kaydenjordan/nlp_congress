 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from  Florida for yielding.   More than 60 million lives have been lost since the treacherous,  devastating, and dishonest Roe v. Wade decision by seven misguided  Justices nearly 50 years ago--60 million.   The big lie is that there is a constitutional right to abortion, a  constitutional right to take the life of a precious, innocent child in  the womb. How have we let this stand for nearly 50 years? How can there  not be one lone honest, compassionate voice on the other side, hearing  and responding to the unborn cries from the womb?   What kind of a compromise must you make in your soul when there is no  longer any honest denial of the science of life? What kind of a  compromise must you make to vote for political expediency to satisfy  the loudest, most aggressive special interest groups and vote to remove  any restrictions on abortion?   How did we get to where one party is 100 percent unanimous in  supporting unlimited, taxpayer-funded abortion at any time for any  reason?    How did those who previously claimed the pro-life label and support  for the Hyde provision at a minimum--back when we didn't have the  scientific, visual proof of life--how do they now enthusiastically  defend unrestricted abortion?   Yet, we find ourselves today on the precipice of the Supreme Court  having the opportunity to finally, at long last, reverse this decision.  May these Justices have courage. May they do what is right. May they do  what is moral. May they do what is lawful. May they preserve and  protect life. May they finally overturn Roe v. Wade.
