 Mr. Speaker, the American Humane Association, the  country's first national humane organization, is saving, sheltering,  feeding, and protecting more than 1 billion animals around the world  each year.   In honor of noted conservationist Wolfgang Kiessling, the American  Humane Association created the Wolfgang Kiessling International Prize  for Species Conservation, recognizing and supporting the work of those  who achieve significant positive change in the field of conservation  practice, theory, and research.   After considering the achievements of extraordinary candidates from  16 countries, Dr. Paul Rodriguez, chairman of the International Union  of the Conservation of Nature Species Survival Commission, was selected  as the inaugural honoree of the Wolfgang Kiessling International Prize  for Species Conservation.   I recognize and commend the efforts of the American Humane  Association, Wolfgang Kiessling, and the 2022 award winner, Dr. Jon  Paul Rodriguez, for their outstanding work on behalf of the endangered  animals which enrich our world.                            ____________________
