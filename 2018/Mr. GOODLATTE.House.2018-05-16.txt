 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 891, I call  up the bill (H.R. 5698) to amend title 18, United States Code, to  punish criminal offenses targeting law enforcement officers, and for  other purposes, and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the question  of adopting the amendment to H.R. 5698 may be subject to postponement  as though under clause 8 of rule XX.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material to H.R. 5698.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   On October 15, 1991, the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial  was dedicated to honor Federal, State, and local law enforcement  officers who have made the ultimate sacrifice for the safety and  protection of our Nation and its people.   The memorial features two curving, 304-foot-long, blue-gray marble  walls. Carved on these walls are the names of more than 21,000 officers  who have been killed in the line of duty throughout U.S. history,  dating back to the first known death in 1791.   Each spring, law enforcement officers from around the country gather  in Washington, D.C., for Peace Officers Memorial Day. For a week, these  men and women attend events to celebrate and honor those law  enforcement officers who have made the ultimate sacrifice. Each year,  there is a memorial service in which the names of fallen officers are  added to the long, curving marble walls of the memorial. Unfortunately,  the list of names keeps growing and shows no signs of slowing down.   That is why today I am pleased we are considering the Protect and  Serve Act. This bill is designed to ensure those who seek to harm  police officers face swift and certain justice.   In recent years, the brave and dedicated men and women in blue who  serve our communities are facing increased levels of hostility and  violence. The increasing levels of hostility towards the law  enforcement community have given rise to an increase in ambush-style  attacks on police officers.   In 2016 alone, 64 police officers were shot and killed in the line of  duty, 21 of whom were killed in ambush-style attacks. According to CNN,  in the first 17 weeks of this year, 21 law enforcement officers across  the U.S. have been shot and killed in the line of duty. That averages  out to more than one death every week.   Only a few weeks ago, on April 19, 2018, two sheriff's deputies were  gunned down and killed in a suspected ambush while they were eating at  a restaurant in Gainesville, Florida.   To address this threat to the brave police, who put their lives on  the line each day across our country, the Protect and Serve Act allows  for Federal prosecution of criminals who knowingly assault law  enforcement officers and cause serious bodily harm or attempt to do so.  This bill applies to both Federal law enforcement officers and State  and local officers where there is a nexus to interstate commerce.   Importantly, Mr. Speaker, this legislation recognizes that most often  these crimes are wholly within the jurisdiction of a State to  prosecute. Therefore, in addition to other requirements in the bill to  ensure a Federal connection, H.R. 5698 states specifically that  prosecution under this new statute may only be pursued if the Attorney  General certifies that, one, the State does not have jurisdiction; two,  the State has requested that the Federal Government assume  jurisdiction; three, the verdict or sentence obtained pursuant to State  charges left demonstrably unvindicated the Federal interest in  protecting the public safety; or, four, a prosecution by the United  States is in the public interest and necessary to secure substantial  justice.   This is a critical part of the bill. It will ensure that the Federal  power is  [[Page H4010]]  reserved for particularly egregious cases.   At the dedication of the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial,  President George H. W. Bush aptly stated: ``Carved on these walls is  the story of America, of a continuing quest to preserve both democracy  and decency, and to protect a national treasure that we call the  American Dream.''   Today, we continue to recognize this special role police officers  play in our society. The Protect and Serve Act sends a uniform message  that our country will not tolerate attacks on police which purposefully  attempt to undermine the State, sow chaos in our communities, and wreck  the lives of many of our finest citizens and their families.   I urge my colleagues to send a uniform message today by addressing  the grave crisis threatening both our communities and the brave men and  women in blue who put their lives on the line each day.   I would like to thank my Judiciary Committee colleagues, especially  career law enforcement officers Sheriff Rutherford and Chief Demings,  for sponsoring this bill. In addition, I want to thank Congressman Buck  for his years of tireless work to ensure that those who target law  enforcement officers are punished.   Finally, I want to recognize the police organizations who have worked  with us so diligently on this and many other bills, including the  Fraternal Order of Police, the National Association of Police  Organizations, the Major County Sheriffs of America, the National  Sheriffs' Association, the Federal Law Enforcement Officers  Association, and the Sergeants Benevolent Association, among many  others. I thank them. We all salute them for their steadfast commitment  and dedicated service.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Rutherford), who is the chief sponsor of the legislation  and a member of the Judiciary Committee.    Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to yield such time as he  may consume to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Scalise), a gentleman  who can speak well of the role that law enforcement officers play in  saving lives. He is the chief majority whip of the House of  Representatives.    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record letters from the  National Fraternal Order of Police dated May 9, 2018; the National  Association of Police Organizations, Inc., dated May 16, 2018; the  Sergeants Benevolent Association, dated May 8, 2018; and the National  Sheriffs' Association, dated May 7, 2018, all endorsing this  legislation.                             National Fraternal Order of Police,                                         Washington, DC, 9 May 2018.      Hon. Paul D. Ryan,      Speaker of the House, House of Representatives, Washington,           DC.      Hon. Kevin O. McCarthy,      Majority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy P. Pelosi,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Steny H. Hoyer,      Minority Whip, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Speaker and Representatives McCarthy, Pelosi and       Hoyer: I am writing on behalf of the members of the Fraternal       Order of Police to advise you of our strong support for H.R.       5698, the ``Protect and Serve Act,'' which was favorably       reported by the House Committee on the Judiciary earlier       today and to urge that it be considered next week during       National Police Week.        The legislation, introduced by Representative John H.       Rutherford (R-FL), a former sheriff, and Val V. Demings (D-      FL), a former police chief, would impose Federal penalties on       individuals who deliberately target local, State or Federal       law enforcement officers with violence. This year 87 officers       have been shot in the line of duty and 28 of them were       killed. Far too many of these murdered officers were slain in       ambush as was the case with Sergeant Noel Ramirez and Deputy       Sheriff Taylor Lindsey of the Gilchrist County Sheriff's       Department in Florida. These two officers were having lunch       together when they were assassinated by a man who fired       through the restaurant's window to kill them before turning       the weapon on himself. Similarly, the violent transnational       criminal organization MS-13 called for the assassinations of       police officers in New York so the gang could ``take back the       streets''--a move clearly intended to intimidate the men and       women in uniform.        Ambush attacks like this are increasing at an alarming       rate. A report issued by the Federal Bureau of Investigation       on the motivations of cop-killers revealed that many of these       attacks are motivated by a hatred or animus toward law       enforcement officers. This same report stated that these       killers felt that the communities and elected officials no       longer supported their officers and they would not face       serious penalties for their actions. We must change this       perspective and we believe the ``Protect and Serve Act'' will       do just that.        We appreciate, as always, your leadership and your support       for law enforcement officers and the families of those who       fell in the line of duty. As our nation comes together to       honor these heroes during National Police Week, I hope the       House will consider taking this legislation up on the floor       and passing it.        On behalf of the more than 335,000 members of the Fraternal       Order of Police, thank you for considering our view on this       important legislation. If I can provide any additional       support for this bill or on any other matter, please do not       hesitate to contact me or my Senior Advisor, Jim Pasco, in my       Washington, D.C. office.            Sincerely,                                                  Chuck Canterbury,      National President.                                   ____                                             National Association of                                      Police Organizations, Inc.,                                 Alexandria, Virginia, May 16, 2018.      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Members of Congress: On behalf of the National       Association of Police Organizations (NAPO), I am writing to       you to advise you of our strong support for H.R. 5698, the       Protect and Serve Act.        NAPO is a coalition of police units and associations from       across the United States that serves to advance the interests       of America's law enforcement through legislative and legal       advocacy, political action, and education. Founded in 1978,       NAPO now represents more than 1,000 police units and       associations, 241,000 sworn law enforcement officers, and       more than 100,000 citizens who share a common dedication to       fair and effective crime control and law enforcement.        The Protect and Serve Act of 2018 provides for new criminal       provisions for deliberate, targeted attacks on officers. This       bill is critical, as there is a serious and growing trend of       armed attacks on law enforcement officers. According to a       December 2017 report from the Office of Community Oriented       Policing Services (COPS) and the National Law Enforcement       Officers Memorial Fund, 2016 saw a significant increase in       ambush attacks on unsuspecting officers, with 21 shot and       killed. 61% of those officers were not answering a call for       service or engaged in enforcement action or performing       official duties--they were targeted and killed just for the       uniform they wore. 12 officers were murdered sitting in their       patrol cars.        NAPO has long been fighting to establish stricter penalties       for those who harm or target for harm law enforcement       officers. Any persons contemplating harming an officer must       know that they will face serious punishments. NAPO strongly       believes that increased penalties make important differences       in the attitudes of criminals toward public safety officers,       and ensure protection for the community.        On May 13th, 360 American law enforcement heroes, who gave       their lives in the line of duty, were honored at the 30th       Annual Candlelight Vigil. In memory of those officers and in       the hope of ensuring there are fewer names added to the       memorial walls next year, we ask that you join us in       supporting H.R. 5698, the Protect and Serve Act.            Sincerely,                                     William J. Johnson, Esq., CAE,      Executive Director.                                   ____           Sergeants Benevolent Association, Police Department, City             of New York,                                         New York, NY, May 8, 2018.      Hon. Robert Goodlatte,      Chairman, House Committee on the Judiciary,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Jerrold Nadler,      Ranking Member, House Committee on the Judiciary,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman and Representative Nadler: I am writing       on behalf of the more  [[Page H4013]]       than 13,000 members of the Sergeants Benevolent Association       of the New York City Police Department (SBA) to thank you for       scheduling the markup of the ``Protect and Serve Act.'' The       SBA strongly supports this important officer safety       legislation and we respectfully request that the Committee       advance it to the full House of Representatives as       expeditiously as possible.        Unfortunately for law enforcement officers today, it is a       simple fact that they must maintain constant vigilance to the       threats posed by those who seek to do them harm for nothing       more than the badge and uniform they wear. It is a vigilance       borne out of what we have seen in recent years, as far too       many officers have made the ultimate sacrifice at the hands       of cowardly criminals who have intentionally targeted law       enforcement officers for violence. Last month's ambush attack       in Gilchrist, Florida that claimed the lives of Sgt. Noel       Ramirez and Deputy Taylor Lindsey is just the latest example       of the rise in violence carried out on federal, state, and       local law enforcement. We have seen similar attacks in Baton       Rouge and Dallas in 2016, as well as the assassination of our       own NYPD Officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu in December       2014. According to a recent joint study conducted by the COPS       Program and the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial       Fund, between 2010-2016 there were 81 officers killed in       ambush-style attacks--targeted specifically because they were       uniformed police or deputies. Of this number, 25 of the       officers attacked were responding to a call for service at       the time of the ambush. Because these types of attacks       threaten to unravel the basic social fabric of our Nation--      the rule of law--they must be met with the harshest of       penalties.        It is for these reasons and many others that our       organization is proud to support the ``Protect and Serve       Act,'' which will help to address the rise in attacks on, and       increase the protection of, state and local law enforcement.       Specifically, the bill aims to combat targeted violence       against law enforcement officers by creating a new federal       crime for perpetrating, or attempting to perpetrate,       deliberate acts of violence against federal, state, and local       law enforcement officers. It would also permit the U.S.       Department of Justice (DOJ) to assume jurisdiction and       prosecute these heinous attacks on law enforcement in those       instances where the state has requested that DOJ assume       jurisdiction, or where federal prosecution is in the public       interest in order to secure justice. Penalties under the act       would range from up to 10 years in federal prison to a life       sentence if death results from the offense, or the offense       involved kidnapping, attempted kidnapping, or an attempt to       kill.        On behalf of the membership of the Sergeants Benevolent       Association, thank you again for your consideration of this       important legislation. Please do not hesitate to contact me,       or our Washington Representatives, if we can be of any       further assistance.            Sincerely,                                                        Ed Mullins,      President.                                   ____                                   National Sheriffs' Association,                                        Alexandria, VA, May 7, 2018.      Congressman John Rutherford,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Rutherford: On behalf of the National       Sheriffs' Association (NSA) and the more than 3,000 elected       sheriffs nationwide, we write to endorse The Protect and       Serve Act of 2018. We believe that your proposal of this bill       is necessary and vitally important to the safety and       protection of our country's federal, state, and local law       enforcement.        Each day deputies and officers put their lives on the line       to protect and serve their communities. They are the       mainstays of our communities, and should be treated with       respect. Egregious acts such as targeting, injuring, or       killing a law enforcement officer should be punishable to the       highest degree according to the severity of the crime.        The National Sheriffs' Association strongly supports The       Protect and Serve Act of 2018 as it works to punish       individuals who commit crimes targeting law enforcement       officers. We believe this bill is an essential to further       defend the safety of our nation's law enforcement officers.            Sincerely,                                              Jonathan F. Thompson,                                        Executive Director and CEO.     Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I just want to make it very clear how important this legislation is  for protecting law enforcement officers because it sends a message that  we are going to handle these cases in a new way.   Some have criticized this bill, claiming that it is a hate crime.  While I share those individuals' concerns about Federal hate crime  statutes, I am pleased to tell the Members of this Congress that this  bill before us did not create a new Federal hate crime. That is because  the legislation does not use the language from the hate crime statute  that requires the government prove the defendant acted ``because of the  actual or perceived'' status of the victim.   What this bill does is penalize knowingly attacking a law enforcement  officer. Given the increase in ambush-style attacks on law enforcement,  which was detailed earlier, this bill represents a solution to a  growing problem: the killing of police officers. It is narrowly  tailored to accomplish that goal.   Therefore, I want to assure those Members who may be concerned about  its intent that it is definitely not changing our Federal hate crime  statutes.   This legislation this week, National Police Week, sends an important  signal not just to our Nation's law enforcement officers, 900,000  strong, but far beyond that, to all Americans, that we are placing a  very, very high priority on saving the lives of men and women who put  their lives on the line to protect us, to protect our freedoms, to  protect our opportunities, to protect our families, to protect our  communities, and making sure that people who ambush police officers and  take police officers' lives are held fully accountable, which is what  this bill does. It is a good bill. It is an important bill. I urge my  colleagues to support it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   This amendment makes two small, but important changes to the  underlying legislation.   It first clarifies the language of the bill to assure those who are  prosecuted are acting with some level of intent in injuring a police  officer. It does this by changing the language from ``knowingly causing  serious bodily injury to a law enforcement officer'' to ``knowingly  assaults a law enforcement officer causing serious bodily harm.'' This  change will avoid covering situations where someone unintentionally  harms a police officer.   The amendment also amends the definition of law enforcement officer  to ensure it covers all law enforcement officers who are putting  themselves in harm's way each day, including corrections officers.   Mr. Speaker, this amendment is important because it ensures that, in  practice, this statute can be used more efficiently to protect law  enforcement officers. It also ensures that nobody who wears a badge  will be unintentionally excluded from the bill's protections.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, that is good news, and I yield back the  balance of my time    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
