 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Texas for  his leadership on this initiative and on this bill.   It is sad that we find ourselves today having to force the  administration to enforce the security of the United States border,  that we have to force the Department of Homeland Security to secure the  border.   What this bill will do is codify into law the effective policies  under the previous administration that left this President with a  secure border. What did this President have to do to maintain a secure  border? He did nothing but keep the policies in place that he  inherited.   We are currently averaging some 10,000 illegals per day invading the  country. What is the response from the Democrats on the other side in  this administration? We can do better.   We are having some 300,000 illegals invade the country on a monthly  basis. Think of the three largest football stadiums in the country,  that equivalency invading our border every day, invading our country.   Yet, we cannot get one Democrat vote, I predict, to vote to secure  our border, to protect our country's national security, our health  security, our economic security.                                time  1700    This bill will build the wall. It will hire more border agents. It  will enhance technology to assist them. It will require transparency  and accountability from this derelict Department of Homeland Security.  It will enhance compensation for our Border Patrol. It will support  local law enforcement in their efforts to help secure the border.   The fact is, no country in the history of the world has been more  welcoming to migrants from all over the world, from all races, all  nationalities, all ethnicities, than the United States of America. We  support legal, lawful immigration, and that is why this country permits  a million legal migrants every year. But we must stand united against  illegal immigration, and this bill does just that.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Cammack for  hosting this Special Order tonight and honoring the brave men and women  who put their lives in harm's way to keep our communities safe.   Every day, some 800,000 law enforcement officers put on the badge and  leave their families behind not knowing what the day will hold.   They serve silently on the front lines, faithfully upholding the law  and fighting to reduce crime and to save lives.   Our party truly backs the blue. It stands proudly with these valiant  men and women, including those serving this Capitol complex even  tonight.   Sadly, however, those on the other side want to defund the police and  restrict their ability to enforce the law, but we want them to have all  the support and resources they need most to effectively execute their  duties.   In fact, I have a former State trooper on my own staff, and I am  grateful for his service to our Commonwealth.   Unfortunately, these last few years have seen mass retirements and  decreasing morale in police departments, so I stand with my colleagues  to express deep gratitude to all law enforcement officers who stand in  the gap to serve and protect.   Thanks to them, families in our communities can sleep better knowing  you stand watching, ready to respond when needed. I thank them on  behalf of a grateful Nation.
