 I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Educational  Opportunity and Success Act, a bill to strengthen the Federal TRIO  Programs and improve their administration. Across the Nation, TRIO  helps students from disadvantaged backgrounds gain access to a college  education and provide many of the supports that they need to prepare  for, succeed in, and graduate from higher education programs. I would  very much like to thank Senator Baldwin, Senator Capito, and Senator  Tester for joining me as original cosponsors.   In the State of Maine, TRIO Programs serve students from all over our  State and are focused on increasing educational opportunities for first  generation, low-income, and disabled students. From 2007 to 2017, TRIO  has expanded from 20 programs to 28 in our State and has expanded from  serving 6,690 students to nearly 7,500 students in our State. Over the  course of my Senate service, I have been so inspired by the stories of  countless TRIO students with whom I have talked. They have described to  me firsthand the positive impact of these programs on their academic  success and on their futures.   For example, Autumn Mallet from Bangor, ME, graduated from Bangor  High School in 2015, unsure about whether she even wanted to pursue  higher education. Neither she nor her parents had any experience with  higher education. That is very typical of what I found in talking with  students who are enrolled in the TRIO Programs. Autumn decided to  enroll at Eastern Maine Community College, where she connected with  TRIO's Student Support Services Program. Autumn called TRIO  ``irreplaceable'' and her ``full support system.'' The academic  advisers were her ``go-to people'' when it came to signing up for  classes, finding tutors, navigating financial aid, and advocating for  herself.   Autumn graduated in May 2018 with an associate's degree in liberal  studies and secondary education, and she has gone on to the University  of Maine where she is currently earning her bachelor's degree. At the  University, she also taps into the resources of the Student Support  Services Program. And, very movingly, Autumn is giving back to TRIO.  She is a TRIO peer mentor at Eastern Maine Community College, helping  students, just like herself, successfully navigate higher education and  giving them the tools and the confidence to succeed. For Autumn, TRIO  has made all the difference as she has pursued her own goals and helped  other students achieve theirs.   Congress created the TRIO Programs because it recognized that low- income, first-generation students often face significant financial and  societal obstacles to accessing and achieving success in higher  education. The Educational Opportunity and Success Act would better  serve those students by implementing key reforms.   First, and most important, our bipartisan bill would reauthorize the  TRIO Programs for an additional 5 years.   Second, our bill would instruct the Department of Education to  publish guidance at least 90 days before each grant competition, giving  colleges and universities adequate opportunity to prepare the  successful applications to secure the funding needed to offer the TRIO  Programs.   Third, our bill would remove the administrative burdens in the  application process for these schools, making sure that Federal funds  get out the door more efficiently and to the programs and the students  they are meant to serve. Under the current administrative process, many  colleges and universities experience delays while the Department  reviews administrative errors before making all of the grant awards.  This reform would help to expedite the grant process.   Fourth, our legislation would institute commonsense guidelines at the  Department of Education for TRIO grant applications.   Let me tell you what happened in 2017. In that year, the Department  initially rejected dozens of applications for the Upward Bound Program  based on arbitrary, nonsubstantive formatting criteria, such as line  spacing and font size irregularities. This was bureaucracy at its  worst. One of those applications was from the University of Maine at  Presque Isle, which had been a longtime recipient of funding to provide  TRIO Programs. Here is what happened with the University of Maine at  Presque Isle. It submitted a 65-page application. In that application,  the University of Maine of Presque Isle used 1\1/2\-line spacing  instead of double spacing in the text appearing in the graphics on two  of its application's 65 pages.   I am not making this up. For that reason alone, because the spacing  was 1\1/2\ lines rather than 2 on just 2 of the graphs in a 65-page  application, the Department of Education rejected it--based on that  alone.   The Department's bureaucratic decision would have denied 960  disadvantaged Maine high school students the chance to fulfill their  academic potential. Imagine that--that 960 students, who needed the  support of the TRIO Program to be successful, would not have been  served because of a tiny formatting error on 2 pages of a 65-page  application. It was nothing substantive, just a formatting error.   After months of advocacy, I was able to work with the Department of  Education and my Appropriations colleagues to reverse this ill- conceived decision, and I am very happy to report that the University  of Maine of Presque Isle is today serving those students.   Our bill would prevent the Department of Education from rejecting  applications simply on the basis of the formatting criteria that it  suggests and instead would establish a straightforward process of  correction for applications with minor formatting or budgeting errors.  This is a commonsense reform that will prevent unnecessary bureaucratic  obstacles in the future--obstacles that have a real impact on the lives  of the students who are intended to benefit from the TRIO Programs.   Fifth, our bill would make it simpler for students who receive free  and reduced-priced lunches and Pell grants to qualify for the TRIO  Programs. Proving income eligibility can be a barrier to services, and  this bill would make it easier to identify potential participants for  the TRIO Programs.   The bill would also update TRIO eligibility criteria to reflect the  most recent requirements for Federal financial aid. This would ensure  that TRIO administrators would not have to consult multiple data  sources and can instead use a student's most recent financial aid  information to determine eligibility for the TRIO Programs rather than  having them go through an additional process.   Finally, the bill would require the Department of Education to  conduct additional virtual training sessions, better ensuring that all  areas of the country--especially our small, rural communities--have the  ability to know about and access the TRIO Programs.   As the longtime cochair of the Congressional TRIO Caucus, I have long  supported the TRIO Programs. I have worked to ensure that they are  reaching the students who most need them. So many students in Maine and  across the country have truly had their lives changed by these  wonderful programs, such as Upward Bound. They have been introduced to  the world of higher education. They have been given the support they  need to succeed. In my State, where so many families simply do not have  experience with higher education, the TRIO Programs have made all the  difference for their sons and daughters.
