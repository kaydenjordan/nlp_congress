 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I call  up House Resolution 305 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 305         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to take from the Speaker's table the bill (H.R. 244)       to encourage effective, voluntary investments to recruit,       employ, and retain men and women who have served in the       United States military with annual Federal awards to       employers recognizing such efforts, and for other purposes,       with the Senate amendments thereto, and to consider in the       House, without intervention of any point of order, a single       motion offered by the chair of the Committee on       Appropriations or his designee that the House concur in the       Senate amendments numbered 2 and 3, and that the House concur       in the Senate amendment numbered 1 with an amendment       consisting of the text of Rules Committee Print 115-16       modified by the amendment printed in the report of the       Committee on Rules accompanying this resolution. The Senate       amendments and the motion shall be considered as read. The       motion shall be debatable for one hour equally divided and       controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the       Committee on Appropriations. The previous question shall be       considered as ordered on the motion to final adoption without       intervening motion or demand for division of the question.        Sec. 2.  The chair of the Committee on Appropriations may       insert in the Congressional Record not later than May 3,       2017, such material as he may deem explanatory of the Senate       amendments and the motion specified in the first section of       this resolution.        Sec. 3.  The chair of the Permanent Select Committee on       Intelligence may insert in the Congressional Record not later       than May 3, 2017, such material as he may deem explanatory of       intelligence authorization measures for the fiscal year 2017.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Hastings), my  friend, pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, yesterday the Rules Committee met and reported  a rule for consideration of two very important measures. First, the  resolution provides for consideration of Senate amendments to H.R. 244,  the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2017.   The rule provides for 1 hour of debate, equally divided and  controlled by the chair and ranking member of the Appropriations  Committee. In addition, the resolution provides for consideration of  the FY 2017 Intelligence Authorization Act as an amendment to the  underlying bill.   Mr. Speaker, the appropriations package in front of us is the first  successful bicameral, bipartisan negotiation of the Trump  administration. It has broad bipartisan support in both Houses of  Congress. All Members can feel good about the work of the  Appropriations Committee, especially our chairman, Mr. Frelinghuysen of  New Jersey, and our Ranking Member, Mrs. Lowey of New York. In the  House, the work must continue today but, hopefully, will be concluded  today.   The package in front of us not only keeps the government open and  operating through the end of the fiscal year, but it also represents a  successful completion of key member priorities on both sides of the  aisle.   This bill provides for a $25.7 billion increase in defense spending,  notably including an additional $7.3 billion for Department of Defense  readiness and training, as well as the largest pay raise our troops  have received in 6 years. These funds will help us enhance our military  readiness and marks an end to the erosion of our national military  strength.   Importantly, we accomplished this without a dollar-for-dollar  increase in nondefense discretionary spending, a practice which was  imposed upon us by the previous administration. That practice  threatened to drive our national deficit even higher. I am pleased that  we broke that connection, for we should never operate under such a  formula in the future.   This measure also provides for an increase of $1.5 billion in funding  for border security. $772 million is available for key administration  priorities like border security technology enhancements and  infrastructure improvements. It also increases funding for Customs and  Border Patrol to improve operational effectiveness. And, I note, the  President has wide authority and latitude to deploy these dollars where  [[Page H3081]]  they should do the most good. This is the largest increase in border  security funding in almost a decade.   Domestically, this bill funds hundreds, if not thousands, of Member  priorities. We reached a bipartisan agreement on opioid funding,  redirecting over $500 million to combat this epidemic affecting every  district in the Nation. We funded health care for miners, a key  priority for many of our Members.   We secured the second consecutive $2 billion increase for the  National Institutes of Health, the Nation's lead biomedical research  organization and a key driver of the hope of treating new diseases,  saving countless lives, and, incidentally, driving down healthcare  costs.   We also secured an increase for the Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention, which will help enhance our readiness to combat pandemics  and respond to public health crises.   We increased funding for GEAR UP and TRIO, two essential programs  that help first-generation college students actually go to college, and  increased funding for Head Start by $90 million. Every Member of this  House has a victory someplace in this bill, and this was done, Mr.  Speaker, by cutting spending in other less essential areas and making  tough choices.   In the Labor-H provisions of this bill, for instance, we actually  spend $2.8 billion less than President Obama requested, and $1 billion  less than we actually spent last year.   Finally, and most importantly, this bill is the product of a  successful bipartisan, bicameral negotiation. This shows all of us that  we have the ability for the President, the Republicans in the House and  the Senate, and the Democrats in the House and the Senate to sit down  and work together on important issues. I am heartened by this success,  and I believe it suggests our ability to work together in the future on  other crucially important pieces of legislation like tax reform and  infrastructure improvements.    Mr. Speaker, I urge support for the rule and the underlying  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   To respond to a few of my friend's points, Mr. Speaker, I want to  begin by agreeing with my friend, actually.   As he knows, I agree with his point that this should have been done  many months ago, and could have been done, in my view, many months ago.  We should have done this in December. I don't think we did the country  or ourselves or the President any favors by delaying that. So my friend  is right about that decision, and I hope we all learn a lesson from it.   I also agree with my friend that, because we delayed, the 2018  appropriations process will be extremely difficult and truncated. It  will make work harder. We may find ourselves back here in a number of  months asking for  [[Page H3083]]  some brief extension as we continue to work through our problems. I  hope not, but my friend's observation on that point I agree with.   I want to disagree with my friend pretty strongly about his  observation about the 160 riders that we decided in the negotiation not  to press, and I want to explain why we decided not to press them.   Frankly, we don't need to press them anymore. Almost 160 of those  were designed to limit or reverse rulings of the last administration-- either rules or executive decisions. Well, Mr. Trump is now the  President of the United States and he is going to have the ability to  do almost all of those things on his own. He doesn't need legislative  instruction from us. He will certainly get support as he works through  that list with the executive branch, which he runs.   I also want to add, just to clarify, it is important to note that  there is nothing in this bill that funds Planned Parenthood in any way,  shape, or form. As a matter of fact, there is a family planning title  and grants are awarded out of that title by the Department of Health  and Human Services.   Sometimes in the past, Planned Parenthood has received money in those  grants. Now there is new management at the Department of Health and  Human Services, so we will see how this goes. This Congress has never  appropriated money directly to Planned Parenthood and, frankly, I  suspect never will.   Finally, in defense of the President, I want to point out that we are  adding billions of dollars to defense of this country, which is  desperately needed because, frankly, his predecessor had allowed it  to erode. That is because of the President's leadership.    We are making the most substantial investments in border security in  a decade. That is because of the President's leadership.   Finally, we have broken this terrible one-for-one formula that the  last administration imposed on us. In other words, to defend the United  States of America, we had to spend more money domestically, whether we  needed to or not, whether we could afford it or not. If it weren't for  President Trump, that formula would still be in existence and we would  be frittering away money in places where we don't need it and denying  support to our troops and our forces in the field when they desperately  need it. I am very grateful to the President for making that possible.  Again, with his leadership, it could not have occurred.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Alabama (Mr.  Byrne), my good friend, a fellow Rules Committee member, and also a  distinguished member of the House Armed Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Before I go to my next speaker, I want to take a moment to respond to  my friends.   Mr. Speaker, I actually came here to debate the appropriations bill,  which is a great bipartisan compromise, but I am always happy to engage  in the healthcare debate as well, if that is what my friends choose to  do. I am happy to do it because I remember the conditions under which  ObamaCare was passed.   I remember the promises that we would save $2,500 a family--not true.   I remember, if you liked your plan, you could keep it--not true.   I remember, if you liked your doctor, you could keep that  individual--not true.   This was sold, frankly, on a tissue of fabrications and some  predictions that were outlandishly false.   Those people who say this is a good system, come to my State. We are  down to a single provider--one. That provider, by the way, I always say  thank God for them, because they are losing money. We are down to one.  Our rates are going up 69 percent.   So anybody who thinks this is a successful system should go look at  it. If it were successful, my friends would probably still be in the  majority instead of the minority. It has not been successful. The  American people have, in election after election, rendered a verdict  that this particular system is not meeting their needs, and it badly  needs to be overhauled and changed, if not rooted out completely.   Frankly, again, as, I think, through the President's actions and what  my colleagues in the leadership of my party are doing, I am very glad  they are working overtime right now to try and make sure that we have  something better for the American people than my friends delivered on  the other side of the aisle when they had the opportunity to do so. It  is not working.   I hope very much we have to cancel travel plans so the next day or  two we can actually vote on this. I would be ecstatic to do that. So,  again, I would be happy to debate that. When the time comes, we will.  But I look forward to engaging in that debate because I am absolutely  convinced we can do a lot better for the American people than we  [[Page H3085]]  did when ObamaCare was passed, and we can implement something a lot  better for the American people than we did when it was rolled out. And  we certainly can avoid some of the catastrophic consequences.   As for my friend's concerns about preexisting conditions, frankly,  they are not going to be reversed, but I happen to live in a State  where I trust my Governor and my legislature to make smart decisions.  Frankly, I trust them a lot more than I do anybody in Washington, D.C.,  to understand what is going on in my State. I suspect most people in  here actually trust their Governors and their legislature to be more in  touch with the needs of their people than anybody in Washington, D.C.,  happens to be, so I am happy to see a devolution of decisionmaking from  Washington to other parts of the country. As I read the Constitution,  we call that federalism. It has worked very well for the American  people for almost 240 years.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from the Fourth  District of Michigan (Mr. Moolenaar), my good friend in his second  term, but a new member of the Committee on Appropriations. I am very  glad to have him on my Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human  Services, Education, and Related Agencies.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Dent), my very good friend and my fellow member of  the Committee on Appropriations and the chairman of the Subcommittee on  Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 2 minutes.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I want to thank my good friend. It is always a pleasure, honestly, to  engage in debate with him because it is going to be spirited, but it is  going to be civil. So I thank my friend for that.   And, frankly, when my friend points out that he and President Trump  are actually on the same side for once, I think the second coming may  not be very far. So we are all in a pretty good mood here.   But I do want to echo a couple of points that my friend made, and  made, as always, with great skill. There is a lot in this bill that  brings us together. This was a product of genuine compromise. We have  Republicans in the House and Democrats in the House, Republicans in the  Senate and Democrats in the Senate, and, obviously, the administration.  It is really a five-corner negotiation.   I think we ought to step back a little bit and reflect that, in the  course of that, while all those parties began with very different  positions, and some verbal fisticuffs, as well, they actually moved  closer together over the course of discussion. And that has effectively  meant that we are going to have the first bipartisan, bicameral  negotiation in this administration that has been successful.   I would hope it becomes a model for some of the things that lie in  front of us, things like infrastructure, and like tax reform. I  recognize we won't always agree. But, to me, this agreement shows that  we can work towards agreements, if we will sit in good faith and  compromise with one another.   I think the President, frankly, did a lot of good things from his  point of view here. I think the additional money for our men and women  in uniform, the raise in pay for those we have asked so much from, and  who have never let us down, is something he can be proud of.    I think the additional money on the border, where we know we have a  security problem, we may debate the best way to address that. That is  fair enough. But that is an achievement that he deserves credit for.   And I think, frankly, breaking this artificial linkage of domestic  spending and security spending was something that is really important.  Sometimes we will actually need more domestically than, perhaps, we  need in defense. But we are going to have to look at those things  logically, not create artificial formulas. I actually fear sometimes my  side might do that in reverse by demanding cuts in exchange for  military spending when those cuts are, in themselves, not wise.   Finally, I look at things where we find a lot of common purpose here.  My friend, Mr. Dent, mentioned a number of those. Things like more  money for the National Institutes of Health and the Center for Disease  Control. Believe me, pandemics and bioterrorists don't care if you are  Republican or Democrat, or Liberal or Conservative. We have to maintain  this effort. It is extraordinarily important.   I think, again, and my friends pointed out, we worked together to  provide additional funds for early childhood, to provide additional  money through programs like GEAR UP and TRIO, to help those who have  never had an opportunity to go to college and succeed. And, frankly,  things like the year-round Pell grant, that, again, as speakers from  both sides of the aisle pointed out, are going to help students  actually succeed and help them wrestle with the financial burden. So  there is a lot in here to be proud of.   Now, our vote on the rule is always a partisan exercise, so I  recognize that. But I am very proud that, after that vote, we will have  substantial numbers of Members from both sides of the aisle voting  together on something they worked on together and achieved. It will be  sent over to the Senate, and I think we will see the same result there,  and eventually to the desk of the President of the United States, and I  think he can sign it with a great deal of pride and a recognition that:  hey, occasionally, bipartisanship and negotiation actually work.   With that, again, I want to thank my very good friend for the debate.  And I want to point out in closing that this is so much better than a  continuing resolution. This is real governance at work. This is us  working together, exercising oversight, and appropriately funding, and  compromises on occasion, important functions for the American people.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Hastings is as follows:            An Amendment to H. Res. 305 Offered by Mr. Hastings         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       section:        Sec. 4. Rule XXI of the Rules of the House of       Representatives is amended by adding at the end the following       new clause:  [[Page H3087]]            RESTRICTIONS ON CONSIDERATION OF CERTAIN LEGISLATIVE PROVISIONS                           RELATING TO HEALTHCARE         13. (a) It shall not be in order to consider a bill, joint       resolution, amendment, or conference report which includes       any provision described in paragraph (b).''        (b) A provision referred to in paragraph (a) is a provision       which, if enacted into law, would result in any of the       following:        (1) The denial of health insurance coverage to individuals       on the basis that such individuals have a pre-existing       condition or a requirement for individuals with a pre-      existing condition to pay more for premiums on the basis of       such individuals having such a preexisting condition.        (2) The elimination of the prohibition on life time limits       on the dollar value of health insurance coverage benefits.        (3) The termination of the ability of individuals under 26       years of age to be included on their parent's employer or       individual health coverage.

(8) The reduction of Federal taxes on the 1 percent of the       population with the highest income or increase the tax burden       (expressed as a percent of aggregate Federal taxes) on the 80       percent of the population with the lowest income.        (c) It shall not be in order to consider a measure or       matter proposing to repeal or amend the Patient Protection       and Affordable Care Act (PL 111-148) and the Health Care and       Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010 (PL 111-      152), or part thereof, in the House or in the Committee of       the Whole House on the state of the Union unless an easily       searchable electronic estimate and comparison prepared by the       Director of the Congressional Budget Office is made available       on a publicly available website of the House.        (d) It shall not be in order to consider a measure or       matter proposing to repeal or amend the Patient Protection       and Affordable Care Act (PL 111-148) and the Health Care and       Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010 (PL 111-      152), or part thereof, in the House or in the Committee of       the Whole House on the state of the Union, that is called up       pursuant to a rule or order that makes a manager's amendment       in order or considers such an amendment to be adopted, unless       an easily searchable updated electronic estimate and       comparison prepared by the Director of the Congressional       Budget Office reflecting such amendment is made available on       a publicly available website of the House.        (e) It shall not be in order to consider a rule or order       that waives the application of paragraph (a), paragraph (b),       paragraph (c), or paragraph (d). As disposition of any point       of order under paragraphs (c) through (e), the Chair shall       put the question of consideration with respect to the order,       conference report, or rule as applicable. The question of       consideration shall be debatable for 10 minutes by the Member       initiating the point of order and for 10 minutes by an       opponent, but shall otherwise be decided without intervening       motion except one that the House adjourn.                                   ____           The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.
