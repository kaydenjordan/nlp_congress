 Mr. Speaker, it does not give me pleasure to be here  today to say what I am about to say. I am really frustrated.  [[Page H5645]]    The Energy and Commerce Committee, which I am the ranking member and  former chairman of, we worked most of this year on legislation to ban  the manufacture, processing, and distribution of asbestos.   We found common ground. We worked together. We voted it out of  committee by a 47-1 vote. We fully anticipated the work product of the  Republicans and Democrats in that committee to be brought to the floor  under suspension, as approved by the committee.   Sadly, Democrats on Friday night listed the bill, but they had  rewritten parts of it without ever consulting with Republicans and  tried to cram it through the process.   Now, after many days of trying to work this out between us, and we  have offered many alternatives to try and accommodate our majority  colleagues, they are trying to blame Republicans for this bill not  coming to the floor.   Well, I will tell you what, bring the bill we passed out of committee  to the floor and we will vote for it, and it will pass overwhelmingly.   You are the majority party. You just brought a $2.2 trillion bill to  the floor; you can bring this one under a rule. Do that. Keep your  word.   Let's work together and ban asbestos.                            ____________________
