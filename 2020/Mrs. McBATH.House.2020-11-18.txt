 Mr. Speaker, as we move into the last weeks of 2020, as  we move into a dark and uncertain winter, our Nation continues to face  an increasingly deadly pandemic. Grief, economic hardship, and anxiety  can be felt in every corner of our country.   Despite the challenges that face our Nation, the past few weeks have  seen millions of Americans stand up and make their voices heard.   And millions of Americans have chosen unity over division, stability  over chaos, and looked forward to a future filled with faith and hope  for a brighter world.   That world requires something from each and every one of us--we all  must do our part. We all have a role to play in transforming our  aspirations into real, effective progress.   Over the last 2 years, I have heard from thousands of families who  have called on my office in a moment of need; a grandparent whose  Social Security checks just simply stopped coming; a veteran who  desperately needed an appointment at the VA hospital; a small business  that required assistance to keep their employees paid during this  pandemic.   For many of these people, their call to my office may have been the  first time that they have ever interacted with a government official.  It may be the first time that they have ever asked their government for  help.   Each and every day, we are called upon to serve our communities in  Congress. They are trusting us to do everything that we can to advocate  on their behalf.   We must never lose sight of that faith and that trust that they  placed in us.   Hardworking families across Georgia, and from around the Nation,  understand that the days and the months ahead may be the most important  of our lifetime.   And Americans have been very clear. They have asked their leaders to  put aside their partisan bickering and focus on American fellowship.   And the mandate that they have given us is one of compassion and  cooperation.   It is a mandate to heal fractures and mend their wounds.   It is a mandate to solve problems and protect them.   And it is a mandate to compromise with common sense.   It is a mandate to enact policies that provide every person in this  Nation an opportunity to fight for their very own American Dream.   For many years, before I had the honor of serving my community in  Congress, I worked as a flight attendant for Delta Airlines, and I  shared journeys with people from every corner of our globe and of every  color and every creed and of every race and every religion.   Yes, we all come from different backgrounds, and we share different  beliefs, and we all belong to different political parties. But what we  must understand is that we share a common purpose that transcends  partisanship.   We are all uniquely American. We are all far more alike than we are  different. We all need to spend time with those that we love, to share  our stories with those who make us smile, make us laugh. We all want  what is best for our families.   On these journeys across America, I watched first-generation  Americans chart a course toward a lifetime of new and exciting  experiences.   And I watched men and women in uniform fly home to surprise their  young children, their mothers who have been worried sick, their  brothers who haven't seen their best friend in years.   I have watched parents beam with pride as they reunited with their  new college graduate. After decades of hard work, they knew, with faith  and with certainty, that the days of their children would be better  than their own.   This is the America that our constituents sent us here to fight for  and sent us here to lead; to preserve the ideas that this Nation was  founded upon; to protect the values that must endure long after every  single one of us in this Chamber is gone.   Our strength as a Nation has always been on our ability to come  together to address America's greatest challenges, which we are in  right now. And that is the opportunity that we have in this very  moment.   And when we look back at this time in years to come, I pray that we  can all take pride in our response; that we fought against all those  who seek to sow the seeds of hatred and division--and for all those  rooted in peace and prosperity; that we fought to strengthen our fellow  Americans with love and with unity; that we fought for progress  alongside our brothers and sisters of this great Nation with  unshakeable resolve; that we fought for a future that we can all  believe in.                            ____________________
