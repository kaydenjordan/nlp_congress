Mr. President, before we wrap up today, I call my  colleagues' attention to a truly dedicated staff member who has served  the Senate for decades.   After more than three decades on the job with the Senate Sergeant at  Arms, Cindy Hasiak is retiring today from her post as Chamber manager.   A native of Indiana, Cindy first arrived to work in the Capitol back  in 1987. She was welcomed with--get this--a chance to work the Iran- Contra hearings. Since then, she has been on the clock for 7  Presidential inaugurations, 32 Presidential addresses and States of the  Union, 6 lying-in-state ceremonies, and a great many more normal  workdays, or at least what passes for normal here in the Senate.   More than three decades of landmark votes, major debates, and all the  daily business that takes place in this Chamber, Cindy has been here  helping make it happen.   To be specific, as one of our doorkeepers, and lately the director of  doorkeepers, Cindy has literally guarded the Senate floor. Talk about a  sensitive job.   Alongside the brave men and women of the Capitol Police, our  doorkeepers control and manage access to this historic institution that  attracts the attention of the entire world. They check credentials,  welcome visitors, keep things running smoothly.   Here on the floor, they keep us safe. Up in the Galleries, they  welcome visitors and give citizens a chance to watch democracy in  action. So it is undoubtedly the case that the Senate has been stronger  for Cindy's attentive service, but even after 32 years, we would be  foolish to think we could keep her forever.   After more than her share of long days, longer weeks, and late nights  that relegated entertaining and family time to the back burner, Cindy  has certainly earned the chance to spend less time supervising all of  us here and more time with her loved ones.   I know my colleagues join me in wishing Cindy good health and  happiness as she embarks on a well-deserved retirement. She will leave  with our deepest gratitude for a job well done. I might add that given  the fact Cindy is from Indiana, it is appropriate that we have the  Senator from Indiana as the Chair.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 1200, which was received  from the House.
