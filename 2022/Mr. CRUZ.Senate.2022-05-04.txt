 Madam President, I call up my motion to instruct conferees,  which is at the desk.    Madam President, China and Iran are two of the most  dangerous enemies of the United States. China is our most significant  geopolitical foe for the next 100 years. Iran is the world's leading  state sponsor of terrorism.   The Biden administration, unfortunately, has been dealing with both  from a position of weakness. Specifically, the Biden administration has  refused to enforce oil sanctions against Iran, allowing Iran to sell  more than a million barrels a day of oil primarily to China.   At the same time, the Biden administration is negotiating to lift  terrorism sanctions on the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and the  Central Bank of Iran. The IRGC is responsible for murdering over 600  service men and women. The IRGC, right now, is actively trying to  murder the former Secretary of State of the United States and the  former National Security Advisor.   If you support terrorism sanctions on the IRGC, you should vote yes,  and if you want to lift those sanctions, you should vote no.    Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.
