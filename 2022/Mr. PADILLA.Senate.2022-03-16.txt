 Mr. President, I rise to speak on behalf of a few  Federal judge nominees from the State of California.   In recognizing that, right now, many Americans are certainly  following the news and the potential news of the Federal judiciary and  are focusing on a nominee for the U.S. Supreme Court. As a member of  the Judiciary Committee, I certainly look forward to hearing more from  Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson next week as we conduct her confirmation  hearing.   The choices for the Supreme Court are certainly critical for the  future of our democracy, but the fact of the matter is--and the  Presiding Officer knows I like numbers and knows I like data. So the  important data point here is that it is only a tiny percentage of cases  in our Federal court system that actually reach the U.S. Supreme Court.  In fact, more than 90 percent of the Federal cases are decided at the  district court level. That means the vast majority of people who  interface with the Federal judiciary will only ever meet a district  court judge, sitting on the other side of the bench, whether  [[Page S1201]]  they are witnesses to a crime, whether they are parties to a lawsuit or  defendants in a criminal case.   That is one of the primary reasons I have worked so closely with the  Biden administration in helping to identify and recommend and support  talented nominees for California's district courts.   Today, I rise to highlight three nominees to serve as Federal judges  whose confirmation processes we are beginning today.
