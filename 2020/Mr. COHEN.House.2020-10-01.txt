 Madam Speaker, I came here for the purpose of commending  Representatives Malinowski and Riggleman for bringing the resolution  condemning QAnon and its baseless, racist theories. But having heard  some of the remarks today, I have to tell you: Speaker Pelosi is  standing up for American values and standing up for the least of us,  while the Republicans are standing for the most of us.   The Republicans passed a $150 billion tax break for the richest  Americans, people like Donald Trump who don't pay taxes. They get a 4- year backlog to file losses in real estate deals to cut out their  taxes.   They won't do anything for children in a child tax credit, but they  think that that policy of giving people, on average, a $1.6 million tax  benefit to the richest 1 percent is good values. That is not good  values. That is bad values.   That is not good values; that is bad values. And the Republicans  ought to object to that because it is making them the party of greed  and tax weaselers and the bad people in America and not caring about  the least of these.                                time  1230
