 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the timely  Senate action of the just passed National Defense Authorization Act for  fiscal year 2019. Similar to last year, the NDAA is geared towards  increasing the readiness of our military and properly equip our troops  for their safety and for their effectiveness in their mission.   The steady decline of our Armed Forces under the previous  administration is well documented. Now we are continuing the  revitalization we started last year by investing in our soldiers and  providing them with some of the necessary equipment needed to get their  job done.   This is about providing for the well-being of our troops and their  families, including the largest pay raise in 9 years. We are also  investing in critical missile defense and nuclear deterrence programs  that will substantially improve our national defense capabilities.   In order for America to continue as a leader of the free world, our  military must be ready to defend us from all and any threat. As we head  into this Memorial Day holiday, we can, in part, honor the fallen by an  effective NDAA, giving our military what it needs, and support, indeed,  as we remember this Memorial Day weekend.                            ____________________
