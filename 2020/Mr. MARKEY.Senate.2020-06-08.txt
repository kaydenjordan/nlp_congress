 Mr. President, due to a clerical error, the junior  Senator from California, Ms. Harris, was not added as an original  cosponsor of S. Res. 602, a resolution that we introduced together on  June 2, 2020, recognizing that the murder of George Floyd by officers  of the Minneapolis Police Department is the result of pervasive and  systemic racism that cannot be dismantled without, among other things,  proper redress in the courts. Senator Harris understands that law  enforcement should not be completely shielded from accountability when  they violate someone's civil rights, and that the Supreme Court's  qualified immunity doctrine is broken. I thank her for her support in  leading the effort to abolish qualified immunity for law enforcement  officers in its current form.                            ____________________
