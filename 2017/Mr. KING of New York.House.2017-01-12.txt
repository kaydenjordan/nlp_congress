 Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 78, the  SEC Regulatory Accountability Act. If passed, the SEC would be required  to follow President Obama's executive order that requires a thorough  cost-benefit analysis of new rules and a comprehensive review of  existing regulations. Under current law, the SEC must consider the  effect of its rules on ``efficiency, competition, and capital  formation,'' and weighing costs and benefits is necessary to meet this  requirement.   Cost-benefit analysis is not a new idea. Agencies have done this kind  of analysis for over 30 years. In fact, it is a bipartisan idea. In  1981, President Reagan issued an executive order requiring Cabinet- level agencies to engage in cost-benefit analysis, which President  Clinton expanded with another executive order in 1993.   Unfortunately, independent agencies are not subject to executive  orders and those regulated by the SEC have suffered as a result. From  2005 to 2012, SEC regulations were overturned consistently by the  courts for inadequate economic analysis and unjustified costs. While  the SEC has taken steps to improve its rulemaking process, H.R. 78 will  ensure that future rules maximize economic benefit and companies do not  face unnecessary hurdles when they access our capital markets.  Democrats and Republicans often do not agree on policy, but I hope we  can agree on the need for a fair, transparent, and informed process.   I thank my distinguished colleague for introducing this vital  legislation.
