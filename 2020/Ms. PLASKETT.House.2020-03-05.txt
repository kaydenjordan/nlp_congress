 Mr. Speaker, this is Women's History Month. I rise to  recognize Nella Larsen, who was born in Chicago in 1891. Her mother was  a Danish immigrant and her father an immigrant from the Danish West  Indies, what is now known as the U.S. Virgin Islands.   Larsen attended school in all-White environments in Chicago until she  moved to Nashville to attend high school. She later practiced nursing,  served as a librarian in the New York Public Library, and, after  resigning from that position, she began a literary career.   Her first novel, ``Quicksand,'' won her a Harmon Foundation bronze  medal. After the publication of her second novel, ``Passing,'' in 1929,  Larsen was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship, a first for an African  American woman, establishing her as a premier novelist of the Harlem  Renaissance.   She died in New York in 1964.   Her work explored the complex issues of racial identity and  identification in her fiction. Though critics remain conflicted about  her novels, ``Quicksand'' and ``Passing,'' there can be no question  that they are significant, groundbreaking American literary texts. She  received a number of awards for her writing.   Along with her contemporary, novelist Zora Neale Hurston, Larsen is  considered to be one of the most important female voices in the Harlem  Renaissance. We remember her voice now.                            ____________________
