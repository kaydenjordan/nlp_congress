 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.J. Res.  26, a resolution disapproving the action of the District of Columbia  Council in approving the Revised Criminal Code Act of 2022.   This resolution is not only a brazen and misguided measure seeking to  uphold decades of racially systemic policies of criminal injustice, it  is an insulting attempt to trample on the rights and the will of the  people in the District of Columbia.   By subjecting thousands of Black residents of Washington, D.C. to  criminalization and incarceration, the Revised Criminal Code Act of  2022 was the first comprehensive revision of the D.C. code since the  year 1901, something that should've been revised long before.   However, in contrast to the majority of other states, D.C. did not  update its criminal statues throughout the 1960s and 1970s.   As a result of the antiquated laws, which had been in place for  decades, the human rights and freedoms of Washingtonians has been  compromised, resulting in D.C. having one of the highest imprisonment  rates in the nation, whereby Black males account for more than 95% of  those who are behind bars.   The 2022 revision was a necessary push forward, and for the  Republicans within this congress to attempt to undo these revisions,  shows a rejection of Home Rule.   The revisions helped to correct many of the faults that the District  of Columbia continuously ran into with the district itself making the  necessary corrections with the support of the public.   The D.C. Criminal Code Reform Commission was formed by the D.C.  Council to revise the statutes to guarantee that the revisions of  offenses and punishments are precise, consistent, reasonable, and  constitutional.   The District of Columbia Public Defender Service, the District of  Columbia Attorney General, legal professionals, and the general public  were among the sources of input that the Commission consulted.   Members of Congress should not use their own policy judgment to  replace that of the elected officials within D.C.   Prior to these revisions simple assault carried a sentence of less  than six months in prison, while the threat of simple assault carried a  20-year sentence.   Possession of self-defense spray and possession of a fully automatic  machine gun carried the same maximum penalty of one year.   Some offenses can be traced back to the District's Black Codes and  Slave Codes and others that were introduced by segregationists from  states outside D.C.   The almost 700,000 individuals who live in Washington, D.C., are  capable of self-government and through the Revised Criminal Code Act of  2022, proved themselves as such.   Congress is not judge, jury and executioner and should not overstep  its place within Washington, D.C. Washington, D.C. has its sole right  to govern its jurisdiction and citizens.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member and thank  the managers of this bill for their work.   This was no weather balloon. This was a spy balloon.   Let me be very clear: Members of both sides of the aisle, Democrats  and Republicans, are standing before the American people and  recognizing that this resolution of the Chinese Communist Party's  actions are appropriate, and we should, as Americans, denounce their  actions.   Let me be very clear as well: I want to congratulate United States  military intelligence officials and others who effectively took the  Commander in Chief's order that occurred on February 1 to shoot it  down, and they handled themselves with the greatest amount of  appropriateness to ensure that the American people were safe, to  contain the threat, and to do their job.   It serves no purpose to suggest that the Commander in Chief,  President Joe Biden, failed the American people or did anything wrong.   Interestingly enough, in the midst of the spy balloon, over 70  percent of the American people believe that Joe Biden took to the  podium in the State of the Union and gave them enough comfort that the  State of the Union is well, our souls are strong, and the American  people are strong.   Yes, as a member of the Homeland Security Committee, I am keenly  aware and concerned about this Nation's national security, keenly aware  of the timeframe in which this spy balloon came into our eyesight.   With that in mind, even as it traversed the United States, I can  assure you, in spite of the chronicling of the facts here, that General  Austin, the Department of Defense, and others that were responsible for  our safety, pursuant to the direction of the Commander in Chief,  followed this spy balloon and were able to handle it appropriately in  the course of shooting it down.   Finally, let me say: It is important that we use this as a  condemnation of the Chinese Communist Party. Let us not use this to  intimidate Chinese Americans or to be able to create atmospheres of  hate. I denounce that, and I denounce SB 147 in the State of Texas that  wants to stop Chinese Americans from buying property. That is not the  American way.   What is the American way is to stand as Democrats and Republicans and  others and Members of Congress to take our full responsibility,  alongside the executive, to ensure your national security. We have done  that.    We have the facts, we know the traversing, and I can assure you that  the Chinese Americans have not engaged themselves in this activity and  should not be condemned.   The Chinese Communist Party is aware of the strength of the people of  the United States and their defense.    Mr. Speaker, let me thank the Biden administration  for work that they have already done by asking to have them help us in  the closure of the disposable e-cigarette loophole.   As chair of the Congressional Children's Caucus, the administration's  work in curtailing youth e-cigarette use is commendable. Vaping and e- cigarette usage among youth is at a historic low. Good news.   Despite this, however, the FDA guidance issued by the previous  administration that prohibits flavored e-cigarettes fails to include  any disposable e-cigarette products currently on the market.   This loophole, alongside the appeal that disposable e-cigarettes have  for our youth, has influenced a surge in youth consumption.   Right now, in smoke shops, corner stores, and gas stations across the  country, disposable e-cigarettes are being sold for prices as low as  $5.   Like candy, they are being offered in enticing flavors such as  strawberry, iced apple mango, and pineapple lemonade; just what a child  would look at.   Each product is cleverly designed to easily fit in one's pocket, easy  to take to school or other places. These products are sleek,  affordable, pocket-sized, and highly accessible.   A single disposable device can contain enough nicotine as an entire  pack of cigarettes.   A 2022 National Youth Tobacco Study said these products' usage is up  2,188 percent since 2019. It is dangerous. Let's get to work. Let's  save our children.   Let us celebrate a happy Black History Month, as well.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to thank the Biden Administration for its help  already. Now the Nation needs help in closing the disposable e- cigarette loophole.   The Administration's work in curtailing youth e-cigarette use is  commendable; vaping and e-cigarette usage among youths is at a historic  low.   Despite this, however, the FDA guidance issued by the previous  administration that prohibits flavored e-cigarettes, FAILS to include  any disposable e-cigarette products currently on the market.   This loophole, alongside the appeal that disposable e-cigarettes have  for youth, has influenced a surge in youth consumption.   Right now, in smoke shops, corner stores, and gas stations across the  country, disposable e-cigarettes are being sold for prices as low as  $5.   They are being offered in enticing flavors such as Strawberry, Iced  Apple Mango, and Pineapple Lemonade.   Each product is cleverly designed to easily fit in one's pocket.   These products are sleek, affordable, pocket-sized, and highly  accessible to our youth.   A single disposable device can contain enough nicotine as an entire  pack of cigarettes.   According to the Centers for Disease Control 2022 National Youth  Tobacco Study, usage of these products is up 2,188 percent since 2019.   This is a dangerous over site that will put thousands of lives at  risk.   I urge this Administration to close the loophole to ensure the flavor  ban includes disposable e-cigarettes.   The future and safety of America's youth depend on it.                            ____________________
