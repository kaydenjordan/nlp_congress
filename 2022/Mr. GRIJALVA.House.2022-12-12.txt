 Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 6611) to authorize the Embassy of France in Washington, DC,  to establish a commemorative work in the District of Columbia and its  environs to honor the extraordinary contributions of Jean Monnet to  restoring peace between European nations and establishing the European  Union, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 6611         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. AUTHORIZATION TO ESTABLISH COMMEMORATIVE WORK.         (a) Definitions.--In this section:        (1) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary       of the Interior.        (2) Sponsor.--The term ``Sponsor'' means the Government of       France.        (b) Authorization.--        (1) In general.--The Sponsor may establish a commemorative       work on Federal land in the District of Columbia and its       environs to honor the extraordinary contributions of Jean       Monnet with respect to--        (A) restoring peace between European nations; and        (B) establishing the European Union.        (2) Compliance with standards for commemorative works.--The       establishment of the commemorative work under this section       shall be in accordance with chapter 89 of title 40, United       States Code (commonly known as the ``Commemorative Works       Act''), except that sections 8902(a)(1) and 8908(b) shall not       apply with respect to the commemorative work.        (3) Prohibition on the use of federal funds.--        (A) In general.--Federal funds may not be used to pay any       expense of the establishment or maintenance of the       commemorative work under this section.        (B) Acceptance of contributions and payment of expenses.--      The Sponsor shall be solely responsible for the acceptance of       contributions for, and the payment of the expenses of, the       establishment and maintenance of the commemorative work under       this section.        (4) Deposit of excess funds.--        (A) In general.--If, on payment of all expenses for the       establishment of the commemorative work under this section       (including the maintenance and preservation amount required       by section 8906(b)(1) of title 40, United States Code), there       remains a balance of funds received for the establishment of       the commemorative work, the Sponsor shall transmit the amount       of the balance to the Secretary for deposit in the account       provided for in section 8906(b)(3) of that title.        (B) On expiration of authority.--If, on expiration of the       authority for the commemorative work under section 8903(e) of       title 40, United States Code, there remains a balance of       funds received for the establishment of the commemorative       work under this section, the Sponsor shall transmit the       amount of the balance to a separate account with the National       Park Foundation for memorials, to be available to the       Secretary or the Administrator of General Services, as       appropriate, in accordance with the process provided in       paragraph (4) of section 8906(b) of that title for accounts       established under paragraph (2) or (3) of that section.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 6611, introduced by  my colleague, Representative Keating.   This bill authorizes the French Embassy to establish a commemorative  bench in Washington, D.C.'s Rock Creek Park to honor the historic  contributions of Jean Monnet.   Jean Monnet was a French diplomat and entrepreneur known as a  founding father of the European Union.   Monnet served as a key diplomat during World War II, coming to  Washington on France's behalf to meet with President Roosevelt to  negotiate a massive aircraft purchase at the start of the war.   Later in the war, after Nazi Germany invaded France, Monnet  negotiated with American authorities to deliver much-needed supplies to  the British front lines. Monnet's efforts helped save millions of lives  and led the way in uniting Europe in the postwar era.   Monnet himself said that walks through Rock Creek Park helped him  think and develop plans to achieve peace and unity in Europe. I can  think of no better way to honor his legacy than this legislation.   I thank my colleague, Representative Keating, for introducing this  important bill and championing the legislation.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes,'' and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 314) to repeal the Klamath Tribe Judgment Fund Act.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                   S. 314         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Klamath Tribe Judgment Fund       Repeal Act''.       SEC. 2. REPEAL.         Public Law 89-224 (commonly known as the ``Klamath Tribe       Judgment Fund Act'') (79 Stat. 897) is repealed.       SEC. 3. DISBURSEMENT OF REMAINING FUNDS.         Notwithstanding any provision of Public Law 89-224 (79       Stat. 897) (as in effect on the day before the date of       enactment of this Act) relating to the distribution or use of       funds, as soon as practicable after the date of enactment of       this Act, the Secretary of the Interior shall disburse to the       Klamath Tribe the balance of any funds that, on or before the       date of enactment of this Act, were appropriated or deposited       into the trust accounts for remaining legal fees and       administration and per capita trust accounts, as identified       by the Secretary of the Interior, under that Act (as in       effect on the day before the date of enactment of this Act).     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of S. 314, the Klamath Tribe  Judgment Fund Repeal Act, introduced by Senator Merkley of Oregon. Our  colleague, Representative Schrader of Oregon, has the House companion  to this legislation.   This bill will provide long-awaited relief to the Klamath Tribes by  restoring the Tribe's self-governance over the management of its own  judgment funds.   Like many tribes, the Klamath Tribes were terminated by Congress in  the 1950s--in their case, through passage of the Klamath Termination  Act. In addition to termination, the legislation established procedures  for the sale of reservation land belonging to Tribal members.   At the time, the Tribe was required to submit to the Secretary of the  Interior a final roll call of Tribal members. The final roll call was  eventually used to settle the Tribe's ongoing Indian Claims Commission  suits under the Klamath Tribe Judgment Fund Act.   Fortunately, in 1986, the Klamath Tribes' Federal trust relationship  with the United States was restored. However, the judgment fund did not  account for this restoration and limited the ability of the Tribe to  settle any outlying claims.   Today, the Klamath Tribes have no ability to determine how Tribal  funds can be allocated to Tribal members or other Tribal priorities.  This goes against Tribal sovereignty and is a violation of the  authorities upheld by Federal recognition.   S. 314 will right this wrong by repealing the outdated Klamath Tribe  Judgment Fund Act and restoring the Tribe's ability to exercise its  sovereign authority over its own Tribal judgment funds.   I thank Senator Merkley and Representative Schrader for introducing  this important piece of legislation and supporting the Tribe in its  lengthy quest for a remedy.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to  the gentlewoman from New Mexico (Ms. Leger Fernandez), the chair of the  Subcommittee for Indigenous Peoples of the United States.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.  [[Page H9677]]     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 789) to repeal certain obsolete laws relating to Indians.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                   S. 789         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

(4) The first section of the Act of March 3, 1875 (18 Stat.       424, chapter 132; 25 U.S.C. 129), is amended under the       heading ``CHEYENNES AND ARAPAHOES.'' by striking ``; that the       Secretary of the Interior be authorized to withhold, from any       tribe of Indians who may hold any captives other than       Indians, any moneys due them from the United States until       said captives shall be surrendered to the lawful authorities       of the United States''.        (5) Section 2087 of the Revised Statutes (25 U.S.C. 130) is       repealed.        (6) Section 3 of the Act of March 3, 1875 (18 Stat. 449,       chapter 132; 25 U.S.C. 137), is repealed.        (7) Section 2101 of the Revised Statutes (25 U.S.C. 138) is       repealed.        (8) Section 7 of the Act of June 23, 1879 (21 Stat. 35,       chapter 35; 25 U.S.C. 273), is repealed.        (9) The first section of the Act of March 3, 1893 (27 Stat.       612, chapter 209), is amended--        (A) under the heading ``MISCELLANEOUS SUPPORTS.'' (27 Stat.       628; 25 U.S.C. 283), by striking the last 2 undesignated       paragraphs; and        (B) under the heading ``FOR SUPPORT OF SCHOOLS.'' (27 Stat.       635; 25 U.S.C. 283), by striking the second undesignated       paragraph.        (10) Section 18 of the Act of June 30, 1913 (38 Stat. 96,       chapter 4; 25 U.S.C. 285), is amended by striking the tenth       undesignated paragraph.        (11) The Act of June 21, 1906 (34 Stat. 325, chapter 3504),       is amended under the heading ``commissioner.'' under the       heading ``I. GENERAL PROVISIONS.'' (34 Stat. 328; 25 U.S.C.       302) by striking the fourth undesignated paragraph.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of S. 789, the Repealing  Existing Substandard Provisions Encouraging Conciliation with Tribes  Act, introduced by Senator Rounds of South Dakota. Here in the House,  the bill is led by my friend and colleague, Representative O'Halleran.   This bill would repeal 11 antiquated Federal laws that pertain to  American Indians and Alaska Natives.   As this body is well aware, Federal Indian law has existed since the  foundation of the United States, and it governs the relationship  between the Federal Government, American Indians, and Alaska Natives.   The policies and principles of Federal Indian law have undergone many  transformations throughout American history, as it was once the policy  of the Federal Government to commit violence and forced displacement  against Tribal communities.   Although the Federal Indian laws of today are better at upholding the  principles of Tribal self-determination and sovereignty, many laws that  reflect the prior Federal policy during the eras of genocide, removal,  assimilation, or termination still remain as law.   S. 789 will address this concern by repealing 11 outdated statutes,  many of which pertain to the colonial and Indian boarding school eras.   I thank Senator Rounds and Representative O'Halleran for introducing  this legislation and ensuring that the Federal law reflects the respect  that we hold for Indian Country.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1645     Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to  the gentlewoman from New Mexico (Ms. Leger Fernandez).    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 1466), to authorize the Director of the United States  Geological Survey to establish a regional program to assess, monitor,  and benefit the hydrology of saline lakes in the Great Basin and the  migratory birds and other wildlife dependent on those habitats, and for  other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 1466         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 1466, introduced by Senator Jeff  Merkley and led in the House by my colleague, Representative Blake  Moore.   This bill will direct the U.S. Geological Survey to establish a  program to assess and monitor the hydrology of saline lakes and  associated ecosystems in the Great Basin States in the West.   Saline lakes in the Western United States are shrinking and becoming  saltier due to prolonged drought and other effects of climate change.  These shrinking lakes are exposing harmful dust that threatens the  public health of neighboring communities while harming local economies  and eliminating essential migratory bird habitat.   This program will help inform and support coordinated management and  conservation actions to benefit saline lakes.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I join with my colleague in urging support  of the legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2551) to designate and adjust certain lands in the State of  Utah as components of the National Wilderness  [[Page H9679]]  Preservation System, and for other purposes.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2551, introduced by our  colleague, Representative   John Curtis.   This bill will adjust management boundaries to allow the advancement  of the Bonneville Shoreline Trail, while also designating nearby U.S.  Forest Service land for permanent protection.   The Bonneville Shoreline Trail is a regional multiuse concept trail  that will stretch 280 miles from the Idaho border to Nephi, Utah.  Currently, more than 90 miles of the trail have been built.   Certain areas of the trail are currently impeded, preventing hikers  and cyclists from enjoying the full scope of recreational opportunities  it is meant to offer.   While advancement of the trail will expand access to recreation in  two of Utah's most populated counties and ensure that local residents  and visitors can take advantage of the trail for years to come, which,  of course, is a good thing, it is my understanding that this particular  proposal has also been part of a broader discussion known as the  Mountain Accord that is designed to deal with a number of regional  transportation and land-use planning issues.   I encourage the local stakeholders to keep working on that plan to  solve ongoing issues and advance even more meaningful conservation  protections for the Wasatch Mountains.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I urge support of the legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5715) to reauthorize the Morris K. Udall and Stewart L.  Udall Trust Fund, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5715         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. FUNDING REAUTHORIZATION.         Section 13 of the Morris K. Udall and Stewart L. Udall       Foundation Act (20 U.S.C. 5609) is amended--        (1) by striking ``through 2023'' each place it appears and       inserting ``through 2029'';        (2) in subsection (b)(1), by striking ``$1,000'' and       inserting ``$5,000''; and        (3) in subsection (c), by striking ``the fiscal year in       which this subsection is enacted'' and inserting ``fiscal       year 2022''.

AUDIT OF THE FOUNDATION.         ``Not later than 4 years after the date of enactment of       this section, the Inspector General of the Department of the       Interior shall conduct an audit of the Morris K. Udall and       Stewart L. Udall Foundation.''.       SEC. 3. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of my legislation, H.R. 5715,  which will authorize the Morris K. Udall and Stewart L. Udall Trust  Fund.   Congress established the Udall Foundation in 1992 as an independent  executive branch agency to honor Morris K. Udall's lasting impact on  the Nation's environment, public lands, natural resources, and his  support for the rights and self-governance of Native Americans and  Alaska Natives.   In 2009, Congress enacted legislation to honor Stewart L. Udall and  add his name to the name of the foundation.   The agency is headquartered in Tucson, Arizona, and maintains an  additional office in Washington, D.C.   The Udall Foundation accomplishes its mission through five major  programs.   The important one is the John S. McCain III National Center for  Environmental Conflict Resolution, which provides impartial  collaboration, consensus building, and conflict resolution services on  a wide range of environmental, natural, and cultural resources, Tribal  and public lands issues involving the Federal Government.   In addition, the foundation runs numerous graduate, intern, and focus  programs for Native American and Alaska Natives throughout the country,  of which many here in Congress have benefited from those internships  and fellowships within committees and in individual offices.   I thank the 13 members of the board of directors of the Udall  Foundation for their support, the Council on Environmental Quality for  their support, and urge consideration and support for the legislation.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                           House of Representatives,                                Committee on Education and Labor,                                   Washington, DC, December 2, 2022.      Hon. Raul Grijalva,      Chair, Committee on Natural Resources,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chair Grijalva: I write concerning H.R. 5715, a bill       to reauthorize the Morris K. Udall and Stewart L. Udall Trust       Fund, and for other purposes. There are certain provisions in       the legislation that fall within the Rule X jurisdiction of       the Committee on Education and Labor.        In the interest of permitting your committee to proceed       expeditiously to floor consideration of this important bill,       I am willing to waive this committee's right to sequential       referral. I do so with the understanding that by waiving       consideration of the bill, the Committee on Education and       Labor does not waive any future jurisdictional claim over the       subject matters contained in the bill which fall within its       Rule X jurisdiction. I request that you urge the Speaker to       name members of the Education and Labor Committee to any       conference committee which is named to consider such       provisions.        Please place this letter into the committee report on H.R.       5715 and into the Congressional Record during consideration       of the measure on the House floor. Thank you for the       cooperative spirit in which you have worked regarding this       matter and others between our respective committees.            Sincerely,                                         Robert C. ``Bobby'' Scott,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                  Committee on Natural Resources,                                   Washington, DC, December 2, 2022.      Hon. Robert C. ``Bobby'' Scott,      Chair, Committee on Education and Labor.      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chair Scott, I write to you concerning H.R. 5715, a       bill to reauthorize the  [[Page H9681]]       Morris K. Udall and Stewart L. Udall Trust Fund, and for       other purposes.        I appreciate your willingness to work cooperatively on this       legislation. I recognize that the bill contains provisions       that fall within the jurisdiction of the Committee on       Education and Labor. I acknowledge that your Committee will       not formally consider H.R. 5715 and agree that the inaction       of your Committee with respect to the bill does not waive any       future jurisdictional claim over the matters contained in the       bill that fall within your Committee's Rule X jurisdiction. I       am pleased to support your request that the Speaker name       members of the Committee on Education and Labor to any       conference committee to consider such provisions.        I will ensure that our exchange of letters is included in       the committee report on H.R. 5444 and the Congressional       Record during floor consideration of the bill. I appreciate       your cooperation regarding this legislation and look forward       to continuing to work with you as this measure moves through       the legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                  Raul M. Grijalva,                          Chair, House Natural Resources Committee.     Madam Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to  the gentlewoman from New Mexico (Ms. Leger Fernandez), the chair of the  subcommittee.    Madam Speaker, I, as well, would like to thank my  colleagues across the aisle for their thoughtful and important  suggestions to the legislation. I am happy to incorporate them. Their  suggestions make the program healthier and stronger, and I appreciate  that.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 6427) to amend the Red River National Wildlife Refuge Act to  modify the boundary of the Red River National Wildlife Refuge, and for  other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 6427         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Red River National Wildlife       Refuge Boundary Modification Act''.       SEC. 2. RED RIVER NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE BOUNDARY                     MODIFICATION.         Section 3(a)(1) of the Red River National Wildlife Refuge       Act (Public Law 106-300; 114 Stat. 1055) is amended by       striking ``map entitled `Red River National Wildlife Refuge--      Selection Area', dated September 5, 2000'' and inserting       ``map entitled `Red River National Wildlife Refuge       Acquisition Boundary' and dated March 21, 2022''.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   H.R. 6427, the Red River National Wildlife Refuge Boundary  Modification Act will amend the Red River National Wildlife Refuge  acquisition boundary, which is the area from which more land can be  added to the refuge.   This amendment will allow for 3,300 acres of land to be conveyed to  the refuge system.   The Red River National Wildlife Refuge runs through parts of the Red  River Valley in northwestern Louisiana. Each year, approximately 80,000  waterfowl visit the 50,000-acre refuge for feeding and resting. Over  200 species of neotropical migratory songbirds also stop at the refuge.   The expansion will support migratory birds throughout their annual  life cycle of breeding, wintering, and migrating. It will also provide  additional economic benefits to the region through partnerships with  local farmers and increased public access for outdoor recreationists.   Madam Speaker, I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for  their work on this important legislation. I urge a ``yes'' vote, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I have no requests for time. We are  prepared to close, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I join with my colleague in urging  adoption of this good legislation. I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 7496) to direct the Secretary of the Interior to install a  plaque at the peak of Ram Head in the Virgin Islands National Park on  St. John, United States Virgin Islands, to commemorate the slave  rebellion that began on St. John in 1733.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 7496         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. INSTALLATION OF PLAQUE COMMEMORATING SLAVE                     REBELLION ON ST. JOHN.         (a) In General.--Not later than 1 year after the date of       the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of the Interior       shall install, in an appropriate location in the area of the       Ram Head trail at the peak of Ram Head in the Virgin Islands       National Park on St. John, United States Virgin Islands, a       suitable plaque to commemorate the slave rebellion that began       on St. John on November 23, 1733.        (b) Contents of Plaque.--The plaque installed under       subsection (a) shall include information regarding--        (1) important facts about the slave rebellion that began on       St. John in 1733;        (2) the collective suicide that occurred during the slave       rebellion in the vicinity of Ram Head on St. John in 1734;       and        (3) the significance of the slave rebellion to the history       of St. John, the United States Virgin Islands, and the United       States.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 7496, introduced by my  colleague, Representative Stacey Plaskett.   This bill will direct the Secretary of the Interior to install a  plaque at the peak of Ram Head in the Virgin Islands National Park to  commemorate the slave rebellion that began in St. John in 1733.   The slave insurrection on St. John is the first time in which  enslaved people successfully took control of a colony, and it served as  a spark to later slave revolts that would take place. After half a year  of fighting, opposition troops defeated the uprising in St. John.   As a last cry for freedom, the last remaining slave rebels died by  suicide by drowning themselves at Ram Head in a collective act of  defiance. Installing a commemorative plaque in the Virgin Islands  National Park will honor the sacrifices of the rebels and ensure that  visitors who hike to the top of Ram Head learn and reflect on this  powerful history.   I thank my colleague, Representative Plaskett, for introducing this  legislation, championing this bill on behalf of her constituents.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes,'' and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I urge adoption of the legislation, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 7952) ``to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to issue  a right-of-way permit with respect to a natural gas distribution  pipeline within Valley Forge National Historical Park, and for other  purposes'', as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 7952         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Valley Forge Park       Realignment Permit and Promise Act''.       SEC. 2. RIGHT-OF-WAY PERMIT FOR NATURAL GAS DISTRIBUTION MAIN                     SEGMENT AT VALLEY FORGE NHP.         (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of       law, the Secretary may issue a right-of-way permit pursuant       to part 14 of title 36, Code of Federal Regulations (as in       effect on the date of the enactment of this Act), for the       covered main segment if the covered main segment is relocated       to a proposed realignment of Valley Forge Park Road and North       Gulph Road within the Park.        (b) Scope of Authority.--The authority to grant a right-of-      way permit under subsection (a) shall apply only to the       covered main segment and shall not apply to any other part of       the natural gas distribution main system or any other       pipeline system within the Park.        (c) Definitions.--In this section:        (1) Covered main segment.--The term ``covered main       segment'' means the portions of the natural gas distribution       main (including all appurtenances used in the operation of       such main) within the Park--        (A) existing on the date of the enactment of this Act; and        (B) that are located under, along, or adjacent to the       segments of North Gulph Road and Valley Forge Park Road       (SR3039 and SR0023 respectively, as those roads were aligned       on January 21, 2022) that are between--        (i) the intersection of North Gulph Road with Richards       Road; and        (ii) a point on Valley Forge Park Road located 500 feet       northwest of its intersection with County Line Road.        (2) Park.--The term ``Park'' means Valley Forge National       Historical Park.        (3) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary       of the Interior.       SEC. 3. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 7952, introduced by my  colleague Representative Madeleine Dean. As part of a broader effort to  develop and enhance the area around Valley Forge National Historical  Park, the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation is working to  realign and repave a road that runs through the park's entrance.   This bill will allow the movement of a natural gas pipeline segment  from its current position at the entrance of the park to a new roadbed  being constructed east of the current road.   If the pipeline is not permitted to move, the project could be  further delayed costing time and resources. Moving the pipeline will  also allow for the creation of a new trail connection, which will  better allow people to reach and enjoy Valley Forge.   I thank my colleague Representative Dean for introducing this  legislation on behalf of her constituents.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the bill, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to  the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. Dean).    Madam Speaker, I urge adoption of the legislation. And  as Representative Dean said, I thank the sponsors of the legislation.  One small thing that only Congress can do in this particular instance  affects not only the utilization of this park but makes the situation  safer for everyone involved and less expensive, and I thank her for her  foresight.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
