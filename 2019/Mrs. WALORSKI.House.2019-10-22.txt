 Madam Speaker, I rise today because what we are  witnessing is unprecedented in the history of this country. House  Democratic leaders are conducting an impeachment inquiry behind closed  doors with selective leaks instead of transparency, with no due process  and without a vote on the House floor.   Why do they want to keep this process hidden from view? Because they  know the American people will see right through this partisan scheme.   Democrats decided to impeach this President the day he took office.  Now they are just trying to come up with a reason, no matter what the  facts are.   The American people know that Washington is broken, and they sent us  here to fix it. Instead, House Democrats are shaking the people's trust  in this institution.   We should be passing USMCA to give our farmers and workers a better  deal.   We should be voting on bipartisan legislation to lower prescription  drug costs.   We should be working to fix our immigration system and secure the  border.   Madam Speaker, it is time to end this charade and get back to work.                            ____________________
