 Mr. President, I rise today in support of H.R. 3055, which  includes the fiscal year 2020 Transportation, Housing and Urban  Development, and Related Agencies, or the T-HUD, Appropriations bill. I  have worked closely with Chairman Collins, and I want to salute her for  her excellent work and her leadership. This is a bipartisan bill, which  includes key investments in transportation and housing infrastructure.   It has not been an easy job, but Senator Collins' leadership and her  thoughtful approach and our collaboration, I think, have helped us  present a bill to the U.S. Senate which is more than worthy of support.   While the budget agreement provided a 4 percent increase to our  allocation, we actually have $1 billion less in spending power compared  to 2019 due to declines in offsetting collections and increased costs  for renewals in HUD's rental assistance program.   Working together and with the input of most Senators, we were able to  put together a solid bill that earned unanimous support in the  committee. While we were challenged in developing this bipartisan bill,  other subcommittees have faced an impossible task as the majority  caters to the President's demands for a border wall and places no  guardrails to prevent the diversion of defense funds to pay for it.   This is the same issue that resulted in the President's 35-day  shutdown of the Federal Government between December and January. I hope  the President will heed the majority leader's axiom that ``there is no  education in the second kick of a mule'' and avoid a rerun of this  brinkmanship.   The minibus package before us is a good start to a process that will  hopefully deliver final bills to the President's desk before  Thanksgiving. The T-HUD bill included in this package provides critical  funding to repair our bridges, roads, and transit systems in order to  improve the safety, reliability, and efficiency of our transportation  networks. These investments will support economic growth, create jobs,  and help to address our deferred maintenance backlog across all  transportation sectors.   It rejects the President's proposal to cut Amtrak funding in half and  phase out long-distance passenger service. Instead, we provide $2  billion for Amtrak, which will allow it to initiate the Northeast  corridor fleet replacement, deploy additional safety technology, and  invest in bridge and tunnel replacement projects.   The T-HUD bill also prioritizes funding for aviation safety in order  to strengthen the safety inspector workforce and enable the Department  of Transportation and the FAA to address identified weaknesses in  aircraft certification process. Chairman Collins and I have  consistently worked to support FAA's safety mission, often exceeding  the budget request each year to accomplish that.   We have been disturbed by many of the official findings and  unofficial reports concerning the 737 MAX certification and the culture  at the FAA. As the FAA reassesses its aviation safety performance and  priorities in response to the findings of the inspector general, the  National Transportation Safety Board, and other inquiries, we will work  to adjust funding to assist the agency in fully executing all official  recommendations in a timely manner.   I cannot emphasize enough the importance of enacting a full-year T- HUD bill to help address the FAA's safety and operational demands. If  we end up with a yearlong continuing resolution, we will have missed  the opportunity to  [[Page S5953]]  respond based on what we have learned in the aftermath of the  devastating 737 MAX crashes.   It is also important to pass this bill because it upholds our  longstanding commitment to make housing affordable for 5 million low- income families and provides funding for innovative solutions to  address homelessness among the more than half a million Americans who  are without stable housing.   We rejected the President's ill-advised proposals to cut $12 billion  in affordable housing and community and economic development programs  like HOME, CDBG, and Public Housing. These bipartisan programs are  critical components to bridging the gap between stable housing and  homelessness for so many working families.   The bill also continues to invest in programs that prevent veterans'  homelessness by rejecting the administration's proposal to eliminate  the HUD-VASH Program. Instead, we provide $40 million for 1,500 new  housing vouchers to help veterans gain access to safe and stable  housing.   This year, we were able to continue providing record funding to  remediate lead-based paint and other environmental hazards in low- income housing and expand these initiatives to our Nation's public  housing.   I am proud of the bill before us, and I want to work with my  colleagues to consider amendments to make it even better. I encourage  Senators to file amendments as soon as possible so we can continue to  move this process forward.   Before I conclude, let me compliment my colleagues who are managing  the other bills that are included in this minibus package--Commerce,  Justice, Science, Agriculture, and Interior. They have done excellent  work in crafting their bills, supported, as always, by Chairman Shelby  and Vice Chairman Leahy. I hope we can follow their example and move  quickly to complete our work on all 12 appropriations bills before  November 21.   Finally, our efforts were immensely aided and assisted by a strong  and dedicated staff at the T-HUD Committee. I recognize Clare Doherty  for the majority counsel and Dabney Hegg for the minority counsel for  their extraordinary work, which motivated their entire staff to go  above and beyond. That is one of the major reasons today Senator  Collins and I can stand with a very good bill to present to the U.S.  Senate.   With that, Mr. President, I would ask unanimous consent to make a  presentation that was previously scheduled on another topic.    Mr. President, I rise to highlight my concerns about  ongoing Russian information warfare operations against the American  people, including the upcoming 2020 Presidential elections, the lack of  a unified strategy from the administration to counter and deter these  attacks, and steps that must be taken in the near term to be better  prepared in the future.   I will explain how statements by the President soliciting foreign  governments to investigate political rivals for his personal benefit  are part of a disturbing pattern of behavior that reinforces Russian  disinformation narratives and has implications for our national  security and the integrity of our democracy.   It has been almost 3 years since Russia interfered in our democracy  during the 2016 Presidential election with hybrid warfare and malign  influence operations. These hybrid warfare tactics, including  information warfare, which I will focus on today, are not simply  opportunistic meddling by Russia. Russia's purpose is to further its  strategic interests. Russian President Vladimir Putin knows that, for  now, Russia cannot effectively compete with the United States through  conventional military means and win.   Instead, Putin seeks to use tools from his hybrid warfare arsenal to  divide the United States from our allies and partners in the West and  weaken our institutions and open societies from within. By weakening  our democracy, Putin can strengthen Russia's perceived standing  globally and bolster his autocratic grip on power at home.   Similar to the other tools in its hybrid arsenal, Russia has been  developing its information warfare playbook over time, enhancing both  the technical and psychological aspects of these information operations  in capability, sophistication, and boldness. Lessons learned from  previous information warfare campaigns culminated in the attacks the  Kremlin unleashed against the United States during the 2016  Presidential election.   The 2016 information warfare campaign, according to our intelligence  community--in their words--``demonstrated a significant escalation in  directness, level of activity, and scope of effort compared to previous  operations.'' Special Counsel Mueller's report on Russian interference  in the 2016 Presidential election confirmed these assessments and  detailed how the Kremlin used information warfare operations, among  other hybrid warfare tactics in--in the words of the Mueller report-- ``sweeping and systematic fashion.''   The recently released Volume 2 of the bipartisan investigation by the  Senate Intelligence Committee on Russian active measures campaigns and  interference in the 2016 U.S. election affirms both the intelligence  community's assessment from January 2017 and the special counsel's  investigation.   The committee--again, on a bipartisan basis--concluded that, in their  words, ``Russia's targeting of the 2016 U.S. presidential election was  part of a broader, sophisticated, and ongoing information warfare  campaign. . . .''   From these assessments and reports, we have been able to reveal  aspects of the Kremlin's playbook. In the 2018 midterm elections, the  government took steps, in coordination with the social media companies,  to disrupt Kremlin and Kremlin-linked information warfare operations.  As a nation, we have never undertaken a collective examination, as we  did after the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, to understand  what happened and how we should reorganize ourselves, our government,  and our society to prevent it from ever happening again.   To make matters worse, the findings of the special counsel's report,  a detailed accounting of how Kremlin and Kremlin-linked actors attacked  our democracy, have been obfuscated with a partisan spin by President  Trump and his allies. This absence of a comprehensive nonpartisan  assessment and the President's lack of seriousness has implications for  our national security as we prepare for the 2020 elections.   Equally troubling, the President has consciously or unconsciously  embraced themes peddled as part of Russia's information warfare  operations on the campaign trail, while serving as President, including  comments over the summer that our elections are rigged and that there  were illegal votes cast in so-called ``blue'' States.   Not only does the President give the impression that he is unbothered  by this interference of 2016, he appears to be openly asking for help  in 2020 and willing to leverage the power of his office to get that  assistance. You only have to look as far as his phone conversation with  the Ukrainian President where he asked for a favor in return for the  delivery of defensive weapons to counter Russian aggression or the  President publicly inviting China to start an investigation into the  Biden family moments after he discussed trade talks with Beijing and  threatened that ``if they don't do what we want, we have tremendous  power.'' He told the world as much in a June interview with ABC News  when he said that he doesn't see anything wrong with taking help for  his political campaign, including from a foreign adversary. He is  broadcasting to the world that he is willing to throw the interests of  the United States overboard if it means helping with his reelection  prospects.   These statements also have the intended or unintended effect of  furthering Russian disinformation campaigns, including that our  democracy is corrupt or fraudulent. These incidents and others I will  discuss today are part of a troubling pattern of behavior and must be  called out for what they are. They are wrong.   The President's troubling behavior, coupled with his inability or  unwillingness to lead an effective policy to counter and deter this  type of malign foreign influence, is to the peril of our national  security and the integrity of our democracy. We cannot allow this  course to continue uncorrected.   In order to further understand these dynamics and what to do to  counter  [[Page S5954]]  them, I will highlight three aspects of the Russian information warfare  playbook that we can anticipate will be deployed in 2020. The first  aspect is supporting candidates likely to advance Kremlin strategic  interests; the second aspect is undermining the credibility of the  elections; and the third aspect is the recruiting of local surrogates  to wittingly or unwittingly advance the Kremlin's agenda.   For each aspect, I will also explain how the Trump campaign,  wittingly or not, embraced that tactic. I will then offer four  recommendations for near-term steps to defend ourselves from foreign  adversaries who seek to interfere with our fundamental institutions.   A central objective of Russian election interference efforts is  supporting candidates that advance Kremlin strategic interests. For the  2016 Presidential election, Russia assessed that a Trump Presidency  would advance their interests, and Kremlin and Kremlin-linked actors  deployed information warfare and malign influence campaigns to aid  then-Candidate Trump.   The intelligence community unanimously assessed in January 2017-- again in their words--``Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016  aimed at the U.S. Presidential election to denigrate Secretary Clinton  and harm her electability and potential Presidency. Putin and the  Russian government developed a clear preference for President-elect  Trump.''   The recent report by the Senate Intelligence Committee--again, on a  bipartisan basis--arrived at the even stronger conclusion that the  Kremlin-linked troll organization's ``social media activity was overtly  and almost invariably supportive of then candidate Trump, and to the  detriment of Secretary Clinton's campaign.''   Similarly, the special counsel's report confirmed that Russian  operations aimed to bolster their favored candidate, concluding that  ``[t]he Russian government perceived it would benefit from a Trump  Presidency and worked to secure that outcome.'' The report described in  detail how Russia's two main information warfare operations--the  manipulation of social media and the hacking and dissemination of  stolen information--``favored Presidential candidate Donald J. Trump  and disparaged Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.''   With regard to the manipulation of social media, the February 2018  indictment by the special counsel of the Kremlin-linked troll  organization, commonly known as the Internet Research Agency, provided  additional evidence of how operations aimed to bolster specific  candidates. The indictment showed Kremlin-linked trolls were instructed  to ``use any opportunity to criticize Hillary and the rest (except  Sanders and Trump--we support them).''   The other main Russian information warfare effort was carried out by  the Russian military intelligence units, or GRU, which stole private  information and disseminated it, including on social media, to damage  Secretary Clinton.   The Senate Intelligence Committee's recent report confirmed this  tactic, assessing that ``information acquired by the committee from  intelligence oversight, social media companies, the special counsel's  investigative findings, and research by the commercial cyber security  companies all reflect the Russian government's use of GRU to carry out  another vector of attack on the 2016 election: the dissemination of  hacked materials.''   One of the ways that the GRU was able to amplify its ability to  disseminate the hacked material was by collaborating with WikiLeaks.  The special counsel's report found that ``in order to expand its  interference in the 2016 presidential election, the GRU units  transferred many of the documents they stole from the [Democratic  National Committee, or the] DNC, and the chairman of the Clinton  campaign to WikiLeaks.''   It must be noted that the special counsel, as well as our  intelligence community, have established that the organization  WikiLeaks was not just acting as an unwitting stooge for the Russians.  WikiLeaks had a role in the amplification of these information warfare  operations. The special counsel's indictment from July of 2018 stated  that GRU officers, posing as the fake persona Guccifer 2.0 ``discussed  the release of the stolen documents and the timing of those releases''  with WikiLeaks ``to heighten their impact on the 2016 Presidential  election.'' The special counsel's report further described how ``as  reports attributing the DNC and DCCC hacks to the Russian Government  emerged, WikiLeaks and [WikiLeaks founder Julian] Assange made several  public statements designed to obscure the source of the materials that  WikiLeaks was releasing.'' The weaponization of this information stolen  by the GRU units through WikiLeaks was an important aspect of the  Kremlin's support to then-Candidate Trump and heightened the impact of  these operations against our elections.   The special counsel's report detailed a third line of effort to  advance Russia's preferred candidate. The information warfare campaigns  were conducted in coordination with outreach to the Trump campaign from  Kremlin and Kremlin-linked individuals. These overtures included  ``offers of assistance to the [Trump] campaign.'' That is a quote from  the special counsel's report.   In contrast, the special counsel's office found no parallel efforts  of assistance directed toward Secretary Clinton's Presidential campaign  and, in fact, found the opposite. With regard to the manipulation of  social media by Kremlin-linked trolls, the special counsel's report  stated that ``by February 2016 internal [Internet Research Agency]  documents referred to support for the Trump Campaign and opposition to  candidate Clinton,'' and further states that ``throughout 2016 the  [Internet Research Agency] accounts published an increasing number of  materials supporting the Trump Campaign and opposing the Clinton  Campaign.'' The special counsel's February 2018 indictment of the  Internet Research Agency described additional efforts to oppose the  Clinton campaign, including information warfare campaigns across social  media platforms designed to peel off certain groups that are  traditionally identified as reliable Democratic Party voters. The  indictment stated: ``In or around the latter half of 2016, the  [Internet Research Agency] began to encourage U.S. minority groups not  to vote in the 2016 U.S. presidential election or to vote for a third  party presidential candidate.'' The recent Senate Intelligence  Committee report also affirmed this finding, concluding that no single  group was targeted more than African Americans.   Let me emphasize again that this Senate report was a bipartisan  effort.   President Putin all but confirmed support for the Trump campaign  while standing next to the President in July of 2018 at the Helsinki  Summit. When asked by the press if he wanted Trump to win the election  and whether he directed any Kremlin officials to help with these  efforts, Putin replied: ``Yes, I did, because he talked about bringing  the U.S. Russia relationship back to normal.'' I think in this  instance--and I think it is rare--we should take Putin's word for it.   Equally disturbing, the special counsel provided significant evidence  that President Trump and his associates embraced, encouraged, and  applauded Russian support. The special counsel's report definitively  concludes that Russia saw its interests as aligned with and served by a  Trump Presidency, that the central purpose of the Russian interference  operations was helping the Trump campaign, and that the Trump campaign  anticipated benefiting from the fruits of that foreign election  interference.   The special counsel's report detailed evidence showing how Trump  embraced Russian information warfare campaigns that sought to help him  and damage his opponent. The evidence is overwhelming that the Trump  campaign encouraged this interference in the Presidential campaign,  even as it became increasingly apparent that Russia was behind these  attacks on our democracy.   One example of embracing Kremlin and Kremlin-linked help is Trump  campaign associates, including the President's son-in-law and then- campaign chairman, meeting with Russian agents in the hopes of getting  dirt on Secretary Clinton. The email to set up the meeting to Donald  Trump, Jr., held the Kremlin's intentions plain as day. The offer was,  and I quote, ``to provide the Trump campaign with some official  documents and information that would  [[Page S5955]]  incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be useful to  your father'' as ``part of Russia and its government's support for Mr.  Trump.'' Trump Junior embraced this offer and responded that, quote,  ``if it's what you say, I love it.'' I think that response from the  President's son speaks for itself.   Yet another example of this behavior was the Trump campaign's  promotion of WikiLeaks releases of information stolen by GRU. The  special counsel's investigation showed that ``the Presidential campaign  showed interest in the WikiLeaks releases of documents and welcomed  their potential damage to candidate Clinton.''   On June 14, 2016, the Washington Post reported that ``Russian  government hackers'' were behind the hacking of the DNC and DCCC. So it  was likely that as of mid-June of 2016 the Trump campaign had a good  idea that the stolen information distributed by WikiLeaks about the DNC  was stolen by Russia. The Mueller report described that ``by the late  summer of 2016, the Trump Campaign was planning a press strategy, a  communications campaign and messaging based on the possible release of  Clinton emails by WikiLeaks.'' By October 7, the Department of Homeland  Security and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence issued  a joint statement naming the WikiLeaks disclosures as ``consistent with  the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts'' to influence  public opinion and were ``intended to interfere with the U.S. election  process.'' If not prior to the release of that joint statement,  certainly by that point, the President's campaign should have known  better. Instead, they appeared willing to embrace the Russian  information warfare campaigns aimed at damaging their opponent.   The special counsel's January indictment of longtime Trump associate  Roger Stone further details how Trump associates sought information  about WikiLeaks releases of stolen materials intended to damage  Secretary Clinton. That indictment stated: ``A senior Trump campaign  official was directed to contact Stone about any additional releases  and . . . other damaging information [WikiLeaks] had regarding the  Clinton campaign.'' That indictment also showed that on October 7,  2016--a half-hour after the joint statement by DHS and ODNI that  WikiLeaks was part of Russia's operation to interfere with U.S.  Presidential elections--WikiLeaks disseminated the first set of emails  from Clinton chairman John Podesta. In response to those releases, ``an  associate of the high-ranking Trump campaign official sent a text  message to Stone that read `well done.' '' Trump campaign associates  applauded the actions by WikiLeaks, which Trump's then-CIA Director  later labeled ``a non-state hostile intelligence service often abetted  by state actors like Russia.'' Instead of calling the FBI, the campaign  celebrated. In the last month of the campaign alone, the President  publicly boasted of his love of WikiLeaks at least 124 times.    Embracing WikiLeaks is not the only example of the President's  problematic embrace of Russian information warfare operations. The  President appears to have welcomed the GRU's hacking operation and its  intention to damage his opponent's candidacy. On July 27, 2016, Trump  announced publicly during a press conference:         Russia, if you are listening, I hope you're able to find       the 30,000 emails that are missing. I think you will be       rewarded mightily by our press.    The special counsel's report confirmed that the GRU tried to assist  Trump with those efforts, finding that ``within approximately five  hours of Trump's statement, GRU officers targeted for the first time  Clinton's personal office.''   This call for Russia to hack his political opponent and find her so- called deleted emails was not an isolated remark or sarcasm, as the  President likes to say. The special counsel's report detailed that  during the same period:         Trump asked individuals affiliated with his campaign to       find the deleted emails. Michael Flynn . . . recalled that       Trump made this request repeatedly and Flynn subsequently       contacted multiple people in an effort to obtain the emails.    Further, as described in the special counsel's report, one of the  people General Flynn contacted to obtain Secretary Clinton's alleged  deleted emails claimed that he had organized meetings with parties whom  he believed ``had ties and affiliations with Russia,'' though the  special counsel's investigation was not able to establish that Flynn's  contacts interacted with Kremlin-linked hackers. As Brookings  Institution senior fellow Benjamin Wittes laid out in April, Trump  ``not only called publicly on the Russians to deliver the dirt on his  opponent but he also privately ordered his campaign to seek the  material out . . . knowing . . . that Russia would or might be the  source.''   As I mentioned earlier, the special counsel was not able to find  sufficient evidence to prove that the Trump campaign's embracing of  Kremlin or Kremlin-linked operations constituted a crime beyond a  reasonable doubt, but, clearly, the special counsel established a  breadth of episodes where Trump embraced Russian operations in support  of the campaign. Maybe those acts don't meet a criminal standard, but  there are significant implications for this behavior. For instance, is  it OK for a candidate to get elected President or elected to any public  office by capitalizing on information stolen by a foreign adversary?  Will that be acceptable the next time around? Will foreign campaigns  targeting our elections be accepted as normal from now on? The actions  of President Trump indicate, unfortunately, that it is acceptable and  even welcome, and that is to the detriment of our national security and  the integrity of our democracy.   I would like now to highlight a second aspect of the Kremlin's  playbook, operations to denigrate the legitimacy of U.S. elections and  democratic processes in general. The January 2017 intelligence  community assessment found that one of the main objectives of the  Kremlin-ordered election interference campaign was to undermine the  American public's faith in our electoral system. The intelligence  community's assessed in January 2017: ``When it appeared to Moscow that  Secretary Clinton was likely to win the presidency, the Russian  influence campaign focused more on undercutting Secretary Clinton's  legitimacy . . . including by impugning the fairness of the election.''  The intelligence community's assessment further stated that ``Pro- Kremlin bloggers had prepared a Twitter campaign, #DemocracyRIP, on  election night in anticipation of Secretary Clinton's victory.''   The special counsel's work confirmed the intelligence community's  assessment. The Mueller report showed significant evidence of how the  Kremlin-linked troll organization the Internet Research Agency deployed  information operations around the theme that the election was rigged,  fraudulent, or otherwise corrupt. The special counsel's indictment of  Internet Research Agency officials from February 2018 stated:  ``Starting in or around the summer of 2016, [the Kremlin-linked troll  organization] also began to promote allegations of voter fraud by the  Democratic Party through their fictitious U.S. personas and groups on  social media.'' The Kremlin-linked troll organization purchased  advertisements on Facebook to further promote allegations of vote  rigging, including ads promoting a Facebook post that charged ``Hillary  Clinton has already committed voter fraud during the Democratic Iowa  Caucus.'' Other examples include posts that voter fraud allegations  were being investigated in North Carolina on the Internet Research  Agency's fraudulent Twitter account @TEN_GOP, which claimed to be the  Tennessee Republican Party. Just days before the election, the agency  used the same fraudulent Twitter handle to push the message  ``#VoterFraud by counting tens of thousands of ineligible mail in  Hillary votes being reported in Broward County, Florida.''   Consciously or unconsciously, President Trump also embraced this  tactic from the Russian information warfare playbook and ran with it.  According to a New York Times compilation, Trump tweeted at least 28  times during the 2016 Presidential campaign that the election, the  electoral process, or certain early voting procedures were rigged,  fraudulent, and corrupt. Let me give you a few examples. On August 1,  2016, Trump told a rally in Ohio: ``I'm afraid the election is going to  be rigged, I have to be honest.'' On September 6, 2016, he stated:  ``The only  [[Page S5956]]  way I can lose in my opinion . . . is if cheating goes on . . . go down  to certain areas and study [to] make sure that other people don't come  in and vote five times.'' Multiple press reports indicate that Trump's  campaign website invited supporters to serve as ``Trump election  observers'' to help him ``stop crooked Hilary from rigging the  election.'' At the final debate on October 19, 2016, Trump indicated he  would not necessarily accept the results of the election, instead  saying he would ``look at it at that time,'' alleging ``millions of  people'' on the voter rolls ``shouldn't be registered to vote.''    At an Ohio rally the next day, Trump alleged that Secretary Clinton  ``is a candidate who is truly capable of anything, including voter  fraud.'' On October 21, 2016, Trump told a rally in Pennsylvania:         Remember, folks, it is a rigged system. That's why you've       got to get out and vote. You've got to watch. Because this       system is totally rigged.    In these instances and others, Trump furthered the Kremlin's  disinformation campaign by embracing and promoting the themes that our  democratic system was rigged. As New Yorker journalist Jonathan Blitzer  observed at that time, ``Trump has taken . . . [the voter fraud]  concept to the extreme: trying to delegitimize a national election even  while campaigning for the presidency.''   It is wildly irresponsible to push conspiracy theories that threaten  the integrity of our democratic system without any evidence. It is  wrong when a candidate for President pushes conspiracy theories that  advance a central theme of the Russian information warfare campaign  that our electoral system is ``rigged'' and aids key strategic  objectives of the Kremlin. These tactics also undermine the American  public's faith in our electoral system and strengthen Putin's position  in the strategic competition between the United States and Russia. It  is unpatriotic and cannot be accepted as part of our democracy and open  society.   The mere idea that our entire election system would be attacked by  the Russians to delegitimize it, and then to have those efforts echoed  by the President does a huge disservice to the American public. If the  American public does not have faith in the integrity of our electoral  system, then we have profoundly lost a fundamental principle of our  government that thousands of Americans have defended over years and  years of effort. Our elections have to be protected. They can't be  denigrated. The denigration that we saw was outrageous.   These two aspects of the Kremlin's playbook are supported by a third  aspect--the recruitment and exploitation of local surrogates. This  process was described in an amicus brief from December 2017 filed  against President Trump by former national security officials,  including Director of National Intelligence Clapper, CIA and NSA  Director Hayden, CIA Director Brennan, and Acting CIA Director Morell.  The brief stated:         The Russian Government continues to use local actors in a       number of ways, [including] to get closer to a target       (especially one who would be hesitant to offer assistance to       Russian operatives directly), or manipulate a target to suit       their needs. They use these agents to probe individual       targets to see if they might be open to relationships or       blackmail. And they recruit individuals within a country to       help them understand how to appeal to U.S. populations and       target and shape the contours of disinformation campaigns.    The recent Senate Intelligence Committee report affirmed these  tactics, explaining: ``Russian backed trolls pushing disinformation  have also sought to connect with and potentially coopt individuals to  take action in the real world.''   The special counsel's report described how the Kremlin and Kremlin- linked actors deployed these tactics in the United States to interfere  in the 2016 election, including:         As early as 2014, the [Internet Research Agency] instructed       its employees to target U.S. persons to advance its       operational goals. Initially, recruitment focused on U.S.       persons who could amplify content posted by the [Internet       Research Agency].    However, the activities that the Kremlin-troll agency, wittingly or  unwittingly, used Americans for grew over time to include assistance  with organizing pro-Trump rallies and demonstrations. The special  counsel's related indictment of the Internet Research Agency officials  stated that by late August 2016, the Internet Research Agency had an  internal list ``of over 100 real U.S. persons contacted through  [Internet Research Agency]-controlled false U.S. persona accounts and  tracked to monitor recruitment efforts and requests.'' These efforts to  exploit local surrogates included two different types of interactions  with the Trump campaign according to the special counsel--reposting  Kremlin-linked troll content from social media and requests for  assistance with organizing political rallies.   This aspect of the Kremlin playbook--recruitment and exploitation of  local surrogates--was also embraced, consciously or unconsciously, by  the President and his inner circle. The special counsel's report  detailed how Trump's family and campaign associates retweeted Kremlin- linked troll organization posts, amplifying a foreign adversary's  information warfare campaign against our Presidential election. The  special counsel found: ``Posts from the [Internet Research Agency]- controlled Twitter account @TEN_GOP were cited or retweeted by multiple  Trump campaign officials and surrogates, including Donald J. Trump Jr,  Eric Trump, Kellyanne Conway, Brad Parscale, and Michael T. Flynn.''  The posts these campaign surrogates cited or retweeted included two  other aspects of the information warfare campaign--accusations to  damage Secretary Clinton's campaign and allegations of voter fraud.   With regards to this aspect, as well, the special counsel did not  conclude there was enough evidence to establish that the embrace and  amplification of these information warfare operations was willful  coordination by the Trump campaign amounting to a criminal conspiracy.  It may well be that the President and the people around him didn't know  that at @TEN_GOP wasn't the Tennessee Republican Party but was, in  fact, Russian trolls thousands of miles away, fraudulently pumping  disinformation into our system. However, it still shows a willingness  to embrace for partisan advantage baseless, unsubstantiated allegations  from unknown sources threatening the very fabric of our democracy-- claims we know now were ginned up by a foreign adversary. It may not be  criminal, but it is incredibly reckless and wrong. It is not the  standard of conduct we should demand from someone seeking political  office and the public trust that goes with that office. Again, this is  part of a troubling pattern of behavior by the President.   Equally important, the election of a President who consciously or  unconsciously embraces the tactics of foreign disinformation operations  has implications for our national security and that of our allies and  partners. As Benjamin Wittes from the Brookings Institution assessed,  that the Internet Research Agency, a Kremlin-linked troll organization,  ``was able to . . . get Trump figures--including Trump himself--to  engage with and promote social-media content as part of a hostile  power's covert efforts to influence the American electorate . . . shows  a troubling degree of vulnerability on the part of the U.S. political  system to outside influence campaigns.    Now, unfortunately, we can anticipate that these aspects of the  playbook will continue and escalate in sophistication and scale in  2020. The 2016 election was not just a one-off operation for the  Kremlin. As then-Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats warned,  Russia's malign activities ``are persistent, they are pervasive, and  they are meant to undermine America's democracy.''   FBI Director Chris Wray also emphasized similar concerns during his  spring speech to the Council on Foreign Relations, stating that the  threat from Russian foreign malign influence ``is not just an election  cycle threat; it's pretty much a 365-days-a-year threat.'' Director  Wray further warned that ``our adversaries are going to keep adapting  and upping their game.''   The intelligence community assessed in January 2017 that the campaign  against us represented a ``new normal'' in Russian influence efforts in  which ``Moscow will apply lessons learned from its campaign aimed at  the U.S. presidential elections to future influence efforts in the U.S.  and worldwide.''  [[Page S5957]]    The recent Senate Intelligence Committee's report concluded that  information warfare attacks in 2016 ``represent only the latest  installment in an increasingly brazen interference by the Kremlin on  citizens and democratic institutions of the United States.'' And  Director Mueller told the House Intelligence Committee in July that  Russian interference ``wasn't a single attempt. They're doing it as we  sit here.''   This interference has only increased in sophistication as the  Russians used lessons learned from tactics developed in the Kremlin  playbook in 2016. We saw Kremlin and Kremlin-linked actors deploy  information warfare campaigns designed to advance their preferred  candidates in the 2018 elections.   An October 2018 Department of Justice indictment from the Eastern  District of Virginia detailed information warfare operations in 2017  and 2018 by the Internet Research Agency leveraged to promote  candidates aligned with President Trump and denigrate candidates  opposed to him, including anti-Trump Republicans. These operations  demonstrated a high level of precision and specificity in messaging for  the Agency's employees to deploy, including references to relevant news  articles and topical items of the day to optimally promote Russia's  candidates and causes of choice.   For example, the indictment cited how managers of the Internet  Research Agency provided employees a news article titled ``Civil War if  Trump Taken Down'' and instructed them to use their fraudulent personas  to ``[n]ame those who oppose the President and those who impede his  efforts to implement his preelection promises.'' One of the targets of  these efforts was anti-Trump Republicans. The trolling instructions  included detailed talking points to deploy over social media platforms,  including ``focus on the fact that the Anti-Trump Republicans: a) drag  their feet with regard to financing the construction of the border  wall; b) are not lowering taxes; c) slander Trump and harm his  reputation (bring up McCain); d) do not want to cancel ObamaCare; e)  are not in a hurry to adopt laws that oppose the refugees coming from  Middle Eastern countries entering this country.''   This information warfare operation was designed to support the  President and detailed a sophisticated campaign deployed against an  unwitting American public by trolls pretending to be fellow citizens.  As national security journalist Natasha Bertrand wrote in The Atlantic  about the 2018 information warfare campaigns detailed in the Eastern  District's indictment, ``[t]he messaging strategy mimicked the  overheated rhetoric . . . that [the Internet Research Agency] employed  to considerable effect during the Presidential election. The partisan-- and at times hateful--comments so artfully mimicked the daily back and  forth on social media that they seemed to be those of real Americans.''   She also observed how these messages supported the President, noting  that ``[a]t times, the messaging copied President Trump's bombast  almost verbatim'' and ``the echo chamber between Trump's election  rhetoric and that of the Russian trolls was striking.''   And the Russian information operations were not limited only to  supporting President Trump. The Eastern District of Virginia indictment  also showed how the Kremlin-linked troll organization worked to advance  Republican challengers of several congressional races through a  fraudulent Twitter account called @CovfefeNationUS, which encouraged  readers to contribute to a political action committee seeking to defeat  incumbent Democratic Senators and Representatives in the 2018 midterm  election. These operations demonstrated a sophisticated understanding  of the American political system.   We also saw evidence from the 2018 midterms of a second tactic from  the Kremlin's playbook that I discussed earlier, attacking the  legitimacy of the election, which is a fundamental attack on the  democracy of this country--the ethic that holds us together. Here, too,  the operation evolved in sophistication. In the same indictment, the  Eastern District of Virginia described information warfare operations  that worked to undermine the legitimacy of the U.S. election, with  specific messages for its employees to disseminate. One example from  the indictment was instructions for the Russian Internet Research  Agency's employees to cite specific online articles on voter fraud. The  Kremlin-linked trolls were told the state in deployed messages:         Remind that the majority of ``blue States'' have no voter       IDs, which suggests that large scale falsifications are bound       to be happening there. . . . Democrats in the coming election       will surely attempt to falsify the results.    The indictment also detailed how these information warfare campaigns  were deployed across multiple platforms, including being pushed out  using multiple fraudulent Twitter accounts to reinforce and amplify  their message.   Finally, we saw the continuation of a third aspect of the Russian  playbook, the recruitment of local surrogates to advance Kremlin  interests with the 2018 election. As the Eastern Virginia's indictment  states, between March 2016 and around July 2017, ``while concealing its  true identity, location, and purpose, the [Kremlin-linked troll  organization] used the false U.S. persona `Helen Christopherson' to  contact individuals and groups in the United States to promote  protests, rallies, and marches, including by funding advertising,  flyers, and rallies and supplies.''   The indictment further details how the Kremlin-linked troll  organization used a different fake persona ``while concealing its true  identity, location, and purpose, to solicit at least one person  presumed to be located in the United States to assist with . . . social  media activities.'' These efforts to recruit surrogates included  posting on and managing content on a fraudulent Facebook page created  specially to further a Russian information warfare campaign.   As we have been warned, these operations will continue to look more  American, and the Kremlin and Kremlin-linked agents will continue to  try to recruit people in the United States to advance Russia's hybrid  operations.   Many of the President's national security officials have warned that  we could see heightened Russian information warfare attacks and other  influence operations in the 2020 elections. Even before the 2018  midterm elections, Christopher Krebs, Homeland Security's Cybersecurity  and Infrastructure Security Agency Director, warned:         The midterm is . . . just the warm-up, or the exhibition       game. . . . The big game, we think, for adversaries is       probably 2020.    FBI Director Wray echoed that assessment, stating this spring that  the ``2018 elections were seen as a dress rehearsal for the big show in  2020`` and that the FBI anticipates the 2020 threat being even more  challenging.   Former Director of National Intelligence Daniel Coats testified to  the Senate Intelligence Committee in late January: ``Moscow may employ  additional influence toolkits--such as spreading disinformation,  conducting hack-and-leak operations, or manipulating data--in a more  targeted fashion to influence U.S. policy, actions, and elections.''   There are several examples which further demonstrate how these  efforts have become more sophisticated and pervasive. In 2016, Russia  disseminated what turned out to be authentic stolen information.  However, just a few months later, during the French Presidential  elections, Kremlin and Kremlin-linked actors disseminated a mix of real  and fake information about Presidential candidate Emmanuel Macron in  order to damage him and bolster their preferred candidate, Marine Le  Pen. So next time foreign adversaries may use a mixture of real and  fake information as part of their influence operations.   We already saw a multi-country, multi-language information warfare  campaign uncovered by the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research  Lab that made use of ``fake accounts, forged documents, and dozens of  online platforms to spread stories that attacked western interests and  unity.''   It may also be harder to discern what is real and what is fake  because it is more likely to look like it is coming from regular  Americans who are concerned about an issue. In February 2018, Russia  expert Heather Conley warned in testimony before the Senate Armed  Services Subcommittee on Cybersecurity that Russian information warfare  campaigns in 2018 and 2020 will adapt and ``look more American, [and]  it will look less Russian.''   In addition, new technologies, including the use of artificial  intelligence  [[Page S5958]]  and deepfake recordings that seem real but are actually doctored or  entirely fabricated, will add an additional layer of complexity and  make it easier for us to fall for these operations. As then-Director of  National Intelligence Dan Coats testified to the Senate Intelligence  Committee in late January, ``Adversaries and strategic competitors  probably will attempt to use deep fakes or similar machine-learning  technologies to create convincing but false image, audio, and video  files to augment influence campaigns directed against the United States  and our allies and partners.''   Despite these assessments by our senior national security officials  and our intelligence community, the voluminous evidence in the special  counsel's indictments and report, additional indictments from the  Department of Justice, and bipartisan reports from the Senate  Intelligence Committee, the President appears unwilling or unable to  recognize the urgency of this national security threat or the need to  immediately implement a comprehensive strategy to counter and deter  Russian hybrid warfare. Instead of alerting Americans to the threat,  the President continues to ignore the analysis of his own intelligence  agencies. Instead of leading efforts to deter foreign adversaries, the  President, with the whole world watching at the July 2019 G20 Osaka  summit, treated election interference as a joke, signaling to Putin  that he would not hold Russia accountable.   This doesn't only apply to past Russian interference in the 2016  election. The President's blind spot when it comes to Russian election  interference is harming our ability to counter future interference. The  New York Times reported in April that former Homeland Security  Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen was told not to bring up the issue with the  President of expected Russian interference in the 2020 election. Acting  Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney said it ``wasn't a great subject and  should be kept below [the President's] level.''   The President's unwillingness to accept Russian interference and his  public statements inviting other countries to interfere in future  elections have created real impediments to formulating a whole-of- government and a whole-of-society strategy to counter and deter Russia  or others from attacking our elections. Despite almost 3 years having  passed since the 2016 election, the White House has not led efforts to  develop a comprehensive strategy to counter foreign election  interference. While, as I mentioned, individual U.S. Departments and  agencies took steps to disrupt Russia in the 2018 midterm elections, no  wholesale strategy to deter and counter these operations appears to  have been implemented for 2020.   Don't just take my word for it. Then-European Commander General  Curtis Scaparrotti, who was on the frontlines in deterring Russia,  testified this spring to the Senate Committee on Armed Services that  U.S. efforts to counter Russian influence operations still lacked  ``effective unification across the interagency.'' Equally troubling was  his assessment that the United States has yet to develop ``a  multifaceted strategy to counter Russia.''   When FBI Director Christopher Wray testified in May before the Senate  Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related  Agencies, he could not identify a lead person who was designated to  coordinate these efforts. This is despite a provision included in the  fiscal year 2019 National Defense Authorization Act requiring the  President to designate an NSC official to be in charge of coordinating  the U.S. Government response to malign foreign influence operations. To  date, no such coordinator has been named. Moreover, the cybersecurity  coordinator at the NSC was dismissed over a year and a half ago, and  that position remains unfilled. So, at the highest levels, we don't  have anyone in charge.   What additional steps can we take right now to protect the American  people against interference campaigns by the Russians and other foreign  adversaries--campaigns we know are coming ahead of the 2020 elections?   In the near term, I believe we must immediately adopt several  measures that would provide additional tools to detect these  information warfare operations and help reduce the American people's  vulnerability to them. We have no time to waste.   First, we must designate the Secretary of Homeland Security, with the  concurrence of the Director of National Intelligence and the FBI  Director, with the responsibility for increasing public vigilance and  reassuring the American people about the legitimacy and validity of our  elections.   This group of senior officials should be organized to detect foreign  interference in our political process and expose malign behavior,  including on social media. In the run-up to the election, this group  must issue monthly public reports--with a classified annex, if  necessary--showing top trends in malign influence campaigns from  countries identified as posing the greatest threats. They also must  provide a public assessment as to whether these countries are engaged  in interference in our election 90 days prior to election day and again  30 days out. Making such an assessment a requirement and including a  delivery date will help inoculate these assessments from questions  about political bias.   Even after election day, we need to make sure this group is poised to  affirm the legitimacy of the democratic process. No less than 3 days  after the election, it must also make an assessment to the maximum  extent possible as to whether foreign interference was detected. To  further protect the group from accusations of political bias, the spot  assessment could be backed up by a neutral, nonpartisan panel, which  would review and certify the government's assessment in short order,  such as within 2 weeks.   These types of public assessments are not unprecedented. As I  mentioned earlier, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence  and the Department of Homeland Security made an announcement about  Russian influence operations ahead of the 2016 election. Ahead of the  2018 midterm elections, the Director of National Intelligence, the  Department of Justice, the FBI, and the Department of Homeland Security  made a public statement about foreign influence, and the President  issued an Executive order regarding election interference ahead of the  2018 midterm elections, which requires a 45-day report after the  election that assesses attacks from foreign adversaries. Yet these  sporadic statements are not enough to reassure the American people, and  a report 45 days after the election is much too long to wait. The  public must know that this group is going to keep us informed in real  time and issue warnings regarding the threats.   Much of this idea was endorsed as a recommendation in the recent  bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee's report, which called for the  executive branch to stand up a task force to continually monitor and  assess the use of social media platforms by foreign countries for  ``democratic interference'' that, among other things, would  ``periodically advise Congress and the public on its findings.''   Second, we need a better understanding of how the Kremlin and other  foreign adversaries are deploying disinformation and foreign influence  operations across social media platforms. Right now, we are depending  on social media companies to take down unauthentic accounts that are  engaged in malign influence activities. These companies have stepped up  their efforts to identify and counter these activities, which is  something they failed to do in the 2016 election. Ultimately, they are  for-profit enterprises, and the government's visibility on and  understanding trends and indicators of foreign activity on these  platforms is limited. We cannot solely rely on the social media  companies to look after the public good and protect our national  security.   One way to increase transparency and help the American public  understand the changing threat picture across social media platforms  would be greater support for independent research, with the  participation of the social media companies and independent third-party  researchers, to compile information and analyze trends that are  relevant to foreign information operations. Such research would allow  trusted independent researchers and academics to gain insight into  cross-platform trends and  [[Page S5959]]  provide analysis of indicators of foreign influence activities to the  public. This mechanism could also provide an important tool for  informing our government's response to foreign influence and  disinformation operations ahead of the 2020 elections. This concept  also has bipartisan support from the Senate Intelligence Committee,  which includes a similar recommendation in its recent report.   We have proof that this concept works and is vital to national  security. General Paul Nakasone, commander of U.S. Cyber Command,  publicly testified to both the Senate Armed Services and Intelligence  Committees that two analyses of Kremlin-linked influence operations  across social media platforms done by independent researchers at the  Senate Intelligence Committee's behest were, in his words, a very, very  helpful window into the adversary's operations ahead of the 2018  midterms. As our adversaries continue to evolve and adopt their  techniques, we need to redouble our efforts to understand what to  expect in the next election.   Third, we must reinforce the prohibition on candidates and campaigns  that accept offers of help from foreign adversaries who interfere in  our political process to advance their strategic interests.   The Trump campaign's series of foreign contacts in the 2016 election  and the President's continued statements to solicit and show his  willingness to accept assistance from foreign governments make it clear  that Congress must act to prevent future interference efforts. That is  why I am a cosponsor of S. 1562, the Foreign Influence Reporting in  Elections Act--or the FIRE Act--introduced by Senator Warner. The FIRE  Act would require all campaign officials to report within 1 week to the  Federal Election Commission any contacts with foreign nationals  attempting to make campaign donations or otherwise collaborate with the  campaign. The FEC would, in turn, have to notify the FBI within 1 week.   It is in all of our interests to ensure that we can defend against  foreign attacks on our democratic institutions, and reporting these  kinds of contacts to the appropriate authorities is our first line of  defense. I am disappointed that my Republican colleagues have blocked  Senator Warner's attempt to pass the FIRE Act even after many of them  insisted that politicians should report to the FBI any contacts or  offers of help by a foreign government.   Fourth, we should build upon the passage in the Senate of S. 1328,  the Defending Elections against Trolls from Enemy Regimes Act. This  bipartisan legislation by Senators Durbin and Graham was a step in the  right direction by making improper interference in U.S. elections a  violation of immigration law and violators both deportable and  ineligible for visas to enter the United States. Additional targeted  sanctions should be considered on Russia to deter future election  interference with our allies and partners.   These are some immediate steps we can take as the Russian playbook  for the 2020 election crystallizes, but we can also see a familiar  pattern beginning to emerge.   This is not hypothetical. Just yesterday, Facebook announced it took  down 50 accounts associated with the Internet Research Agency. I have  spoken about it consistently throughout my comments this evening.   Just yesterday, they took down 50 accounts. These Kremlin-linked  trolls posed as real Americans, including from swing States. They  deployed information operations on social media to praise President  Trump and Senator Sanders and attack Vice President Biden and Senators  Warren and Harris--repeating tactics from 2016 and 2018.   Facebook's head of cyber security stated in conjunction with that  announcement that we can guarantee ``bad guys are going to keep trying  to do this.'' This is just one more confirmation that Russia is  deploying aspects of the same playbook in 2020.   This time, we know this information warfare campaign is coming. In  fact, it has already begun. We need to build on what we have learned  and what we anticipate coming next. We should be ensuring that we have  structures in place to counter foreign election interference.  Importantly, we must work together with private partners to expose more  of these operations and continue to help the American people understand  it. We can speak the truth about how Russia is exploiting our democracy  and open society to deploy its malign influence playbook so the public  is not caught unaware of these sophisticated foreign tactics and  attempts to manipulate the social media environment.   We also cannot continue to let these moments pass without speaking up  about the tenets of our democracy and what it stands for. Russia  exploited vulnerabilities in our society, and their tactics were  encouraged and amplified by a candidate who was seeking the highest  office in the land. That candidate, now President, appears to see no  reason to change his behavior for the future and instead he has doubled  down.   Congress as a body and we as a country must speak out and say this is  not acceptable. It is not acceptable for candidates for political  office--any political office, those seeking to hold a position of  public trust, to seek to engage with our adversaries or foreign  authoritarian regimes to advance their political campaigns. It is not  acceptable to meet with foreign agents about getting stolen information  on your opponents, information acquired by foreign espionage. It is not  acceptable to promote materials stolen by foreign adversaries. It is  not acceptable to abuse the power of the Presidency to advance your  personal political interests to the detriment of the country. It is not  acceptable to promote propaganda and disinformation campaigns that work  to delegitimize our democracy, a democracy that generations have fought  and died to protect. This is a violation of the public trust that is  inherent in any political office and which any candidate for public  office must uphold to be worthy of the American people's support.   It is critical that we unite in a bipartisan manner to take immediate  action to counter these threats. The integrity of our electoral system  is not a Republican or a Democratic issue. It is an American issue.   As Abraham Lincoln said, ``America will never be destroyed from the  outside. If we falter and lose our freedoms, it will be because we  destroyed ourselves.''   I yield the floor.
