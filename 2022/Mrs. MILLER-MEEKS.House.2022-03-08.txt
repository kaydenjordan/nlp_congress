 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a young man  from my district for shining the national spotlight on Central College  by shattering one of the most impressive NCAA records.   Last season, Central College senior quarterback Blaine Hawkins set  the new NCAA season record for the most touchdown passes with a total  of 63 touchdowns over 13 games, leading the Dutch to an impressive 12-1  season record.   Blaine has garnered national attention for setting the Division III  career touchdown record, and he has won several awards, including  Player of the Year, Conference Offensive MVP for both the 2019 and 2021  season, and has been named an Academic All-American for the 2018, 2020,  and 2021 season.   Congratulations to Blaine and the Central College Dutch for a  fantastic season. I wish you all the best.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I stand in unequivocal support of H. Con. Res. 70.   The series of bomb threats against historically Black colleges and  universities, or HBCUs, is extremely concerning. Threats of violence,  especially ones motivated by racism and hate, have no place in this  country. This resolution demonstrates our full and unwavering support  for HBCUs.   Since the beginning of February, over a dozen HBCUs in 5 states and  the District of Columbia have received bomb threats. Threatening the  safety and education of students in these historic institutions is  unacceptable.   The work HBCUs do on behalf of students, families, and communities,  is critically important. These institutions are invaluable parts of the  postsecondary education landscape, and they are changing lives by  offering students an excellent education.   For almost 200 years, these institutions have worked to provide Black  Americans with the skills and education they need to become a vital  part of our workforce. Generations of strong and capable leaders have  graduated from these institutions, including 50 percent of Black  teachers and doctors, as well as 80 percent of Black judges.   Despite massive challenges throughout their histories, HBCUs have  persevered. Their ability to thrive under immense pressure and hardship  is how we know they will survive this current onslaught of hate. But  they will not fight against these threats alone. We stand by their side  so they can continue to play a critical role in preparing our country's  next generation of leaders and innovators.   I strongly urge my colleagues to join me in voting ``yes'' on this  resolution, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman  from Louisiana (Ms. Letlow).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from Arkansas (Mr. Hill).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, we certainly all remain unified in  condemning the bomb threats, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, as a member of the Education and Labor Committee, I have  learned about the ways in which HBCUs serve our country's students and  postsecondary education community. For decades, HBCUs have provided  countless opportunities for men and women to achieve their goals,  whether academic, professional, or personal.   Threats of violence against HBCUs are despicable and cowardly. We  fully and unequivocally condemn these acts of hate. They have no place  in our country.   HBCUs deserve to be celebrated, not threatened. That is why I am  voting in favor of H. Con. Res. 70, and I urge all of my colleagues to  do the same.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Joyce) for organizing this evening's Special Order  hour.   For months now, we have seen a steady rise in energy prices,  highlighted by rising prices at the gas pump. The United States imports  hundreds of thousands of barrels of Russian oil every day, a slap in  the face to workers and businesses across our country.   Sanctioning Russia's energy sector will cripple their economy and  might be what it takes to end Russia's illegal invasion of a sovereign  nation.   Today, the administration took a much-needed step and banned the  import of Russian oil and gas. To help counter a lack of oil from  Russia, the administration is currently requesting that dictatorships  like Venezuela and Iran increase their oil and gas output instead of  unleashing domestic energy production. This is unconscionable.   To support American workers and businesses, we should tap into the  abundance of natural resources at home to counter high fuel costs,  including Iowa-made ethanol and biofuels.   As a Presidential candidate in 2020, President Biden pledged to  promote and advance renewable energy, ethanol, and other biofuels to  help rural America.   Ethanol helps to extend our fuel supply, and this can help alleviate  price pressure at the pump while giving access to American-made energy.   If only the Midwest States switched from E10 to E15, it would easily  replace all the barrels of oil that we will no longer be importing from  Russia. American ethanol producers have well over 2 billion gallons of  unutilized production capacity and are standing ready to play a larger  role in our energy sector.   We should continue to also grow our energy export network with our  European allies and our NATO partners to help them wean off Russian  energy. Biofuels, nuclear, oil, natural gas, hydro, and electric can  all be part of our energy diplomacy and weaken Russia's influence in  Europe.   We must take an all-of-the-above approach to our domestic energy  policy, especially in the face of Russian aggression.   I will continue to fight to ensure that our energy sector continues  to use oil and gas and American-made energy to end our dependence on  Russia and other adversaries, diversify our energy usage, become more  environmentally friendly, and create good-paying jobs here at home.                                time  2000
