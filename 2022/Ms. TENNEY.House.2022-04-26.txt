 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 6441,  the Women's Business Centers Improvement Act, legislation that I am  honored to lead with my colleague, Representative Sharice Davids.   Female entrepreneurs and women-owned businesses play a critical role  in our Nation's economy. As a longtime small business owner myself, and  the owner of a woman-owned business, I understand the challenges women- owned small businesses face, especially in rural communities.   The Women's Business Center program at the Small Business  Administration has been helping women overcome obstacles and build  thriving businesses for over 30 years. With more than 150 locations  across the Nation, the Women's Business Center program provides over  150,000 female small business owners annually with resources  [[Page H4470]]  and guidance, helping them to identify opportunities for growth.   The bipartisan Women's Business Centers Improvement Act will  strengthen the Women's Business Center program, increase authorized  funding, and enact commonsense taxpayer protections and oversight  provisions to safeguard public dollars and ensure that the program  efficiently serves the American people.   Additionally, the bill will expand the cap on grants made available  under this program, which will better support our women entrepreneurs.  These improvements will help the Women's Business Centers program run  efficiently and expand into more communities, like those underserved  communities particularly in my district and Ms. Davids' district and  all across New York and our Nation.   I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan women-owned small  businesses bill and vote ``yes'' on H.R. 6441.
