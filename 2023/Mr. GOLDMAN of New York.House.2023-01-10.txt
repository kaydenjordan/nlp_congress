 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to make something  crystal clear: The primary purpose of this special subcommittee is to  interfere with the special counsel's ongoing investigation into a  conspiracy to overturn the 2020 election.   This is a shocking abuse of power, but it is not just the usual  efforts by Members on the other side of the aisle to, once again, do  Donald Trump's dirty work. This time they are trying to protect  themselves.   One of them, a Member from Pennsylvania, had his cell phone seized  pursuant to a court order finding probable cause that he committed a  crime. Yet, he has indicated that he wants to be on this subcommittee  so that he can undermine a criminal investigation into himself.   My Republican counterparts can dress up the subcommittee with a  menacing name, but let's call it what it really is: the Republican  committee to obstruct justice.   The American people don't want that. They don't want yet another  front of the Republican war on democracy and the rule of law.   Mr. Speaker, I will vote ``no'' and urge everyone to do so.
