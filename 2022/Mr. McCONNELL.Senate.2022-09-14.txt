 Mr. President, the American people's No. 1 priority is  runaway inflation that is smashing their family budgets and crushing  our economy.   Yesterday, the latest inflation report showed that soaring prices are  still completely out of control. Inflation has totaled 13.2 percent  since the day President Biden took office. We just had the worst 12  months for both food inflation and electricity inflation since the  fallout from the Carter administration.   President Biden and our Democratic colleagues chose to celebrate-- celebrate--this awful inflation report with a so-called inflation  reduction party yesterday at the White House. While the Dow Jones  plummeted over 1,000 points, while the S&P 500 lost more than 4 percent  of its value in 1 day, while American families can't afford gas,  groceries, or electricity, Washington Democrats partied on the White  House lawn to celebrate their policies. That is what happened  yesterday.   This is what Democrats do while our economy crumbles. They subsidize  luxury electric cars; they make plumbers and retail workers eat the  graduate school debt of doctors and lawyers; and they throw a party for  themselves on the White House lawn.
