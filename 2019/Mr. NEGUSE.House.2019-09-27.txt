 Madam Speaker, I first want to thank the gentleman from  California for his courtesy and, of course, that of the majority  leader.   Madam Speaker, I rise today to call attention to a failure of our  government to issue a promised and required  [[Page H8077]]  set of regulatory guidance in a timely manner and a failure of our  government to adequately prepare the American people for natural  disasters and to provide relief for suffering communities.   I happen to represent the great State of Colorado's Second  Congressional District, and my State is no stranger to catastrophic  weather events. Exacerbated by the dangers we face from the threat of  climate change, we regularly experience forest fires, tornadoes, and  other disasters. Six years ago, we experienced historic flooding most  severely impacting Boulder County and Larimer County, both counties in  my district.   In September of 2013, we were inundated with heavy rainfall with up  to 15 inches of rainfall in 1 week in some areas. The result was  devastating flooding across the front range of Colorado.                                time  1200    The storms took the lives of 10 Coloradans and caused nearly $4  billion in damage across 21 counties in our State, the most expensive  disaster in Colorado's history. Rivers and creeks overflowed. Waters  seeped into the homes of thousands and displaced 18,147 people across  our State. Roads and bridges, as you can see here, were completely  washed out. Much infrastructure was destroyed.   My district, as I mentioned, contains two of the counties that were  the hardest hit by these events, Boulder and Larimer Counties.   Yet, today, more than 6 years later, many of these communities have  still not been able to recover from the flooding fully.   Rebuilding from a disaster this severe is a lengthy and expensive  process. However, it is made more difficult by Federal grant  regulations set by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA,  that require cities and counties to rebuild infrastructure in the exact  same way it had been built before the disaster in order to qualify for  reimbursement.   If these counties were to rebuild the roads and bridges that were  destroyed in the flood the same way they were originally built, it  would put these same communities at risk of future disasters once  again.   There is a lack of clarity and consistency for these cities and  counties, as well as countless other cities and counties across the  country, in FEMA's current determination of reimbursements.   Many projects in my district have been deemed ``not cost-effective''  because the counties made an adjustment and wanted to improve their  infrastructure, not just rebuild the same road right next to a river  that would be washed out again with the next flood.   Now, the good news is, Madam Speaker, that Congress has already acted  in a bipartisan way to show that we understand this problem. Section  1235 of the Disaster Recovery Reform Act passed last year, in 2018, and  it required that FEMA issue interim guidance, which is based on ``the  latest consensus-based codes and standards'' within 60 days of that law  being enacted.   Just to give you a sense of context in terms of time, the law was  signed by the President on October 5, 2018. It has been almost an  entire year since this bill was signed into law, yet FEMA has issued no  interim guidance.   I understand. I get it. I recognize that it may take longer than 60  days, maybe 90 days, maybe 120 days. But an entire year?   This endangers not just the financial security of counties in  Colorado that have millions of dollars at risk based on the pending  project determinations, but it demonstrates a fundamental failure by  the United States Government. There is simply no excuse for the  extensive delay that FEMA has taken in issuing this interim guidance.   Millions of dollars are at risk every day that counties have to wait  to learn if their projects will be reimbursed or covered under FEMA  rulemaking.   I know there are hardworking people at FEMA who are doing their jobs  each and every day to protect communities across our country, but I  would just implore the Agency--and we have certainly communicated this  directly to the Agency--that it should not have taken 6 years for  communities to rebuild their infrastructure after a flood fully, and it  certainly should not be caused by delays from red tape at the Federal  level.   Promises were made by the Agency to get this rulemaking done. I urge  FEMA to take action to issue this guidance in the last few days of  September, as they promised.   We have just a few more days, Madam Speaker, until the month  concludes. My constituents are waiting. The counties are waiting. The  country is waiting. I ask FEMA to not allow for any other delays, and I  yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 12 o'clock and 3 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until Tuesday,  October 1, 2019, at 9 a.m.                            ____________________
