 Madam Speaker, I rise today deeply alarmed by the  increase in fentanyl-related deaths in my district.   According to the San Bernardino County sheriff, there were over 100  fentanyl-related incidents in my district in the last year, resulting  in the death of nearly 100 of my constituents. In fact, Madam Speaker,  in the last 3 years, fentanyl-related deaths in my community have  increased over 600 percent. According to the sheriff, this is a direct  result of the trafficking of fentanyl across our southern border with  Mexico.   Last year the Inland Empire regional drug task force seized over 600  pounds of fentanyl, and they estimate the majority of that originated  in Mexico.   Madam Speaker, this is a direct result of our failure to secure our  southern border and the changes in Federal policy as relates to the  southern border that have been enacted in the last year.   Madam Speaker, we must stop this trafficking of fentanyl across the  border and protect our community by securing our southern border.                            ____________________
