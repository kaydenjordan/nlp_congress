 Mr. Chairman, I thank the distinguished  ranking member for yielding me time and for her hard work during this  arduous process. And I would also like to thank Chairman Frelinghuysen  and Chairman Dent for their hard work as well.   As we all know, the Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and  Related Agencies bill has a strong reputation for common ground and  bipartisanship. Chairman Dent, like always, set a cooperative tone and  was inclusive throughout this process. He has worked tirelessly to  address many Members' concerns, and I joined him in that effort, as  well as critical issues impacting our veterans and Active and Reserve  servicemembers.   The Military Construction portion of this minibus provides adequate  funding for both the Active and Reserve components. In addition, the  bill funds the NATO Security Investment Program at the FY17 level,  sending a strong message to our Nation's allies that we stand with them  as we continue to face evolving international threats.   For the Department of Veterans Affairs, this bill provides $3.9  billion, which is a 5.3 percent increase over FY 2017.   I am also pleased that this bill will address the issue of breast  cancer awareness and prevention and provides almost $700 million for  medical research, which will fund essential efforts, such as those to  address TBI and PTSD, develop state-of-the-art prosthetics, care for  victims of military sexual trauma, and treat veterans suffering from  mental illness.   The bill also continues to fund important programs to combat veteran  homelessness, provide our vets with effective and timely healthcare,  and improve the veteran benefits application process and appeals  process.   I am also extremely grateful for Chairman Dent's support for in vitro  fertilization and coverage for assisted reproductive technologies for  veterans who have sustained a service-connected injury that impacts  their fertility. This issue is very important to me and to so many  servicemembers. All veterans deserve to be able to start families.  Moreover, providing access to IVF is consistent with the VA's goals to  support veterans and improve their quality of life.   On a personal note, this bill will also address the issue of breast  cancer awareness and prevention.   This past spring, our subcommittee visited the Washington VA Medical  Center. We learned that the VA was relying on the controversial USPSTF  guidance for mammography in making coverage decisions.   Last Congress, we passed a law that barred private insurers from  making coverage decisions based on these guidelines through 2018.  However, the moratorium did not apply, we learned in that visit to the  VA, and so women in their forties who were veterans could be denied  coverage for mammograms. To its credit, the VA changed its guideline  regarding screening, and with Chairman Dent's support, language is  included to hold the VA to this better standard.   As I stated during my testimony before the Rules Committee, Mr.  Chairman, it is my sincere belief that if the MILCON-VA bill were being  considered as a stand-alone, as is tradition, under an open rule, it  would receive strong bipartisan support. But, unfortunately, that is  not what we are doing here today.   Instead of following regular order, we, instead, are taking up four  bills at once and adding funds to begin construction on President  Trump's irresponsible border wall that he promised Mexico would pay  for, and now taxpayers are being stuck with the bill. This fiscally and  morally irresponsible expenditure leaves the nondefense appropriations  bills grossly underfunded.   Furthermore, contrary to popular belief, this bill isn't even great  for defense. All this talk about making sure that we provide adequate  resources for our defense and our national security ignores the fact  that the Budget Control Act provides additional funds that would  ultimately be sequestered without a cap adjustment. This minibus would  breach this cap by more than $72 billion, resulting in a mandatory 13.2  percent sequester of all defense accounts, including the Military  Construction title.   And, by the way, I have said this repeatedly each time I have spoken  on this legislation, and never once has anyone in the majority  countered what I am suggesting. That is deeply troubling.   So even if this bill is signed into law, which it will not be, DOD  would not receive one dollar of this increase.   Secretary Mattis testified ``sequestration and the continued use of  continuing resolutions would result in a steady erosion of military  readiness.'' That is the only outcome this bill guarantees. By taking  up this minibus today, we are setting ourselves up for failure, and we  have set ourselves up  [[Page H6367]]  for an early fall with no real progress to be made on the FY 2018  appropriations bills.   Mr. Chairman, we cannot continue to govern in this fashion. I believe  it is time that we stop listening to the most extreme voices and get  past these unrealistic beliefs that we can cut our way to prosperity.  We cannot. If this failed philosophy persists, our work will only get  more difficult.   It is clear that passing any appropriations bill that will be signed  into law will require a bipartisan majority of both Houses. As a result  of this irresponsible posture, I will sadly be voting against the  minibus, and I look forward to working towards an appropriations  product that both parties can work on together in true bipartisan  tradition.   Mr. Chairman, lastly, before I close, I thank our staff in the  MILCON-VA bill on both the majority and the minority side: Maureen  Holohan, Sarah Young, Sue Quantius, Sean Snyder, and Tracey Russell  with the majority; and Matt Washington, Rosalyn Kumar, and Jonathan  Steinberg with the minority.     Mr. Chair, I rise in support of this amendment  and support the en bloc amendments. I appreciate the chairman's  inclusion of amendments from Democratic Members.   The amendments included range from therapy grants to combating opioid  abuse. These amendments will deliver better care to our veterans.   The minority has no objection to this amendment, and I urge a ``yes''  vote on the en bloc amendment.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Virginia (Mr. Beyer).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Norcross).    Mr. Chair, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Nevada (Mr. Kihuen), who has been a passionate advocate  to improve services to his rural communities.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, as the designee of Ranking  Member Lowey, I move to strike the last word.    Mr. Chairman, President Trump, the ``Commander  in Tweet,'' tweeted this morning announcing a ban on transgender  military service, which was a completely baseless and hateful assault  on transgender Americans. Make no mistake: this was not just a midnight  tweet. This was a statement of this administration's discriminatory  policies and a step backwards for our Nation.  [[Page H6422]]    While the President tweeted that his decision came after consulting,  supposedly, with our Nation's top generals, that was apparently news to  them, as it was met with utter surprise and silence from Pentagon  leaders.                                time  1845    Additionally, the President may want to speak to his VA Secretary, as  the VA has unequivocally stated VA's policy has not changed. The VA  provides care, benefits, and other VA services to all veterans,  including transgender veterans.   The President's policy reversal comes after our military has  undertaken a measured and thoughtful process to make our military open  to LGBT Americans to serve their Nation with pride and patriotism. This  thoughtful process included the successful repeal of Don't Ask, Don't  Tell, which had the support of civilian and military defense leaders  and an overwhelming number of Americans.   Unlike the President's tweets, the decision to make our military more  open was not made rashly or with the intention to discriminate.   With over 6,000 transgender Americans serving on Active Duty, in the  National Guard, and in our Reserve forces, it would be reckless,  dangerous, and cruel to remove brave servicemembers from their critical  roles protecting the American people. It is reckless and dangerous to  immediately leave vacant positions that are so vital to our national  security.   It would be cruel to perniciously discharge these servicemembers less  than honorably, an act that could gravely impact whether they are  eligible for VA benefits.   Time and again, we see the dramatic and unintended consequences of  this President's thoughtless actions.   As we fight for an open military, we will also fight to provide the  proper care and resources to the over 130,000 transgender veterans that  fought to defend this Nation.   Additionally, whatever my colleagues on the other side of the aisle  may say, this decision was not based on a financial cost-benefit  analysis.   Allowing transgender people to serve in the military would raise  defense health spending by less than 0.1 percent annually, including  funds for gender reassignment surgeries. That is just $2.4 million to  $8.4 million.   In comparison, just so we are illustrative, the Pentagon spends  $84.24 million annually on erectile dysfunction prescriptions. Of that,  $41.6 million was specifically spent on Viagra.   Moreover, research has shown that greater inclusion has little or no  impact on unit cohesion, operational effectiveness, or readiness. In  fact, commanders have noted that these policies benefited all  servicemembers by creating a more inclusive and diverse force.   Mr. Chairman, several things are clear:   This was not a decision based on fiscal responsibility.   This was not a decision based on military readiness.   This decision was apparently made to save the President's immoral,  irresponsible border wall, because some Republican Members threatened  to bring down the entire minibus appropriations bill that we are  debating here today over transgender medical treatment in the military.   This decision, at the end of the day, was based purely on bigotry and  hate, and it is one that we will vehemently oppose.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.                  Amendment No. 20 Offered by Mr. Ratcliffe     Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I, like many Members, have  concerns regarding another round of BRAC. I realize that this is a  complicated issue for all Members of Congress, especially those with  military facilities in their congressional districts.   I have had this conversation with my chairman, Mr. Dent, several  times. And while we both share the concerns of those Members with  military bases in their district and other military facilities, the  gentleman is right. We are going to need to address that we have  facilities all across the country that really need to be evaluated  because they are, essentially, maintaining infrastructure that is no  longer needed.   For example, the estimate of excess capacity for the Army is 22  percent. The Air Force's estimate of excess capacity is roughly 30  percent. Both the Army and the Air Force are strong supporters of  another BRAC round.   While this amendment really has no effect because we don't actually  have any funding in this bill for another BRAC round, it does send the  message that Congress is unwilling to tackle what is arguably a tough  issue.   This amendment would be, essentially, an abdication of our duties as  Members of this House to ensure that taxpayer resources are being used  in a wise and fiscally responsible way, and  [[Page H6423]]  that is something that we hear from our friends on the other side of  the aisle regularly.   And given that we have a very significant increase in the defense  appropriations bill, when we have resources that we are expending or,  essentially, wasting by not having a BRAC round, then we are,  essentially, leaving that money on the table when we could provide it  for our national defense.   So I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment. And I recognize  that the chairman is willing to accept it, but we should underscore  that there are no funds in this bill for a round of BRAC, so,  essentially, the acceptance of this amendment adopts the same posture  that this bill already holds.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for  yielding time to me.   Mr. Chairman, the VA conducts animal research at 74 of its  facilities, and only 3 of these--Cleveland, Milwaukee, and Richmond-- are still conducting experiments on dogs that involve inflicting  significant pain and distress. Just  [[Page H6424]]  yesterday, another whistleblower went public with graphic photos of  mutilated dogs and other troubling information about dog testing at  that facility.   In addition, a recent VA Office of Research Oversight investigation  found that the VA failed to keep adequate records about sick and  suffering dogs and has consistently underreported the number of dogs  used in experiments to Federal authorities.   I want to be clear that this amendment, unfortunately, does not stop  all animal research at the VA, and it doesn't even stop all dog  research at the VA--again, unfortunately. Far from it, in fact. This  amendment rightly and simply prohibits taxpayers' dollars from being  spent on research that causes dogs significant pain and distress.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment on  behalf of Bailey, Demmy, Coqui, Minnie, and Maddie Schultz.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I am opposed to the amendment.   Mr. Chairman, Davis-Bacon is a pretty simple concept, and a fair one  at that. What the Davis-Bacon Act does is to protect the government as  well as the workers in carrying out the policy that is very simple and  very straightforward: paying decent wages on government contracts.   The Davis-Bacon Act requires that workers on federally funded  construction projects be paid no less than the wages paid in the  community for similar work. It requires that every contract for  construction of which the Federal Government is a party in excess of  $2,000 contain a provision defining the minimum wages paid to various  classes of laborers and mechanics.   Mr. Chairman, the House has taken numerous and repeated votes on this  issue, and on every vote, this body has voted to maintain Davis-Bacon  requirements. In fact, most recently, during consideration of the  fiscal year 2018 National Defense Authorization Act, in a bipartisan  fashion, the House firmly rejected a similar amendment 242-183.   Last year, we avoided including divisive language like this in this  bill, and it is my hope that we stop attacking the working class and  defeat the amendment before us today and move on to more important  matters as we surely have in front of us.   Mr. Chairman, I urge all Members to vote ``no,'' and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the  distinguished gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Norcross), who has been a  passionate advocate and fighter for working men and women of this  country.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Chairman, it is unfortunate that the gentleman from Iowa  repeatedly engages in revisionist history when it comes to walking the  Chamber through the history of why we have Davis-Bacon.   It was actually in 1927 that a contractor who was employing African- American workers was building a Veterans Bureau hospital--fitting that  we are debating this on this bill in the district of Congressman Bacon.  What Congressman Bacon found was that there were very serious issues  related to low wages being paid, competitive pressure towards those  lower wages, discrimination against the wages of migrant workers, and  so he introduced Davis-Bacon initially to be able to make sure that  workers on construction projects would be able to be paid the  prevailing wages in the community.   These workers happened to be African American. That is about the only  thing that is at all related to the so-called Jim Crow reference that  the gentleman from Iowa made.   We need to make sure that, no matter where you work on a Federal  Government project, construction workers, working people who are trying  to make sure that they produce quality work, are able to produce that  quality work by being paid the prevailing wage in a community based on  those standards.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1915     Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
