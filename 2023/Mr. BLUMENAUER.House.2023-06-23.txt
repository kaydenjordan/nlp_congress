 Mr. Speaker, 50 years ago this week, Oregon became  the first State to decriminalize cannabis. I was honored to be a part  of that process.   It is time for the Federal Government to catch up.   We owe it to the generations of Black Americans targeted by the  failed war on drugs.   We owe it to our veterans with their wounds, seen and unseen.   We owe it to thousands of workers and their employers who fail drug  tests every day because they used State-legal cannabis weeks before.   We owe it to the large and growing cannabis industry, whose employees  are targets for violent robbery because we deny them bank accounts.   We owe it to the American public who are not waiting for the Federal  Government.   We need that framework to tax and regulate cannabis.   On the anniversary of Oregon's historic step to decriminalize  cannabis, it is past time for the Federal Government to be a real  partner and not a roadblock on the path forward.                            ____________________
