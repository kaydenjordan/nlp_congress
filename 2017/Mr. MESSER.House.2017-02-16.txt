 Madam Speaker, the Federal Government should not fund  abortions, and it should not force States to fund them either. That is  one reason this body recently voted to make the Hyde amendment  permanent and governmentwide.   The vast majority of Americans support this policy as a matter of  conscience and agree that tax dollars should not fund abortion  procedures. Today's bill is consistent with that principle.   But despite the rhetoric across the aisle, the bill permits, but does  not require, States to direct title X funds to health providers that do  not provide abortions.   Without this bill, States would be forced to fund the abortion  industry by Federal bureaucrats. This is an issue of states' rights as  well as one of conscience.                                time  1400    I am proud to support this measure, stand up for States, and defend  life.   I want to thank my colleague, Diane Black, for her hard work and  leadership on getting this bill to the floor, and I urge my colleagues  to vote for its passage.   Ms. DeGETTE. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Castor).
