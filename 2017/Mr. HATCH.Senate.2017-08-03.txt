 Mr. President, I agree with the distinguished Senator from  Texas. I thought his remarks were very much on point and very good.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to speak on a policy matter  that has been generating substantial attention recently, and that is  modern antitrust law. This issue is critical. In the perennial debate  over the proper role of government in economic affairs, it will grow  all the more critical in the years to come.   New technologies, creating markets not even imaginable only a decade  ago, are spurring fundamental shifts in the economic landscape. In the  national news, mergers between corporate giants or new fines imposed by  foreign regulators are becoming an acceptable thing almost every day.  In the Senate, we increasingly see antitrust law dragged into larger  economic arguments that are heavier in inflammatory rhetoric than in  careful deliberation. Allow me, then, to offer a few thoughts on the  matter, and to directly address the rising controversy.   America has always been--and, I haven't a doubt, will remain--the  economic and technological marvel of the world. Cradled in the best  traditions of the West and animated by a culture equal parts  industrious, creative, and restless, our system has produced the most  prosperous people in human history. It has shown its shortcomings, to  be sure. But on the whole, the American economy is unrivaled by any  other. Indeed, at times its blessings are so bountiful, its provisions  for the creation of wealth so effective, that we tend to take it for  granted in this country. We tend, at times, to forget what got us here.   A big part of what got us here is American antitrust law. You see,  all throughout history, societies and governments have tended toward  the central planning of economic activity.   America, however, chose a different path. We refused to yield to the  false comforts of collectivism. We opted, instead, for an economy that  was vibrant, tumultuous, competitive, and free. It is fortunate that we  did, for we have found that in the impossible complexity and unsettling  chaos of the market--wherein millions of consumers and producers make  millions of individual and uncoordinated decisions each and every day-- a spontaneous order arises that serves all of us far better than any  central authority ever could. Of course, our markets work toward those  ends only when they are genuinely free, fair, and competitive. That is  where antitrust comes in.   In a very real sense, antitrust is the capitalist's answer to the  siren song of the central planner. When antitrust doctrine is referred  to as the Magna Carta of the free enterprise system, I suspect this is  what we mean.   Let me be clear: Antitrust doctrine in this country has not always  gotten it right. As we all know, early antitrust policy tended to  confuse protection of market participants for protection of the market  itself; it was quick to micromanage particular industries, to choose ad  hoc intervention over predictable systems of incentives, and to cast  suspicion on any market too concentrated or business too big.   Fortunately, antitrust doctrine grows and adapts. It develops in the  same wonderful tradition and manner as the common law. Just as the  common law historically gave us property, contract, and commercial  rights, so too upon their basis does antitrust seek, year by year, to  give us markets that are competitive and free. Thus, the modern era of  antitrust has produced a fundamental improvement in our competitive  doctrine.   We have steadily adopted the consumer welfare standard, which judges  the conduct of firms and the arrangement of markets by what will  maximize efficiency and therein serve consumers most completely.   There will always be market failures to account for and noneconomic  concerns to keep in mind. But when it comes to the core, basic  functioning of the market--how to deliver the most  [[Page S4803]]  goods to the most people at the highest quality and lowest cost-- consumer welfare still works best.   In most industries, most of the time, we ought to think a little less  about how best to regulate the market and a little more about how best  to set the market upon regulating itself. The disciplining effects of  competition and the limitless store of American ingenuity do far more  for consumers than the well-intentioned intervention of government  authorities.   The consumer welfare standard has, consistently over the years,  proved an absolute boon to our economy and our society. Of course, a  legal standard means little unless handled with care.   We have chosen the right standard; now we must keep choosing the  right officials to implement it. You see, under the consumer welfare  standard, good antitrust enforcement is a lot like good sports  officiating. It harnesses, rather than stems, the flow of the action.  It lays out limited, predictable, and reliably enforced rules. It gets  the most out of the players and the competition itself, regardless of  which team is in the lead. Most importantly, as any sports fan could  tell you, when officiating is done right, we hardly notice the refs at  all.   With the right antitrust officials cognizant of their role, we can  expect a spirited contest in which American entrepreneurs keep putting  points on the board and American consumers keep reaping the reward.   Federal judges, naturally, are critical. In disputes of consequence,  they provide the ultimate backstop.   Also critical are our executive officials. Makan Delrahim, for  instance, has been nominated to lead the Antitrust Division at the  Department of Justice. He is eminently qualified, enjoys broad,  bipartisan support, and is at the ready to start as soon as he receives  our consent. I will urge my colleagues in the Senate, once again, to  take up his nomination and confirm him to this important post. He has  both Democrat and Republican support. He is well known. He ran the  Judiciary Committee under my jurisdiction.   On the other side of the enforcement equation, we are still waiting  on nominations to the Federal Trade Commission. The FTC is an important  agency that will play a central role in the years ahead. Whoever is put  in charge will face the monumental task of setting the agency on the  right track. I have supreme confidence that the President will make the  right choice on this one, and I look forward to supporting his  nominees.   As these vacancies linger, however, uncertainty lingers as well.  Critical merger and acquisition activity remains sidelined as  innovation is chilled and expansions are put on hold. All of this comes  at an unnecessary cost to our businesses and consumers.   I want this whole body to hear me clearly: There is no need for the  same old partisan food fight over our antitrust officials. Let's get  Makan Delrahim to work. FTC nominations will likely include two  Republicans and a Democrat. There is no reason they can't be swiftly  confirmed as a package. If delay on these important confirmations  persists, I will be back on the floor to make sure everyone--from  consumers to industry--knows it.   As I mentioned earlier, antitrust has been increasingly drawn into  the broader public debate on economic and innovation policy, and not  for the better. With each passing day, it seems the consumer welfare  standard finds itself besieged from the left. Their rhetoric may not  yet have made its way into traditional precedent, but it certainly has  made itself known.   Some in academia insist that recent market concentration and  technological progress compel a return to bold, persistent  experimentation. Many in the media call for antitrust to pursue  everything from industrial democracy to campaign finance reform to  material leveling. Above all else, we hear again the old, lazy mantras  that big is bad, disruption is suspect, and public utility designation  is welcome.    Professor and former FTC Commissioner Joshua Wright has referred to  this particular set of proposals as ``hipster antitrust.'' Well, as you  might imagine, nobody would mistake me for a hipster. So for my part,  and for ease, I will go ahead and call it the progressive standard.  Truth be told, as a proposed replacement for the consumer welfare  standard, the progressive standard leaves me deeply impressed. From  what I can tell, it amounts to little more than pseudoeconomic  demagoguery and anti-corporate paranoia. Nevertheless, it must not be  dismissed out of hand.   Over the last 8 years, policymakers laid the groundwork for it by  routinely disregarding some of the most basic elements of the consumer  welfare standard. Now we see the same stirrings of this radical  approach in many speeches on the other side of the aisle, as well as in  the recently released platform curiously titled ``A Better Deal.''   As such, I believe a response is in order. In defense of the consumer  welfare standard, we could, of course, run through the more technical  deficiencies of the progressive standard. We can mention that as  doctrine, it lacks manageable standards, dispensing with intellectual  rigor and inviting political mischief. We can mention that as theory,  it accounts for neither tradeoffs nor scarcity. We can mention that as  aspiration, it subordinates the productive incentives of the  entrepreneur to the fanciful designs of the bureaucrat.   Truth be told, the real trouble for the progressive standard is, it  fails to grasp the bigger picture of our history, economy, and national  character. It fails to appreciate that our time is not so distinct from  times past and that our momentary insights are not so superior to the  lessons learned over generations prior.   Of course, anyone can see that changes are afoot. As chairman of the  Senate Republican High-Tech Task Force, I have seen it firsthand. The  new technological age, having dawned in the late 20th century,  continues to ripen into the 21st.   New innovation is relentlessly spurring transformation across the  economy, and many markets are concentrating as a result. Yet supporters  of the progressive standard seem to think this presents historically  unique problems. They rely, as academics are wont to do, on sleek, new  jargon to argue that today's antitrust challenges are not only tangibly  but conceptually distinct of those of the past. They argue, in other  words, that things really are different this time around. At the end of  the day, terms like ``platform economics'' and ``network effects''-- commonly used to attack the consumer welfare standard--do less to  define new economic concepts than to explain how old economic concepts  are manifesting themselves in modern markets.   Through history, we have seen this time and time again. As the saying  goes, the more things change, the more they stay the same. Markets  concentrate and then disperse; dominant firms rise and then fall; with  innovation comes creation in one sector and destruction in another.  Anxiety over this evolution is very real, and the strident calls we  hear to do something about it--whatever that may be--are on some level  understandable, but this lurch toward the progressive standard is not.   Change, sometimes furious change, is a constant in our system. For  all its rancor, for all its chaos and uncertainty, it is, alas, what  propels us forward. We hope, not fear, that each age looks better than  the last.   Now, in anticipation of an objection from my friends across the  aisle, nobody is suggesting that no enforcement is necessary. Genuinely  anti-competitive conduct must be stopped, and mergers prone to abet  such conduct must be heavily scrutinized. That is all a part of keeping  markets fair and free in the best tradition of American capitalism.   Again, as I mentioned earlier, we should aim to regulate markets such  that in their basic core functioning they regulate themselves. Market  discipline imposed by competition and driven by innovation should be  our aim. To that end, nobody doubts that new developments in the market  will require a fresh look at doctrine. Nobody questions that the  consumer welfare standard will have to adapt. For example, categories  of anti-competitive conduct may need to be tweaked, refastened or even  expanded in light of technical advancement and market evolution. Merger  review, never an exact science, will seize upon new econometric tools  for measuring ancient  [[Page S4804]]  economic concepts like quality, preference, and efficiency. The rule of  reason, I am sure, will continue to bedevil judges, practitioners, and  law students alike, but that is just fine.   Antitrust, as I keep saying, is ultimately a common law exercise. I  am here to argue merely that the consumer welfare standard, when  handled prudently, is a far better steward of our economy than the  progressive standard, which is deeply misguided and potentially quite  destructive.   Take, for instance, the proposed Amazon-Whole Foods merger, which has  generated so much interest lately. It would, of course, be  inappropriate for me on the floor of the Senate to pass judgment. I  would caution my colleagues the same. There is an established process  for review, but the question should be asked: Upon what basis should  antitrust authorities evaluate a proposed merger like this? What we  need is the consumer welfare standard. It carefully examines the basic  and critical question of whether such a deal helps consumers or whether  it hurts consumers. It relies on a coherent doctrine to strike a  balance. It is a balance between the merger's pro-competitive effects,  such as integrative efficiencies and innovation, and the antitrust  competitive potential, such as market domination by one firm or  facilitated price coordination by the few that remain. What we  absolutely do not need, on the other hand, is the progressive standard.   Under no doctrinal limitations to cabin discretion, antitrust  officials would gladly follow vague institutions in shifting  intuitions. With a broad mandate to pursue aims far grander than mere  market efficiency, officials would be free to engage in ad hoc  theorizing about whether corporate consolidation, writ large, can be  squared with universal justice, common fairness, and community values,  or of whatever else their creativity recommends. To take another  example, across the Atlantic, our friends in the European Union have  leveled a massive fine against Google for anti-competitive conduct.  Again, it is not for me to say on the floor whether those fines are  justified. I don't think they are, but it is not for me to say.   Once more, what we need is the framework provided by the consumer  welfare standard. We must weigh the pro-competitive aspects of Google's  conduct with its anti-competitive potential. The ultimate inquiry  should be whether consumers are better off as a result of Google's  actions. Under the progressive standard, however, instead of asking  what lowers prices and increases quality--instead of considering actual  proof of harm to consumers--we would be asking what best serves the  social goals in vogue at the moment. The result would be an open  invitation to market intervention that is more politically motivated  than economically sound.   In conclusion, for all the past rhetoric, for all the claims that a  new age requires a new doctrine, the ideas behind the progressive  standard are not new. They are terribly old. They may be adorned with  original terminology or aimed at novel markets, but it is the same old  collectivist impulse it has always been. In that sense, these ideas are  not unique to Americans. Every day we receive concerning reports from  around the world that foreign governments are increasingly turning to  antitrust for industrial policy. Whether domestically or abroad, the  stakes are simply too high, the consequences too grievous for the  consumer welfare standard to be swept away in an instant, merely  because a new breed of central planners--falsely conceiving themselves  different from their predecessors--imagine they know best.   In America, we have always opted for the invisible hand of the free  market over the heavy hand of government intervention. Let's keep it  that way.   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I wish to speak on the importance of  maintaining a strong Food and Drug Administration. Today we approved  the user fee reauthorizations for the FDA. We have done the important  work of passing these essential user fee agreements out of the  committee and have now debated and passed them on the Senate floor.   The HELP Committee is filled with strong personalities. These  personalities reflect the passion and diversity of opinion of millions  across our nation today. While we may disagree on certain policies,  most of us can agree that funding the drug, device, and biologic  centers of the FDA is essential.   Our future scientific endeavors require a strong FDA that  communicates openly with the industry that it regulates, and this  agreement sets up protocols to achieve that goal. A strong FDA also  requires clear steps for product review, and only through such  deliberative actions can we bring more competition and clarity to our  drugs, devices, and biologic products.   I have championed multiple provisions in this bill, but there are two  I would like to highlight today. First, there is the counterfeit and  diverted drug language. This language makes importation neither harder  nor easier. In fact, it doesn't change importation laws at all. Rather,  it protects and strengthens the drug supply chain by  [[Page S4820]]  simply increasing penalties for criminals that choose to divert drugs  into the United States or sell counterfeit drugs.   Current penalties for illegally diverting drugs in the United States  change arbitrarily based on the location where the drugs are  manufactured. Our bill addresses this disparity by enforcing the same  penalties for diverting drugs made outside the United States as for  those made inside the United States. To ensure public health and to  enhance consumer confidence, it is critical that Congress eliminate  these differing penalties for certain types of diversion and  counterfeiting.   The second provision I wish to call attention to is a bipartisan  proposal from Senators Bennet, Burr, and Casey. These fine Senators  have joined together to address how clinical trials are designed early  on in their development. By offering guidance on how to include the  intended patient population, especially those with rare diseases, drug  sponsors can craft trials that generate useful data for health  professionals and patients to review.   This bill builds upon the success of other expanded access provisions  that put the patient at the heart of the healthcare system. FDA does  consummate work when reviewing products for market, but including a  wider patient mix, when appropriate, will enable phase I, II, and III  trials to be more complex. I strongly believe that accurately  portraying the intended patient population in a clinical trial is key  to ensuring that drugs are both safe and effective.   I support this bill, but I also feel compelled to speak for a moment  on the OPEN ACT. While not included in the package being debated today,  the provisions of the Orphan Product Extension Now Accelerating Cures  and Treatments Act--a bill I introduced this Congress with Senator  Menendez and last Congress with Senator Klobuchar--would promote new  therapies for rare diseases.   New therapies are essential to help the nearly 30 million Americans  suffering from a rare disease or condition. Because complex rare  diseases with small patient populations have limited market potential,  there are few economic incentives to develop new drugs targeting those  diseases. While there are 7,000 rare diseases that impact millions of  Americans, 95 percent of these diseases have no treatment. All too  often, misconceptions about the dangers of exclusivities keep  bipartisan measures from being introduced. We must remain focused,  however, and remember that, each day we delay in getting treatments to  the rare disease community, patients and their families suffer.   Drug companies possess considerable scientific knowledge on drugs  that have already been approved for common diseases. Some of these  drugs could be repurposed for the treatment of rare diseases.  Repurposing drugs is faster, less expensive, and generally less risky  than traditional drug development.   The OPEN ACT would encourage such repurposing by providing an  additional 6 months of market exclusivity to drugs that are repurposed  and approved by FDA for a rare disease or condition.   Finding legislative ways help medical innovators treat rare diseases  has been among my top priorities for over 30 years, since I first  championed the bipartisan, bicameral Orphan rug Act in 1983. The OPEN  ACT is a natural next step in expanding that effort to close the gap  for rare diseases for which we have yet to develop treatments. In  addition to increasing the number of rare disease therapies, this  legislation will boost innovation and provide safer options for rare  disease patients using drugs off-label. My bill enjoys enormous support  with the backing of over 225 rare disease organizations and patient  advocacy groups, not to mention overwhelming support from academic  medical and research centers.   Although this provision is not in the bill before us, I have had  assurances from Chairman Alexander that he will continue working with  me and the cosponsors of this bill to see it become law. I have spoken  to Ranking Member Murray in the past about it, and I remain optimistic  that my colleagues share my concern for the rare disease community and  are willing to advance this legislation in the future. I would like to  thank the chairman and ranking member for their dedication to children  and families in need.   I wish to conclude by reminding my colleagues that many of the  debates that have led to the bill before us today are the culmination  of years of experience. When I led the effort to pass what became  Hatch-Waxman, the true impact of that law dwarfed even our loftiest  hopes. Hatch-Waxman was a resounding success because Senators and  Congressmen worked together to improve our country's situation and  reduce barriers to market entry. This bill is vital to continuing that  goal, and I am pleased to see where the negotiations have landed.                            ____________________     Mr. President, last week, I joined the Senate majority  leader, the Speaker of the House, the chairman of the House Ways and  Means Committee, the Treasury Secretary, and the Director of the  National Economic Council in issuing a joint statement on tax reform.   I ask unanimous consent that the text of the joint statement be  printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.   Since the statement's release, critics and naysayers have said quite  a bit, some even going so far as to declare their opposition to the  statement. That is a little odd, given that the statement is not a bill  or a tax plan; it is simply a statement of agreed upon principles for  tax reform.   That is not to say it was insignificant. Quite the opposite, in fact.  The joint statement is an important development in the overall tax  reform effort for several reasons.   For example, over the past several months, the favored tax reform  narrative among some in the pundit class has been that Republicans are  deeply divided. According to this narrative, Republicans in the Senate,  the House, and the administration all have such fundamentally different  views on tax reform that it will be impossible for us all to get on the  same page.   Some of that was, to use an outdated description, pure poppycock.   When the administration puts out a framework that calls for a 15  percent corporate tax rate while the House blueprint has a 20 percent  rate target, that is not really a disagreement. Both sides want to  lower the corporate rate significantly, and the general idea in both  cases is to reduce the rate as much as is reasonably possible.   Admittedly, there were some key differences of opinion. At the outset  of this Congress, with a newly elected Republican President, it was  fair to say that the House, Senate, and White House were on different  pages when it came to some aspects of tax reform.   However, with last week's release of the joint statement, the leaders  in this effort--in both congressional chambers and in the executive  branch--have declared that, as of now, we are singing off the same song  sheet. There are, of course, details that will need to be worked out,  but all parties are in agreement on the key principles and have enough  confidence that the process can move forward in Congress without the  fear that the House, Senate, or administration will take drastically  different approaches in crafting a tax reform package.   That is very significant. I have been working on tax reform for more  than 6 years now, and this is the first time that we have had anything  approaching this level of unity across the various Chambers and  branches of government.   Another significant marker in the joint statement is the agreement  that the tax-writing committees will do the lion's share of the work in  producing the actual tax reform legislation and that the leaders are  committed to moving through regular order, by which I mean committee  markup processes prior to floor consideration.   This is key because one of the criticisms I have heard about  Republicans' tax reform efforts is that the bill is being drafted  behind closed doors I have even been scolded, sometimes pointedly, over  why I have not held a Finance Committee hearing on ``the bill,'' even  though there is no complete bill in place at this time.   Outside groups, some overtly aligned with the Democrats, have already  put forward budget scores for the House  [[Page S4821]]  blueprint and the President's tax framework, even though there are not  enough specifics in place to score anything yet. Those scores,  generated by whatever is in the imagination of the outside groups, and  not based on any facts, tell tall tales. They say there will be tax  cuts for the rich, big businesses and a parade of horrors. Democrats  here in the Senate, as well, have spoken of the horrors of the  Republican ``tax plan,'' even though there is not a detailed plan in  place. Again, the horrors represent pure fiction.   It is simply not the case that a bill is being drafted behind closed  doors. It was never going to be the case. I have stated several times  in recent months that I intended to have a robust and transparent  process for tax reform in the Senate. The joint statement confirms that  both chambers of Congress will take that kind of approach.   The Finance Committee is already hard at work. We have been talking  about specific reform proposals for months now, and every member on the  majority side of the committee is ready to do the work. More broadly,  the committee has been at work in a bipartisan way on tax reform for  many years now.   We have a number of great members on the Finance Committee, all of  whom--at least on the Republican side--are committed to working toward  this effort. I will continue to gather their input with an eye toward  crafting a tax reform bill and moving it through the committee this  fall. Once again, the committee process is going to be robust; I intend  to hold multiple hearings and full markup.   The joint statement also noted that Republican leaders hoped that our  Democratic colleagues would be willing to participate in this effort.   That should be no surprise. I have been calling on my Democrat  friends to work with us on tax reform for months, even years.   For months now, I have been come to the floor on multiple occasions  to ask my Democratic friends to come to the table.   I held a bipartisan hearing on tax reform in the Finance Committee  just a few weeks ago, where we heard from experts on both sides of the  aisle.   Earlier this week, the committee had another bipartisan hearing, this  one on affordable housing. Of course, most of the Federal affordable  housing incentives are found in the Tax Code, meaning that issue will  undoubtedly be part of the larger discussion.   These hearings are just the latest in very long line of bipartisan,  tax-related hearings in the Finance Committee.   So there really shouldn't be any doubt that, when I sign onto a  statement that includes a call for bipartisanship, the call is both  serious and sincere.   In addition, there is quite a bit of bipartisan agreement over the  policy principles noted in joint statement.   As I said here on the floor just a few weeks ago, a number of  Democrats--including a number of our Senate colleagues and the two most  recent Democratic Presidents--have expressed support for lowering the  U.S. corporate tax rate, which is the highest in the industrialized  world.   Prominent Democrats, including the distinguished minority leader,  have publicly supported reforms to our international tax system in  order to make American businesses more competitive and prevent erosion  of our tax base.   Both of these concepts are prominently mentioned in our joint  statement.   The statement also talks about tax relief for middle-class families  and reduced burdens on small businesses. Democrats, last time I  checked, were largely in favor of this as well.   So long story short, there is nothing in the statement, either in  terms of process or policy, that should discourage a number of  Democrats from getting on board with this effort.   Yet, earlier this week, every member of the Senate Democratic  Caucus--except three--signed onto a letter they purported to be a call  for compromise and bipartisanship. However, if you read the details of  the letter, it was really a set of up-front demands peppered in between  political attacks.   First and foremost, my colleagues demanded in their letter that  Republicans not use budget reconciliation to move a tax reform bill.   That has been a precondition for Democratic involvement in this  effort for months now, among other demands unrelated to tax reform,  and, as I have said many times, it is preposterous. The demand that  Republicans agree upfront to a particular process is really  unprecedented and, not to put too fine a point on it, a little  nonsensical.   If Democrats are willing to engage in good faith on tax reform, why  would they first demand that we ensure their ability to block it from  ever even coming to the floor before they would be willing to engage on  the substance? The logic is a little dizzying, to say the least.   On top of that, if reconciliation remains on the table, why would  that stop Democrats from agreeing on the substance?   Obviously, budget reconciliation gives the majority the tools it  needs to move legislation--under specified rules and conditions-- without the threat of a filibuster, but nothing in the rules requires  reconciliation to be partisan. In fact, historically speaking, tax  bills moved through reconciliation tend to get bipartisan support. For  example, the so-called Bush Tax Cuts of 2001 and 2003 were passed  through reconciliation; yet there were both Republicans and Democrats  voting in favor of the package.   Recent history shows that working together on the substance of policy  is not precluded by the existence of a reconciliation instruction.   In 2009, with a reconciliation instruction in place, Senate  Republicans in the Finance Committee participated in the healthcare  reform process, with hearings, roundtables, and bipartisan discussion  groups, before we were shut out of the final ObamaCare bill.  Republicans did not operate as though there was a prerequisite of no  reconciliation before discussion could occur.   In 2013, with a $1 trillion tax-hike reconciliation instruction in  place, Senate Republicans in the Finance Committee participated in  discussions that produced 10 bipartisan tax option papers; we  participated in what was called a blank slate approach to tax reform;  and we participated in discussion draft conversations. Republicans did  not operate as though there was a prerequisite of no reconciliation  before discussion could occur.   Now, our friends on the other side are critical of us when we follow  the path they, themselves, took. They are insisting that we do what  they would not do when similarly situated. They are not participating  on the same constructive basis we did when we were in their place. From  their leader on down, they act as if the past does not exist or that we  are ignorant of it. Before applying too clever a rhetorical lash to  those on this side, my friends on the other side should heed the advice  of Lord Byron: ``Keep thy smooth words and juggling homilies for those  who know thee not.''   If Democrats will work with us to reach agreement on the substance of  tax reform, the process by which it moves through the Senate shouldn't  really be a concern. Any implication that the process will necessarily  dictate the substance is misleading.   Ideally, the tax reform process would be bipartisan, particularly  here in the Senate. That would be the best-case scenario for the  effort.   In a perfect world, reconciliation would not be necessary.   For that to happen, the Democrats would have to be willing to engage  in a reasonable manner. In my view, opening the discussion with a  demand that Republicans unilaterally disarm and commit to not using the  tools we have under the rules of the Senate--the very tools that have  been used by both sides in the past--smacks of disingenuousness. If  they are truly willing to engage constructively on these efforts--and I  hope they are--we should begin by talking about the substance, not  dealing with process demands.   I hope that what we are seeing is posturing. I hope that my  Democratic colleagues will recognize the significance of the unity  expressed in last week's joint statement and get on board for what will  hopefully be a historic effort.   If they do not, Republicans should be willing to use the tools at our  disposal to move tax reform without Democratic support. That would  include reconciliation.   The majority leader has indicated that he is willing to go that way.  I am willing to go that way as well.   However, to get us to the point, a number of things have to happen,  not  [[Page S4822]]  the least of which is the passage of budget resolution. For now, I am  focusing on the substantive policies and proposals, and I will keep  working with my colleagues on the Finance Committee to deliver on the  tasks we were charged in the joint statement.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                              [July 27, 2017]                       Joint Statement on Tax Reform         Washington.--Today, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI), Senate       Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), Treasury Secretary       Steven Mnuchin, National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn,       Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-UT), and       House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady (R-TX)       issued the following joint statement on tax reform:        ``For the first time in many years, the American people       have elected a President and Congress that are fully       committed to ensuring that ordinary Americans keep more of       their hard-earned money and that our tax policies encourage       employers to invest, hire, and grow. And under the leadership       of President Trump, the White House and Treasury have met       with over 200 members of the House and Senate and hundreds of       grassroots and business groups to talk and listen to ideas       about tax reform.        ``We are all united in the belief that the single most       important action we can take to grow our economy and help the       middle class get ahead is to fix our broken tax code for       families, small business, and American job creators competing       at home and around the globe. Our shared commitment to fixing       America's broken tax code represents a once-in-a-generation       opportunity, and so for three months we have been meeting       regularly to develop a shared template for tax reform.        ``Over many years, the members of the House Ways and Means       Committee and the Senate Finance Committee have examined       various options for tax reform. During our meetings, the       Chairmen of those committees have brought to the table the       views and priorities of their committee members. Building on       this work, as well as on the efforts of the Administration       and input from other stakeholders, we are confident that a       shared vision for tax reform exists, and are prepared for the       two committees to take the lead and begin producing       legislation for the President to sign.        ``Above all, the mission of the committees is to protect       American jobs and make taxes simpler, fairer, and lower for       hard-working American families. We have always been in       agreement that tax relief for American families should be at       the heart of our plan. We also believe there should be a       lower tax rate for small businesses so they can compete with       larger ones, and lower rates for all American businesses so       they can compete with foreign ones. The goal is a plan that       reduces tax rates as much as possible, allows unprecedented       capital expensing, places a priority on permanence, and       creates a system that encourages American companies to bring       back jobs and profits trapped overseas. And we are now       confident that, without transitioning to a new domestic       consumption-based tax system, there is a viable approach for       ensuring a level playing field between American and foreign       companies and workers, while protecting American jobs and the       U.S. tax base. While we have debated the pro-growth benefits       of border adjustability, we appreciate that there are many       unknowns associated with it and have decided to set this       policy aside in order to advance tax reform.        ``Given our shared sense of purpose, the time has arrived       for the two tax-writing committees to develop and draft       legislation that will result in the first comprehensive tax       reform in a generation. It will be the responsibility of the       members of those committees to produce legislation that       achieves the goals shared broadly within Congress, the       Administration, and by citizens who have been burdened for       too long by an outdated tax system. Our expectation is for       this legislation to move through the committees this fall,       under regular order, followed by consideration on the House       and Senate floors. As the committees work toward this end,       our hope is that our friends on the other side of the aisle       will participate in this effort. The President fully supports       these principles and is committed to this approach. American       families are counting on us to deliver historic tax reform.       And we will.''                            ____________________
