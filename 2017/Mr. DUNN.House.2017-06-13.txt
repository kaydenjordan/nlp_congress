 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Department of  Veterans Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act of  2017. This important legislation will streamline the arduous process to  remove, demote, or suspend any VA employee for poor performance,  negligence, or misconduct.   We all know the list of scandals: veterans dying on wait lists,  intoxicated surgical staff, armed robbery, grossly mismanaged  construction projects. Yet the civil service rules allow bad VA  employees to stay on the public payroll.   Our veterans deserve better.   Today we take a bold step toward reversing that failure. This  legislation will allow Secretary Shulkin to immediately remove bad  employees as he works to restructure and improve veterans' care. It  also ensures that whistleblowers are protected from retaliation. The  bottom line is that it implements real accountability at the VA,  accountability to the men and women who have bravely served this  country.   The Veterans Affairs Accountability Act is an important first step in  addressing poor performance and misconduct at the VA, and I urge all of  my colleagues to support this much-needed legislation.   I thank the chair and the ranking member very much for their work on  this.
