 MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, like all of us in  this Chamber, the Vice President and the Cabinet swore in their oaths  of office to protect and defend the Constitution from enemies foreign  and domestic.   Now they must fulfill that oath by invoking the 25th Amendment.  Donald Trump's reckless actions on and leading to January 6 underscore  that he is a clear and present danger to our democratic traditions. He  repeatedly and blatantly lied, spouting baseless claims of a stolen  election and fraud.   He called on his supporters to come to D.C. on January 6, a day which  he said ``will be wild,'' and willfully incited an armed and deadly  insurrection against another branch of our government.    President Trump must be held accountable, and we must return to the  peaceful transfer of power. I urge a ``yes'' vote.
