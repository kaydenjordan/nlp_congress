 DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the  MORE Act, which allows the Federal Government to begin to catch up with  the 47 States, like Illinois, which have already reformed their  marijuana use laws in one way or the other.   Mass incarceration, which disproportionately affects Black and Brown  citizens, has been aided and abetted by marijuana laws, which result in  more than 600,000 arrests annually. The expungement provisions in this  legislation will allow hundreds of thousands of individuals to get  their records expunged so that they can more enthusiastically pursue  legitimate jobs and work to take care of themselves and their families.   The MORE Act is an idea whose time has come. I urge that we vote  ``yes.''
