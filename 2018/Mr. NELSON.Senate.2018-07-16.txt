 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, almost everybody in the world knows by now  that the President met with Vladimir Putin today. While nobody knows  what the two Presidents said in their private meeting, what they said  afterward certainly should alarm all of us.   President Trump refused, once again, to accept the fact that Russia,  at Putin's order, interfered in our elections. What the President said  was alarming, it was embarrassing, and it is unacceptable. We know  Putin interfered, and we know he will do it again in our upcoming  elections. This is from the unanimous report of the intelligence  community of this country and was reaffirmed earlier today by the  Director of National Intelligence, former Senator Dan Coats, who was  President Trump's appointee.   In its January 2017 assessment, the IC assessed that Russian  President Putin ordered an influence campaign in the 2016 election,  which was aimed at the U.S. Presidential election. That assessment  described the campaign as a mix of cyber operations that were conducted  by Russian intelligence services in its overt use of propaganda and  fake social media accounts and trolls.   Take it from President Trump's own administration. Then-Director of  the CIA and now-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo acknowledged the Russian  interference. He stood by the intelligence community's assessments, and  that was a year and a half ago. He even said he had every expectation  that Russia would continue to try to interfere in our elections.   A few days ago, Dan Coats, who is the Director of the DNI, said:         The warning lights are blinking red again. . . . The       digital infrastructure that serves this country is literally       under attack.    Just this past Friday, the Justice Department announced the  indictment of 12 Russian intelligence officers for hacking the Clinton  campaign and the DNC. This is just the latest in a series of  indictments.   Today, though, the President, while standing right next to Vladimir  Putin, said that while the men and women of the U.S. intelligence  community concluded with high confidence that Putin did, indeed,  interfere in our elections, President Trump said:         [President Putin] said it's not Russia. I don't see any       reason why it would be.    That is rather curious.   Even worse, the President stood next to Putin and said the United  States was to blame for the Russian aggression. Let me repeat that. The  President stood next to Putin and said the United States was to blame  for the Russian aggression. This Senator believes our own intelligence  community, not a former KGB spy and colonel who is bent on undermining  democracy and the rule of law around the world, is whom you ought to  believe.   What does a spy do? In order to achieve a spy's ends, the spy lies.  That is what and how Vladimir Putin was trained, and it is obvious he  is no friend of the United States.   There has been a lot of discussion about Russia, and I know that, at  times, it can be confusing to everyday folks. Yet amidst all of the  talk and the disinformation, it is critically important that we don't  lose sight of the threat to our democracy. That is what Russian  interference in our elections is. It is an attack on the very  foundation of our democratic institutions. Of course, that is what  Putin is trying to do--invade our own democracy in order to divide us;  it is to undermine our own faith in our own institutions, and to  ultimately undermine American leadership in the world.   This should not be a partisan issue in America, in our domestic  politics. I hope we come together quickly, in a bipartisan way, to  defend ourselves and to finally push back on Putin. I hope we insist  that the White House enforces all of the economic sanctions the  Congress has already pushed through but that the White House has been  very slow to enact. I hope this Congress is also going to enact more  economic sanctions and get them to where they will really start causing  a crimp in the step of the Russian leaders. Why not start freezing the  bank accounts of some of its highest leaders?   First, the United States, led by our President, has to see the enemy  and the threat for what they are. Now, going on 2 years into his  administration, the President is unwilling to stand up to Putin--man- to-man, eyeball-to-eyeball--and to defend our country.   I yield the floor.
