 Mr. Speaker, on Friday, The Wall Street  Journal editorialized: ``Let Ukraine Go on Offense Against Russia.''   ``As Russia's war on Ukraine enters its sixth week, the script has  flipped. Russia's advance has stalled, and Ukraine now wants to go on  offense to push back Russian forces from the land they have taken. But  the country needs U.S. and NATO help to do it.''   ``Now is the time to help Ukraine take the offensive. Reports of  demoralized Russian forces are more frequent, including defectors who  have taken equipment with them.''   ``Throughout this conflict, the Biden administration has been slow. .  . . `' Now ``is the time to keep the pressure on to truly achieve a  strategic victory for Ukraine and NATO.''   I have faith in the Russian people, a great culture betrayed by war  criminal Putin. There is legislation for defecting Russian troops,  diplomats, and Duma members to be provided immediate refugee status in  America and up to $100,000 for any Russian military equipment turned  over to Ukraine.   God bless Ukraine, God save Ukraine, and long live Volodymyr  Zelenskyy.                            ____________________
