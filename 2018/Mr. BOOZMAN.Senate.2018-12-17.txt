 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.  [[Page S7639]]     Mr. President, I rise today to applaud my colleagues for  coming together in a bipartisan fashion to pass the farm bill  conference report.   There is much to be excited about in the final version of this 5-year  reauthorization. First and foremost, the farm bill will bring much  needed certainty and predictability to farmers and ranchers over the  next 5 years. This is especially important given the intense pressure  our agriculture producers are facing.   If you look at the numbers across the Nation, net farm income is  approximately half of what it was when we passed the last farm bill.  Farm bankruptcies are up by 39 percent since 2014; financing has become  more expensive; commodity prices have plummeted; input costs are  rising; and the trade outlook is volatile and uncertain, to say the  least.   Farmers across the country--regardless of where they call home or  which crops they grow--are hurting. The farm bill that Congress  approved last week, delivers meaningful and real relief for our farmers  and ranchers in these very difficult times. It is the big bill for my  home State of Arkansas as well as across the country.   Agriculture is a driving force of the Natural State's economy, adding  around $16 billion to our economy every year and accounting for  approximately one in every six jobs. That is why agriculture advocacy  groups in Arkansas were very excited when we passed the final version.   The Arkansas Farm Bureau said it was ``pleased that Congress has  recognized how important the new farm bill is to the hard-working  farmers and ranchers of this country'' and expressed gratitude that we  came together ``to pass this critical legislation before the new  year.''   The Agricultural Council of Arkansas said it ``cannot stress enough  the importance of the farm bill and the need for it among Arkansas  farmers.'' The council went on to add ``a farm bill with meaningful  support is critical in preventing significant harm to Arkansas farms.''   The Arkansas Rice Federation said the farm bill will provide  ``certainty in such a variable agricultural climate.''   Along with strengthening key risk management tools for our farmers,  the farm bill also helps our rural communities by authorizing key  economic development and job creation programs. It helps rural  Arkansans with everything from combating the opioid crisis, to home  financing, to high-speed internet access.   Sending this bill to the President is about as important as it gets  for my State. It would not have been as beneficial to Arkansas farmers  and ranchers without the diligent efforts of the conference committee  leadership who worked to ensure that the harmful, arbitrary policy  changes were excluded from the final conference report. As a result of  these efforts, family farms are protected from additional regulations  and unnecessary paperwork.   I commend Chairmen Roberts and Conway, as well as Ranking Members  Stabenow and Peterson, for their commitment to make this bill fair and  equitable to the diverse needs of producers across all regions of the  country.   Again, as always, special thanks to the staffs who do so much hard  work around here to get these things done. It was a heavy lift. They  worked hard to ensure that we would get this done before adjourning  this Congress.   I would also like to thank them for their willingness to include  provisions that I advocated for in the conference report. The  elimination of all State performance bonuses in SNAP is something I  pushed for in the last farm bill. I am pleased that this time we got it  included. The Federal Government partners with States to administer  SNAP, but in order to best serve program recipients, the States must be  good partners. Unfortunately, States have exaggerated their performance  to receive these bonuses. This policy change saves $48 million per  year. Is a smart reform that we have made in this bill.   I was particularly proud that another provision, championed by my  friend Senator Heitkamp and by me, was included. It would allow trade  promotion funding for agricultural products to be used in Cuba. This is  a big win for our farmers and ranchers who have consistently been  working to open up more access to the Cuban market.   Cuba imports approximately 80 percent of its food, and our farmers  and ranchers produce the highest quality, lowest cost, and safest food  in the world.   Additionally, I welcomed the inclusion of my provision that clarifies  the definition of livestock to include live fish for purposes of the  Department of Transportation's hours of service regulations, as well as  reauthorization of the ATTRA Program, which does so much to help our  veterans who want to get started in agriculture, and reauthorization of  the Delta Regional Authority.   The farm bill conference report includes a true investment in  conservation to help the waterfowl in Arkansas, and I was excited to  see the Century Farms Act that Senator Murphy and I authored was also a  part of the package.   With approval of the conference report last week, we are just one  step away from the farm bill becoming law. President Trump has  indicated his support of a farm bill that will ensure certainty and  predictability for producers. We are sending one his way, and I look  forward to it becoming law.   With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, today I wish to recognize and highlight  the significant contributions of Megan Parrott, my 2018 Air Force  fellow. SMSgt Megan Parrott began her fellowship in my office in  January and immediately became an invaluable member of my staff. Her  work as a part of my national security team has been beneficial in the  efforts of my office to advocate and improve life for servicemembers,  veterans, and Arkansans.   Megan was born in Longbranch, NJ, and enlisted in the Air Force in  1999.   In her 19-year military career, both on Active Duty and in the  Reserves, Megan has excelled in her work. A career maintainer, Megan  has served as a lead technician, flying crew chief, section chief, and  flight line production superintendent. As a testament to her  capabilities, in February 2012, Megan was selected for a position on  the joint staff, working for the Senior Enlisted Advisor to the  Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. In that position she was the  program manager and confidential adviser on matters including joining  forces, the Women in Service Review, the Yellow Ribbon Program, and  personnel readiness.   She has used her extensive experience in the Air Force and the joint  staff to help me serve Arkansans. Throughout her tenure on my staff,  Megan demonstrated the Air Force core values of ``Integrity First,  Service Before Self, and Excellence In All We Do.'' I relied upon  Megan's input on all matters of defense and veterans' policy. Megan  drafted legislation, recommended policy positions, staffed me at Senate  Veterans' Affairs Committee hearings, represented me in meetings, and  helped support my priorities during the appropriations process. She  also assisted me in my role as a cochair of the Senate Air Force  Caucus. Megan supported multiple congressional delegation trips to Air  Force bases and coordinated meetings between Senators, the Secretary of  the Air Force, and the Chief of Staff of the Air Force.   Megan was well versed in the subject matter and fully steeped in  research, and she always supplemented her knowledge with insights from  her personal experience as a senior enlisted leader in the military. In  true senior NCO fashion, Megan made time during her year as a fellow to  mentor junior members of my staff, providing career advice, offering  information about executive branch functions, and talking about  professional development opportunities.   As the son of an Air Force master sergeant, I am especially proud to  have hosted an enlisted fellow this year. I am only surprised that  Megan is not yet a chief master sergeant, and I look forward to  attending her promotion to chief in the very near future.   Megan, thank you for all you have done for Arkansas while working on  my staff. To her husband Chris--also an Air Force senior enlisted  leader--and their two daughters, Natalie and Emily, I say thank you for  sharing your amazing wife and mother with my team this year.                            ____________________
