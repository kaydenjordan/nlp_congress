 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to speak in support of H.R.  500, the Financial Exploitation Prevention Act of 2023. I thank my  colleague, the gentlewoman from Missouri, for introducing this  legislation.   Too often, our offices receive desperate calls from seniors who have  been exploited by scammers who coerced them into making bad or risky  investments and cost them all or most of their life savings. These  calls are especially heartbreaking as our seniors are the ones who have  sacrificed so much to build our country into the incredible Nation that  it is today.   That is why the Financial Exploitation Prevention Act codifies a  process by which seniors and vulnerable adults in our country are given  a tool they can use to fight back: time.   By delaying the transfer of funds and verifying that the true will of  the accountholder is being exercised, we can, hopefully, prevent more  of these tragic calls and circumstances from happening in the first  place--as my colleague pointed out, $2.9 billion a year in fraud  perpetrated upon our seniors.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the Senate to join us in passing this commonsense  legislation into law to protect our seniors and our most vulnerable  residents across our country.    Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to bring this body's attention  to the urgent need to provide tax relief for families in districts like  mine.   Folks in the Hudson Valley are facing an affordability crisis due to  record inflation, skyrocketing energy costs, and the arbitrary cap on  State and local taxes, otherwise known as SALT, placed on residents of  States like New York in 2017.   It effectively leads to double taxation in a part of our country  which already pays among the highest taxes in the Nation. In Rockland  and Westchester Counties, for instance, we pay the highest property  taxes in the country, averaging well over $10,000.   That is why I have introduced legislation, with bipartisan support of  my colleagues Representatives D'Esposito and Sherrill, to begin to  address this. The SALT Marriage Penalty Elimination Act would correct  the flaw created by the original SALT cap that penalizes married  couples filing jointly by lifting their deduction to $20,000 rather  than $10,000. This small change would significantly help families in my  district and across the country.   Ultimately, we need to repeal this arbitrary cap in full, but in the  meantime, we can take concrete steps to provide hardworking taxpayers  in New York and across the country real tax relief.                            ____________________
