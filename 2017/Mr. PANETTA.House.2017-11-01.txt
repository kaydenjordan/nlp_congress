 Mr. Speaker, I appreciate Mr. Lipinski's kind words, but  I  [[Page H8380]]  think he and I know best that we had good teachers to help us  understand what it takes to get things done here in the United States  Congress, and, most importantly, that is the ability to work together.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to stand here today with all of my  colleagues, Republicans and Democrats, who are on the Climate Solutions  Caucus. As you have heard tonight, and as we know, the Climate  Solutions Caucus is a bipartisan caucus that gives Democrats and  Republicans the opportunity to sit down and to discuss ways not only to  protect our environment, but to protect our homes, our Nation's  economy, and our Nation's security.   Yes, this caucus consists of people from separate political parties,  but all of us are united in our belief that we must have this dialogue  to defend our future.   Being from the central coast of California, where we have over 120  miles of stunning coastline in my district, we understand the  vulnerability that comes with rising sea levels, something that can  impact our economy, our security, and, of course, our daily lives.   The co-chairs of the Climate Solutions Caucus, Florida  Representatives Carlos Curbelo and Ted Deutch, they understand and they  appreciate that threat, for earlier this year Florida was pummeled by  Hurricane Irma and the subsequent severe flooding, a storm that  affected the lives of millions of Americans and cost billions in  recovery and cleanup efforts.   We have seen that at times of crisis like that, despite the damage  and despite our differences, our government and even this Congress can  come together and put back together those communities. That is our  government during an emergency, and at times where there are storms,  where there is damage, we are motivated to come together and govern.   This year, my district saw this type of governing due to damage it  suffered during the major winter storms earlier in 2017.                                time  2045    Every county in my district saw devastation. One county in  particular, Monterey County, suffered an extreme amount of damage--the  town of Big Sur, along the coast of California, in particular. The  northern route of Highway 1, going into Big Sur, suffered a knockout of  a major bridge. The southern route had a major landslide, leaving that  community isolated.   But I can tell you, 2 weeks ago, I stood on the brand-new bridge that  was built. And as I was standing there, to me, it was a story of the  people of Big Sur, very resilient, always coming back from these types  of situations. But it was also the story of government working, people  and government coming together, getting things done to help people.   Now, just prior to that, I had read a New York Times editorial, where  the title of that editorial was, ``We Used to Build Things.'' And it  was by David Brooks, and he talked about this big fire called the Big  Burn, back in the early 1900s, that started in Washington and Oregon  and spread throughout the upper West, all the way into Montana. And  from that devastating fire arose something, and that was the U.S.  Forest Service.   When I read that article, it reminded me that, throughout the history  of this Nation, we have always built things to help people. We have  engineered infrastructure to energize our economy, and we have expanded  agencies to embolden and to empower our communities and the people who  live there.   So now, after the storms on the West Coast, after the flooding in the  Midwest, and after the hurricanes on the East Coast, it is our turn. It  is time for this generation, our generation, to build things in a smart  and resilient fashion, so that future generations are secure and safe  in their homes and in their communities. And we need to start by  focusing on and building infrastructure that is strong and stable to  sustain the inevitable intense storms of the future.   Now, we know, and what has been confirmed by the nonpartisan Federal  Government Accountability Office, that extreme weather events are  already costing U.S. taxpayers billions and billions of dollars each  year. According to that GAO report, the Federal Government spent more  than $350 billion over the last decade on losses to private property  and disaster assistance programs from natural disasters.   Now, that amount doesn't even include the massive price tag on the  recovery effort from this year's hurricanes and fires that are expected  to be amongst the costliest in our Nation's history. And we know that  it is going to get worse as storms are more intense, and recovery  efforts are going to cost more. So we need to recognize and we need to  realize the need for smart rebuilding.   Now, after the 2012 hurricane up in New York, Hurricane Sandy, there  was a Rebuilding Task Force that was put together, and it recommended  that Federal flood protection measures should entail that projects  receiving Federal dollars, they should comply with elevation and flood- proofing measures to avoid rebuilding them after future storms. The  report wanted to ensure that we do not need to pay multiple times to  repair for flooding damages in flood-impacted areas.   In 2015, the administration put forward the Federal Flood Risk  Management Standard. That was a standard that set out that federally  financed infrastructure projects must be built to withstand future  storms and flooding. That standard was meant to ensure that taxpayer  dollars are spent wisely and communities are protected.   However, in August, this administration decided to roll back the  Federal Flood Risk Management Standard, a decision that was compounded  by its poor timing, as it was announced 2 weeks before the hurricanes  that ripped apart Houston, Florida, and Puerto Rico.   So last month, Congressman Curbelo and I introduced the Federal  Infrastructure Flood Resiliency Act, a bipartisan bill that ensures  that Federal agencies complete implementation of a Federal Flood Risk  Management Standard; such a standard that will not just benefit our  coastal communities, it will help our government, and it will help our  country, because we know that every dollar that is invested in flood  mitigation efforts results in $4 in saved flood recovery costs. This is  something that Republicans and Democrats understand.   After Hurricane Harvey, the Governor of Texas, Mr. Abbott, stated:  ``As we go through the build-out phase, and rebuilding Texas, part of  our focus must be on rebuilding in a way that will prevent a disaster  like this from happening again.''   Mr. Speaker, by investing in more resilient project designs, our  communities will be able to recover quickly, and they will be protected  against any future flooding. Taking these prudent steps will save  taxpayer dollars and prevent future loss of life and property. It is a  commonsense step that we can take toward responsible, bipartisanship  governing; and it is this type of governing that needs to happen all  the time.   Now, when I stood on that bridge, and I was there celebrating the  reopening of that bridge, the reopening to Big Sur, I also thought that  this was government at its best, where the government came together, it  responded, it reacted in record fashion, and it reconstructed a major  bridge.   So yes, it made me proud, but it also made me realize that we need to  stop just governing by crisis. We need to start governing with  leadership. We need to come together to get things done, not just in  emergency situations, not just for natural disasters of today, but we  need to start governing for tomorrow.   The Climate Solutions Caucus understands and believes that we, in  Congress, need to lead. We need to do that by coming together. We do  that by talking about the effects of climate change. We do that with  Flood Risk Management Standard legislation, and we don't necessarily do  it for us. We do it for our children.   That is leadership, and that is why I am proud to be on the Climate  Solutions Caucus.
