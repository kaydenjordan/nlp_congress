 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember  Reverend Otis Livingston, a decorated veteran and lifelong resident of  Decatur, Illinois, who passed away a few weeks ago at the age of 90.   With the exception of his military service, Otis spent his entire  life in Decatur. He graduated from Decatur Public Schools and spent 33  years working as a lead operator at A.E. Staley's.   During the Korean war, Otis served as a combat medic in the 15th  Medical Division and the 1st Cavalry Division. For his bravery, Otis  was awarded a Bronze Star and a medal from the President of South  Korea.   Otis was strong in his faith and dedicated himself to serving God and  his neighbors. He served in numerous church and community positions,  including chaplain for the Macon County Jail.   It was in this role that he and his wife were inspired by the need to  minister to the incarcerated. They founded Reach Prison Ministry, which  has served central Illinois communities for decades.   Otis was a very well-loved part of the Decatur community for years.  He was a true example of public service, and he led others to faith by  his faith. I know the impact he has left on Decatur, and I know that he  will be truly missed.                           Honoring Craig Lindvahl     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember  Craig Lindvahl, a native of my hometown of Taylorville, who passed away  earlier this year after a 4-year battle with pancreatic cancer.   Craig was an award-winning educator, filmmaker, composer, and author.  He was a teacher in the Teutopolis School District for 34 years. He  followed his parents, Ron and Ann, who taught me in the Taylorville  schools. My prayers go out to both of them.   Craig started the Creating Entrepreneurial Opportunities program in  Effingham, a yearlong course for high school students designed to  utilize partnerships that provide an overview of business development  and processes. Today, over 200 schools offer the program that Craig  created for their students.   Craig was dedicated to his students. He served on the Illinois State  Board of Education, and, in 2015, Craig was honored as the Effingham  County Citizen of the Year. He also won an Emmy Award.   As many know, Craig's mantra for himself was: ``Who will be better  because of what I do today?'' I think it is safe to say that everyone  who knew Craig is better for it. He impacted so many throughout his  life, and he will not be forgotten.                            ____________________
