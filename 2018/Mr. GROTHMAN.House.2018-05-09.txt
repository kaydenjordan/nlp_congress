 Mr. Speaker, I am proud today to speak about the  Workplace Choice and Flexibility for Individuals with Disabilities Act.   This legislation is a solution that will go a long way towards  increasing opportunities for people with different abilities and will  allow the promise of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act,  which was passed in 2014, to be fulfilled.   Unfortunately, since the time that that act was passed, unnecessary  roadblocks have been thrown up in the way of people who want to work in  work centers for people with disabilities.   These work centers, first of all, frequently provide a great  opportunity for people to work; and secondly, provide job training that  can be used by people as they get out in the community, which is the  goal of so many people.   Let us not put these people in a straitjacket and say that between  ages 19 and 25 you cannot or should not be able to work in work  centers.   I know many of the employees at these work centers. They do a  tremendous job, and it is time to expand options for people with  different abilities.   This bill is not threatening WIOA. It is embracing the goals of WIOA.                            ____________________
