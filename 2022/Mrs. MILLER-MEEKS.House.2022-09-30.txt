 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize October  as National Depression and Mental Health Screening Month and next week  as Mental Illness Awareness Week.   National Depression and Mental Health Screening Month is aimed to  raise awareness of the need for accessible mental health screenings and  to provide support to people facing mental health conditions, ensuring  that they don't feel alone.   The National Alliance of Mental Illness study found that one in five  people in Iowa navigates the reality of living with a mental health  condition. Mental health affects everyone, and it is important that  Congress implements legislation to support Americans who are  struggling.   I am proud of the work that Congress and the FCC have done to  implement the 988 crisis hotline, which has changed the 10-digit  hotline to a 3-digit number that everyone can remember.   The hotline provides immediate support around the clock, but Congress  can and should do more. I hope my colleagues will take this month to  reflect on our current system and think of ways we can expand mental  health resources, perhaps changing it to brain health.
