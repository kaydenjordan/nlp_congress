 Mr. President, I rise to recognize the 99th  birthday of Norman Lear, a man who came to Hollywood and entertained  the Nation, then dedicated his life to bettering it as a champion for  progressive values.   Born in 1922, Norman Lear served bravely in the Air Force during  World  [[Page S5097]]  War II, flying 52 combat missions over Europe. After the war, he made  his way to California and struck out as a television writer. Norman  Lear's sitcoms were beloved for their humor, empathy, and willingness  to dive into the lives of diverse characters. His innovative shows  reached more than 120 million viewers per week in the 1970s and `80s.   And yet, in the midst of this success, Norman Lear put his career on  hold because, once again, he felt called to serve his country.  Distressed by the rise of radical rightwing activists, Norman Lear  founded People for the American Way in 1980 and became a champion of  American constitutional values.   Through his writing, producing, and activism, Norman Lear has  strengthened our democracy. He has championed free expression, civic  participation, and equal justice for all. He even bought a copy of the  Declaration of Independence to send on a 50-State tour, bringing  Americans closer to our founding ideals and encouraging voter  registration, a cause that is dear to me.   Today, at 99, Norman Lear is still fighting for progressive values.  He also continues to produce some of the funniest and wisest works for  the screen, highlighting the diverse experiences that make America  stronger.   I want to offer Norman Lear my best wishes for the first day of his  100th year and my thanks for his dedication to bettering the lives of  so many.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise to recognize the 50th  anniversary of Tapatio, a family-run company from the great State of  California that exemplifies the American Dream.   Jose-Luis Saavedra, the founder of Tapatio, immigrated to California  from Guadalajara, Mexico. He started out working in the aerospace  industry, and he often shared a delicious homemade salsa with his  coworkers. In 1971, after a recession shut down the plant where he  worked, Mr. Saavedra decided to try perfecting and selling his hot  sauce.   Tapatio was born out of a small kitchen in Maywood, CA, and continues  its operations to this day in Vernon, CA. With the hard work and  innovation of Mr. Saavedra, his wife, and his children, Tapatio grew in  popularity and size, spreading from small groceries in East Los Angeles  to stores and restaurants around the country.   Today, Tapatio is known for introducing the flavors of Guadalajara  around the world. It now produces about 200,000 bottles of Tapatio a  day and exports globally to about 30 countries. The company has even  developed single-serving packets of its signature hot sauce to meet the  demand from American servicemembers stationed abroad and at least one  U.S. Senator.   Tapatio has remained a family-run business for 50 years, employing  three generations of the Saavedra family. It is more than an immigrant  success story, Tapatio is an icon of cultural ambassadorship. According  to Mr. Saavedra, the Smithsonian Institute displayed a bottle of  Tapatio to showcase the brand's role in spreading positive images of  Latino culture.   I congratulate Tapatio on reaching this historic milestone, serving  as an important reminder of the cultural and economic contributions of  immigrants to our country, and keeping the American dream alive for  future generations.                            ____________________
