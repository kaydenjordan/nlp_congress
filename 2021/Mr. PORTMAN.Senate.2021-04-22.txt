 Madam President, I appreciate the thoughtful comments  from my colleague from Oklahoma of the need for us to have an  independent judiciary.   I am on the floor to talk about a different issue, and it is the  latest, very troubling information that we are receiving regarding the  addiction epidemic and specifically drug overdose deaths in the United  States. I am also going to talk about some of the steps we can take  right now to address that reality.   One of the top priorities I have had in this body and in the House  has been this drug addiction issue. Frankly, this is a moment of  frustration because we were making progress, and then COVID-19 hit.  Unfortunately, the drug epidemic has hit my State of Ohio particularly  hard. The latest data from the Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention, the CDC, show that it is a pretty grim picture right now,  and it should be a wake-up call to all of us. Overdose deaths rose  nearly 30 percent nationwide from September 2019 to September 2020.  During this time period, you can see the overdose deaths numbers going  up dramatically.   This is heartbreaking for me because we were making progress. After  literally decades of increases in drug overdose deaths every single  year--decades--going back to the 1990s, we finally here in the 2017,  2018, 2019 periods began to make progress in reducing overdose deaths.  In fact, in Ohio, we had a 24-percent decrease in overdose deaths  during 1 year, 2018, but, right now, the numbers are getting higher and  higher, and it is everywhere.   As you can see from this chart, if something is in any of these  colors, this means that there is an increase in overdose deaths. If it  is in blue, it means there is a decrease, and this was just during this  period of September  [[Page S2156]]  2019 to September 2020, the latest data for which we have good  information. It doesn't even include all of 2020, and as we know, the  pandemic, unfortunately, went all the way through 2020 and into 2021.  All of the data show that, as you got further into the pandemic, we had  higher rates, so we expect, when the final data come out for 2020, it  will be even higher.   Here is where we are now. Look at this. Other than the State of South  Dakota, every single State has seen an increase--and a substantial  increase in many cases--in overdose deaths. This is in 49 of 50 States.  In my own State of Ohio, there has been about a 25-percent increase in  overdose deaths during this period.   Only a few years ago, again, we were making progress. One reason that  we had begun to turn the tide was because of work that had been done  here in the U.S. Congress. Right around this time period, we passed  legislation called the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act. We  also passed legislation called the 21st Century Cures Act. Both were  signed into law in 2016. So it would have been in this period. It  became effective in this period and actually helped to reduce overdose  deaths for the first time in decades.   I commend my colleagues for that legislation. It was the first time  we had ever funded recovery, as an example. We also funded prevention  and treatment and provided our law enforcement with more naloxone, this  miracle drug that reverses the effects of an overdose. Many of my  colleagues have had the opportunity to speak with their local addiction  boards or have been with law enforcement or other first responders-- firefighters--who have used this naloxone effectively to save lives.   So things were getting better until we saw this big increase in  connection with the coronavirus pandemic. The stresses of this  unprecedented time, clearly, have contributed to the spike in drug  abuse. People have felt lonelier. People have felt more isolated.  Specifically, people have not been able to get access to recovery  programs. Being in person with a recovery coach is a whole lot  different than being on a Zoom call. That is what I hear from  recovering addicts, and it makes sense.   I will say that people have turned to drugs to cope during this tough  period, but also, many of those who are in recovery have been stalled  in their progress because of their inability to be with other  recovering addicts. So part of the best practices and best scientific  evidence we have is that an effective way to help people overcome their  addictions is to be with other people who also have those addictions.  We have known this for years in terms of alcohol treatment programs--AA  and so on--but this has been one of the problems.   Another issue I am going to raise, which apparently is somewhat  controversial, but I hear it from the experts--and those are the people  on the ground, in the field, who are dealing with this issue--is that,  when we here in Congress provided lump sums to all Americans under a  certain income--and you will remember the individual payments--they  didn't go out right away because our State offices couldn't process  them quickly enough, particularly with regard to unemployment  insurance, wherein our workers' comp and our unemployment offices could  not get the money out the door on a weekly basis but could  retroactively provide those funds.   We had individuals getting--instead of $300 a week or $600 a week-- $10,000 a week because it was an accumulation of many weeks. People  were owed that, but getting these big lump sums was not helpful in the  context of many people who were in recovery because it led to their  purchasing drugs and it led to what we are finding out--again, back  home--in talking to the experts, were some of the reasons you had this  spike. So there are a lot of reasons here.   I guess what we need to focus on now is, How do we get beyond this?   These deaths are happening away from the national headlines because  the coronavirus is taking the national headlines, understandably. A  story just last week, from a news station in Dayton, OH, summed it up  perfectly with a quote from Lori Erion, who is the founding president  of Families of Addicts.   She said:         During the pandemic, addiction and families struggling with       it haven't gone anywhere. We have been here the whole time.    But they have not gotten much notice. There were 87,000 people who  died from overdoses in the September 2019 to the September 2020 period  we talked about. There were 87,000 Americans who died. If not for the  COVID-19 pandemic, I don't think we would have seen this increase--from  everything we are hearing if the correlation is almost precise--but  also we would be hearing a lot more about the addiction crisis and  doing more about it here.   We did put some funding into the CARES Act and into the two most  recent COVID-19 packages to help with behavioral health, people's  mental health, and also with addiction. That has been helpful, but we  need to go much broader and do something much more comprehensive to  take this moment to recommit ourselves to fighting addiction and  ensuring that more Americans don't continue to lose their lives to  overdoses. We have bipartisan legislation that has been introduced that  we have been working on with a lot of people on the outside to try to  come up with some new ideas, some ways to address this problem.    In the 5 years since this Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery  legislation has become law, which was in part the reason we saw this  reduction--also, a lot of great work was done at the local level and  the State level--the substantial, several billion-dollar commitment we  made here in this Chamber for more prevention, treatment, and longer  term recovery with naloxone and so on, made a difference, but it has  been 5 years.   During that time, I have visited with literally hundreds of different  organizations in my home State. I have also just talked to a lot of  experts about this. I have been to a lot of nonprofits, from Cleveland  to Cincinnati and from Portsmouth to Toledo. I have talked to literally  hundreds of recovering addicts about what works and what doesn't work  for them.   There is legislation that we are introducing now, which we call CARA  3.0. We had the first Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, and we  had a second one back in 2018, a smaller one. Now we have this new,  bipartisan CARA 3.0 legislation. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse is my  coauthor, but we have a number of Members who have joined up to help,  and it addresses three major areas.   One is research and education. We still need to find out more, and we  still need to get better research and better alternatives to opioids to  deal with pain because much of this is being driven, as you know, from  opioids--both heroin and prescription drugs but also these new  synthetic opioids, which are the deadliest of all.   Second, we focus on education. Getting the prevention message out  there is incredibly important to keep people from coming into the  funnel of addiction in the first place, which is incredibly powerful  and effective.   Third, of course, are treatment programs.   The fourth is recovery. Again, Congress had never funded recovery  before; yet all of the best science shows that these recovery programs,  when done properly, can be incredibly helpful, and longer term  recovery, unfortunately, is needed, which is costly, but the  alternative is worse.   Finally, there is criminal justice reform, which I will talk about in  a moment.   It will bolster our work to prevent drug abuse before it happens  through funding for research and education. A new national drug  awareness campaign is part of this legislation, and the research and  development of alternative pain treatment methods that don't lead to  addiction is part of it.   CARA 3.0 will also take the important step of addressing the  disproportionate effect the addiction crisis has had on people in  poverty and communities of color. Unfortunately, during this increase,  we have seen a higher percentage of overdoses in communities of color.  A national commission has been formed to look at this issue to better  develop treatments and best practices to avoid overdoses.   Second, our bill will build on what works and how we treat addiction.  It will double down on proven, evidence-based addiction treatment  methods  [[Page S2157]]  while expanding treatment options for groups that are particularly  vulnerable to addiction, including young people, new and expecting  mothers, rural community residents, and communities of color-- individuals who live in those communities. One of the things that we  have learned through, again, evidence-based research into what works  and what doesn't work is that medication-assisted treatment, when done  properly, can be very effective.   It will also make permanent the current expanded telehealth options  for addiction treatment that were created temporarily in response to  the social distancing required by the COVID-19 pandemic. This is really  important. Telehealth is one of the few silver linings in an otherwise  very dark cloud of the coronavirus pandemic. Yet, for many individuals,  telehealth was effective, particularly with regard to behavioral health  and addiction services. So we want to be sure that the temporary  ability to pay for those telehealth visits, as an example, through  Medicaid as an example or Medicare, can continue past the pandemic.   CARA 3.0 will also bolster the recovery options for individuals who  are working to put addiction behind them through funding to support  recovery support services and networks. It will enable physicians to  provide medication-assisted addiction treatments, like methadone, to a  greater number of patients and change the law to allow these drugs to  be prescribed via telehealth for a greater ease of access. This will  require a change in legislation to allow people to provide these kinds  of treatments.   Our bill will also destigmatize addiction recovery in the workplace  by ensuring that taking one of these medications--again, medications to  get people over their addictions--will not count as a drug-free  workplace violation. This may seem like an obvious change, but,  unfortunately, it will take a change of law to be able to make that  happen.   Finally, CARA 3.0 reforms our criminal justice system to ensure that  those who are struggling with addiction, including our veterans, are  treated with fairness and compassion by the law, putting them on a path  to recovery instead of into a downward spiral of drug abuse.   Importantly, CARA 3.0 funds a Department of Justice grant program to  help incarcerated individuals who are struggling with addiction to  receive medication-assisted treatment while they are still in the  criminal justice system. Again, that may seem like a pretty obvious  solution, but there are people who go into the system addicted, and  they come out addicted. They are not given the treatment options when  they are incarcerated, and they simply go back to lives of addiction.  Those people have high rates of recidivism, clearly. Most are  rearrested and are back in the system within a relatively short period  of time.   So this will reduce recidivism, repeat offenses. It makes sense for  the person addicted, and it certainly makes sense for the community,  with fewer crimes being committed. It also makes a lot of sense for the  taxpayer because that treatment, although there is an additional  expense while in the criminal justice system, will have a much better  chance of getting those people back to lives wherein they can go back  to work, back to their families, be in recovery, and not be back in the  expensive criminal justice system. So it is a win-win-win.   CARA and CARA 2.0 gave States and local communities new resources and  authorities to make a real difference in my State and others. CARA 3.0  renews and strengthens those programs, and given the recent spike in  addiction we see here, it provides a significant boost in funding as  well. When added with the existing CARA programs that were authorized  through 2023, we will be investing well over $1 billion per year to  address this longstanding epidemic, putting us on the path toward a  brighter future free from addiction.   Another important part of CARA 3.0 is our bipartisan legislation to  build on this expanded telehealth option for addiction services.   It was necessary during the pandemic to have it because of social  distancing. We found out that, although there is no substitute for  face-to-face interaction, telehealth has kept patients in touch with  their doctors and allowed physicians to prescribe medication-assisted  treatment remotely.   It doesn't make sense to get rid of these options once the pandemic  goes away, so again, CARA 3.0 included legislation we had previously  introduced separately called the Telehealth Response for E-Prescribing  Addiction Therapy, or the TREATS Act, to make permanent a number of  temporary waivers for telehealth services and bolster telehealth  options for addiction treatment services.   Specifically, it does a couple things. First, it allows for a patient  to be prescribed these lower scheduled drugs, like SUBOXONE, through  telehealth on their first visit. You can't do that now. Current law  requires you to go in person for a visit when needing an initial  prescription for controlled substances, but this has been a deterrent  to patients in crisis and in urgent need of treatments from schedule  III or schedule IV drugs, like SUBOXONE or certain other drugs for a  co-occurring mental health condition.   It also limits abusive practices by both audio and visual  capabilities to be able to interact with the treatment providers to  reduce fraud and abuse when it is your first visit, and it would also  keep the existing requirements for in-person visits when prescribing  schedule II drugs--these are the harder drugs, like opioids and  stimulants--which are much more prone to being abused through these  telehealth visits.   So we have a provision in there to avoid abuse, but it is also  important to continue this telehealth when other options aren't there.  I think it is a balanced approach that makes sense.   Second, our bill will allow for Medicare to bill for audio only or  telephone telehealth visits for mental health and substance abuse if it  is not the patient's first visit. Due to access to the broadband or  distance, in-person or even video appointments aren't always possible,  particularly for our seniors.   We need to focus on safety and robust treatment options, but in order  to balance the needs of patients, we have proposed to allow our  Nation's seniors under Medicare to use phones for subsequent mental  health or behavioral health visits when they don't have access to the  internet and where fact-to-face interaction isn't possible and isn't as  necessary.   I believe the TREATS Act will make a difference in the addiction  treatment space and will help us prevent more untimely overdoses.   So the legislation I have laid out so far--CARA 3.0 and the TREATS  Act--cover an important aspect of the addiction crisis: the addiction  treatment efforts that help lessen the demand for drugs, which is the  single most important thing, reducing that demand.   But there is also more we have to do on the supply side because as  drugs are pouring into our country, they are at a lower price on the  streets of Cincinnati or Columbus or Cleveland or Dayton or Toledo. So  we do need to do more to curb the supply of these dangerous substances.  This is especially true right now because there is such a critical  crisis ongoing, and there is a looming deadline to keep one class of  very dangerous drugs illegal and off the streets.   I am talking about the kinds of opioids that are--like fentanyl, that  are synthetic opioids but have a slight molecular change. So unless we  act here in Congress, they will no longer be scheduled, no longer be  illegal.   Data from the CDC, again, shows that the biggest driver to this surge  in overdose deaths that we see here comes from fentanyl, comes from  these synthetic opioids. They are often far more deadly than  traditional opioids, like heroin. In fact, fentanyl is 50 times more  powerful than heroin. A pound of fentanyl is lethal enough to kill a  half a million people. And fentanyl, as you will find out talking to  your law enforcement folks and others in the treatment space, it is  often now being laced with other drugs, like cocaine, like crystal meth  or heroin.   Most of this synthetic opioid is being illegally manufactured in  China and then smuggled across our borders, either coming in through  the mail system or going to Mexico and then being smuggled across.   There is also evidence now that it is also being produced in Mexico,  which is a change and a major concern.   In order to avoid prosecution, prior to 2018, scientists in China-- evil scientists in China--and drug traffickers started making slight  modifications to fentanyl, sometimes adjusting a single  [[Page S2158]]  molecule and creating what are essentially fentanyl copycats.   While these fentanyl-related substances have the same narcotic  properties as fentanyl, their tiny variations allowed them to evade  prosecution. But oftentimes, these similar substances, like  carfentanil, which some of you are aware of, are even deadlier than  fentanyl itself.   To address this, the Drug Enforcement Agency in 2018 used its  authority to temporarily classify all fentanyl-related drugs as  schedule I substances, which allows law enforcement to aggressively  intercept and destroy these substances. Unfortunately, this designation  was only temporary. That is all DEA could do.   So, in 2019, Congress extended that designation until May 6, 2021, so  a 2-year extension until 14 days from now.   If that deadline lapses 14 days from now, criminals who run labs in  China and Mexico will be able to avoid law enforcement as they flood  the United States with unlimited slight variants of fentanyl that are  just as deadly. We can't let that happen.   Let me say that again. At a time when we are experiencing an alarming  rise in overdose deaths that we see here, and fentanyl is the major  culprit, the No. 1 killer, we may face a situation where law  enforcement will lose the ability to aggressively stop these fentanyl  copycats in the United States unless Congress acts in the next 14 days.   Fortunately, we have legislation to do that. Our bipartisan FIGHT  Fentanyl Act, which I introduced with Senator Joe Manchin, will fix  this problem by permanently classifying fentanyl-related drugs as  schedule I drugs. It would give our law enforcement certainty to go  after synthetic opioids in all their forms and show we are committed to  addressing the threat posed by this dangerous class of drugs.    Our proposal is the one bipartisan approach to this in the Senate. We  structured it to address concerns from the criminal justice community  and made sure it does not impose mandatory minimum sentencing under  criminal charges brought under our bill. That has been one of the  concerns expressed, particularly by some on the other side of the  aisle. So we took that out.   I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to come to the table  and support this urgent legislation.   The House just passed a 5-month extension this week. That is, to me,  very sad. Let's make this permanent. There is no reason to do a short- term extension and to create the uncertainty with law enforcement, and,  frankly, to tell these evil scientists in places like China, in 5  months, you are going to be able, potentially--to be able to sell this  substance again without worrying about the law. This makes no sense.  Let's make it permanent. Let's give the DEA the authority to do what  they need to do. And by doing so, let's reduce the amount coming in,  which increases the cost on the street, which is an important step  toward rededicating our efforts to stop these drugs from stealing  thousands of lives and causing so much pain.   In conclusion, I urge my colleagues--our Nation faces a crisis. It is  the coronavirus pandemic that is finally winding down, but it is also  the addiction crisis. It has been happening underneath the coronavirus.  As was said by my constituent--this woman who unfortunately has faced  addiction in her own family--we have been here the whole time, and it  hasn't gotten better; it has gotten worse.   Many of its victims are suffering in silence. We know a lot about  what is going on with COVID. We don't know a lot about what is going on  with this pandemic, this epidemic of drugs.   So let's act now, without delay. We have 14 days until DEA loses the  authority to go after dangerous fentanyl copycats, but we can do  something about it. We can pass legislation right now that will help  people at their point of pain, as well as provide law enforcement the  tools to cut off the source of their suffering--both the CARA 3.0  legislation to deal with the demand side and the legislation to be sure  this poison can't come into our communities freely.   As the CDC data shows, this is an issue that affects every single one  of us. Forty-nine States have seen a big increase. We know we need to  do it. Let's not wait any longer to get to work once again turning the  tide on our addiction crisis.   I yield the floor.
