 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of  H.R. 2543, the Financial Services Racial Equity, Inclusion, and  Economic Justice Act.   The Financial Services Racial Equity, Inclusion, and Economic Justice  Act would direct the Federal Reserve to provide reports on racial and  ethnic disparities in employment, income, wealth, and access to  affordable credit. It also includes provisions that would establish  language access requirements for creditors and servicers to better  serve borrowers with limited English proficiency, allow all federal  credit unions to expand their membership to include underserved  communities, and clarify that financial institutions be required to  collect their self-identified sexual orientation and gender identity  information to help combat discriminatory practices against lesbian,  gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ+) business owners. This  bill also includes an amendment that I authored with my colleague from  Rhode Island, Congressman Jim Langevin, to require disparities for  individuals with disabilities to be published in the Federal Reserve's  reports.   Let me share a brief example of why this legislation is necessary.  Last year, a local news agency led an investigation in my district that  revealed a long and tragic pattern of discriminatory lending practices  in South Dallas. It became apparent that several banks refused to give  home loans to residents in low-income areas, in direct contradiction to  federal laws protecting borrowers regardless of race or economic  status. This is a failure of both policy and oversight, and is the  exact type of issue that this bill would require the Federal Reserve to  address.   I want to thank Chairwoman Waters and the members of the Financial  Services Committee for bringing the Financial Services Racial Equity,  Inclusion, and Economic Justice Act to the floor. I also want to thank  the Chairwoman for joining my roundtable on the discriminatory lending  practices in South Dallas last year. These stories are not unique to my  district--they are found in communities across the country. That's why  we need a federal approach, and I urge all my colleagues to join me in  supporting this bill.                                time  1330
