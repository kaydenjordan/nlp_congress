 Mr. Speaker, many servicemembers and veterans across the  country who have been exposed to military burn pits are becoming ill.  Many are dying due to cancers and suffering from severe pulmonary and  autoimmune diseases.   We have the chance to end the use of harmful burn pits this week with  my two amendments in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal  Year 2020.   Our military uses burn pits to eliminate dangerous waste, including  chemicals, jet fuels, and batteries, which can emit toxic smoke  containing carcinogens and particulate matter.   In my district, we tragically lost to pancreatic cancer Jennifer  Kepner, a 39-year-old Air Force veteran exposed to burn pits who left  behind her husband and two young children.   We must act now for veterans like Jennifer, for their families, and  for everyone affected by burn pit exposure.   My provisions in the NDAA require the Department of Defense to submit  to Congress an implementation plan to end the use of burn pits and to  inform Congress on all locations where burn pits were used.   These amendments are an important step in the comprehensive plan to  end the use of burn pits. We must do it now.  [[Page H10006]]                                ____________________
