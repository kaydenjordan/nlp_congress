 Madam Speaker, it doesn't take a law degree. It doesn't  take imagination. All it takes is common sense to see that President  Trump's ownership and his family's operation of hotels and golf courses  and rental properties is ripe for corruption.   President Trump's failure to completely divest his ownership interest  not only violates tradition followed by every other modern President,  it is unconstitutional. The Constitution prohibits any U.S. official-- including President Trump--from taking payments from foreign  governments.   His ongoing involvement in The Trump Organization will let foreign  governments funnel payments to his businesses. Foreign operatives will  try to curry favor with the administration with no accountability to  the American people.   When he took the oath of office last week, President Trump swore to  preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States.  Sadly, his refusal to cut his business ties has broken that vow in  these very first days of his administration.                            ____________________
