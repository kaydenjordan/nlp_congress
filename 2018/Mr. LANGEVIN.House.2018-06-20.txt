 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize LGBT Pride  Month, a time to celebrate the diversity of the LGBT community and  honor the strength and courage of LGBT people throughout history.   I was thrilled to attend the annual LGBT Pride Fest this past weekend  in my home State of Rhode Island, a wonderful celebration that  illustrated just how far we have come in the fight for equality.   But the struggle isn't over, Mr. Speaker, and it is more important  than ever that we stay strong and vocal. We, as a society, cannot and  should not accept that LGBT people face discrimination in this country  every day, whether they are in a cake shop, the armed services, or in a  school bathroom.   That is why I am proud to cosponsor the Equality Act, which was  introduced by my good friend and colleague from the Ocean State,  Congressman  David Cicilline, and is cosponsored by 196 of my  colleagues.   Discrimination is never justified. Let's celebrate our diversity and  promote a culture of tolerance and acceptance, not only during Pride,  but every day of the year.                            ____________________
