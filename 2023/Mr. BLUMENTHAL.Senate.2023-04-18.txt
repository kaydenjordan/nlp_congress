 Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart  to pay tribute to Ralph ``Teddy'' Brown, Sr., a dedicated police  officer, community leader, and friend to many. Sadly, Mr. Brown passed  away on March 14, 2023, at the age of 82. He will be remembered for his  commitment to his country and community of West Haven, CT, and his love  for his family.   Born in Ansonia, CT, Teddy served in the U.S. Air Force and was  stationed in Washington State. It was there he met Carroll, who would  become his wife of  [[Page S1206]]  65 years. After Teddy's military service ended, the Browns moved to  West Haven, CT, where they have been deeply enmeshed in the community  for over six decades.   In 1977, at the age of 37, Teddy made history as one of the first  three Black police officers in the city of West Haven. He ably served  the department for 28 years, retiring as a detective sergeant. On the  force, Teddy was known as a positive role model for all, particularly  for West Haven's youngest residents.   After his retirement, Teddy continued his outstanding legacy of  community service. He served as commissioner on West Haven's Parks and  Recreation Board and president of the West Haven Library Board. He  continued to elevate future generations by coaching youth basketball.   Teddy was also one of the strongest supporters of the West Haven  Black Coalition, founded by his wife Carroll in 1986. This long- standing community organization has disbursed more than $200,000 in  scholarships to students, in recognition of their academic  achievements, leadership skills, and community service. For the past 37  years, Teddy was a strong advocate for the coalition, contributing  financially to the scholarships and supporting Carroll's great work.  The West Haven Black Coalition is a remarkable testament to the Browns'  dedication to their community.   Through his decades of service as a law enforcement officer and a  civic leader, Teddy left a lasting impact on everyone around him. But  he will be remembered first and foremost as a man who loved his family.  He led by example as a mentor and a role model to countless young  people.   My wife Cynthia and I extend our deepest sympathies to Teddy's family  during this difficult time, particularly to his wife Carroll, his three  sons, and his grandchildren. May their many wonderful memories of Teddy  be a blessing. I hope my colleagues will join me in honoring Teddy's  life and legacy, both large and lasting.                            ____________________
