 Madam Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the life of  Sergeant First Class Donald Keith Strickland. Donald passed away  recently after a long life of service to his country, his fellow  Americans, and his family.   Standing with me today is my good friend, Representative Alex Mooney  of West Virginia. We are both dear friends of Donald's son, Tony  Strickland, who I served in the legislature with and who has a long  relationship with this great person here.   What you see in a legacy with a man like Donald, who was an Army  staff sergeant, also known as a drill sergeant--which, by the way, the  family home was known as ``strict land'' because it was very strict  there due to that background. The legacy shows the great family that we  know with Tony and his kids and all the wonderful grandchildren that  Mr. Donald Strickland had.   He is survived by his wife, Antonie; his three children; and many  grandchildren and great-grandchildren.   The legacy of how we are measured is truly in your family and what  you leave behind as you touch your country.   For our dear friend Tony, our hearts are with you in the loss of your  father, and God bless you all.                            ____________________
