 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the National Children's  Museum Act. I give great thanks to Eleanor Holmes Norton, Rodney Davis,  Peter DeFazio, and others who worked so hard on this legislation.   Children's museums are extraordinary gifts for the life of the mind.  We give our kids imaginations, dreams, possibilities, and whole new  universes. Children's museums change the trajectories of their lives,  and this is the legacy of the National Children's Museum in the  Nation's Capital.    For decades, the museum was much beloved in the city. We often took  our kids to the old convent in northeast D.C., but after moving in 2004  in order to grow, it has been fighting to get back to its roots ever  since.   We are lucky to have it located now in the Ronald Reagan Building and  International Trade Center, again in the heart of D.C., but still it  faces barriers to reach its past success.   Even though this august body made it a congressionally designated  museum in 2003, it is the only such congressionally designated museum  expected to pay rent in a Federal building. With this bill, the  nonprofit museum will be able to thrive and remain financially viable  and accessible to our Nation's children and work with the GSA in a way  that makes sense.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my friends not just to vote for this bill, but  after we have crushed the pandemic to bring their children and  grandchildren to be thrilled and inspired by our National Children's  Museum.
