 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  Flag Day and celebrate the United States Army's 246th birthday that we  observed on Monday of this week.   Every year, just a few days after Memorial Day, on June 14, our  country celebrates Flag Day and the Army's birthday.   Flag Day is a celebration of our Stars and Stripes, which the Second  Continental Congress designated as the symbol of our Nation on June 14,  1777.   While our flag has changed over the years to celebrate our growing  country, it remains a glorious symbol of hope for our brave servicemen  and -women who salute it; defend it; serve it; and, in some cases, die  for it, to protect our freedom and liberty.   Since our founding, our flag has flown from sea to shining sea and  around the world. Old Glory remains one of the most powerful symbols on  Earth.   June 14 is also the U.S. Army's birthday. Without our Army 246 years  ago, we would not be the great Nation that we are today.   Mr. Speaker, yesterday, our great Nation celebrated our Army and our  flag, both of which symbolize America being the land of the free and  the home of the brave.                            ____________________
