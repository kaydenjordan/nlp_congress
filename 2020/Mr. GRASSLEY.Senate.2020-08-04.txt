 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1  minute in morning business.    Madam President, Iowa's secretary of state Paul Pate  will mail an absentee ballot request form to every registered Iowa  voter for the November election. This is a request form, not a ballot,  being mailed out to everybody.   Iowa's current absentee ballot system allows anyone who wants to vote  by mail the option to do so. Just send in the request form when you  receive it, or you may download it online, but if Iowans prefer to vote  in person, that remains their choice.   There has been a lot of misinformation claiming that some massive,  Federal intervention is needed to allow citizens to vote by mail. This  isn't true in Iowa or elsewhere. Every State has vote-by-mail, and 16  States ask for a reason, such as being over 65, for example, but most  have waived or loosened this requirement.   Some groups are now using the pandemic to push for a Federal mandate  on States to adopt a new, universal vote-by-mail system overnight. It  took 5 years when Washington State implemented voting by mail.  Requiring every State to replace its current voting system with a whole  new, centralized, mail-only system this close to our November election  is a recipe for disaster. In such a system, every registered voter,  including those who have died or moved away, would automatically be  mailed a ballot with no voting in person.   Every Iowan who wants to vote absentee in November can do so, and  those who want to vote in person can also do so safely. It is a voter's  choice and should remain so   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, for the benefit of my colleagues who  want to speak next, I have a 1-minute remark and approximately 5  minutes of remarks.   Today is National Chocolate Chip Cookie Day. It is a perfect day to  salute an Iowa entrepreneur who built a cookie empire at the Iowa State  Fair. Last year, his business sold 2 million chocolate chip cookies  during the 11 days of the fair.   A lifelong salesperson and legendary concessionaire, this 92-year-old  Iowan is in a league of his own. After more than a quarter century  rolling cookie dough at the State fair, Joe Barksdale decided it was  time to hang up his apron. However, his legacy will continue for  generations to come. He is paying it forward by giving back to the  people of Iowa. Joe gifted his legendary cookie recipe to the Iowa  State Fair so that its profits could be reinvested for years to come.   As of today, Barksdale's State Fair Cookies has a brand new home. The  permanent cookie building will shorten customer wait times with a dozen  sales windows. For anyone who hasn't tasted this State delicacy, I  suggest you put it on your bucket list.                            ____________________     On another matter, Madam President, Iowa is home to  86,000 family farms and leads the Nation in the production of  commodities, such as corn, where we are No. 1; soybeans, No. 2; pork,  and eggs, No. 1. Iowa also ranks in the top 10 in cattle production, as  many family farms raise livestock alongside their corn and soybeans.   The 2017 USDA Census of Agriculture showed over 23,000 farms in Iowa  that raise cattle or calves, with annual sales of $4.7 billion. Caring  for livestock takes a spirit of commitment, selflessness, and, of  course, hard work. These farmers get up very, very early in the  morning, work on their farms all day, and are active members of their  communities. These families and their values form the foundation of  what makes up our rural communities across Iowa.   However, over the years, the consolidation of the beef industry has  threatened the very livelihood of these families and rural communities  where they reside. From the 2012 USDA Agriculture Census to the 2017  Agriculture Census, Iowa lost nearly 1,500 cattle producers. This is  not a new issue to the beef industry. The concern of fair and  transparent cattle pricing has seen increased attention due to  disruptions in our food supply chain. It has been very obvious during  this period of the virus pandemic.   For background, the U.S. Department of Agriculture mandates price  reporting for live cattle and tracks the spread between fed cattle  prices--what the producer gets paid--and the boxed beef values, which  is what the packing company gets paid.   For the years 2016 to 2018, this spread averaged about $21 per  hundredweight. Soon I will be comparing that to a very, very big  increase from that $21. However, during April and May, there were major  beef supply disruptions, as large numbers of plant workers contracted  COVID-19. Because there are only four companies that slaughter 80- percent of the cattle, companies have the advantage of purchasing  cattle from thousands of producers, acting as a chokepoint for the  entire industry. These packers dominate the marketplace and limit  opportunities for price negotiation.   During this time, in these recent months, packer profit margins  topped out at a spread of $279 per hundredweight compared to the $21  that I previously mentioned. This was the largest spread between the  price of fed cattle and the price of boxed beef since the inception of  the mandatory price reporting law of 2001. So while all the packers  were making record profits, the independent producer had nowhere even  to market his livestock.   It is important to note that the impact of consolidation doesn't just  hurt producers. It hurts consumers. We have seen the price of ground  beef and steaks--a staple in many American diets--double or triple  recently. Grocery stores also limited the amount of meat that families  could buy. All this has made it very clear that the cattle market is  broken and real action is needed to fix it.   Thankfully, the Trump administration stepped up to this cause. It has  responded with two decisive actions to address the country's cattle  market. First, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Department of  Justice are both investigating the practices of these packing  companies, particularly the four that dominate the market. While this  will take time, President Trump has personally asked for these  investigations and said he did it because he wants to protect the  family farmer.   Second, on July 22, the USDA issued a significant report that lays  out a roadmap to fix the cattle marketplace. The U.S. Department of  Agriculture mentions 12 different ways to create additional price  discovery, increase marketplace competition, and have a more  transparent relationship between the price of live cattle and the beef  products that the consumer buys.   This investigation and report are very much a breath of fresh air,  particularly for this Senator who has been bringing this issue to the  attention of Agriculture Department and Justice Departments under both  Republican and Democratic administrations for a long period of time. We  have had multiple administrations from Democrats to Republicans  ignoring independent cattle producers and the broken cattle market. So  I am very grateful that President Trump and Secretary Perdue  [[Page S4705]]  take this issue seriously, when so many others before them have ignored  this problem.   In the report issued by Secretary Perdue, one of the considerations  for Congress is to create a mechanism to mandate negotiated cash  trades. I am getting to one of the very key reasons why I am on the  floor today, because I see some of the actions in this report from  Secretary Perdue as almost an endorsement of the Grassley-Tester 50/14  concept.   The Grassley-Tester bill will require half of packers' weekly volume  of beef slaughter to come as a result of purchases made on the cash  market. The fact is that without a mandated amount of cash trade,  independent producers become residual suppliers and then lack the  leverage to fairly negotiate with packing companies.   Besides the Grassley-Tester bill, Congress has the responsibility to  fully vet the 11 other considerations that the Trump administration  lays out in its report. The Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry  Committee should hold hearings on this road map. We should bring a  diverse set of stakeholders, government officials, business executives,  and subject matter experts to explain the challenges that cattle  producers are facing. The hearings would allow the committee to  properly vet proposals to improve mandatory price reporting, which  needs to be reauthorized by September 30 of this year.   The beef industry employs hundreds of thousands of hard-working men  and women who work each day to help feed our country and, because we  export so much, you can say feed the world.   As the U.S. Department of Agriculture Census shows, we are losing  producers due to consolidation. We need to show these men and women  that Washington, DC, is listening. We need to show our rural  communities that we want them to survive. We must develop solutions to  the problems that they are facing.   I will continue to be the voice for independent producers. Today, I  am asking my colleagues and Congress to be that voice with me. Support  my bill with Senator Tester and bring competition and price  transparency back to the cattle markets. While I am at it, I want to  reemphasize something I previously said. The Ag committee should hold a  hearing on these issues and do it very soon.   I am happy to see Senator Tester on the floor, who I think is here to  speak on the very same issue.   I yield the floor.
