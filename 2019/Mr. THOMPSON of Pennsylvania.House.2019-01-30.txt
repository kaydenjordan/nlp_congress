 Mr. Speaker, this past Sunday, the  world joined together in honoring the memory of those who were murdered  during the Holocaust.   In 2005, the United Nations designated January 27 as International  Holocaust Remembrance Day.   The systematic, government-sponsored persecution and murder of 6  million Jews by the Nazi regime and its collaborators will always be a  scar on humanity.   We promise to always remember those who lost their lives, those who  survived, and those who saved them, those who stood in the face of such  evil and refused to turn a blind eye. We make this promise to ensure  such blight on humanity will never happen again.  [[Page H1288]]    By remembering the events of the Holocaust, we can understand how  important it is to defend those who are defenseless. We must eradicate  hatred and never become indifferent to the suffering of others.   Mr. Speaker, on the international day of remembrance, the most  important thing to reflect upon is the humanity that exists in all of  us.                            ____________________
