 Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the men and  women who made the ultimate sacrifice in service to our country, I  introduce the bipartisan Honor and Remember Flag Recognition Act of  2023 with Representative Jen Kiggans of Virginia.   Currently, 27 States, including North Carolina, have adopted this  symbol in honor of those killed in action. By supporting the Honor and  Remember Flag Recognition Act, we can help the families of these fallen  servicemembers find closure.   On behalf of these families, I ask all Members of Congress to support  this vital legislation. Together, let us affirm our unwavering  commitment to honoring and remembering our courageous and brave heroes  who have given their lives for our freedom and democracy.                            ____________________
