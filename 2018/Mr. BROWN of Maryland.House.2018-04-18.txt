 Mr. Speaker, there is a civil war in Syria and  a humanitarian crisis that the United States simply cannot and should  not ignore.   Today there are some 2,000 U.S. soldiers and marines on the ground in  Syria who have spent the past several years engaged in the fight to  defeat ISIS. That fight has been largely successful, yet troops remain  in Syria to prevent a resurgence of ISIS. U.S. forces are engaged in  hostilities against ISIS, not in the Syrian civil war.   Congress was informed in 2015 that our forces are in Syria pursuant  to the AUMF enacted in 2001, in response to the attacks on 9/11.   Although U.S. ground forces aren't engaged in the Syrian civil war,  our forces have engaged Syrian forces and its regime. Last year, a U.S.  Navy F-18 shot down a Syrian war plane in the collective self-defense  of our coalition partners. The use of force in self-defense is  unquestionably authorized, however risky that may be in potentially  drawing the U.S. into armed conflict with Syria or into the Syrian  civil war.   In the fall of 2016, U.S. forces mistakenly and unintentionally  killed Syrian troops in an air strike that was intended for ISIS  fighters. Last year, the Syrian regime launched an aerial bombing with  sarin, causing the deaths of nearly 100 civilians.   In response to Assad carrying out these war crimes, the United States  military, at the direction of President Trump, fired 59 cruise missiles  against a Syrian air base. It was the air base from which the aircraft  were launched to drop nerve gas on innocent women, children, men, and  civilians.  [[Page H3401]]    But that didn't stop Assad. Just 11 days ago, less than 10 days after  President Trump instructed military leaders to withdraw U.S. troops  from Syria as soon as possible, Assad again launched a chemical attack  on more than 500 people.   In response, and without meaningful discussion with Congress,  President Trump, once again, ordered air strikes against Syrian targets  associated with the Syrian chemical weapons program.   Mr. Speaker, notwithstanding the U.S. presence on the ground and our  air engagements in Syria since 2015, this Congress has never openly and  formally debated the question of authorization for the use of military  force in Syria.   It is time for us to do our job. Assad is a barbaric, genocidal  dictator. The use of chemical weapons is heinous, and the use of  conventional weapons against civilians, which he is also guilty of  doing, is equally heinous.   Syria is a humanitarian disaster. 400,000 Syrians, most of whom are  innocent civilians, are dead. These facts are not disputed. For more  than 70 years, the United States has been an anchor of international  security, and I believe we cannot look away when a dictator brazenly  and repeatedly violates international law.   The debate that is long overdue in Congress should not be limited to  if, when, and how the United States should respond to the next chemical  attack. Congress abdicated that responsibility in 2013 and in 2017, and  I fear we are on course to do so again this year.   Deliberations over how and when to retaliate against the next  chemical weapons attack must be part of the larger debate that we must  have about our country's goals, policies, and strategy in Syria and  whether another solitary military strike would be effective.   We should recognize that another military response will be hollow if  not accompanied by a more robust, whole-of-government approach. We need  to agree on a strategy that will permanently deter Assad from using  chemical weapons, send a message to Moscow and Tehran, and push Assad  to the negotiation table to achieve a lasting political solution to the  civil war and humanitarian crisis.   Will this approach require greater support of the secular opposition  in Syria? Will we have to work with our NATO allies to intervene more  purposefully to contain Assad? These are the things--the issues--that  every Member of Congress must grapple with as we weigh the use of  military force. The President cannot act unilaterally.   I believe our ideals and principles, as well as our national  security, are at stake in Syria, along with our leadership of an  international system where we seek to ensure that weapons of mass  destruction are never used.   I believe our democracy is stronger when the President acts with the  support of Congress.   Mr. Speaker, let's debate and vote on the authorization to use  military force in Syria now.                            ____________________
