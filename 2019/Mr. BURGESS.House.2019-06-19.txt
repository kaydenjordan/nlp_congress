 Madam Chair, I call up amendment No. 1 to Division A of  H.R. 3055.    Madam Chair, this amendment increases funding for the  Keep Young Athletes Safe Act grant program by $2.5 million.   The Keep Young Athletes Safe Act grant program provides funding for  nonprofit, nongovernmental entities to safeguard amateur athletes in  the Olympic program against emotional, physical, and sexual abuse. The  United States Center for SafeSport was created in the wake of the Larry  Nassar abuse scandal and is a qualifying grant recipient.   Congress only authorized $2.5 million for fiscal years 2018 through  2022 for this grant. In comparison, the United States Anti-Doping  Agency, set up to prevent doping in sport, receives $14 million  annually. Last year, SafeSport said it needed at least $10 million to  be able to serve the athletic community and adequately investigate  allegations of abuse.   While no abuse in sport should be tolerated, the protection of our  children from sexual misconduct should be a top priority. This  amendment doubles the amount appropriated for the Keep Young Athletes  Safe Act grant program for a total of $5 million for fiscal year 2019,  half of what is requested by the U.S. Center for SafeSport and $9  million below the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency.   Many of our young athletes go on to represent the United States in  world and Olympic competitions. They deserve to be safe. They deserve  to be supported as they pursue their goals and dreams through sport.   Madam Chair, this is a bipartisan amendment, and I encourage my  colleagues to vote in favor of protecting young athletes.    Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Indiana (Mrs. Brooks).                                time  1645     Madam Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this amendment.  It is an important amendment and we need to get this done.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
