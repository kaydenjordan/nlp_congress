 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a high  school in my district that was recently recognized for their commitment  to student success.   For over 15 years, Iowa has partnered with the ACT's college  application campaign to increase the number of first-generation college  students and students from low-income households in applying for and  pursuing higher education.   I am proud to announce that, in 2020, 176 Iowa schools participated  in the college application campaign, and all together, 504 students  completed 1,578 college applications. Of the 176 schools that  participated, Muscatine High School in my district was awarded the 2020  School of Excellence Award for Iowa from ACT. Muscatine was selected  for this great award based on their commitment to student success and  for serving as an exemplary model for Iowa's college application  campaign.   Congratulations to the students and faculty at Muscatine for being  leaders in academic achievement and for serving as a great role model  for student success in Iowa and the entire Nation.
