 Mr. President, I pay tribute to a remarkable Cuban- American patriot whose life embodied the American Dream. Caridad Roque  Perez, who went to eternal glory at the age of 82, was a beloved  journalist and an iconic former political prisoner who unjustly endured  more than 15 years of imprisonment under the criminal Castro regime.  Cary's tireless pursuit of freedom and justice made a lasting impact  not just in South Florida but also within the Cuban-American exile  community across our nation. While our community mourns the loss of one  of its most resilient and courageous voices, it is our moral duty to  honor and remember her legacy as well as to carry on her relentless  advocacy for a democratic Cuba, free from tyranny.   Jeanette and I unite in prayer alongside the Cuban exile community  for the repose of the soul of this brave anti-Castro dissident who  dedicated her life to service and advocacy.                            ____________________
