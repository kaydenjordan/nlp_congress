 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of our most  vulnerable Americans; the unborn. They do not have a voice. It is up to  us to be their champion and fight for their right to life.   I am deeply concerned by the actions of the majority and the current  occupants of the White House. They are actively destroying decades of  progress and protections for the unborn, which is why it is essential  to pass the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act.   Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committees on Energy  and Commerce, Ways and Means, and the Judiciary be discharged from  further consideration of H.R. 18 and ask for its immediate  consideration in the House.
