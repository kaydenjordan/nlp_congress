 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the  resolution (H. Res. 517) supporting the Global Fund to fight AIDS,  tuberculosis (TB), malaria, and its Sixth Replenishment, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 517         Whereas the Global Fund to fight AIDS, tuberculosis (TB),       and malaria is an effective partnership of governments, the       private sector, civil society, and affected communities to       transform the response to these epidemics;        Whereas since the Global Fund's creation in 2002, and in       close cooperation with the President's Emergency Plan for       AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), more than 32,000,000 lives have been       saved in countries where the Global Fund invests;        Whereas the Global Fund has contributed to extraordinary       improvements in global health, including by helping to reduce       by half the number of AIDS-related deaths since 2005,       contributing to a 37-percent decline in TB deaths from 2000       to 2016, and a 60-percent decline in the number of malaria       deaths since 2000;        Whereas the Global Fund and its partners work to uphold a       steadfast commitment to transparency and accountability,       receiving high marks in multilateral aid reviews and by       independent watchdogs;        Whereas despite progress achieved to date in combating       AIDS, TB, and malaria, significant challenges threaten future       progress, including drug and insecticide resistance, reaching       marginalized and vulnerable populations, and complacency in       the fight against infectious diseases;        Whereas United States leadership has been critical to the       Global Fund's success as its largest donor and through its       oversight role on the Board of the Global Fund;        Whereas the Global Fund amplifies and supports the results       of United States bilateral heath programs, including the       PEPFAR, the President's Malaria Initiative, and the United       States Agency for International Development TB program;        Whereas a statutory cap on United States contributions to       the Global Fund has successfully leveraged increased       contributions from other donors in prior Global Fund       replenishments;        Whereas the United Kingdom and Japan, for example, already       have pledged significant increases to the Global Fund for the       Sixth Replenishment;        Whereas the Global Fund's requirements for cofinancing have       spurred domestic investments, with recipient countries       committing 41 percent more of their own funding to fight       AIDS, TB, and malaria for 2018 to 2020 compared to 2015 to       2017;        Whereas recipient countries are expected to increase their       co-financing by 48 percent, growing to $46,000,000,000 from       2021 to 2023; and        Whereas with these resources secured, the Global Fund       projects it will reduce the number of deaths due to AIDS, TB,       and malaria by nearly 50 percent, avert 234,000,000       infections or disease cases, and save an additional       16,000,000 lives: Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) encourages the Global Fund and its partners to continue       their valuable contributions to end the epidemics of AIDS,       TB, and malaria;        (2) affirms previous commitments of the United States to       providing 33 percent of the budget to the Global Fund,       including for the Sixth Global Fund Replenishment held on       October 10, 2019, in Lyon, France, as demonstrated by the       $1,560,000,000 provided by H.R. 2839 in the 116th Congress       (providing FY2020 appropriations for the Department of State,       foreign operations, and related programs), as passed by the       House of Representatives;        (3) urges donor countries to step up the fight and increase       their pledges for the Sixth Global Fund Replenishment and       supports continued diplomatic engagement to improve burden       sharing;        (4) urges Global Fund recipient countries to continue to       make and meet ambitious cofinancing commitments to sustain       progress in ending the epidemics of AIDS, TB, and malaria;       and        (5) encourages United States bilateral aid programs to       continue their collaboration with the Global Fund to maximize       the life-saving impact of global health investments.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H. Res. 517.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, there is no better example of American interests and  values intersecting in our foreign policy than global health issues.   On the one hand, global health challenges are strategic challenges.  Countries and communities with poor access to healthcare are less  productive, less stable, less able to act as strong partners.  Unchecked, pandemics can blow across borders and make their way to our  own shores, threatening the American people, so we have a real interest  in working to tackle global health problems.   At the same time, we, as Americans, want to see people everywhere  lead healthy, happy lives, and access to healthcare allows more people  to pursue greater opportunity.   That is why, over the last two decades, the Global Fund has been such  a remarkable foreign policy initiative. It has helped reduce by half  the number of AIDS-related deaths worldwide since 2005. From 2000 to  2016, it contributed to a 37 percent decline in tuberculosis deaths.  Since the year 2000, the Global Fund has helped reduce the number of  deaths from malaria by 60 percent.   America's contributions to the Global Fund have helped to fund these  vital programs, and our leadership has helped drive billions in  additional investments from other donors and recipient states. In  October, the Global Fund received pledges of more than $14 billion for  the next 3 years from 75 donors. Sixteen million people will benefit  from this lifesaving assistance.   This is work that we should all be proud of. It has helped advance  core American interests around the world. It has shown the character of  our country, our spirit of generosity and compassion.   It is essential that the Global Fund's work continues. That is why I  am proud to support this measure from Foreign Affairs Committee  Chairman Engel and Ranking Member McCaul. This resolution puts the  House on the record reaffirming our support for the Global Fund,  reiterating how important its work is. It says that the funding the  House already approved for next year shall go forward because the  Global Fund's future success depends on American involvement.   The Global Fund has built a tremendous record of success. We need to  keep that record going so that we can continue to help people around  the world withstand life-threatening but preventable diseases.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume  for the purpose of closing.   Mr. Speaker, a lot of factors have come together over nearly 20 years  to account for the success of the Global Fund, but in my view, the most  crucial piece of the puzzle has been American leadership.   I worry about what has happened to American leadership in recent  years. I worry when an American administration sends budget after  budget to Capitol Hill asking us to slash our investments in diplomacy  and development by a third. I worry about the message that sends to the  rest of the world,  [[Page H9194]]  about the lives which could be lost if we reduce our commitment to the  fund, and about what it could mean for all the success that efforts  like the Global Fund have achieved.   Mr. Speaker, it is important today that the House send this message,  that we express our clear support for the Global Fund and our support  for bringing American leadership to bear on global health challenges.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support this measure, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 3460) to facilitate effective research on and treatment of  neglected tropical diseases through coordinated international efforts.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3460         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``End Neglected Tropical       Diseases Act''.       SEC. 2. TABLE OF CONTENTS.  Sec. 1. Short title. Sec. 2. Table of contents. Sec. 3. Statement of policy. Sec. 4. Findings. Sec. 5. Definition. Sec. 6. Rule of construction. Sec. 7. Expansion of United States Agency for International Development                Neglected Tropical Diseases Program. Sec. 8. Actions by Department of State. Sec. 9. Multilateral development and health institutions.       SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.         It is the policy of the United States to support a broad       range of implementation and research and development       activities that work toward the achievement of cost-effective       and sustainable treatment, control, and, where possible,       elimination of neglected tropical diseases for the economic       and social well-being of all people.       SEC. 4. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) The World Health Organization (WHO) has identified 17       neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). Approximately 2 billion       people, almost one-third of the world's population, are at       risk of contracting an NTD, and more than 1.4 billion people       are currently afflicted with 1 or more NTDs.        (2) In 2013, WHO adopted a comprehensive resolution on NTDs       recognizing that increased national and international       investments in prevention and control of neglected tropical       diseases have succeeded in improving health and social well-      being in many countries.        (3) NTDs have an enormous impact in terms of disease burden       and quality of life. NTDs cause the loss of up to 534,000       lives and 57 million disability-adjusted life-years each       year. NTDs surpass both malaria and tuberculosis in causing       greater loss of life-years to disability and premature death.       Many NTDs cause disfigurement and disability, leading to       stigma, social discrimination, and societal marginalization.        (4) NTDs create an economic burden of billions of dollars       through the loss of productivity and high costs of health       care required for treatment. People afflicted by NTDs are       less productive than their healthy counterparts. NTDs       jeopardize the ability of people to attend work and school,       or to produce at full capacity. For example, controlling one       NTD, hookworm, in children can result in a 43-percent       increase in future wage earnings.        (5) The social, economic, and health burden of NTDs falls       primarily on low- and middle-income countries, where access       to safe water, sanitation, and health care is limited. At       least 100 countries face 2 endemic NTD burdens, and 30       countries carry 6 or more endemic NTDs.        (6) NTDs are not confined to the developing world, however.       Several NTD outbreaks have been reported in the United States       and other developed countries, especially among the poor. In       the United States, NTDs disproportionately affect people       living in poverty, and especially minorities, including up to       2.8 million African Americans with toxocariasis and 300,000       or more people, mostly Hispanic Americans, with Chagas       disease.        (7) Many NTDs can be controlled, prevented, and even       eliminated using low-cost, effective, and feasible solutions.       Understanding the economic burden of NTDs on productivity and       health care costs can help to assure governments and donors       that the resources directed toward NTDs represent a good       investment.        (8) Research and development efforts are immediately needed       for all NTDs, especially those for which limited or no       treatment currently exists.        (9) Critical to developing robust NTD control strategies       are epidemiological data that identify at-risk populations,       ensure appropriate treatment frequency, and inform decisions       about when treatment can be reduced or stopped.        (10) Of the 14 most common NTDs, roughly 80 percent of       infections are caused by soil-transmitted helminths (STH) and       schistosomiasis. STH are a group of 3 parasitic worms       (roundworms, whipworms, and hookworms) that afflict more than       1 billion people worldwide, including 600 million school-age       children, of whom more than 300 million suffer from severe       morbidity. Schistosomiasis is another helminth infection       affecting at least 200 million people in developing       countries, but some estimates indicate that the true number       of people affected may be double or even triple that number.        (11) The benefits of deworming are immediate and enduring.       A rigorous randomized controlled trial has shown school-based       deworming treatment to reduce school absenteeism by 25       percent. School-based deworming also benefits young siblings       and other children who live nearby but are too young to be       treated, leading to large cognitive improvements equivalent       to half a year of schooling.       SEC. 5. DEFINITION.         In this Act, the term ``neglected tropical diseases'' or       ``NTDs''--        (1) means infections caused by pathogens, including       viruses, bacteria, protozoa, and helminths that       disproportionately impact individuals living in extreme       poverty, especially in developing countries; and        (2) includes--        (A) Buruli ulcer (Mycobacterium Ulcerans infection);        (B) Chagas disease;        (C) dengue or severe dengue fever;        (D) dracunculiasis (Guinea worm disease);        (E) echinococcosis;        (F) foodborne trematodiases;        (G) human African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness);        (H) leishmaniasis;        (I) leprosy;        (J) lymphatic filariasis (elephantiasis);        (K) onchocerciasis (river blindness);        (L) scabies;        (M) schistosomiasis;        (N) soil-transmitted helminthiases (STH) (roundworm,       whipworm, and hookworm);        (O) taeniasis/cysticercosis;        (P) trachoma; and        (Q) yaws (endemic treponematoses).       SEC. 6. RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.         Nothing in this Act shall be construed to increase       authorizations of appropriations for the United States Agency       for International Development.       SEC. 7. EXPANSION OF UNITED STATES AGENCY FOR INTERNATIONAL                     DEVELOPMENT NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES                     PROGRAM.         (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:        (1) Since fiscal year 2006, the United States Government       has been an essential leader in global efforts to control       seven targeted neglected tropical diseases: lymphatic       filariasis (elephantiasis), onchocerciasis (river blindness),       schistosomiasis, soil-transmitted helminthiases (roundworm,       whipworm, and hookworm), and trachoma. Additional information       suggests that such efforts could also produce collateral       benefits for at least three other neglected tropical       diseases: foodborne trematodiases, scabies, and yaws (endemic       treponematoses).        (2) The United States Government is a partner in the London       Declaration on Neglected Tropical Diseases (2012), which       represents a new, coordinated international push to       accelerate progress toward eliminating or controlling 10 NTDs       by 2020.  [[Page H9195]]         (3) While many of the most common NTDs have safe, easy to       use, and effective treatments, treatment options for the NTDs       with the highest death rates, including human African       trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness), visceral leishmaniasis,       and Chagas disease, are extremely limited.        (4) The United States Agency for International Development       (USAID) Neglected Tropical Diseases Program has made       important and substantial contributions to the global fight       to control and eliminate 5 of the most common NTDs.       Leveraging more than $15,700,000,000 in donated medicines,       USAID has supported the distribution of more than 1 billion       treatments in 31 countries across Africa, Asia, and Latin       America and the Caribbean.        (5) Since 2014, the USAID Neglected Tropical Diseases       Program has been investing in research and development for       the treatment of certain NTDs to ensure that promising new       breakthrough medicines can be rapidly evaluated, registered,       and made available to patients.        (6) The USAID Neglected Tropical Diseases Program is a       clear example of a successful public-private partnership       between the Government and the private sector and should be       judiciously expanded, as practicable and appropriate.        (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that       the USAID Neglected Tropical Diseases Program, as in effect       on the date of the enactment of this Act, should--        (1) provide integrated drug treatment packages to as many       individuals suffering from NTDs or at risk of acquiring NTDs,       including individuals displaced by manmade and natural       disasters, as logistically feasible;        (2) better integrate NTD control and treatment tools and       approaches into complementary development and global health       programs by coordinating, to the extent practicable and       appropriate, across multiple sectors, including those       relating to HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, education,       nutrition, other infectious diseases, maternal and child       health, and water, sanitation, and hygiene;        (3) establish low-cost, high-impact community- and school-      based NTD programs to reach large at-risk populations,       including school-age children, with integrated drug treatment       packages, as feasible;        (4) as opportunities emerge and resources allow, engage in       research and development of new tools and approaches to reach       the goals relating to the elimination of NTDs as set forth by       the 2012 World Health Organization publication ``Accelerating       Work to Overcome the Global Impact of Neglected Tropical       Diseases: A Roadmap for Implementation'', including for       Chagas disease, Guinea worm, human African trypanosomiasis       (sleeping sickness), leprosy, and visceral leishmaniasis; and        (5) monitor research on and developments in the prevention       and treatment of other NTDs so breakthroughs can be       incorporated into the USAID Neglected Tropical Diseases       Program, as practicable and appropriate.        (c) Program Priorities.--The Administrator of USAID should       incorporate the following priorities into the USAID Neglected       Tropical Diseases Program (as in effect on the date of the       enactment of this Act):        (1) Planning for and conducting robust monitoring and       evaluation of program investments in order to accurately       measure impact, identify and share lessons learned, and       inform future NTD control and elimination strategies.        (2) Coordinating program activities with complementary       USAID development and global health programs, including       programs relating to water, sanitation, and hygiene, food and       nutrition security, and education (both primary and       secondary), in order to advance the goals of the London       Declaration on Neglected Tropical Diseases (2012).        (3) Including morbidity management in treatment plans for       high-burden NTDs.        (4) Incorporating NTDs included in the Global Burden of       Disease Study 2010 into the program as opportunities emerge,       to the extent practicable and appropriate.        (5) Continuing investments in the research and development       of new tools and approaches that complement existing research       investments and ensure that new discoveries make it through       the pipeline and become available to individuals who need       them most.       SEC. 8. ACTIONS BY DEPARTMENT OF STATE.         (a) Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator.--It is the sense       of Congress that the Coordinator of United States Government       Activities to Combat HIV/AIDS Globally should fully consider       evolving research on the impact of NTDs on efforts to control       HIV/AIDS when making future programming decisions, as       necessary and appropriate.        (b) Global Programming.--        (1) In general.--The Secretary of State should encourage       the Global Fund to take into consideration evolving research       on the impact of NTDs on efforts to control HIV/AIDS when       making programming decisions, particularly with regard to       female genital schistosomiasis, which studies suggest may be       one of the most significant cofactors in the AIDS epidemic in       Africa, as necessary and appropriate.        (2) Global fund.--In this subsection, the term ``Global       Fund'' means the public-private partnership known as the       Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria       established pursuant to Article 80 of the Swiss Civil Code.        (c) G-20 Countries.--The Secretary of State, acting through       the Office of Global Health Diplomacy, should encourage G-20       countries to significantly increase their role in the control       and elimination of NTDs.       SEC. 9. MULTILATERAL DEVELOPMENT AND HEALTH INSTITUTIONS.         (a) Congressional Finding.--Congress finds that the       treatment of NTDs, including community- and school-based       deworming programs, can be a highly cost-effective       intervention, and schools can serve as an effective delivery       mechanism for reaching large numbers of children with safe       treatment for soil-transmitted helminthiases (roundworm,       whipworm, and hookworm) in particular.        (b) United Nations.--The President should direct the United       States permanent representative to the United Nations to use       the voice, vote, and influence of the United States to urge       the World Health Organization and the United Nations       Development Programme to--        (1) ensure the dissemination of best practices and       programming on NTDs to governments and make data accessible       to practitioners in an open and timely fashion;        (2) highlight impacts of community- and school-based       deworming programs on children's health and education,       emphasizing the cost-effectiveness of such programs;        (3) encourage governments to implement deworming campaigns       at the national level;        (4) consider the designation of a portion of grant funds of       the institutions to deworming initiatives and cross-sectoral       collaboration with water, sanitation, and hygiene efforts and       nutrition or education programming, as practicable and       appropriate;        (5) encourage accurate monitoring and evaluation of NTD       programs, including deworming programs; and        (6) engage governments in cross-border initiatives for the       treatment, control, prevention, and elimination of NTDs, and       assist in developing transnational agreements, when and where       necessary.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 3460.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, let me start by thanking Mr. Smith from New Jersey, a  senior member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, for his hard work on  this bill, which seeks to make progress on this pressing global health  challenge.   There is a category of diseases--what we call neglected tropical  diseases--that pack a particularly nasty punch on populations living in  poverty without adequate sanitation. These are precisely the kinds of  diseases that hold entire communities back. They drive up health costs,  lead to lost wages, undercut productivity, and deprive children of the  shot at a better future.   What is especially wrenching about these diseases is that they cause  all this harm, despite the fact that we have the tools to combat them.  Very elementary public health efforts can stop these diseases in their  tracks: research, drug distribution, and basic public health  intervention. Yet these diseases affect more than 1 billion people  around the world, according to the World Health Organization.   To its credit, USAID is already focusing on these diseases. The  Agency's Neglected Tropical Disease Program has worked to distribute  nearly $16 billion worth of donated medicines in more than 30  countries. It is a good start, but these efforts aren't yet equal to  the challenge.   This legislation underscores the serious challenge posed by neglected  tropical diseases and encourages USAID to expand its work to grapple  with this problem. It also sets up a stronger diplomatic approach for  dealing with these diseases by requiring the State Department to push  for broader action through the U.N., the Global Fund, and the G-20.   In short, this measure pushes for a smart, broad-based effort for  getting at these preventable diseases.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support it, and I reserve the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume for  the purpose of closing.   Mr. Speaker, let me again thank Mr. Smith for all his hard work on  this bill.   This legislation shows so clearly how we can use development and  diplomacy in tandem to help meet serious global challenges. It is why  diplomacy and development are so important in our foreign policy.   There is no doubt that neglected tropical diseases have a major  roadblock for impoverished communities around the world. There is also  no doubt that we have the tools to combat them if we can garner the  resources and the political will to get the job done. That is what this  bill aims to do.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to vote ``yes'' on this measure, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the  resolution (H. Res. 546) disapproving the Russian Federation's  inclusion in future Group of Seven summits until it respects the  territorial integrity of its neighbors and adheres to the standards of  democratic societies.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 546         Whereas, in 2014, Russia illegally occupied Ukraine's       Crimea region and parts of eastern Ukraine;        Whereas these actions are in direct violation of       fundamental principles of international law, as well as the       United Nations Charter, the Helsinki Final Act, and the 1994       Budapest Memorandum;        Whereas, in 1998, the Group of Seven invited Russia to join       the group in an effort to encourage continued political and       economic reforms in Russia;        Whereas, in March 2014, the Group of Eight suspended Russia       as a direct result of its actions in Ukraine, and instead       continued as the Group of Seven;        Whereas, on April 3, 2014, President Barack Obama signed       into law the Support for the Sovereignty, Integrity,       Democracy, and Economic Stability of Ukraine Act of 2014,       which states that ``it is the policy of the United States       that the continued participation of the Russian Federation in       the Group of Eight (G-8) nations should be conditioned on the       Government of the Russian Federation respecting the       territorial integrity of its neighbors and accepting and       adhering to the norms and standards of free, democratic       societies as generally practiced by every other member nation       of the G-8 nations.'';        Whereas, since 2014, the President of Russia, Vladimir       Putin, has continued to violate international law in       Ukraine's Crimea region and elsewhere, and has continued to       undermine democracy and human rights both at home and abroad;       and        Whereas, on August 26, 2019, President Donald Trump,       announced his intention to invite the President of Russia to       next year's Group of Seven summit: Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) reiterates its unwavering support for the sovereignty       and territorial integrity of Ukraine;        (2) condemns Russia's aggressive actions in Ukraine,       including the illegal occupation of Crimea and ongoing       destabilization of eastern Ukraine;        (3) condemns the Kremlin's assaults on democratic societies       worldwide, including in the United States and other Group of       Seven countries;        (4) reaffirms its full support for the suspension of Russia       from the Group of Eight;        (5) calls on all leaders of the Group of Seven to oppose       the readmission of Russia unless and until it has ended its       occupation of all of Ukraine's sovereign territory, including       Crimea, and halts its attacks on democracies worldwide; and        (6) disapproves of Russia's inclusion in future Group of       Seven summits until it respects the territorial integrity of       its neighbors and adheres to the standards of democratic       societies.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H. Res. 546.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Engel, Ranking Member McCaul,  and members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee for their unanimous  support for H. Res. 546 during its markup, and I urge my colleagues to  support this resolution.   In 2014, Russia was expelled from the Group of Eight as a direct  result of its aggressive actions in Ukraine, including the invasion of  the Crimea region. The remaining seven nations agreed that Russia's  future inclusion would be conditioned on its respect of Ukraine's  sovereignty and territorial integrity.   Later in 2014, this international agreement was codified into U.S.  law when the Support for the Sovereignty, Integrity, Democracy, and  Economic Stability of Ukraine Act was signed into law by President  Barack Obama.   Within this legislation, introduced by my colleague from Kentucky,  Congressman Hal Rogers, is a clause stating that continued Russian  participation in the Group of Eight shall be conditioned on Russia  respecting the territorial integrity of its neighbors and accepting and  adhering to the norms and standards of free, democratic societies as  generally practiced by every other member nation of the G-8.   In the time since this legislation was signed into law, Russia has  not changed course. Instead, it has increased its aggression in Ukraine  and has undermined democracy in numerous nations. In response to  Russia's continued flouting of international democratic standards, I  introduced H. Res. 546 to reiterate longstanding bipartisan  congressional sentiment that Russia's actions should have consequences  on the international stage.   If we allow Russia to participate in future G-7 summits without  meeting the previously set conditions, we are signaling that Russia can  continue to act with impunity and that the United  [[Page H9198]]  States will not stand firm in the face of Russian aggression.   It is my hope that the House of Representatives can, once again, come  together as we did in 2014 to condemn Russia's actions in Ukraine,  reaffirm support for Russia's expulsion from the G-8, and stress that  future participation must hinge on respecting the territorial integrity  of other nations.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume for  the purpose of closing.   Mr. Speaker, this is a good, bipartisan measure. I thank my  colleague, Mr. Shimkus, for supporting it and my good friend from New  Jersey, Congressman Smith.   Time and time again, Russia ignores the standards and norms of  democratic societies and actively operates counter to American  interests. If we do not stand firm against Russian aggression and allow  them to participate in future G-7 summits, we will be rewarding Putin  for his attacks on our country and our allies and that will damage our  partnerships and alliances around the world.   With this measure, Congress makes it clear that we do not support  Russia's inclusion in the G-7 as he continues to attack us, our  partners, and democratic institutions around the world.   Mr. Speaker, I hope all Members would join me in supporting its  passage, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the  resolution (H. Res. 585) reaffirming support for the Good Friday  Agreement and other agreements to ensure a lasting peace in Northern  Ireland.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 585         Whereas, on April 10, 1998, the Government of Ireland and       the Government of the United Kingdom signed the Good Friday       Agreement;        Whereas the main goal of the Good Friday Agreement was to       bring an end to the violence on the island of Ireland and to       ensure self-determination, peace, and reconciliation for the       people of the island of Ireland;        Whereas the successful negotiation of the Good Friday       Agreement stands as a historic and groundbreaking success       that has proven critical to the decades of relative peace       that have followed;        Whereas an exit from the European Union by the United       Kingdom that does not appropriately protect the Good Friday       Agreement threatens to undermine progress that has been made       in moving beyond the legacy of the past in Northern Ireland;        Whereas the power-sharing agreement negotiated between the       Government of Ireland, the Government of the United Kingdom,       and parties in Northern Ireland in 1998 was a critical step       toward negotiating lasting solutions to the issues described       in the Good Friday Agreement and in other agreements that       followed;        Whereas the collapse of the power-sharing institutions in       2017 has created additional difficulties and is serving as a       roadblock to continued progress;        Whereas despite the historic progress of the Good Friday       Agreement and subsequent  [[Page H9199]]       agreements, important issues remain unresolved in Northern       Ireland, including securing justice for victims of state-      sponsored violence and other violence and providing for the       rights of all sections of the community;        Whereas the reintroduction of barriers, checkpoints, or       personnel, also known as a ``hard border'', between the       Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland would further       threaten economic cooperation between the Republic of Ireland       and the United Kingdom as well as the successes of the Good       Friday Agreement;        Whereas the United States Congress served a prominent       assisting role in the negotiation of Good Friday Agreement       and has taken a leading role in striving for peace on the       island of Ireland more broadly; and        Whereas Congress greatly values the close relationships the       United States shares with both the United Kingdom and the       Republic of Ireland and stands steadfastly committed to       supporting the peaceful resolution of any and all political       challenges in Northern Ireland: Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) urges the United Kingdom and the European Union to       ensure that any exit from the European Union by the United       Kingdom supports continued peace on the island of Ireland and       the principles, objectives, and commitments of the Good       Friday Agreement;        (2) urges a successful outcome to the dialogue between all       parties in Northern Ireland to ensure that all of the       institutions of the Good Friday Agreement operate again and       that ongoing political challenges and debates can be       overcome;        (3) expresses support for the full implementation of the       Good Friday Agreement and subsequent agreements;        (4) expresses opposition to the reintroduction of a hard       border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland;        (5) supports the right of all the people on the island of       Ireland to self-determine their future as provided for in the       Good Friday Agreement; and        (6) will insist that any new or amended trade agreements       and other bilateral agreements between the Government of the       United States and the Government of the United Kingdom       include conditions requiring obligations under the Good       Friday Agreement to be met.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H. Res. 585.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I want to start by thanking my colleagues, Mr. Suozzi and Mr. King,  for authoring this excellent bipartisan measure that reaffirms  Congress' support for lasting peace in Northern Ireland. The Good  Friday Agreement and the fulfillment of every obligation under it is  the only way to ensure that those times of violence and division never  return.   That is why I am alarmed by the current situation with Brexit, which  could reintroduce a hard border between the north and the Republic.  This is a dangerous prospect not only for the peace process but for the  economic stability of the island and for the rights of the border  communities.   With this bipartisan resolution we send a clear signal to the United  Kingdom and the European Union. It is a priority for Congress that any  Brexit deal must protect the Good Friday Agreement and all of its  components.                                time  1700    We must ensure that nothing compromises the peace, security, and  economic prosperity across Ireland.   I am proud to be a cosponsor of this measure, and I urge all Members  to join me in supporting it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                          House of Representatives,                                     Committee on Ways and Means,                                   Washington, DC, December 2, 2019.      Hon. Eliot L. Engel,      Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Engel: In recognition of the desire to       expedite consideration of H. Res. 585, ``Reaffirming Support       for the Good Friday Agreement and other agreements to ensure       a lasting peace in Northern Ireland,'' the Committee on Ways       and Means agrees to waive formal consideration of the bill as       to provisions that fall within the rule X jurisdiction of the       Committee on Ways and Means.        The Committee on Ways and Means takes this action with the       mutual understanding that we do not waive any jurisdiction       over the subject matter contained in this or similar       legislation, and the Committee will be appropriately       consulted and involved as the bill or similar legislation       moves forward so that we may address any remaining issues       within our jurisdiction. The Committee also reserves the       right to seek appointment of an appropriate number of       conferees to any House-Senate conference involving this or       similar legislation.        Finally, I would appreciate your response to this letter       confirming this understanding and would ask that a copy of       our exchange of letter on this matter be included in the       Congressional Record during floor consideration of H. Res.       585.            Sincerely,                                                   Richard E. Neal,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                    Committee on Foreign Affairs,                                   Washington, DC, December 2, 2019.      Hon. Richard E. Neal,      Committee on Ways and Means,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Neal: I am writing to you concerning H. Res.       585, Reaffirming support for the Good Friday Agreement and       other agreements to ensure a lasting peace in Northern       Ireland. I appreciate your willingness to work cooperatively       on this resolution.        I acknowledge that provisions of this measure fall within       the jurisdiction of the Committee on Ways and Means under       House Rule X, and that your Committee will forgo action on H.       Res. 585 to expedite floor consideration. I further       acknowledge that the inaction of your Committee with respect       to the bill does not waive any future jurisdictional claim       over the matters contained in the bill that fall within your       jurisdiction. I will also support the appointment of       Committee on Ways and Means conferees during any House-Senate       conference convened on this legislation.        Lastly, I will ensure that our exchange of letters is       included in the Congressional Record during floor       consideration of the bill. Thank you again for your       cooperation regarding the legislation. I look forward to       continuing to work with you as the measure moves through the       legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                    Eliot L. Engel,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Suozzi), the author of this resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Connecticut (Mr. Courtney).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Kildee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Brendan F. Boyle).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume for  the purpose of closing.   Once again, I thank Mr. Suozzi and Mr. King for introducing this  good, bipartisan measure. The United Kingdom and European Union must  safeguard Ireland's continued peace, safety, and prosperity as they  work to secure a Brexit deal.   We must ensure Ireland continues toward a bright, strong future,  never returning to the violence and the division of The Troubles. The  Good Friday Agreement must be protected.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all the Members to support this important  resolution, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (S. 178) to condemn gross human rights violations of ethnic Turkic  Muslims in Xinjiang, and calling for an end to arbitrary detention,  torture, and harassment of these communities inside and outside China,  as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                   S. 178         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Uighur Intervention and       Global Humanitarian Unified Response Act of 2019'' or the       ``UIGHUR Act of 2019''.       SEC. 2. STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.         The purpose of this Act is to direct United States       resources to address human rights violations and abuses,       including gross violations of human rights, by the People's       Republic of China's mass surveillance and internment of over       1,000,000 Uighurs and other predominantly Turkic Muslim       ethnic minorities in China's Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous       Region.       SEC. 3. APPROPRIATE CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEES.         In this Act, the term ``appropriate congressional       committees'' means--        (1) the Committee on Foreign Affairs, the Committee on       Financial Services, and the Committee on Appropriations of       the House of Representatives; and        (2) the Committee on Foreign Relations, the Committee on       Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, and the Committee on       Appropriations of the Senate.       SEC. 4. FINDINGS.         Congress makes the following findings:        (1) The Government of the People's Republic of China has a       long history of repressing Turkic Muslims, particularly       Uighurs, in China's Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region.        (2) In May 2014, Chinese authorities launched their latest       ``Strike Hard against Violent Extremism'' campaign, using       wide-scale, internationally-linked threats of terrorism as a       pretext to justify pervasive restrictions on and human rights       violations of members of the ethnic minority communities of       the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region. The August 2016       transfer of former Tibet Autonomous Region Party Secretary       Chen Quanguo to become the Xinjiang Party Secretary prompted       an acceleration in the crackdown across the region. Scholars,       human rights organizations, journalists, and think tanks have       provided ample evidence substantiating the establishment by       Chinese authorities of ``reeducation'' camps. Since 2014,       Chinese authorities have detained no less than 800,000       Uighurs, ethnic Kazahks, Kyrgyz, and other ethnic minorities       in these camps.        (3) Those detained in such facilities have described forced       political indoctrination, torture, beatings, and food       deprivation, as well as denial of religious, cultural, and       linguistic freedoms, and confirmed that they were told by       guards that the only way to secure release was to demonstrate       sufficient political loyalty. Poor conditions and lack of       medical treatment at such facilities appear to have       contributed to the deaths of some detainees, including the       elderly and infirm.        (4) Uighurs and ethnic Kazakhs, who have now obtained       permanent residence or citizenship in other countries, attest       to receiving threats and harassment from Chinese officials.       At least five journalists for Radio Free Asia's Uighur       service have publicly detailed abuses their family members in       Xinjiang have endured in response to their work exposing       abusive policies across the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous       Region.        (5) In September 2018, United Nations High Commissioner for       Human Rights Michele Bachelet noted in her first speech as       High Commissioner the ``deeply disturbing allegations of       large-scale arbitrary detentions of Uighurs and other Muslim       communities, in so-called re-education camps across       Xinjiang''.  [[Page H9202]]         (6) The Government of the People's Republic of China's       actions against Turkic Muslims in the Xinjiang Uighur       Autonomous Region, whose population was approximately 13       million at the time of the last Chinese census in 2010, are       in contravention of international human rights laws, the       International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of       Racial Discrimination, and the Convention against Torture and       Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment,       both of which China has signed and ratified, and the       Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International       Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which China has       signed.       SEC. 5. SENSE OF CONGRESS.         It is the sense of Congress that--        (1) the President should condemn abuses against Turkic       Muslims by Chinese authorities and call on such authorities       immediately--        (A) to close the ``reeducation'' camps;        (B) to lift all restrictions on and ensure respect for       human rights; and        (C) to allow those inside China to reestablish contact with       their loved ones, friends, and associates outside China;        (2) the Secretary of State should--        (A) fully implement the provisions of the Frank R. Wolf       International Religious Freedom Act (Public Law 114-281); and        (B) should consider strategically employing sanctions and       other tools under the International Religious Freedom Act of       1998 (22 U.S.C. 6401 et seq.), including measures required by       reason of the designation of the People's Republic of China       as a country of particular concern for religious freedom       under section 402(b)(1)(A)(ii) of such Act that directly       address particularly severe violations of religious freedom;        (3) the Secretary of State should work with United States       allies and partners as well as through multilateral       institutions to condemn the mass arbitrary detention of       Uighurs in China's Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region and       coordinate closely with the international community on       targeted sanctions and visa restrictions; and        (4) the journalists of the Uighur language service of Radio       Free Asia should be commended for their reporting on the       human rights and political situation in the Xinjiang Uighur       Autonomous Region despite efforts by the Government of the       People's Republic of China to silence or intimidate their       reporting through the detention of family members and       relatives in China, and the United States should expand the       availability of and capacity for Uighur language programming       on Radio Free Asia in the region.       SEC. 6. UPDATING STATEMENT OF UNITED STATES POLICY TOWARD THE                     PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA.         Section 901(b) of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act,       Fiscal Years 1990 and 1991 (Public Law 101-246; 104 Stat. 84)       is amended--        (1) by redesignating paragraphs (7), (8), and (9) as       paragraphs (8), (9), and (10), respectively; and        (2) by inserting after paragraph (6) the following:        ``(7) United States policy toward the People's Republic of       China should be explicitly linked with the situation in       China's Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region, specifically as to       whether--        ``(A) the mass internment of ethnic Uighur and other Turkic       Muslims in `political education' camps has ended;        ``(B) all political prisoners in the region are released;        ``(C) the use of high-tech mass surveillance and predictive       policing to discriminate against and violate the human rights       of members of specific ethnic groups is evident in other       parts of China; and        ``(D) the Government of the People's Republic of China has       ended efforts aimed at cultural assimilation and particularly       severe restrictions of religious practice in the region;''.       SEC. 7. APPLICATION OF SANCTIONS UNDER GLOBAL MAGNITSKY HUMAN                     RIGHTS ACCOUNTABILITY ACT WITH RESPECT TO                     CERTAIN SENIOR OFFICIALS OF THE PEOPLE'S                     REPUBLIC OF CHINA.         (a) In General.--Not later than 120 days after the date of       the enactment of this Act, the President shall submit to the       appropriate congressional committees a list of senior       officials of the Government of the People's Republic of China       who the President determines are responsible for or who have       knowingly engaged in serious human rights abuses against       Turkic Muslims in the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region and       elsewhere in China. Such list shall include the following:        (1) Senior Chinese officials, such as Xinjiang Party       Secretary Chen Quanguo, who are directly responsible for the       ongoing repression in the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region.        (2) Senior Chinese officials responsible for mass       incarceration, political indoctrination, or reeducation       efforts targeting Uighurs and other predominantly Muslim       ethnic minorities.        (b) Form.--The list required under subsection (a) shall be       submitted in unclassified form but may contain a classified       annex.        (c) Sanctions Imposed.--On the date on which the President       submits to the appropriate congressional committees the list       described in subsection (a), and as appropriate thereafter,       the President shall impose the sanctions described in section       1263(b) of the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability       Act (subtitle F of title XII of Public Law 114-328; 22 U.S.C.       2656 note) with respect to any foreign person that the       President has identified on the list.        (d) Exception for United Nations Headquarters Agreement;       Enforcement.--Subsections (e) and (f) of section 1263 of the       Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act apply with       respect to the imposition of sanctions under this section to       the same extent as such subsections apply with respect to the       imposition of sanctions under such section 1263.

Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Pelosi), the Speaker of the House.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Let me first thank the gentleman from California (Mr. Sherman) and  the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith) for their work on this  legislation.   I also want to acknowledge the work of the Congressional-Executive  Commission on China, led by the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr.  McGovern). His expertise, and that of his staff, has made a significant  contribution to the development of this legislation.   This bill addresses one of the most egregious violations of human  rights in the world today. More than 1 million Uighurs and other Muslim  ethnic minorities have been detained by the Chinese Government and sent  to camps in Xinjiang, where they face torture, sexual abuse,  brainwashing, and other abuses in an attempt to erase their culture and  their religion.   The Chinese Government is engaging in these atrocities under the  guise of  [[Page H9205]]  antiterrorism efforts, and the victims have been denied any due  process. The severity of this disgrace was recently confirmed by a  trove of leaked confidential Chinese documents that detail just how  sinister these policies are.   Meeting with members of the Uighur American community is a sobering  experience. They have stories about family members in China who can no  longer be reached, friends who have gone missing, report after report  of violence, abuse, and mistreatment.   The intention of the top Chinese Communist Party leadership through  this campaign is clear: In the short-term, turn Xinjiang into a prison  for ethnic and religious minorities, and, in the longer term, force  these minorities to assimilate completely, erasing the evidence of  their unique culture, history, and religion.   The Chinese Government has a long record of oppressing Tibetan  Christians, the Falun Gong, and other ethnic religious minorities. But  what makes these efforts different is the use of technology to erase  the Uighur people and their way of life. In some cases, these  technologies can be traced back to American companies and research  institutions.   Unfortunately, we have yet to see an adequate response from the Trump  administration. While the administration's decision to announce its  visa restrictions and add abuse-enabling Chinese tech firms to the  Entity List were good steps, they do not go far enough. There needs to  be real consequences for those who have designed and built these  internment camps.   With the bill we are considering today, the House of Representatives  is making clear that there needs to be more serious repercussions.  Specifically, this bill calls on the Secretary of State to designate  those responsible for these abuses with Global Magnitsky sanctions,  including the freezing of their assets. It would also require the  American firms to do due diligence on where and how their technology is  being used so that they do not unwittingly become part of the Chinese  Government's campaign to violate the human rights of their own  citizens.   This legislation is a necessary response to one of the most pressing  human rights concerns in the world today. I am glad the House is  considering it, and I encourage all Members to vote for its passage.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                          House of Representatives,                                      Committee on the Judiciary,                                   Washington, DC, December 3, 2019.      Hon. Eliot L. Engel,      Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Engel: This is to advise you that the       Committee on the Judiciary has now had an opportunity to       review the provisions in S. 178, the ``Uyghur Human Rights       Policy Act of 2019'' that fall within our Rule X       jurisdiction. I appreciate your consulting with us on those       provisions. The Judiciary Committee has no objection to your       including them in the bill for consideration on the House       floor, and to expedite that consideration is willing to forgo       action on S. 178, with the understanding that we do not       thereby waive any future jurisdictional claim over those       provisions or their subject matters.        In the event a House-Senate conference on this or similar       legislation is convened, the Judiciary Committee reserves the       right to request an appropriate number of conferees to       address any concerns with these or similar provisions that       may arise in conference.        Please place this letter into the Congressional Record       during consideration of the measure on the House floor. Thank       you for the cooperative spirit in which you have worked       regarding this matter and others between our committees.            Sincerely,                                                    Jerrold Nadler,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                    Commtttee on Foreign Affairs,                                   Washington, DC, December 2, 2019.      Hon. Jerrold Nadler,      Committee on the Judiciary,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Nadler: I am writing to you concerning S.       178, the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act of 2019. I appreciate       your willingness to work cooperatively on this legislation.        I acknowledge that provisions of the bill fall within the       jurisdiction of the Committee on the Judiciary under House       Rule X, and that your Committee will forgo action on S. 178       to expedite floor consideration. I further acknowledge that       the inaction of your Committee with respect to the bill does       not waive any future jurisdictional claim over the matters       contained in the bill that fall within your jurisdiction. I       will also support the appointment of Committee on the       Judiciary conferees during any House-Senate conference       convened on this legislation.        Lastly, I will ensure that our exchange of letters is       included in the Congressional Record during floor       consideration of the bill. Thank you again for your       cooperation regarding the legislation. I look forward to       continuing to work with you as the measure moves through the       legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                    Eliot L. Engel,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Sherman), the chairman of the Subcommittee on Asia, the  Pacific, and Nonproliferation.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Suozzi).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   It has been more than 3 years since the Chinese authorities have  accelerated and expanded their repressive campaign in Xinjiang. The  global response to these abuses, up until now, has been insignificant,  partly due to the successful campaign by Beijing to coerce silence from  those who speak out.   Where there has been talk, there has sadly been little action. Today,  we have an opportunity to turn the tide by sending a strong message of  support to the Uighur people and accountability for those Chinese  officials who have violated their own people's rights and religious  freedom for years with impunity.   I urge my colleagues to join me today in sending a strong message to  both the perpetrators and the victims alike with an overwhelming vote  in support for this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, before I yield, I would like to point out that there are  three Members of the New Jersey delegation here. Two of them are  refugees from communism.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
