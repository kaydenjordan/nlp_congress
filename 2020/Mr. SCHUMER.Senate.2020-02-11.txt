 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, the 2020 primary elections are ongoing.  The national election is only 9 months away. If there is anything we  can say for certain about our elections at this point, it is that  foreign entities--Putin, China, perhaps others--are already  implementing their schemes to undermine the public confidence and the  integrity of those elections and to bend social media in favor of their  chosen outcome. FBI Director Wray, former DNI Coats--virtually every  member of our national security and intelligence community has warned  us of this danger.   As we have heard over the past weeks, the threat of foreign  interference in our election dates back to the founding days of the  country. George Washington warned that foreign interference is one of  the most baneful foes of republican government. Adams wrote that as  long as elections happen, the danger of foreign influence recurs.   The warnings of our Founders hold a new and startling relevance  today. The current President of the United States, far from having the  same fears about foreign interference as our Founders, has been very  public about his openness to foreign assistance and manipulation in  support of his election. If a foreign power had dirt on one of his  opponents, the President said, ``I think I'd want to hear it.'' At  different times, the President has invited Russia, Ukraine, and China  to investigate his political opponents.   Of course the President was just impeached over this issue, and the  Senate just concluded a trial in which it appeared a bipartisan  majority of Senators broadly accepted the fact that the President  leveraged hundreds of millions of dollars of military assistance to  Ukraine to compel its government to investigate one of his political  rivals.   The trial of President Trump exposed in great detail the President's  willingness to accept foreign help in the elections. It also revealed  just how little Senate Republicans were willing to do about it. Senate  Republicans wouldn't even fairly examine the charges against the  President by allowing witnesses and documents in his trial.   The end of the President's impeachment trial does not mean that the  end of the issue of election security is somehow over--far from it. We  now have even a greater need to safeguard our elections than we had  before.   The President tried to cheat in our elections, and the Senate  majority of  [[Page S973]]  his party decided to look the other way. What do you think the  President will conclude? He will conclude that he can get away with  anything. He could try to cheat again--ask China or North Korea or  Russia to investigate the Democratic nominee, whoever it is.   We know we can't trust this President to stand up for the integrity  of our elections, so Congress must. Democrats are not going to stop  fighting to put up additional safeguards before the 2020 elections.   Later today, a group of my colleagues will come to the floor to ask  unanimous consent to pass crucial election security legislation. Much  of this legislation is bipartisan. Some of it has already passed out of  committee. Some of it has passed the House, but it has languished for  years--years--because Majority Leader McConnell has refused to bring  any of these bills to the floor.   Senator Warner and Senator Blumenthal have duty-to-report bills-- commonsense measures to require Presidential campaigns to report offers  of foreign help to the FBI. Senator Wyden and Senator Klobuchar have  the SAFE Act--another commonsense measure to authorize funding to  harden election infrastructure and protect voting machines from hacking  and other intrusions.   Neither of these bills should be controversial. There is nothing  partisan about them--nothing at all--but they have consistently been  blocked by Senate Republicans and denied time and consideration on the  floor by Republican Leader McConnell. That doesn't mean Democrats are  going to stop trying. Later today, we will try again to pass these  bipartisan, noncontroversial bills. We will see if our Republican  colleagues are willing to do what is necessary to protect our  elections.                            ____________________     Madam President, on the nomination of Andrew Brasher for  the Eleventh Circuit, the nomination is truly a disgrace--a disgrace-- to our judiciary. I urge every single Senator to reject it.   Mr. Brasher is laughably inexperienced. He was confirmed as a  district court judge only 9 months ago. That is the sum total of his  experience as a judge at any level--9 months. Now Leader McConnell  wants to elevate him to an appellate court. In Leader McConnell's  desperate rush to pack the courts with hard-right judges, his party is  asking the Senate to confirm judicial novices to the most austere and  important seats on the Federal bench.   Worse than this nominee's inexperience, though, are his views, which  are so far outside the American mainstream.   In his 5 years as solicitor general in the State of Alabama, Brasher  defended the indefensible on issues ranging from women's reproductive  rights, to marriage equality, to gun safety. Mr. Brasher has also  amassed a career's worth of experience undermining voting rights.  Brasher signed on to an amicus brief that argued in favor of gutting  the Voting Rights Act--arguably the most important piece of civil  rights legislation in our Nation's history. His arguments in defense of  an Arizona voter ID law were roundly rejected by the Supreme Court,  including Justice Scalia. As the solicitor general for Alabama, Brasher  defended the State's voter suppression efforts, including State  district lines that courts later concluded were drawn explicitly to  discriminate against African-American voters. This is who the Senate  Republicans want to put as a circuit court of appeals justice.   Whether it is covering up for President Trump and his attempts to  cheat in our elections or confirming judges like Mr. Brasher with a  history of race-related voter discrimination, Senate Republicans are  showing outright contempt for the very wellspring of our democracy--the  right of American citizens to vote in free and fair elections.   Mr. Brasher clearly, obviously, and certainly does not belong on the  Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals. I urge every Senator to vote against  his nomination.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, the 2020 primary elections are already  underway, and the national election is only 9 months away. We know that  foreign entities--Putin, China, perhaps others--are already scheming to  undermine the public confidence in our elections. The threats to our  next elections are real and growing nearer each day.   Last week the Senate concluded an impeachment trial of the President,  who was accused of abusing the powers of his office to solicit the help  of a foreign power in his reelection--solicit the help. It didn't just  happen. He was soliciting it.   My Republican Senate friends refused to hold the President  accountable for his misconduct--refused to even hold a fair trial. Now,  what do we think the President will conclude after the Senate  Republican majority let him off the hook for trying to cheat in our  elections? He will conclude that he can try to do it again. Anyone who  knows him knows that is what he will do.   Because Senate Republicans chose to look the other way, the need for  election security legislation is greater now than ever before. We  cannot trust this President to stand up for the integrity of our  elections. So Congress must stand up in his stead.   In a few moments, my colleagues Senator Warner, Senator Wyden, and  [[Page S975]]  Senator Blumenthal will ask for unanimous consent to pass crucial  election security legislation. They will talk about what their  legislation will do. But know this: Protecting our elections should not  be partisan. It should not be controversial. It should earn the  unanimous support of every Member.   The very wellspring of our democracy is the principle of free and  fair elections. Will our Republican colleagues stand up for free and  fair elections today or will they once again block commonsense  legislation to defend our democracy?   I yield to the Senator from Virginia.
