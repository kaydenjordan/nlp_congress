 Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Scott for his  introduction. I also thank the Members of the Virginia delegation, and  my new colleagues.   I rise as the newest Member of Virginia's Fourth Congressional  District and the first African-American woman elected to this body from  the Commonwealth of Virginia. I thank the voters of the Fourth  Congressional District for placing their trust in me to serve in this,  the people's House.   Today, I succeed, but can never replace, A. Donald McEachin, who was  a friend, mentor, and colleague whom I served with in the Virginia  House of Delegates and succeeded in the Senate in Virginia. I stand on  his shoulders. I stand on the shoulders of John Mercer Langston, the  first African American to represent Virginia, also from the Fourth  District.   Mr. Speaker, I did not make this journey alone, and I thank my  friends, family, and supporters who have supported me along the way.   First and foremost, I thank my husband, David Mills. I thank my son,  Jackson, who is excited to show off his dance moves, and my daughter,  Samantha.  [[Page H1132]]    I thank my mother, Lois McClellan. She will be the first to tell you  that she is half responsible for me. She and my late father, Dr. James  F. McClellan, Jr.--on whose Bible I took the oath of office--are why I  am here.   I grew up listening to their stories of their childhood during the  Depression, coming of age during World War II and its aftermath, and  raising a family through the tumult of the 1960s and 1970s. They saw  the best of government in the New Deal. They saw the worst of  government in Jim Crow.   Their stories and the love of history that they sparked in me taught  me at a young age that at its best, government is a force for helping  people and solving problems. At its worst, government is a force that  oppresses some for the benefit of a few.   Their stories sparked a desire to dedicate myself to making a  government by, of, and for the people actually work for the people,  solving problems and making their lives and communities better.   That desire led me to serve in the Virginia General Assembly for 18  sessions where, as the daughter and granddaughter of men who paid poll  taxes and the great-granddaughter of a man who took a literacy test and  had to find three White men to vouch for him to be able to vote, I was  able to pass over 370 pieces of legislation, including the Voting  Rights Act of Virginia.   I stand on the shoulders of my parents, grandparents, and great- grandparents, recognizing that in a lot of ways I am fighting the same  fights that they did, and I stand here to ensure that my children and  yours don't have to fight those same fights.   I am honored, humbled, and excited to get to work with you for the  people of Virginia's Fourth Congressional District and this great  Nation of ours.                            ____________________
