 Mr. Speaker, the Congressional Black Caucus condemns all  forms of white supremacy, anti-Semitism, and Islamophobia in the  strongest terms possible.   This could have been an issue that sowed further division among the  country, but, instead, has united everyone around our shared values,  condemning all forms of bigotry and hatred. The Congressional Black  Caucus stands firmly against all expressions of hate, and is concerned  by the recent uptick in hateful rhetoric and crimes targeting minority  communities.   For example, a white nationalist murdered nine African American  worshipers at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston,  South Carolina, on the evening of June 15, 2015, in hopes of igniting a  nationwide race war; or the perpetrator of the deadliest attack on  Jewish people in the United States' history at the Tree of Life  synagogue building in Pittsburgh that killed 11 worshippers.   It is unfortunate that the President of the United States has shown a  complete lack of leadership on these issues and has, in fact, fanned  the flames.   As chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, the CBC remains committed  to building a more perfect union by engaging in constructive dialogue  that affirms America as a nation welcoming to all.
