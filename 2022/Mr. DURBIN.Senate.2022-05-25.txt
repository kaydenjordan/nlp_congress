As chairman of the appropriate jurisdictional committee  and on behalf of Senator Klobuchar of Minnesota, I object.    As cosponsor of both pieces of legislation that are being  debated here, I would say to the Senator from Utah: Keep the faith. The  day will come. This legislation will see the light of day, and I  believe should become law along with Senator Klobuchar's bill. I  believe both are good pieces of legislation.   This is not the appropriate moment, but that moment will come.

Mr. President, this week, the Senate continues the  important work of confirming highly qualified, diverse nominees to the  Federal Judiciary. Working closely with Senate Democrats, the Biden  administration has prioritized the selection of judicial nominees who  are faithful to the rule of law, who are evenhanded and impartial, and  who understand the critical distinction between being an advocate and  being a judge. And together, we are building a Federal judiciary that  is more representative of the Nation as a whole, both in terms of  demographic and professional diversity. The five nominees under  consideration by the Senate this week are no exception, and I want to  speak briefly on each of them.   Yesterday, the Senate confirmed Judge Stephanie Davis to the U.S.  Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. Since 2019, Judge Davis has  served as a U.S. District Court Judge in the Eastern District of  Michigan. She was nominated for the District Court by President Trump.  And she was voted out of the Judiciary Committee by voice vote and  confirmed by voice vote as well.   Prior to serving on the District Court, Judge Davis served as a U.S.  magistrate judge for approximately 3 years, also in the Eastern  District of Michigan. In total, Judge Davis has served as a Federal  judge for more than 6 years. Before assuming the bench, Judge Davis was  an Assistant U.S. Attorney in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the  Eastern District of Michigan for nearly two decades. During her last 5  years in the U.S. Attorney's Office, she served as the Executive  Assistant U.S. Attorney. She also spent 3 years as the deputy chief of  the Controlled Substances Unit. While serving as a Federal prosecutor,  Judge Davis prosecuted elder fraud cases, served on a committee that  addressed a backlog of untested rape kits, and led one of the earliest  prosecutions combating the opioid epidemic in the Eastern District of  Michigan. Judge Davis also spent 5 years in private practice. During  this time, she volunteered with the Women's Justice Center, helping  victims of domestic violence obtain personal protection orders.   Born in Kansas City, MO, Judge Davis earned her college degree from  Wichita State University and her law degree from Washington University  School of Law.   Judge Davis has been unanimously rated ``Well Qualified'' for the  Sixth Circuit by the American Bar Association, and she has the strong  support of her two home State Senators, Ms. Stabenow and Mr. Peters.   Once sworn in, Judge Davis will be the first Black woman from  Michigan to serve on the Sixth Circuit--and only the second ever Black  woman to serve on the court.   With Judge Davis's extensive experience as a judge, a prosecutor, and  a litigator in private practice, as well as her decades-long commitment  to public service, she is clearly well qualified to serve on the Sixth  Circuit.   This morning, the Senate also confirmed the nomination of Evelyn  Padin to the District of New Jersey. A native of New Jersey, Ms. Padin  received her B.A. from Rutgers University, her M.S.W. from Fordham  University Graduate School of Social Services, her certificate in  European legal studies from Tulane University, and her J.D. from Seton  Hall Law School. Since graduating from law school, Ms. Padin has spent  nearly three decades practicing law.   In 1995, Ms. Padin opened her own law firm, and she has appeared  regularly in both State and Federal courts ever since. She has tried  approximately 10 jury trials to verdict, judgment, or final decision.  In addition to her lengthy career as a litigator, Ms. Padin also has  judicial experience, having served as a municipal court judge for the  Jersey City Municipal Court. In this role, she presided over nearly  3,000 cases--all bench trials--that went to verdict or judgment,  primarily involving minor criminal-type offenses, traffic violations,  and municipal ordinance offenses.   Outside the courtroom, Ms. Padin has been active in the legal  community. She was the first Latina to serve as the president of the  New Jersey State Bar Association. In that role, she worked to improve  access to justice in New Jersey, including by starting legal clinics to  serve the economically disadvantaged.   Ms. Padin received a ``Qualified'' rating from the American Bar  Association and has the strong support of her home State Senators, Mr.  Menendez and Mr. Booker. Ms. Padin's years of experience with New  Jersey's legal system, coupled with her broad legal expertise, make her  well-suited to serve on the Federal bench.   And the Senate also confirmed the nomination of Charlotte Sweeney to  the District of Colorado. Ms. Sweeney is a trial litigator who has  spent over 26 years defending the employment rights of Americans who  have faced discrimination or harassment--based on their race, national  origin, gender, age, or disability--in the workplace. Practicing  primarily in Federal court, she has tried more than 20 cases to verdict  or judgment.   Through her work, Ms. Sweeney has earned a reputation for integrity  and fairmindedness, both from her peers and from those before whom she  has practiced. Twenty-six attorneys who regularly work as opposing  counsel to Ms. Sweeney have offered their ``strong support'' of her  nomination, writing that she ``will be an impartial, prepared, and  reasoned jurist.'' Similarly, 17 former judges and employment lawyers  who have acted as settlement or arbitration proceeding neutrals have  also endorsed her nomination. Based on Ms. Sweeney's advocacy before  them, they believe she ``will make an exceptional district court  judge.''   With so much support from the Colorado legal community and as a  Colorado native herself, it is no surprise that Ms. Sweeney has the  strong support of her home State Senators, Mr. Bennet and Mr.  Hickenlooper, or that she was rated ``Well Qualified'' by the American  Bar Association.   Additionally, Ms. Sweeney will advance President Biden's commitment  to ensuring the Federal judiciary reflects the country it serves. She  will be the first openly LGBTQ article III judge in Colorado and the  first openly LGBTQ woman to serve as a Federal district court judge in  any State west of the Mississippi.   The Senate is also considering Nina Morrison, nominated to the  Eastern District of New York. Ms. Morrison attended Yale College and  New York University Law School before clerking for Judge Pierre N.  Leval on the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. She then worked in  private practice and at the American Civil Liberties Union before  joining the Innocence Project.   Ms. Morrison is now one of the most senior attorneys at the Innocence  Project, where she works to exonerate wrongfully imprisoned individuals  by petitioning for access to DNA evidence and other post-conviction  relief. Thanks to Ms. Morrison's efforts, nearly 30 wrongfully  convicted individuals in more than 10 States have been freed from  prison or death row. In addition, her work has helped to correctly  identify the perpetrators of violent crimes, delivering justice to both  their victims and to those who have been wrongfully imprisoned.   Ms. Morrison is a seasoned litigator who has practiced in State and  Federal courts all across the country. The American Bar Association  unanimously rated her ``Well Qualified'' to serve as a district judge,  and she has the strong support of both of her home State Senators, Mr.  Schumer and Mrs. Gillibrand.   Ms. Morrison has dedicated her career to ensuring that our justice  system lives up to America's ideals. Her dedication, breadth of  experience, and unique perspective will make her an asset to the  Eastern District of New York.   Finally, the Senate will consider Robert Huie, nominated to the  Southern District of California. Mr. Huie is an accomplished litigator  who previously served as an Assistant U.S. Attorney in the U.S.  Attorney's Office for the district to which he has been nominated.  Notably, he was counsel of  [[Page S2698]]  record in more than 600 district court cases and was lead appellate  counsel in approximately two dozen appeals.   After leaving the U.S. Attorney's Office, Mr. Huie went into private  practice, where he is currently Of Counsel in the San Diego office of  Jones Day and a leader in the firm's Investigations and White Collar  Defense Practice. He is also the San Diego office's pro bono  coordinator and chair of the diversity and inclusion committee. A  graduate of Yale Law School and a lawyer with extensive criminal and  civil experience, Huie is well-positioned to join the Federal bench. He  has tried 22 cases--both jury and nonjury--to verdict, judgment, or  final decision.   Mr. Huie has the strong support of Senators Feinstein and Padilla,  and he was rated unanimously ``Well Qualified'' by the American Bar  Association. His legal work both in and out of the courtroom, coupled  with his decades-long career serving the Southern District of  California, make him an outstanding nominee.   I am pleased that three of these nominees received bipartisan  confirmation votes and another nominee has already received a  bipartisan cloture vote. And I urge my colleagues to join me in  supporting those nominations that have not yet come up for a vote.   With their records, experience, and evenhanded approach, all of these  nominees will be ready on day one to serve this Nation as Federal  judges.                            ____________________     I announce that the Senator from Oregon (Mr. Merkley),  and the Senator from Maryland (Mr. Van Hollen) are necessarily absent.
