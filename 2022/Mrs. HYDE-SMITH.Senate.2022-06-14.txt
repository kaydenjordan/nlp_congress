 Mr. President, it is an honor to pay tribute  today to Ms. Karen Goode, who has retired after 47 years of dedicated  public service with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Regional  Office in Jackson, MS. Since becoming a U.S. Senator in 2018, I have  come to appreciate Ms. Goode who has earned consistent high praise from  my State office staff responsible for assisting veterans with their VA  claims. Karen's knowledge, responsiveness, reliability, and  trustworthiness have enabled me to serve Mississippi's  [[Page S2938]]  veterans better and more effectively, and I am very thankful to her for  that.   Karen began her career with the VA in 1975 in a clerical position  with the finance department. A GS-3 at the time she was hired, Karen is  retiring as a GS-13 supervisory veterans service representative, which  is evidence of her meritorious work leading to continual promotions  throughout her Federal civil service career. In the process, she  acquired the knowledge and skill sets for processing all claims for  compensation, pension, education, vocational, and rehabilitation. Ms.  Goode's thorough understanding of the claims review process, along with  her excellent management skills, propelled her into key senior  leadership roles that led her to supervising seven different employee  teams over her VA career.   Ms. Goode's high degree of professionalism earned her multiple  special recognitions. At the recommendation of the veterans service  center manager, Karen in 2006 served as the representative for the  southern area on a quality assurance detail HELP team in Washington,  DC. In 2012, at the completion of a designated special project as  quality team coach, Karen obtained Lean Six Sigma Green Belt  designation.   Even though Congress writes the laws regarding veterans' benefits, it  is up to teams set up within the VA to review veterans' claims and  determine if they are eligible for benefits. It can be a complex and  lengthy process, which I highly respect. Covering a broad range of  benefit categories, I understand the effectiveness in which VA team  member groups review and process claims can differ greatly. Despite  exercising most of her leadership away from the public eye,  Mississippi's veterans are fortunate to have been served by Ms. Karen  Goode for so many years working in this capacity. She has been  unwavering in her commitment to ensuring that Mississippi's veterans  receive the benefits to which they are entitled under the law.   In conclusion, I am incredibly grateful to Ms. Karen Goode for  dedicating her career to serving those who have served our country. I  commend her for her many accomplishments, and I send her my best wishes  for an enjoyable retirement.                            ____________________
