The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentleman opposed to the bill?    I am opposed.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to  recommit.   The Clerk read as follows:         Mr. Langevin moves to recommit the bill H.R. 238 to the       Committee on Agriculture with instructions to report the same       back to the House forthwith with the following amendment:        Page 44, line 15, strike ``and''.        Page 44, after line 15, insert the following:        (B) the Commission shall not consider the swaps regulatory       requirements of a foreign jurisdiction described under       subparagraph (A) as comparable to and as comprehensive as       United States swaps requirements, if that foreign       jurisdiction has been found by the Commission, in       consultation with the Director of National Intelligence, to       have engaged in cyber-attacks targeting any election held in       the United States; and        Page 44, line 16, strike ``(B)'' and insert ``(C)''.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Rhode Island is  recognized for 5 minutes.    Mr. Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill,  which will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted,  the bill will immediately proceed to a vote on final passage as  amended.   Mr. Speaker, the amendment I am offering this afternoon is simple. It  would prevent any jurisdiction's swap laws from automatically being  considered comparable to the United States if it is found to have  engaged in cyber attacks targeting U.S. elections. As someone who has  been involved in cybersecurity policy for the better part of a decade,  it could not be more relevant, it could not be more timely.   During the past year, Mr. Speaker, the core of our democracy came  under attack. The Russian Government, acting under the orders of  authoritarian President Vladimir Putin, conducted a sustained  information warfare campaign designed to undermine the American  people's faith in our electoral system. The influence operation  involved traditional tradecraft, including Russian state-owned media  broadcasters. It also, notably and notoriously, involved the hacking of  Democratic Party organizations, including the Democratic National  Committee.   These are facts, Mr. Speaker. They are the findings of independent  security researchers that have been recently confirmed by the brave men  and women serving their country as part of the intelligence community  for whom I have great respect. The contours of what happened are  indisputable, and they should be undisputed.   Yet, our response to this unprecedented attack has been anything but  unified. Putin and his henchmen acted with an intent to sow discord, to  make us question each other's motives, and to raise doubt about the  validity of our election results. We know this was Putin's intent, and  yet, rather than acting with solidarity to address the problem, we  bicker.   Mr. Speaker, next Friday, I will be here at the Capitol for one of  the greatest American traditions, the peaceful transition of power. Mr.  Trump may not have been my choice for President, but, come next week,  he will nonetheless be my President. I will join with my colleagues  here, and we will congratulate him on his inauguration. We will do so  because there is no evidence that any vote tallies were altered and,  like it or not, Mr. Trump clearly prevailed in the electoral college.   But if we can join together on the election of the President,  something many of my colleagues have severe disagreements about, why  can we not do so to decry Putin's attempted interference? Why do we not  speak today as a body with one voice to say: you've failed, Mr. Putin;  our faith in our democracy is as strong as ever?   I will not pretend that my amendment to this bill is sufficient  punishment for the brazen attack on our democracy. But it will send a  powerful message that this House is unified. It will send a powerful  message to Putin that American democracy is resilient. It will send a  powerful message to our allies that we will not stand idly by as  Russians attempt to affect their democratic institutions. And it will  send a powerful message to our constituents that our commitment to free  and fair elections rises above partisan politics.   President Obama spoke very eloquently on Tuesday about the challenges  faced by our democracy. ``Our democracy is threatened,'' he said,  ``whenever we take it for granted.'' Passing this amendment makes it  abundantly clear that we very much understand how lucky we are to live  in this country and how attacks on it will not be tolerated. I will  reiterate that this amendment will not kill the bill in any way.  Rather, we will move immediately to vote on final passage following its  adoption.   I urge my colleagues to join me in this display of solidarity and  resilience.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore.

The result of the vote was announced as above recorded.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the passage of the bill.   The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the ayes appeared to have it.    Mr. Speaker, we are less than 2 weeks into the start of  the new Congress and Republicans are already trying to make good on  their central campaign promise to repeal the Affordable Care Act.   Regrettably, it is a promise that will cause more than 30 million  Americans and at least 86,000 Rhode Islanders to lose their health  coverage. It will increase prescription drug costs for almost 16,000  Ocean State seniors, and it will cost Rhode Island an estimated 12,000  jobs in 2019, according to a recent report by The Commonwealth Fund and  George Washington University.   Mr. Speaker, the Republicans' promise to repeal the Affordable Care  Act will have devastating consequences for healthcare providers,  patients, families, and even employers. I have long said that ObamaCare  isn't perfect, and I am willing to work in a bipartisan manner to  improve it--a task we have tried to accomplish for years without  Republican cooperation.   Mr. Speaker, the budget resolution the Republicans are jamming  through Congress now is anything but bipartisan. I pledge to do  everything in my power to fight their cynical attempts to revoke the  health coverage of thousands of Rhode Islanders and of millions of  Americans who need it and who depend on it.                            ____________________
