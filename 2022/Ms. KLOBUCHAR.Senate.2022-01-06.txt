 Thank you, Senator Schumer, for your leadership and  your work and your words today.   As I stand here, I look at the faces of the staff. I remember the  moment when we were pushed out of this Chamber for security reasons. I  remember the words of one staff member, Leigh, who yelled out: Take the  boxes. Take the boxes. She was talking about the mahogany boxes that  were filled with the electoral ballots because we knew they would be  destroyed if they were left behind.   I remember my own staff--one of them is here today--hearing their  stories of being in a closet, hiding in a closet with only forks that  happened to be next door to protect themselves, right next to the doors  where the insurrectionists had invaded.   I remember the staff throughout this building who were marooned in  places and the faces of the police officers, the cuts on their faces,  the anguish, and the words of Officer Dunn, who said, at the end of the  day, that he had been called the N-word multiple times and that he had  looked to his friends, as they collapsed in the Rotunda, and said: ``Is  this America?''   ``Is this America?''   The haunting words of the police officer on the police radio that was  heard broadcast in the middle of the whole thing: ``Is there a plan?''   ``Is there a plan?''   There were many breakdowns that day, but the biggest breakdown was  the breakdown of our democracy; that some people actually felt that  they could take the law into their own hands; that they could invade  not just a building but our very Republic.   I look back at the words and the speeches that people gave that day,  not only after the insurrection, but what was telling was what they  said before it started. I think I would urge people to look at those  speeches. That discussion that we were having about this had been  raging for weeks and for months.   I remember standing at this very place right before we closed down  the Senate because of the insurrection and going through the facts-- going through the facts about how President-Elect Biden at the time had  won more votes than any President in history; the facts that 10 living  Defense Secretaries had actually stood up at the time, including both  of Donald Trump's Defense Secretaries, including people like Dick  Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld and William Cohen, and came together and  said that the scurrilous attacks on our democracy must stop, and we  must allow for the peaceful transition of power.   Then I looked at the very end of my remarks, and I ended with this  right before we were invaded. I said this:         My friend Roy Blunt--    Whom I still have immense respect for what he did that evening.         My friend Roy Blunt, my fellow Rules Committee leader, many       years ago, found a statue, a bust of a man at the top of a       bookcase. He did research. He went to the historians.       [And][a]ll he could find out was that no one knew who this       guy was except that he was a cleric. Hence, the statue is       called ``The Unknown Cleric.''        Now, at the time, our leaders [in this great place] thought       this man important enough that they would warrant a statue       for him, but today no one knows who he is. Senator Blunt's       message to schoolkids and Senators alike that visit his       office, when he shows them the statue: What we do here is       more important than who we are.    And I ended with this:         Senators, what matters is not our futures, not our short-      term destinies.        What matters is our democracy's destiny because I think       many of us know [that] people will not know who we are 100       years from now or 200 years from now, but what they will know       is this: They will know what we did today, how we voted       today. [And] that is more important than who we are. [As       someone once said,] [i]t is a Republic, if we can keep it.    ``It is a Republic, if we can keep it.'' Those words ring more true  now than  [[Page S58]]  they did a year ago because, as we know, the haunting shrieks of the  police that day, the officer pinned between the doors at the hands of  rioters--there were people who stood up for our Republic, and there  were people who attacked our Republic.    I remember Captain Carneysha Mendoza, a 19-year veteran of the  Capitol Police, who testified before the Rules Committee, who suffered  chemical burns to her face while commanding the officers in the Rotunda  while they struggled to hold the doors open.   Who can forget Officer Eugene Goodman, who after saving Senator  Romney from walking directly into the mob, ran by himself to take on a  group of rioters with his baton and then diverted that mob away from  the Senate Chamber, allowing us to safely depart?   Mr. President, who can forget the image right there where you sit on  that dais of the insurrectionists rifling through papers on people's  desks, opening up their offices and desks?   Tragically, five officers who reported for duty have since passed  away--five officers. You wonder why you see sad faces today on many  people in this building who were their friends. Capitol Police Officer  Brian Sicknick died the day after the attack. Four other officers died  in the days and months that followed--Capitol Police Officer Howard  Liebengood, DC Metropolitan Police Officers Jeffrey Smith, Gunther  Hashida, and Kyle DeFreytag.   Many more suffered physical injuries and even more sustained  emotional trauma from the events of that day. We also remember, of  course, Officer Billy Evans, who tragically died doing his job at his  post in April.   Recognizing the sacrifice of those heroes to defend our democracy is  the least we can do. Senator Blunt and I led legislation, with the  support our leaders, honoring those who protected the Capitol on  January 6 with the Congressional Gold Medal. It was an honor to stand  with officers and their families in August as President Biden signed  this bill into law.   We have made many, many improvements to the security of the Capitol.  I think it is very important for staff and officers alike and those who  work there to know that.   I want to thank Senator Schumer for his work in installing a new  Sergeant at Arms, Karen Gibson, for the Senate. We have General Walker  over in the House, and we have a new Police Chief, Chief Manger, who  did an excellent job yesterday in describing the changes. We know there  are many challenges ahead.   Last, but not least, is that we do not have enough police officers  right now to fill vacancies so people are working double shifts; they  are working vacations; they are canceling vacations. We have over 400  openings, an experience that many police departments throughout the  country have right now, but one that is very important, and the Chief  has committed to fill those vacancies.   But what have we done, the progress? Well, we have, one, gotten new  personnel in. Two, we have passed a law in this Chamber and signed into  law by President Biden that makes it easier for the Chief to call in  the National Guard in the case of emergency. We have made sure that  there are operational plans in place as there were this summer when  major events occur.   One of the saddest memories of that day was the fact that 75 percent  of the police officers asked to defend this Capitol were in plain  clothes--75 percent. In many cases, they had less protective gear on  than the invaders of the Capitol. That has changed--no more equipment  that is going to be locked on a bus that they can't access. With  Senator Leahy's leadership with Appropriations and Senator Shelby's  leadership, we have been able to obtain more funding to get them the  equipment that they need. All of those things are important.   But as Senator Schumer noted, the other piece of this is our  democracy itself. And that means getting to the bottom of what  happened. Something is happening right now with the House Select  Committee that is working to get the facts. We would have loved to have  an independent Commission like the 9/11 Commission to do that, but they  are doing that work over in the House.   Yesterday, we heard from Attorney General Garland, who pledged to  look at this at every level and to go where the facts will lead. Those  were his words. Accountability at every level for what happened here is  key, and it is the largest investigation we have seen in the history of  America. Over 700 people have been charged. That is a big piece of this  work as well--accountability.   As Senator Schumer noted, this is also about carrying on the torch of  our democracy. The voting rights legislation that we are working on  right now couldn't be more important because what was not accomplished  with bear spray and bayonets has now been passed on to others to pass  bills as we have seen in Wisconsin, where a bill actually passed that  would have allowed for only one ballot dropoff box in the entire city  of Milwaukee. That one was vetoed by Governor Evers. But others have  passed in States like Georgia, in States like Texas. And across this  country is a concerted effort to undermine our democracy.   So it is on us, when we take an oath to defend the Constitution of  the United States, no matter what party we are in, to hold our  democracy dear. It is a precious, precious thing and it is very fragile  and it is in our hands to protect, just as our police officers  protected it on January 6.   When you have 9,600 threats against Members of Congress--double what  it has ever been in the past--that is not a small thing; that is  January 6 continued. When you have election officials who have to leave  their posts because, in the words of the election official from the  city of Philadelphia, his own family was threatened, their names, their  addresses, their house put out on the internet; Katie Hobbs, secretary  of state in Arizona, receiving a voice mail saying: ``I am a hunter-- and I think you should be hunted;'' people in rural areas who are  elected officials who cannot have the kind of security that people may  have in this building--that is January 6 continued.   And we cannot forget our duty going forward. I will end with that  image that I will always cherish and the hope that democracy will  prevail. At 3:30 in the morning, when Senator Blunt and I and Vice  President Pence took that long walk over to the House with the two  young women with the mahogany box filled with the last of the electoral  ballots up through Wyoming--there was broken glass on all sides; there  was spray paint on statues. It was the same walk we had taken in the  morning, which had been so joyful, the celebration of our democracy, so  ceremonial--and there we were, the last ones left taking that walk into  the House Chambers where we finished our job. So when I look back at  that day, that is the lasting image; that in the end, democracy  prevailed.   Two weeks later, there we were under that beautiful blue sky with  leaders of both parties on that inaugural stage saying that, yes, our  democracy stood tall. It brushed itself off, and we moved forward as  one Nation under God, with liberty and justice for all, as we always  do. And that is the spirit with which we must go forward in the coming  weeks as we debate the importance--the importance--of keeping that  democracy strong with election laws; that we continue to improve the  security in this Capitol; and that we hold the people who did this not  just to us, not just to this building but to our very Republic-- accountable for what they did.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I want to recognize the heroic efforts  of our staff, many of whom are here with us today; of our law  enforcement who, in the face of overwhelming numbers and an  unprecedented violent assault, valiantly placed their lives on the line  for this Republic.   It is also an opportunity to remember to recommit ourselves to making  sure nothing like this ever happens again. As President Biden said  today, our democracy held. We, the people, endured; we, the people,  prevailed.   And we devote this moment of silence to those who stood up, not only  for this building, not only for the people that worked here, but for  our very democracy itself.    Mr. President, we will be joined shortly by your  colleague from the great State of Virginia, and I wanted to address  some of the incredible work done by the Maryland and the Virginia  National Guard, which was so important that day.   We have fixed a lot of the issues going forward about how they get  called in, but that moment when they had to stand up, they did. So we  really, truly appreciate their help, as well as other National Guards-- from as far away as New Jersey and as close as DC--for helping out that  day. They made a critical difference.   I see the Senator from Michigan is here, and we thank him for his  leadership of the Homeland Security Committee and the work that we did  together in the aftermath of this insurrection to make sure something  like this--and to guarantee to the staff and the officers in this  Capitol that something like this never happens again.    Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Oregon. We  have had a day of tributes to those who work in the Capitol, those who  protected us. We have had a day of reflection, and we have had a day of  hope as we look to the future for our democracy that we hold with such  care.   I want to thank the staff that was there that day. And for those of  you--I am looking at the pages--who are new in the Senate, over the  next few weeks, it is worth talking to one of the staff members who was  here that day to hear their stories, to let them reflect on what  happened to them, whether they were people who were assigned to the  hallways or the trams or the cafeteria. What happened to them that day?  The Sergeant at Arms, so many employees there who were here that day  because this was the day of the peaceful transition of power in this  Chamber and in the House. The Parliamentarian's office, those that work  there--that was one of the most difficult moments, to walk into their  office late in the morning, 4 in the morning. Senator Blunt and myself,  when this was all done, after we had done our work with Vice President  Pence and the House, we walked around downstairs. It was eerily quiet.  There was no one there. And you walked into the rooms, and there was  glass from people's personal photos in the Parliamentarian's office  that cracked, things thrown on the floor, their personal belongings.   And you wondered: Why did they go in that office? Was it just a  fluke? No, they actually understood where that office was. We later  found out they knew exactly that that office was in charge of these  electoral ballots and in charge that day of the proceedings and had a  special place in our democracy. And they actually knew where that  office was and deliberately went into that office and invaded that  office.   Everyone from the Capitol physician to the floor staffs, both  Democratic and Republican floor staffs, who were here that day, charged  with making this day move like it had over and over and over again  every 4 years when, no matter who wins, we go and we do our work that  is demanded of us under the Constitution.   I remember, 4 years before that, my candidate certainly didn't win in  2016, but we went and we did our job. And I remember at the time, Vice  President Biden was presiding over that proceeding because it was the  end of his time as Vice President, just like Vice President Pence was  involved this last time. And he did his job.   I think about what the Senators have talked about today, and we have  heard from so many of our colleagues--Senator Warner and Van Hollen and  Kaine talking about the National Guards of Virginia and Maryland and  their police that came in--not planned that this was going to happen  this day--and came in and helped protect the Capitol and, along with  National Guards throughout our country, including from my own State of  Minnesota, then stayed on for weeks and weeks and months and months  until we could get the security in order in this place.   The Capitol Police--and so many of my colleagues, including Senator  Booker, have shared the stories of the Capitol Police that day. And I  know we have used some famous examples of those officers, but I think  it is really important to note that every officer did something that  mattered that day, some act of heroic duty, by doing their jobs.   We thank the work that has done by the staffs of our Rules Committee,  who are here today--Senator Blunt's and my staff--as well as Homeland  Security, with Senators Peters and Portman, who immediately took on the  task of holding very public hearings about what went wrong on the  security side and then the decisions to hire new leaders for our  Sergeant at Arms; with Senator Schumer's work on that, as well as the  police chief with Chief Manger, who testified at length yesterday in a  very bipartisan hearing, actually, in the Rules Committee about the  changes that have been made, the changes when it comes to equipment, as  we remember that 75 percent of the officers that day were in  plainclothes and only 25 percent had riot gear--the horrifying image of  the riot gear locked onto a bus that no one could access while the  Capitol was being invaded; the lack of a plan, in the words of the  police officer broadcast on the police radio: Does anyone have a plan?  Does anyone have a plan?   And, sadly, the answer was, literally, no. That has now changed, as  the chief has told us, when events have happened in the last few months  in the Capitol--plans in place, operational plans, drills that have  been conducted in this Capitol.   The lack of resources, which had been demanded in the past, that  Senator Leahy in the Appropriations Committee and Senator Shelby have  come to the floor and have worked to get them the resources that they  need.   But the challenges that still remain, the vacancies on the police  force, people working double shifts and overtime and people not being  able to take their vacation and be with their families because they are  still working to protect our Capitol. And the police chief's pledge to  work to recruit 200 or so more officers in just the next year with  retention benefits and all the work that is being done.   The other piece of this that we heard a lot about today was  accountability. We heard from Senator Durbin and members of the  Judiciary Committee and Senator Booker about the need--and Senator  Markey--for accountability. And this includes the select committee over  in the House and the  [[Page S78]]  investigation that they are conducting with not just Democrats but also  two very strong Republicans who have been willing to basically put  their careers on the line because they believe so much in this  democracy that we must get to the bottom of what happened.   The work going on in the Justice Department, which has now been, as  of yesterday, as the Attorney General of the United States described to  us, the biggest investigation in the history of America, because I  don't think people had envisioned that we would have an attack like  this, but we did.   Two hundred forty-four years of democracy--244 years of democracy-- that it is our charge to protect, and that is why you see this  investigation. That is why you see over 700 people charged. This is why  you see the Attorney General pledge to follow this to every level and  to follow the facts to where they go.    We must remember, in the end, as my colleague from Oregon Senator  Wyden has addressed, this is not just and was not just an attack on a  building; it was an attack on our Republic.   I was looking back at the Inauguration Day and that beautiful moment  with that blue sky, and there were little snowflakes coming down. I  remember hearing the beautiful words of Amanda Gorman, in her gold  coat, that day, with that amazing poem, the singing. I remember Garth  Brooks singing ``Amazing Grace.'' I looked up at the sky and thought  that anything and everything is possible and our democracy has  prevailed.   I remember the words of Abraham Lincoln, actually, which I quoted in  my brief speech that day, when he gave his first inaugural address in  front of this Capitol. The dome was only partially constructed--it was  braced by ropes of steel back then--and he promised he would finish it.  He was actually criticized for spending funds during the Civil War on  the dome, as it was somehow frivolous. To those critics, he replied:  ``If people see the Capitol going on, it is a sign we intend the Union  shall go on.''   When we gathered that day on that inaugural stage, there was still  spray paint on the columns. They actually couldn't get it all out  because the insurrectionists had first come to that platform because-- just as they knew what was going on in the Parliamentarian's Office,  they targeted that platform because that is exactly where President  Biden and Vice President Harris were going to receive their oaths of  office. There were still traces of spray paint. The windows behind us  weren't the real windows; they were makeshift windows. But we all  gathered there. The President-elect, now President, would not have his  inauguration in a bunker. Senator Blunt and I strongly believed that  this should be a public event. As we stood out there, ``The Capitol  shall go on''--that was the message we were sending to the country.   So what does that mean right now, a year later, this anniversary,  ``The Capitol shall go on''? Yes, it means that we have better  security, and we do better by our police officers, and we have their  backs. It means that. We do better by the staff in this great building.  Yes, it means we have accountability for the people who had the  audacity to invade this Capitol and take the law into their own hands  and commit acts of violence. But the other thing it has to mean a year  later is that we carry on that torch of our democracy, as the Senator  from Oregon explained, that we make sure our very democracy is  protected.   (Ms. CORTEZ MASTO assumed the Chair.)   That means guaranteeing that people have the right to vote.   What was not accomplished that day with the bear spray and the  bayonets and the flagpoles sadly carried on because these bills that  have been introduced in so many States and passed across the country-- over 400 of them passed in many, many States across the country or  proposed, seriously proposed, in others--bring us backwards. It  basically says: You know what. Democracy--the people who propose these  bills--is not about who votes for whom, regardless of who wins; it is  about us choosing our voters and deciding haves and have-nots and who  is going to be able to vote and who isn't going to be able to vote.   When you think about what the people of this country will do to  preserve that right to vote--I think about those people in Wisconsin  with homemade masks and garbage bags, standing in the pouring rain at  the beginning of the pandemic just to exercise their right to vote.   I think about the veteran I met when we did our field hearing with  Senators Warnock and Ossoff and Senators Merkley and Padilla down in  Atlanta. This veteran told us that he had signed up to serve our  country, and there wasn't a waiting line, but when he went to exercise  his right to vote, he had to wait hours and hours--4, 5 hours--in line  in the hot Sun just to exercise his right to vote. He told the stories  of older people who had left because they couldn't stand the heat, they  couldn't stand out there anymore.   That is not what our democracy is supposed to look like. It is not  supposed to look like one ballot box in the entire county of Harris  County, which includes Houston in Texas, over 5 million people with one  ballot drop-off box. That is not our democracy.   But the American people in that 2020 election said: You know what. No  matter what you do to us, we are going to go vote. And they voted in  droves. They voted more votes than in the history of America. Part of  that was because, because of the pandemic, changes were made to the  law, including that some States took away ridiculous requirements that  you have to get a notary public. Think about it--in the middle of a  pandemic.   Right now, by the way, South Carolina has put this law back into  effect. To get your mail-in ballot because you can't go vote in person  because you have COVID, you have to have a notary public. There are  stories reported in the news of people having notary publics, through  the glass windows of hospitals, sign off on the application of ballots.  All of that is designed, in the words of Reverend Warnock, so that some  people don't allow some people to vote. That is what that is about.   So it is on us right now to carry on the democracy. And that feeling  we had when the leaders of both parties all stood on that inaugural  stage or when we took that last walk, Senator Blunt and Vice President  Pence and I and the two young women with the mahogany box with the last  of the electoral ballots--that feeling was a good one, and it was a  celebration of joy for our country and the peaceful transition of  power.   As pointed out in our speeches on the Senate floor right after the  insurrection--I remember Senator Shaheen standing right there talking  about how the world is watching our democracy. Well, this is another  moment. The world is watching as we see dictators coming into power in  other countries around the world, as we see the former President still  out there rallying the troops around this Big Lie that he somehow won  the election when every single local election official in this country  knows that is not true. This is our moment to stand up to that because  the people are watching. Our kids are watching. And the democracy  stands in the breach. This is our moment. We must pass the Freedom to  Vote Act, and we must uphold our democracy.   I yield the floor.
