 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor a departing member  of my office, my longtime senior adviser, Jaime Lizarraga.   This is a moment of great official pride as, last week, he was  unanimously confirmed by the Senate to serve as a Commissioner of the  Securities and Exchange Commission.   His departure is also bittersweet for me, as he has been an  invaluable member of our team for the last 15 years.   All of those who have ever had the privilege of working with Jaime  know firsthand, he is the model of an outstanding, patriotic public  servant in a bipartisan way.   He has dedicated his entire career to doing the people's work. He has  excelled not only in my office but also on the House Financial Services  Committee, where he worked with then-Chairman Barney Frank; at the  Treasury Department; and as a staffer at the SEC.   Indeed, President Biden's selection of Jaime to serve on the SEC is a  testament to Jaime's deep expertise, strategic mind, and strong values.   His unanimous confirmation in the Senate was a tremendous victory for  working families and for the entire country.   Here in the House, his masterful leadership was instrumental in  enabling and enacting some of the most consequential economic  legislation in a generation. During the financial meltdown of 2008, he  helped stabilize the markets with the Troubled Assets Relief Program,  TARP.   In the wake of economic catastrophe, he also helped strengthen the  oversight of Wall Street with the historic Dodd-Frank legislation.   As COVID ravaged the Nation, he helped negotiate multiple relief  packages that saved lives and spared livelihoods.   For years, he has been a relentless champion in the Congress for  restructuring Puerto Rico's debt, supporting affordable housing,  reforming our immigration system, and building economic opportunity for  all.   Beyond his many impressive legislative achievements, Jaime is truly  the embodiment of the American Dream. The proud son of immigrants from  Mexico, he has never forgotten his parents' sacrifices to give him and  his sister a brighter future. In that spirit, every day, he fights  relentlessly to open doors of opportunity for every American family.   Jaime's brilliance, expertise, and personal kindness will be sorely  missed in my office and in Congress. But our Nation will greatly  benefit from his continued public service at the SEC as he strives to  build a fairer financial future for all.   On behalf of the House, we congratulate Jaime on this remarkable  achievement and wish him so much success in his new role. We send best  wishes to him, his beloved wife, and his 5 dear children as they begin  this exciting chapter.   Congratulations, Jaime, and thank you for your service.
