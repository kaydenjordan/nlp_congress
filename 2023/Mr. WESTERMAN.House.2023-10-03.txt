 Selah, s-e-l-a-h, selah. This unique word, scattered  throughout the Psalms, signals to the reader to pause, reflect,  consider, and maybe take a deep breath before moving on.   Psalmists use selah to emphasize the significance of a statement. For  example, King David wrote: ``Blessed be the Lord, who daily bears our  burden, the God who is our salvation. Selah.'' That is a profound  statement with huge implications. It deserves more than a cursory  consideration.   Within the next hour, this House will vote ``yea'' or ``nay'' to  vacate the Speaker's chair, a profound action with huge implications.  This was last tried in 1910. Joseph Cannon won the vote. One hundred  thirteen years later, my office is in the Cannon Office Building, and  Uncle Joe Cannon's statue sits just outside this Chamber.   No living human has taken the vote we are about to take. It deserves  that we pause and reflect, that we consider deeply the ramification of  our actions.   To my fellow Republicans who would consider voting ``yes'' to  removing our Republican Speaker, please pause and ask yourself two  questions: Will your ``yes'' vote make America stronger? Will your  ``yes'' vote strengthen conservative policies?   If you believe ``yes'' is the right vote, please stand before this  body and the American people and articulate your plan--not your  grievances or your wishes, your plan. Convince the vast majority of the  Republican Conference that strongly disagrees with you to follow you.   If you cannot do that, which you have failed to do so far, then  voting ``yes'' is, at the least, a disruptive overreaction. In reality,  it is selfish, bad for conservative policies, and bad for America.   That is why I strongly support Speaker Kevin McCarthy and why,  without hesitation or reservation, I will vote ``no'' on this  disastrous resolution.
