 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this amendment.  [[Page H3506]]     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Let's be clear, if our aim is to push back on Russian aggression and  hold Vladimir Putin accountable, this amendment will accomplish none of  that.   Nord Stream 2 is a menace to peace and security in Europe, period. It  is Putin's transparent attempt to make Europe more dependent on Russian  energy, to tighten Russia's grip, and to put down deeper roots to  fracture European resolve.                                time  1915    If we want to disrupt Nord Stream 2, where should we turn up the  heat? On Russia. On Putin and the oligarchs who stand to reap billions  with this.   What does this amendment do? It goes after our allies. It targets  German companies, European enterprises, maybe even Americans. But  consequences for Russia? Forget about it.   Spit on our closest friends, let Russia off the hook, it doesn't seem  right to me.   Sound familiar? It is the same refrain we have heard again and again.  This is not good, and it should not pass.   How are we even debating this? The amendments I offered with  Chairwoman Waters to address Russian bounties on American lives and  pushing back on Russian election interference? Out of order. Nobody  would go along with those.   The measure Chairman Schiff and I authored to prevent the collapse of  the New START treaty, the last remaining safeguard on Russia expanding  its nuclear arsenal unchecked? Out of order.   The Republicans and Democrats loved this treaty when it was ratified.  There was cross-party support for nuclear modernization, but they are  offering a collective shrug now that the clock is ticking on its  expiration.   Mr. Speaker, the National Defense Authorization Act has long stood as  a pillar of bipartisanship in advancing our security interests, but  right now, the Republicans seem to be backing out of this. So guess  what? We have to make sure that certain priorities are not passed  because that is not the direction we should go in.   I am the chairman of the most bipartisan committee in Congress, and  that is too high a price to pay for bipartisanship.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I first thank the gentleman from Arizona (Mr.  Gallego) for really terrific work on this. He did so much to move this  forward, and it was a pleasure having our staffs work together, and I  thank him very much for that.   Mr. Speaker, for years, I have been sounding the alarm on Nord Stream  2. I have warned about the dangers of allowing Putin and Russia to  strengthen their hand by making Europe more dependent on Russian  energy. I have supported dozens of other efforts to hold Putin  accountable and demand that there be consequences for his aggression.   If I thought this amendment would ratchet up pressure on Putin and  his cronies, I would be the first to support it. Instead, I believe  this measure lets Putin off the hook while placing all the consequences  for Nord Stream 2 on our friends and allies. I think it is just a wrong  direction to go.   If we are serious about making Putin pay a price, we should defeat  this amendment and go back to the drawing board. I won't call for a  vote by the yeas and nays on this measure, but I will oppose it, and I  urge all Members to do the same.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding to me.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the amendment that we passed  already, but I wanted to give my strong support for it.   Earlier this year, despite opposition from Congress and our allies,  the administration withdrew from the treaty. I don't think that was the  right thing to do.   When it comes to Putin and when it comes to Russia, we have much  reason to be afraid of moves that Putin is always plotting and  planning. I think the Open Skies Treaty was a good treaty, and I think  it was a big mistake to pull out of it.
