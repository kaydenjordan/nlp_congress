 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Indiana (Mr.  Bucshon), the chairman and my esteemed friend, for yielding time.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to join me in  supporting H.R. 752, the Securing Semiconductor Supply Chains Act,  which I co-led with Congresswoman Eshoo, who I thank for her  leadership.   This bipartisan bill seeks to uncover barriers to expanding foreign  direct investment into domestic manufacturing for semiconductor chips.   Over the past few years, Hoosiers in southern Indiana felt the  ripples in our economy caused by the shortages of semiconductor chips.  Auto manufacturers like Honda in Greensburg and Cummins engine company  in Columbus, Indiana, told me firsthand the potential impacts on day- to-day operations because of this shortage.   We learned the hard way that our economy cannot rely solely on  adversarial nations like China to secure chips for our economy.   My greatest priority in Congress has been fighting for policies that  have the opportunity to create good-paying jobs for our Hoosiers and  for all Americans, and I urge support for this bill.
