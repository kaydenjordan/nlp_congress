 Mr. Chair, September 24, 1981, in his address to the  Nation on the program for economic recovery, President Ronald Reagan  made the following comment: ``As a third step, we propose to dismantle  two Cabinet Departments, Energy and Education. Both Secretaries are  wholly in accord with this. Some of the activities in both of these  Departments will, of course, be continued either independently or in  other areas of government. There is only one way to shrink the size and  cost of Big Government, and that is by eliminating agencies that are  not needed and are getting in the way of a solution. . . . By  eliminating the Department of Education less than 2 years after it was  created, we cannot only reduce the budget but ensure that local needs  and preferences, rather than wishes of Washington, determine the  education of our children.''   The Federal Department of Education was created in 1979. Many people  can't even remember a time when it was not a creation, but there was  such a time.   Mr. Chair, for 200 years, our Nation flourished and had rigorous  education absent the Federal Department of Education.   I, too, am a product of public education, but I contend if we want to  empower parents in the hypersexualized, woke culture that is invading  our classrooms, we need to give school board members and parents the  ability to determine the education of their children and empower them  by returning to the brilliance of our Founding Fathers.   In the 18 enumerated powers that list those things that the Federal  Government should do, education is not mentioned. That is why Thomas  Jefferson made the comment that in order for the Federal Government to  be involved in education, you have to have a constitutional amendment.   We need to follow the advice of our Founding Fathers and put this  back in the hands of our States. They can determine what is happening  in the classroom. That is a success for our children and this country.                                time  1900
