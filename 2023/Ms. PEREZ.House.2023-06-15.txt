 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to my  distinguished predecessor, a true statesman, and above all, a dear  friend, Don Bonker.   I had the honor of knowing Don personally and can attest to his  generosity. When he heard that I was shopping for a suit for my husband  at Goodwill, he mailed out one of his old suits for us to borrow. His  generosity really knew no bounds.   He was a real source of guidance during those early days. He was  always able to take my calls and answer my questions. I will forever  cherish our memories and our conversations together.  [[Page H2949]]    Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in keeping Don's beloved  wife, Carolyn, and his children, Dawn and Jonathan, in our thoughts and  prayers.   May they find solace in knowing Don's legacy will live on in the  hearts and minds of those who had the honor of knowing him.                            ____________________
