 Mr. Speaker, Americans love sports. They love honest  sports. They love winning the Stanley Cup by the great team here in  Washington. We loved winning the World Series with the Houston Astros.  We love our Olympics.   Today, I rise because I recently introduced, H.R. 6067, the  Rodchenkov Anti-Doping Act, or RADA.   In the realm of international sports, it has become almost  commonplace for too many athletes to yield to the temptation of  bridging the gap between their own skills and the pinnacle of athletic  achievement by resorting to performance-enhancing drugs.   To conceal this fall from grace, cheaters are employing increasingly  sophisticated modes of masking the use of any prescribed drugs. This  practice, some of it state-sanctioned, undermines international  athletic competition. That is why I introduced the RADA Act, H.R. 6067.   I ask my colleagues to join me. This is a bipartisan bill supported  by Ms. Gwen Moore, Dr. Burgess, and myself. Our numbers are growing.  The legislation I have introduced is bipartisan.   As well, we salute the valiant man who revealed the true extent of  the complex, state-run doping scheme in Russia.  [[Page H5187]]    Mr. Speaker, I would simply like to close by saying a young lady by  the name of Alysia Montano lost a race to Russians who had been a part  of doping fraud. She lost the medal and she lost millions, but she also  may have lost her spirit.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record an article from The New York  Times entitled: ``U.S. Lawmakers Seek to Criminalize Doping in Global  Competitions'' which cites RADA as a step in the right direction toward  criminalizing doping in international sports.                  [From the New York Times, June 12, 2018]      U.S. Lawmakers Seek to Criminalize Doping in Global Competitions                            (By Rebecca R. Ruiz)         United States lawmakers on Tuesday took a step toward       criminalizing doping in international sports, introducing a       bill in the House that would attach prison time to the use,       manufacturing or distribution of performance-enhancing drugs       in global competitions.        The legislation, inspired by the Russian doping scandal,       would echo the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which makes it       illegal to bribe foreign officials to gain a business       advantage. The statute would be the first of its kind with       global reach, empowering American prosecutors to act on       doping violations abroad, and to file fraud charges of a       different variety than those the Justice Department brought       against top international soccer officials in 2015.        Although American leagues like Major League Baseball would       not be affected by the legislation, which would apply only to       competitions among countries, it could apply to a league's       athletes when participating in global events like the Ryder       Cup, the Davis Cup or the World Baseball Classic.        The law would establish America's jurisdiction over       international sports events, even those outside of the United       States, if they include at least three other nations, with at       least four American athletes participating or two American       companies acting as sponsors. It would also enhance the       ability of cheated athletes and corporate sponsors to seek       damages, expanding the window of time during which civil       lawsuits could be filed.        To justify the United States' broader jurisdiction over       global competitions, the House bill invokes the United       States' contribution to the World Anti-Doping Agency, the       global regulator of drugs in sports. At $2.3 million, the       United States' annual contribution is the single largest of       any nation. ``Doping fraud in major international       competitions also effectively defrauds the United States,''       the bill states.        The lawmakers behind the bill were instrumental in the       creation of the 2012 Magnitsky Act, which gave the government       the right to freeze financial assets and impose visa       restrictions on Russian nationals accused of serious human       rights violations and corruption. On Tuesday, the lawmakers       framed their interest in sports fraud around international       relations and broader networks of crime that can accompany       cheating.        ``Doping fraud is a crime in which big money, state assets       and transnational criminals gain advantage and honest       athletes and companies are defrauded,'' said Sheila Jackson       Lee, Democrat of Texas, who introduced the legislation on       Tuesday. ``This practice, some of it state-sanctioned, has       the ability to undermine international relations, and is       often connected to more nefarious actions by state actors.''        Along with Ms. Jackson Lee, the bill was sponsored by two       other Congressional representatives, Michael Burgess,       Republican of Texas, and Gwen Moore, Democrat of Wisconsin.        It was put forward just as Russia prepares to host soccer's       World Cup, which starts Thursday. That sporting event will be       the nation's biggest since the 2014 Sochi Olympics, where one       of the most elaborate doping ploys in history took place.        The bill, the Rodchenkov Anti-Doping Act, takes its name       from Dr. Grigory Rodchenkov, the chemist who ran Russia's       antidoping laboratory for 10 years before he spoke out about       the state-sponsored cheating he had helped carry out--most       notoriously in Sochi.        At those Games, Dr. Rodchenkov said, he concealed       widespread drug use among Russia's top Olympians by tampering       with more than 100 urine samples with the help of Russia's       Federal Security Service.        Investigations commissioned by international sports       regulators confirmed his account and concluded that Russia       had cheated across competitions and years, tainting the       performance of more than 1,000 athletes. In early 2017,       American intelligence officials concluded that Russia's       meddling in the 2016 American election had been, in part, a       form of retribution for the Olympic doping scandal, whose       disclosures Russian officials blamed on the United States.        Nations including Germany, France, Italy, Kenya and Spain       have established criminal penalties for sports doping       perpetrated within their borders. Russia, too, passed a law       in 2017 that made it a crime to assist or coerce doping,       though no known charges have been brought under that law to       date.        Under the proposed American law, criminal penalties for       offenders would include a prison term of up to five years as       well as fines that could stretch to $250,000 for individuals       and $1 million for organizations.        ``We could have real change if people think they could       actually go to jail for this,'' said Jim Walden, a lawyer for       Dr. Rodchenkov, who met with the lawmakers as they considered       the issue in recent months. ``I think it will have a       meaningful impact on coaches and athletes if they realize       they might not be able to travel outside of their country for       fear of being arrested.''        The legislation also authorizes civil actions for doping       fraud, giving athletes who may have been cheated in       competitions--as well as corporations acting as sponsors--the       right to sue in federal court to recover damages from people       who may have defrauded competitions.        Ms. Jackson Lee cited the American runner Alysia Montano,       who placed fifth in the 800 meters at the 2012 Summer       Olympics. Two Russian women who placed first and third in       that race were later disqualified for doping, elevating Ms.       Montano years later. ``She had rightfully finished third,       which would have earned her a bronze medal,'' Ms. Jackson Lee       said, noting the financial benefits and sponsorships Ms.       Montano could have captured.        The bill would establish a window of seven years for       criminal actions and 10 years for civil lawsuits. It also       seeks to protect whistle-blowers from retaliation, making it       illegal to take ``adverse action'' against a person because       he or she has disclosed information about doping fraud.        Dr. Rodchenkov, who has lived in the United States since       fall 2015, has been criminally charged in Russia after he       publicly deconstructed the cheating he said he carried out on       orders from a state minister.        ``While he was complicit in Russia's past bad acts, Dr.       Rodchenkov regrets his past role in Russia's state-run doping       program and seeks to atone for it by aiding the effort to       clean up international sports and to curb the corruption       rampant in Russia,'' Ms. Jackson Lee said, calling Tuesday's       bill ``an important step to stemming the tide of Russian       corruption in sport and restoring confidence in international       competition.''     Mr. Speaker, join me in supporting the RADA bill.   I thank Isabella Belcher and the OSCE staff.   Mr. Speaker, I recently introduced H.R. 6067, the Rodchenkov Anti- Doping Act (``RADA'') because in the realm of international sports, it  has become almost commonplace for too many athletes to yield to the  temptation of bridging the gap between their own skill and the pinnacle  of athletic achievement by resorting to performance enhancing drugs.   And to conceal this fall from grace, cheaters are employing  increasingly sophisticated modes of masking the use of any proscribed  drugs.   The United States has a large role to play in ferreting out  corruption in international sports.   Not only do U.S. athletes lose out on millions in sponsorships, but  when a U.S. company spends millions to create a marketing campaign  around an athlete, only to have that athlete later implicated in a  doping fraud scandal, the damage to that company's brand can cost tens  of millions.   This has been the story of Alysia Montafio, a U.S. runner who  competed in the 2012 Summer Olympics games in London and placed fifth  place in the 800 meters behind two Russian women finishing first and  third.   These women were later found to have engaged in doping fraud by the  World Anti-Doping Agency, meaning that Ms. Montano had rightfully  finished third, which would have earned her a bronze medal.   Ms. Montano estimates that doping fraud cost her `maybe half a  million dollars, if you look at rollovers and bonuses, and that's  without outside sponsorship maybe coming in.'   She adds, `That's not why you're doing it, but you still deserve it.'  She certainly does. Until now, defrauded U.S. athletes and companies  have had little recourse against doping fraud.   A recent article published by The New York Times titled ``U.S.  Lawmakers Seek to Criminalize Doping in Global Competitions''  references the RADA as a step in the right direction toward  criminalizing doping in international sports.   The RADA is an important step to stemming the tide of Russian  corruption in sport and restoring confidence in international  competition.   This practice, some of it state-sanctioned, undermines international  athletic competition and is often connected to more nefarious actions  by state actors.   This is why it is necessary for Congress to enact H.R. 6067, the  bipartisan Rodchenkov Anti-Doping Act (``RADA'' Act)   The legislation I have introduced is bipartisan, and bears the name  of courageous whistleblower Dr. Grigory Rodchenkov, a valiant man who  revealed the true extent of the complex state-run doping scheme which  permitted Russia to excel in the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics, and which  resulted in its ban from the 2018 Olympic Games.   While he was complicit in Russia's state-run doping program, Dr.  Rodchenkov regrets his role and seeks to atone for it by aiding the  effort to clean up international sports and to curb the rampant  corruption within Russia.  [[Page H5188]]    The RADA Act is a serious step towards cracking down on the use of  performance-enhancing drugs in major international competitions because  it establishes criminal penalties and civil remedies for doping fraud.   A number of other nations, including Germany, Austria, Belgium,  Denmark, France, Italy, Sweden, Switzerland, and Spain, have embraced  criminal sanctions for doping fraud violations and it is time for the  United States to be added to this list.   Doping fraud in major international competitions--like the Olympics,  the World Cup and the Tour de France--is often linked with corruption,  bribery and money laundering.   It is not just victory that criminals engaged in doping fraud snatch  away from clean athletes--athletes depend on prize money and  sponsorships to sustain their livelihoods.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Congressman Raskin for  his leadership, consistent leadership, on these issues. And certainly,  I think, the recognition of the fact that the poor of this Nation, both  in the biblical sense of our faith or the document of your faith, the  poor have always been acknowledged, and, in a certain sense, in the  Christian Bible honored.   And it is a sad state of affairs for us to come to this point in the  Nation to realize that our poor are suffering at large numbers and that  there is no relief.   I know that Dr. King, some 50 years ago, as he was planning the Poor  People's march--and many of us realized that he was not able to fulfill  it for he was shot by an assassin's bullet on April 4, 1968. But the  valiant people went forward with his dream of eliminating poverty. And  I am reminded of his words: Injustice anywhere is injustice everywhere.   And so I speak today of the sprinkling, the harsh sprinkling of  poverty and injustices in this Nation today, and I make it a very  special message to the leader of the free world, who has every power to  collaborate with this important body, to make commitments to end the  very conditions that Dr. King, some 50 years ago, sought to come to  Washington that was ultimately proceeded with by leaders of the  Southern Christian Leadership Conference and poor people from around  the Nation.                                time  1730    They might not have succeeded specifically, but they did bring to the  Nation's eyes and hearts the violence of poverty among Native  Americans, Latinos, African Americans, poor, and Caucasians in places  beyond the South. And, interestingly enough, that poverty continues.   I speak, in particular, of certain elements that show our lack of  concern and where we must get steady and back on track. First, what all  of us have been speaking about over the last couple of days and weeks  is the untoward and the impossible thought of taking children away from  parents who are fleeing poverty, violence, and desperation to come.   We know that, in my home State of Texas, a migrant was separated from  his family and committed suicide while in Federal detention. Injustice  anywhere is injustice everywhere. And a mother, while breastfeeding her  young child, while both were in Federal detention, had her child ripped  away from her arms. That must stop. That is a poverty of mind, a  poverty of heart and spirit.   I want to thank Reverend Barber, who will be headed to Washington on  June 23 with the massive, largest expression of those who still,  unfortunately, live in the shadows, not of their own making. When I say  that, they are not in the shadows, they are there, but seeming there in  the shadows with respect to the policies of this administration, the  terrible Robin Hood tax bill that has created nothing but a balloon of  wealth to the top 1 percent, so much so that the wages of Americans  have not gone up. When you travel throughout the country and in my  district, most people don't know, working Americans have no idea that  any tax bill was passed that was supposed to impact them because it has  not impacted them, and the only thing that is happening is a flush of  corporate profits.   Now, it would seem that one is criticizing that success. We are  criticizing the unequalness of what happens to working families who  work every day and have not had a wage increase.   Then out of that comes the implosion of the Affordable Care Act,  brick by brick being taken away. I know of people who have told me that  their loved one was put in a wheelchair and pointed toward the door:  Get out. And the Affordable Care Act provided that there were no caps  on one's insurance until you got better in the hospital. But because of  the atmosphere, and the climate, and the constant attack on the  Affordable Care Act, hospitals are feeling the burden and are sending  people out the door who are not well.   Even more frightening for people are those who have preexisting  conditions, one of the glaring parts of the Affordable Care Act, one  where people were waving the flag. They were excited, if they had a  preexisting condition, which, before the Affordable Care Act, it could  have been acne or it could have been pregnancy. But now, that coverage  and protection for our loved ones who may have preexisting conditions,  loved ones who could function with healthcare and not be relegated to  be homebound because they were so sick they could not work.   This is a terrible approach to how you run a country.   In these last two points, I want to make it clear how important it is  to recognize that poverty still is. And not only Dr. King, but we  recognize that Robert Francis Kennedy, also struck down by an  assassin's bullet, worked in his campaign for President in 1968 to  bring to the attention of Americans the fact that it is so important to  realize poverty exists in the worst way in the mountains and valleys,  and urban centers, and that Americans should stand up against poverty.   Poverty impacts the criminal justice system. In 1968, African  Americans were about five to four times as likely as Whites to be  imprisoned, or jailed. Compared to today, they are six to four times as  likely as Whites to be incarcerated, which is troubling, given the  population difference.   As Judge Learned Hand observed, ``If we are to keep our democracy,  there must be one commandment: Thou shalt not ration justice.''   It is important that, as we match meaningful prison reform, we must  match it with meaningful sentencing reduction. We must stop the tide of  poverty by ending mass incarceration. And we must, in fact, recognize  that we must fight against recidivism, open the doors of opportunity  for ex-felons as they come out, and make sure that we are reducing  those mandatory minimums that have kept people in jail 15, 20, 25, or  30 years away from their family so that their children grow up without  them.   We must recognize that poverty attacks at a very young age. It moves  people toward the juvenile justice system, and it only causes them to  believe this is the only thing that they can engage in. I have  introduced legislation to give hope to the juvenile justice system: no  more solitary confinement; alternative placement; and if they are able,  as they rehabilitate, we ban the box on saying that they have been in  the juvenile system.   I want to stop homelessness. That is what Dr. King knew had to end to  end that aspect of poverty, and to, of course, end it among our  veterans.   I want to end the idea of $23 billion out of SNAP's program.   And, of course, I want to recognize that when we have these  devastating storms, the amount of homelessness goes up. It is so very  important to recognize the devastation of Hurricane Harvey, that there  are those who are still unhoused, and to make a commitment after every  disaster that we make those communities whole: volcanos, tornadoes,  fires, and floods.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for allowing us to be here  tonight. And I want to conclude by showing this Robin Hood tax bill,  stealing from the poor. This year, the administration, President Trump,  proposed to slash housing benefits by $11 billion because we had to pay  for the tax cut. Weeks after that tax cut was passed, President Trump  proposed to pay for the bill by slashing housing benefits and other  supports for low-income people who struggle to make ends meet. And here  we stand with the $1.5 trillion deficit.   So, what is our message? That we must never give up in this fight. We  must stand in the tradition of Dr. King. We must be reminded of those  who are coming to Washington in the coming days. We must say to have  mercy on them. And, of course, as Reverend Barber would always seek,  that they be blessed, blessed with mercy and success, as they stand  against poverty and stand for the ending and elimination of poverty  [[Page H5192]]    Mr. Speaker, I thank the Congressional Progressive Caucus for  anchoring this important Special Order.   In the spirit of the 50th Anniversary of the Poor People's Campaign,  we are here today to bring the nation's attention to the issues that  affect them: immigration, health care, paid sick leave, criminal  justice, homelessness, and environmental justice.   We must act without delay regarding the ``zero-tolerance'' policy  that separates families apprehended on the southern border by U.S.  Border Patrol.   As the member of the House Committees on Homeland Security and former  Ranking Member of the Homeland Security Subcommittee on Maritime and  Border Security, I cannot think of a situation more devastating than  having the government forcibly separate a parent from her child to a  place unknown, for a fate uncertain, absent any form of communication.   Every day, hundreds of persons, ranging from infants and toddlers to  adolescents and adults, flee violence, oppression, and economic  desperation from Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador, seeking safe  harbor in the United States.   They are not criminals or terrorists, they are refugees seeking  asylum.   The level of callousness displayed by this administration towards  those seeking refuge within our borders is shocking.   Every day that passes seemingly reveals another horrific tale of a  migrant interacting with Trump's border patrol forces and then being  worse for the wear because of it.   We know of the immigrant who was deported to Mexico, a country he  left when he was three years old, only to be murdered by gang violence  just three weeks after his forced return.   We know of the young mother, separated from her children at the  border, left to wonder about their fate, safety, future, and whether  she would ever see them again.   In my home state of Texas, a migrant who was separated from his  family, committed suicide while in federal detention.   A mother who, while breastfeeding her young child when both were in  federal detention, had her child ripped away from her arms.   This cannot be how we make America great again, this is how we make  America hateful again.   This week brought news that the Trump administration is seeking to  build a tent city at Fort Bliss for the purpose of housing children  separated from their parents.   This is unconscionable, outrageous and it must stop.   I have written to the Secretary of the Department of Homeland  Security calling for an immediate end to this policy.   America is the envy of the world, in large part because of our  welcoming and generous nature.   For over 100 years, those seeking a better life have been drawn to  this land by the words on the Statue of Liberty: ``Give me your tired,  your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, the wretched  refuse of your teeming shore.''   The current president fails this obligation, but he is who he is.   We must be who we are: a loving, embracing people, eager to share the  bounty of this country to all who seek it.   The President and GOP have promised for years now to create a plan to  improve health insurance for everybody.   But that promise has not been kept.   The Affordable Care Act (ACA) has significantly improved the  availability, affordability, and quality of health care for tens of  millions of Americans, including millions who previously had no health  insurance at all.   Americans are rightly frightened by Republican attempts to repeal the  ACA without having in place a superior new plan that maintains  comparable coverages and comparable consumer choices and protections.   It is beyond dispute that the ``Pay More For Less'' plan proposed by  House Republicans a few months ago fails this test miserably.   The Republican ``Pay More For Less Act'' is a massive tax cut for the  wealthy, paid for on the backs of America's most vulnerable, the poor  and working class households.   This ``Robin Hood in reverse'' bill is unprecedented and breathtaking  in its audacity--no bill has ever tried to give so much to the rich  while taking so much from the poor and working class.   This Republican scheme gives gigantic tax cuts to the rich, and pays  for it by taking insurance away from 24 million people and raising  costs for the poor and middle class.   It is despicable and shameful that those elected to serve their  people would rather see their pockets full than their constituents  healthy and well.   Fifty years or so ago the American Labor Movement was little more  than a group of dreamers, and look at it now.   From coast to coast, in factories, stores, warehouse and business  establishments of all kinds, industrial democracy is at work.   From ending sweatshop conditions, unlivable wages, and 70-hour  workweeks, we have come a long way from our practices over 100 years  ago.   However, we still have work to be done.   Currently in America, there are no federal legal requirements for  paid sick leave.   For companies subject to the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), the  Act does require unpaid sick leave and are only eligible to take FMLA  after they have worked for their employer for at least 12 months,  worked for at least 1,250 hours over the previous 12 months, and work  at a location where at least 50 employees are employed by the employer  within 75 miles.   According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, state and local  government workers were more likely than workers in private industry to  have access to paid sick leave but less likely to have access to paid  vacations and holidays.   As with workers in private industry, state and local government  workers in the lower wage categories were less likely to have access to  paid sick leave than workers in higher wage categories.   Workers in lower wage categories were less likely to have access to  paid sick leave than more highly paid workers.   For private-industry workers with an average wage in the lowest 10  percent, 27 percent had access to paid sick leave; among workers with  an average wage in the highest 10 percent, 87 percent had access to  paid sick leave.   This is an atrocity.   We must allow for all of our constituents to be able to work within a  healthy environment.   In 1968, African Americans were about 5.4 times as likely as whites  to be in prison or jail; compared to today, African Americans are 6.4  times as likely as whites to be incarcerated, which is especially  troubling given that whites are also much more likely to be  incarcerated now than they were in 1968.   It is clear the inequalities and disparities that ignited hundreds of  American cities in the 1960s still exist and have not been eliminated  over the last half-century.   As Judge Learned Hand observed, ``If we are to keep our democracy,  there must be one commandment: thou shalt not ration justice.''   Reforming the criminal justice system so that it is fairer and  delivers equal justice to all persons is one of the great moral  imperatives of our time.   For reform to be truly meaningful, we must look at every stage at  which our citizens interact with the system--from policing in our  communities and the first encounter with law enforcement, to the  charging and manner of attaining a conviction, from the sentence  imposed to reentry and collateral consequences.   The need for meaningful prison reform cannot be overstated because  being the world's leader in incarceration is neither morally nor  fiscally sustainable for the United States, or the federal government,  the nation's largest jailer.   For individuals who have paid their debt, the reentry process is  paved with tremendous, and often insurmountable, obstacles resulting in  recidivism rates as high as 75 percent in some areas.   More must be done to ensure that the emphasis on incarceration is  matched with an equal emphasis on successful reentry so that the  approximately 630,000 individuals who reenter society each year are  prepared to be successful in civilian life.   This is why I have also strongly supported and cosponsored  legislation that will allow those with a criminal conviction to have a  fair chance to compete for jobs with federal agencies and contractors.   I have also been working for many years to stop the over- criminalization of our young people.   Today, more and more young children are being arrested, incarcerated,  and detained in lengthy out-of-home placements.   Harsh and lengthy penalties handed down to young offenders increase  their risk of becoming physically abused, emotionally traumatized, and  reduce their chance of being successfully reintegrated back into their  communities.   I have introduced and supported legislation to help reform how youth  and juveniles are treated to reduce contact and recidivism within the  juvenile and criminal justice system; to help protect them from a  system that turns them into life-long offenders.   Just as we need to minimize the conviction of innocent people, we  must address the unnecessary loss of life that can result from police  and civilian interactions.   Effective law enforcement requires the confidence of the community  that the law will be enforced impartially and equally.   That confidence has been eroded substantially in recent years by  numerous instances of excessive use of lethal forces.   There is no higher priority than improving the peacefulness of these  interactions and rebuilding the trust between law enforcement and the  communities they serve and protect.   Currently, over half a million people in the United States on any  given night are experiencing homelessness.  [[Page H5193]]    Now that Congress has lifted the low spending caps required by law  for defense and domestic programs, lawmakers should ensure the highest  level of funding possible for affordable housing.   When U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)'s  resources are cut, families may lose access to stable housing, putting  them at increased risk of homelessness.   This year, President Trump proposed to slash housing benefits by $11  billion compared to current levels.   Weeks after passing a massive tax bill that grows our deficit by $1.5  trillion, the President proposed to pay for the tax bill by slashing  support for low income people who struggle to make ends meet.   HUD and The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) affordable  housing programs have lifted millions of families out of poverty.   Without this investment, many of these families would be homeless,  living in substandard or overcrowded conditions, or struggling to meet  other basic needs.   As well, homelessness among the American veteran population is on the  rise in the United States and we must be proactive in giving back to  those who have given so much to us.   Today, in our country, there are approximately 107,000 veterans (male  and female) who are homeless on any given night.   And perhaps twice as many (200,000) experience homelessness at some  point during the course of a year.   We have an obligation to provide our veterans the assistance needed  to avoid homelessness, which includes adequately funding for programs  such as Veterans Administration Supportive Housing (VASH) that provide  case-management services, adequate housing facilities, mental health  support, and address other areas that contribute to veteran  homelessness.   We must commit ourselves to the hard but necessary work of ending  veteran homelessness in America because providing a home for veterans  to come home to every night is the very least we can do.   As one of the original members of the House Committee on Homeland  Security, I am well aware of the range of threats that our nation has  faced.   However, I believe that the threats posed by climate change have been  ignored to our nation's detriment.   Climate change is the challenge of our lifetime and for far too many  years we have heard the warnings from prominent scientists regarding  the danger to people if nothing is done to reverse the amounts of Green  House gases released into the atmosphere.   All of you will recall the devastation that Hurricane Harvey wreaked  on the Houston community last fall.   Neither Houston nor any other city in the nation had ever experienced  flooding of the magnitude caused by Harvey.   In addition to the immense costs of recovery and reconstruction, the  cost of human lives is always immeasurable.   If we do not collectively and concretely address the looming threat  of climate change, we must prepare for many more devastating natural  disasters that destroy lives and livelihoods.   In 2015, the Pentagon published a report that found climate change to  be a security risk, because it degrades living conditions, human  security and the ability of governments to meet the basic needs of  their populations.   Communities within the United States and countries around the world  that already are fragile and have limited resources are significantly  more vulnerable to disruption and far less likely to respond  effectively and be resilient to new challenges caused by climate  change.   The poor and marginalized who live in areas that already prone to the  consequences of severe weather because the land was cheaper or unwanted  by developers will suffer the early consequence of climate change, but  the damage will not stop there it will be felt by all.   As many of you well know, Greenhouse Gases such as carbon dioxide  (CO2) absorb heat (infrared radiation) emitted from Earth's  surface.   Increases in these concentrations of these gases in Earth's  atmosphere are causing our planet to warm by trapping more of this  heat.   Warmer temperatures have caused the Arctic Ice sheets to melt at an  unprecedented rate.   This winter we have seen extreme temperature swings in some parts of  the country, while in others they have seen no winter at all.   We are at a point where we can no longer wait for action only from  Washington D.C., we must begin to take action in our own cities,  counties and states to prepare for the challenges we will face if the  rise in temperatures is not abated.   It will continue my efforts in Washington to make sure that we have  flood study of the greater Houston area to determine the implications  of flooding and development in our area.   I urge my colleagues in Congress, and all Americans, to look at what  unites us rather than what divides us.   We are linked by our compassion, and bound by the fundamental edict  of the American Dream that says we will strive to provide our children  with a better life than we had.   We can, and we must, find the common ground necessary to make this  dream a reality for Americans of every race and creed, nationality and  religion, gender and sexual orientation; indeed for every American  wherever he or she may live in this great land regardless of what he or  she looks like or who they may love.   We can do it; after all, we are Americans.
