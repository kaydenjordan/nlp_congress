 Mr. President, I rise to pause and remember March 28,  2020. It is a day that Oklahomans and the Nation lost a patriot and a  friend to many.   I stand here at this desk that I have used for the past 5 years, but  before it was my desk, it was the desk of Dr. Tom Coburn.   A few days after we gaveled out in March, Dr. Coburn took his first  breath in Heaven, where he was finally cancer-free, finally pain-free,  and living in the presence of Jesus, where there is no  [[Page S2310]]  government waste and no inefficiency, where there is no conflict, and  liberty is absolutely eternal. We will miss his sage advice, his blunt  perspective, and his steadfast wisdom.   Dr. Coburn served in this Chamber for 10 years, from 2005 to 2015,  but he also served in the House of Representatives for 6 years, from  1995 to 2001. The one title he carried in both of those Chambers was  ``Doctor,'' and that was his preferred term.   Thomas Allen Coburn was born in Casper, WY, on March 14, 1948. Dr.  Coburn graduated from Central High School in 1966. In 1968, he married  Carolyn Denton--by the way, the 1967 Miss Oklahoma. They had three  daughters and nine grandchildren.   At Oklahoma State University, Dr. Coburn was an honor student and  president of the student business council. He graduated in 1970 with a  bachelor's degree in accounting.   After the family business he worked at was sold, he attended medical  school at the University of Oklahoma and received his medical degree  with honors in 1983. He interned at St. Anthony's Hospital in Oklahoma  City. In 1986, he founded the Muskogee Family Medicine practice, which  is still in operation today.   His victory over melanoma as a young man inspired him to become a  physician. He stated he wanted to give back because he had been given  to. Unfortunately, that battle with melanoma when he was a young man  was not his last battle with cancer.   As a physician, his dedication to his patients was inexhaustible.  Over his career, he delivered 4,000 babies and would often see 30  patients a day in his office.   After his election to the House of Representatives in 1994, he would  fly home from Washington, DC, so that he could continue to see his  patients on weekends--a schedule he maintained for the entire 6 years  he spent in the House. He was a doctor all the time.   It was not uncommon for him to be in a conversation with someone, and  right in the middle of the conversation, he would ask them how they  were feeling because he had picked up something in their demeanor that  he thought was a little bit wrong.   Dr. Coburn was a deacon and a Sunday school teacher.   In all the story that I have told you, if you are looking for some  element of politics in the background, you won't find it until 1994.  His decision to run for Congress in 1994 was a long shot. He narrowly  won, becoming the first Republican to represent Oklahoma's Second  Congressional District in 73 years.   He went to Congress as a man on a mission. He was determined to help  solve the Nation's problems. His focus was not Oklahoma; it was the  Nation.   I remember asking him privately before I started serving in the House  of Representatives how he made a difference. His answer was that there  are two people who make a difference in Congress--the person who  studies and the committee chairman. Study more than anyone else, know  the issue, and you can get it done.   His tenacity on every issue was legendary. POLITICO once summarized  it well, saying: ``A typical bill moving through the Senate has a  number of institutional hurdles to clear: subcommittee, committee,  leadership and Coburn. It's that last one that you won't find in a  textbook.''   His staff were wholly devoted to the cause, not necessarily because  of him but because of the mission. One of his former staffers wrote  this after Dr. Coburn passed:         We blocked a lot of bills. We offered a lot of amendments.       We lost a lot of votes. We highlighted a lot of wasteful       spending. We irked a lot of people. And over time, we started       changing how business was done. Bills that added new spending       couldn't pass without offsets. Program duplication became       part of the lexicon. The practice of earmarking went away.       People started paying attention to government waste.    Doctor Coburn's annual ``Wastebook'' became one of the more high- profile reports coming out of Washington each year. Over the years, Dr.  Coburn and his team highlighted trillions in questionable spending on  low-priority items that taxpayers were unwittingly paying for. Any  spending that proved to be classic Federal wastefulness, duplicative,  fraudulent, or purely ineffective, likely made the list each year. The  ``Wastebook'' became an annual rallying cry for taxpayers frustrated  by Washington's spending habits. Phrases that are common in American  political conversations today, like ``the bridge to nowhere,'' ``shrimp  on a treadmill,'' ``term limits,'' and ``earmarks,'' were all battles  that he fought to win.    In 2010, in a fight over the debt limit increase, Dr. Coburn created  an annual report from the Government Accountability Office on  government duplication. It seemed like just another government report,  but that report--that report that he passed in 2010--has saved  taxpayers $262 billion dollars so far.   Dr. Coburn and his team were in the fights worth fighting, but they  were battling on the playing field of ideas and policy proposals, not  against people. In a town that wants to label everything left versus  right, liberal versus conservative, Dr. Coburn and his team didn't have  any criteria to meet for those who joined them in the fight; they were  willing to pull together any ally. You didn't have to agree on  everything, but as long as you agreed on a couple things in front of  you, that is what mattered. The friendships that were forged in the  fight were genuine, true, and certainly unique.   He was the chief sponsor of President Obama's USASpending.gov to  increase transparency in government spending. He was a champion for  HIV/AIDS patients and medical research to save lives. He was a  tenacious fighter against Social Security disability fraud, eventually  exposing a $1 billion Social Security scam in West Virginia run by a  lawyer named Eric Conn, a Kentucky lawyer who filed thousands of bogus  disability applications.   He was a master of Senate rules--his clay pigeon amendment is  legendary in Senate procedure. He was one of the unlikeliest Members to  vote for TARP in 2008. It was probably one of the hardest votes that he  took, but when he looked at the facts in front of him, he saw that it  was the right thing to do. That was ultimately what it boiled down to-- he was willing to do the right thing, no matter what the cost. He  opposed what needed opposition, but he would prefer to argue in private  to resolve an issue rather than in public, although he was clearly not  afraid to argue in public.   After years of serving families as their physician--a task he  continued on weekends even when he was in the House of  Representatives--the Senate Ethics Committee ruled that Dr. Coburn was  violating conflict of interest rules by holding an outside job and  prohibited him from practicing medicine as a Senator. Dr. Coburn then  just stopped taking payment and did his work as a physician pro bono,  and the Ethics Committee also rejected that plan and prohibited him  from working pro bono, even as a physician.   Ironically, I am now the chairman of Ethics for the Senate. The last  time I visited with Dr. Coburn at his house in February, in the middle  of our long, great conversation, he said to me: Since you are the  chairman of Ethics, why don't you get that rule changed and allow  doctors to still practice medicine while they are in the Senate? That  is wrong. That needs to be fixed.   Even in the end, he was still working to right what was wrong.   Many people know that when Dr. Coburn left the Senate, he spent his  time trying to fix Congress--still working on term limits and a  balanced budget amendment.   If you have not seen it, you should read some of the things his  former staff wrote about Dr. Coburn after he passed away a few weeks  ago. Any Senator in this Chamber could only wish that our staff looked  up to us as much as his staff looked up to him.   I thought the best way to honor Dr. Coburn today, though, was to  remind this body of what Dr. Coburn said as he walked out of this  body--his farewell speech. Among the many things he said, he challenged  the Senate and Senators by saying this:         The Senate was designed uniquely to force compromise, not       to force gridlock--to force compromise. One Senator had the       power to stop everything for the first 100 years but it       didn't because compromise was the goal.    Our Founders understood there were many differences between the  States in size, in geography, economy, and opinions. They united the  States as one country based upon the premise that the many are more  powerful than the one. As Senators, we have to follow this example.   Then, he said this:   [[Page S2311]]              I've not always done that--I admit that freely to you. I       should have.    As Senators, we must follow the example and stand for our principles,  but working to find those areas of agreement where compromise can be  found to unite and move our country forward. Not all the powers of the  Senators are exercised on the Senate floor. Each Member of the Senate  has a unique role to participate and practice oversight and to hold the  government accountable. That is part of our duties, except most often  that is the part of our duties that is most ignored.   True debates about national priorities would come about if we did  effective oversight. It is the Senate, once hailed as the world's  greatest deliberative body, where these differences should be argued.  Our differences should be resolved through civil discourse so they are  not settled in the streets. Just as the Constitution provides for  majority rule in our democracy, while protecting the rights of  individuals, the Senate must return to principles to bring trust to the  electorate, and it can.   The theme of his whole farewell speech centered around this one  statement:         We do not have one problem we cannot solve. There is       nothing too big for us. They are all solvable.    On this National Day of Prayer, I believe it is entirely appropriate  that we pray for Dr. Coburn's family, friends, and former staff, who  will miss his friendship and his counsel, and so will our Nation.   I pray that Carolyn, their daughters, and their families cherish the  memories of a husband, dad, and grandfather. Our State and our Nation  will be forever grateful for your sacrifice. I pray that the task Dr.  Coburn began would be completed for the sake of our liberty and of our  future, and I pray that this body will take up the challenge he left on  this floor: to solve the hard problems we face as a nation together.   I yield the floor.
