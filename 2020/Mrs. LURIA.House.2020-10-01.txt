 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of America's  Conservation Enhancement Act and the inclusion of my bill, the  Chesapeake Bay Program Reauthorization Act.   As my colleague, Mrs. Dingell, said, this is truly an example of a  bipartisan bill where we have been able to work across the aisle and  across the bay, and I would like to thank my colleague, Mr. Wittman  from Virginia, as well for his strong cooperation on this program.   The Chesapeake Bay is a national treasure, and its health is critical  to the environmental and economic well-being of coastal Virginia and  beyond. The Chesapeake Bay generates $33 billion in economic value  annually and is home to spectacular natural beauty and ecological  diversity.   The EPA's Chesapeake Bay Program coordinates regional conservation  efforts and supports the work of States in meeting their restoration  commitments under the Chesapeake Bay Watershed Agreement. Funding for  the bay program goes directly to localities to improve conservation  efforts. However, Congress has not reauthorized this program since  2005.   By passing the ACE Act and, simultaneously, my bill, Congress will  reaffirm that all States in the watershed and the EPA must work  together to achieve these restoration goals. This includes ensuring  that all States have plans in place enabling them to achieve these  goals.   I want to thank my colleagues in the House and the Senate who worked  hard to secure the passage of this bill.   Again, I would like to thank Mr. Wittman, my colleague, Congressman   Bobby Scott from Virginia, as well as Mr. Sarbanes from Maryland for  being initial cosponsors on this bill. I urge all Members to support  America's Conservation Enhancement Act.
