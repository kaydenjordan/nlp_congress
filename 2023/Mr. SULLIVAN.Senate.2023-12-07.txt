 Mr. President, I am going to pose a simple question  here related to this guy. That is the dictator of China, Xi Jinping.  Imagine if a Chinese financial institution, one of their banks, one of  their private equity funds--they have a lot of them. Imagine if a  Chinese financial institution started to invest in the United States in  big technologies that would make the U.S. military much stronger. What  do you think would happen to those executives in China? They are taking  [[Page S5877]]  Chinese money, and they are pouring it into companies that work  directly with the Pentagon, making the U.S. Army, Navy, Marine Corps,  and Air Force stronger and more lethal. What would this dictator do to  those Chinese executives?   I will tell you what he would do. A, he would never let them do it.  But if they did do it, he would arrest them, put them in jail, and  shoot them at sunup. That is what he would do.   There is not one person in this body, not one person in America-- heck, not one person in China--who would disagree with that.   That is what he would do.   So what happens when American investment companies--financial  institutions, private equity firms, hedge funds, venture capital firms,  investment banks--what happens when they invest in Chinese companies  that make the Chinese military more lethal and stronger? What happens?   The answer: pretty much nothing. Worse, we have a hard time knowing  which American firms are even doing this.   This is a huge knowledge gap in an asymmetrical advantage that our  biggest adversary--right here, Xi Jinping and the Chinese Communist  Party--has over us.   They can't invest. They won't invest. They will get the death penalty  if they invest in an American company that will help our military  become stronger.   We have, who knows, a lot of financial institutions investing in  Chinese companies to make their military stronger. We have financial  companies that are investing in the Chinese Communist Party, companies  that are producing things like advanced semiconductors, artificial  intelligence, quantum computing, hypersonics--all technologies that are  critical to dominating the 21st century battlefield. This is a giant  American national security issue.   I don't normally come down to the Senate floor and quote Lenin. I am  not a big fan of Lenin. But he purportedly said that ``capitalists will  sell us the rope with which we will hang them.''   There is a little bit of that going on right now here in the United  States of America. We have executives in this country and certain  financial institutions--by the way, these American financial  institutions and executives owe everything to their success by being  American, being in the greatest country in the world, with the rule of  law and our capital markets and our dynamic economy. Their success is  because of the great Nation we live in, and yet some, kind of addicted  to making more money--listen to Lenin. They are like, you know, maybe I  will do that advanced chip manufacturing investment in the Chinese  economy; maybe I will help them a little bit with artificial  intelligence or quantum computing.   By the way, quantum computing, if you get really good at that, you  can break any code that our military uses. You are toast if you can't  communicate in a covered fashion--encrypted.   This is really dangerous stuff. I was first, actually, made aware of  this many years ago by, in my view, one of the best Chairmen of the  Joint Chiefs of Staff for our military that we have had in decades,  Marine Corps Gen. Joe Dunford. He is just a fantastic Marine officer,  just a fantastic Chairman. He is very measured, very smart, very  strategic.   He raised this issue with me many years ago: Senator, we, America,  have financial institutions--American financial institutions using  American investment money--you know, the Iowa teachers' retirement  plan, the laborers' retirement plan. They are taking that money, and  they are investing it in China in some really advanced technologies.   There is a problem. The Chinese don't have that kind of investment  capital and professionalism to grow these companies, but we do.   So this was first brought up to me by a great Marine general. So I  started digging into it over the years and years, and it is a giant  problem. Senior administration officials in the Biden administration  agree. A whole host of top national security officials in the Trump  administration agree. This is a bipartisan issue in terms of the  concern. It is a blinking red light for our national security.   So some might ask: Well, wait a minute. What is wrong with an  American financial company making an investment in the Chinese private  economy?   Well, look, it depends on what part of the Chinese private economy.  If you want to go make more hamburgers over there and sell--I don't  know--refrigerators, that is fine. But these are investments in some of  the critical technological needs of the military that will enable  whichever military dominates these sectors to dominate the 21st century  battlefield.   And, by the way, there is no such thing as a private company in  China. If you are a private equity firm in America, you are saying:  Well, I am just investing in this private company in China to help them  with their quantum computing capability.   We all know that this guy and the Chinese military--the PLA and the  Chinese Communist Party--they own that. They own that. They will take  it, use it, dominate it.   So what can we do about this problem? Well, look, there are a lot of  ideas on what we can do about this problem. I am working on legislation  that would actually have the U.S. Government, believe it or not--and I  am not a big government guy--look into the investments being made by  American financial institutions into some of the most high-tech areas  of China, what we would call outbound CFIUS. CFIUS is this process for  inbound investment.   Let's look at what is happening outbound. It is a little more  controversial. I think we need it, unfortunately, because we have a lot  of--not a ton but, certainly, a number of--American financial  executives who are like: Look, man, whatever--patriotism, I will leave  that at the door. I am not really worried about that. I am not worried  about that guy. I just want to make a big buck. It is too bad, but we  got them. So we need this.   Here is an easier starting point. Let's have a transparency provision  that enables us, the U.S. Government, to say: All right, big financial  American firms or private equity firms or hedge funds, the American  investment dollars that you are getting from the Illinois teachers'  retirement fund, we want to know if you are putting that into quantum  computing that can help this guy dominate Taiwan.   We want to know that. We want transparency. It is pretty good idea.   Now, Senator Cornyn offered a bill--I was a cosponsor of it--that we  attached to the NDAA, saying we want outbound investment transparency.  We want to know: What are American financial firms doing helping this  guy become stronger?   It is pretty easy. Guess what, Mr. President. It is super bipartisan.  That bill is brought to the floor as part of the National Defense  Authorization Act and passed 91 to 6--91 to 6. Very few things pass 91  to 6 here. That did because it made sense. It is very bipartisan and  relatively simple. It is just transparency.   Hey, Sequoia Capital--I am going to talk about them in minute--a big  private equity firm, are they investing in quantum computing that can  help this guy dominate the world? We should know, especially if it is  American investment dollars, right?   So that is a good start. There is a lot of agreement.   Here is a letter from Dr. Kevin Roberts, the head of the Heritage  Foundation.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter dated November  29, 2023, be printed in the Record.        There being no objection, the material was ordered to be       printed in the Record, as follows:                  Congress: Time to Walk the Walk on China         Washington--Heritage Action President Dr. Kevin Roberts       released the following statement Wednesday as Congress       finalizes its annual defense bill.        ``Congress must seize opportunities in this year's National       Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) to counter threats from       Communist China and deliver for the American people. Reports       that the House of Representatives may abandon efforts to       track the billions of dollars of U.S. capital flowing into       China, including into sanctioned Chinese military and       technology companies, are extremely concerning. Doing so       would all but ensure that the House will close out its first       year of Republican leadership without notching any meaningful       legislative accomplishments to address the most critical       national security threats from China.        Multiple efforts to address threats from China are in       danger of being omitted from the NDAA, including provisions       to sanction  [[Page S5878]]       fentanyl traffickers, protect U.S. agricultural land, and end       the funneling of taxpayer dollars to Chinese drone and       biotech companies. However, the most important effort would       begin to tackle a massive problem: today, U.S. capital freely       flows into China with few restrictions, little oversight, and       minimal prohibitions. The pensions and savings of millions of       Americans are literally financing China's military buildup.       Nevertheless, reports indicate that efforts by House       Financial Services Chairman Patrick McHenry may succeed in       blocking the Senate's bipartisan Outbound Investment       Transparency Act, which would begin scrutinizing these       problematic investments in China.        ``Failing to advance outbound investment reform would be a       gift to Xi Jinping and the Chinese Communist Party. Congress       works for the American people, not Wall Street. It is long       past time to stop funding our own destruction and end       business as usual with Beijing. Politicians like talking the       talk about being tough on China--it's time to walk the       walk.''     He was talking about how we need to be able to track  U.S. capital flowing into China, and it would be extremely concerning  if that Cornyn amendment didn't make it into the final NDAA.   So he is saying: Hey, Senators, House Members, make sure that stays  in.   Thank you, President Roberts of Heritage.   He also wrote the leadership of the House and Senate: Senator  McConnell, Senator Schumer, Speaker Johnson, and Congressman Jeffries.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter dated November  16, 2023, be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                  November 16, 2023.      Hon. Mike Johnson,      Speaker of the House, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Charles E. Schumer,      Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Hakeem Jeffries,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Johnson, Leader Jeffries, Leader Schumer, and       Leader McConnell: As the FY2024 National Defense       Authorization Act (NDAA) moves through conference committee,       we write to urge Congress's support for security-related       restrictions on outbound investment of American capital to       the People's Republic of China (PRC). Many outbound       investments into China are jeopardizing our national security       by accelerating sensitive dual civilian and military       technology development for the PRC, thereby strengthening its       military, intelligence, surveillance, and security       capabilities.        Some in Congress incorrectly argue that restricting such       investments will impede the economic growth produced by       adhering to free market principles. House Financial Services       Chairman Patrick McHenry, for example, has argued that ``If       we oppose China's state-run economy, we want more private       investment--not less. Of those private investors, we want       more of them to be Americans--not fewer. And if we are truly       concerned by China's technology companies, we want as many       Americans as possible steering them, spreading Western       standards, and complying with U.S. laws.''        This argument does not apply to a state-controlled economy       like China's, where businesses succeed only at the pleasure       of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). We regularly observe       how the PRC cajoles American businesses into advancing CCP       interests and values, from Hollywood studios and professional       sports leagues preserving their market access by self-      censoring, to major American companies promising to uphold       ``core socialist values.'' It is both unwise and       unconscionable to finance the capabilities of an adversary       hostile to American interests and values.        Recognition of the risks associated with U.S. investment       flowing to the PRC is growing. In his letter of August 3,       2023, Chairman Mike Gallagher of the Select Committee on the       Strategic Competition between the United States and the       Chinese Communist Party warned that much of the more than $1       trillion that the U.S. invests in the PRC through public       markets ``directly finances PRC technology companies with       documented connections to the Chinese military and the       Chinese Community Party's (CCP) abhorrent human rights       abuses.'' President Biden's recent Executive Order 14105 of       August 9, 2023 purports to speak to this concern, as do       numerous legislative proposals. On July 25, 2023,the Senate       voted 91-6 to include in the FY24 NDAA the Outbound       Investment Transparency Act, which would require notification       of U.S. investments in key industries in foreign countries of       concern.        Congress must establish sensible restrictions on U.S.       capital flowing to sensitive industries and technologies in       China. As a starting point, the FY24 NDAA must maintain the       Senate's approach of establishing a disclosure and       transparency regime for high-tech investments. Building on       that foundation with meaningful restrictions in further       critical technology sectors would be an even better outcome       for American national security.        Nor should Congress accept attempts to substitute sanctions       for outbound investment screening. Opponents of meaningful       restrictions on outbound investment into China have argued       that additional sanctions authorities are an acceptable       alternative, despite the continuing lax enforcement of even       mandatory sanctions towards China. While we strongly support       enhancing and more sensibly harmonizing the U.S. sanctions       regime, sanctions alone are piecemeal and backwards looking,       rather than comprehensive and preventative. Predictability,       efficiency, and efficacy all favor broad, robust prohibitions       as default. Specifically, the Committee passed Chinese       Military and Surveillance Company Sanctions Act should not       replace the Outbound Investment Transparency Act.        Congress cannot allow American investment--including the       investment of millions of average Americans' retirement       funds--to bankroll threats to America's national security,       the erosion of America's technological edge, and the       violation of our nation's essential commitments to freedom       and human dignity. Congress works for the American people,       not Wall Street. As the FY24 NDAA is finalized, it must       retain the Outbound Investment Transparency Act.            Sincerely,      Chris Griswold,        Policy Director, American Compass.      Victoria Coates,        Vice President, Davis Institute for National Security and       Foreign Policy, The Heritage Foundation.      Thomas J. Duesterberg,        Senior Fellow Hudson Institute.      Michael A. Needham,        Executive Director, America2100.      Hon. Steve Yates,        China Policy Initiative, America First Policy Institute.      Joseph Miller,        Executive Director, Citizens for Renewing America.      Jon Toomey,        Senior VP of Government Relations, Coalition for a       Prosperous America.     The letter says this is really important--this Outbound  Investment Transparency Act, 91 to 6. Let's get it in the final NDAA.   It is pretty simple, pretty noncontroversial.   But, Mr. President, as you know, nothing here is ever simple.  Evidently, the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee,  Patrick McHenry--I don't know him. He seems like a nice guy, from what  I hear. But, boy, is this guy misguided because it is all over the  press that he fought like crazy to strip this provision out of the  NDAA.   Why would he do that? By the way, he is retiring. So I am not sure  why we give him a lot of say anymore. But somehow, some way, one  Congressman--Republican, by the way--over in the House convinced the  House to strip this transparency provision that is meant to undermine  this bad guy. They stripped it out of the NDAA. So it is not in the  National Defense Authorization Act because one Congressman said: I  don't want it in. Ninety-one Senators said: We need it in. And, by the  way, the vast majority of the House wants it in.   You have a really strong House Member, Congressman Gallagher, who is  leading this bipartisan China commission. He says it is really  important.   The Biden administration wants it in. I have talked to Secretary of  Commerce Raimondo and the Secretary of Defense. They all want it in.  But one Congressman, who is not even going to be around anymore, gets  to strip it out so we don't know what American investments are going to  make this guy stronger? He gets the final say?   This is an outrage. And this is enough of an outrage that Senator  Cornyn and I, 2 weeks ago, in a lunch, when the Speaker of the House  came to visit us, we said: Hey, Mr. Speaker, we are hearing some things  about this really important, simple transparency investment provision,  that you guys might strip it out. Why?   Come on. Some of us have been focused on the China threat for years,  and now, we have one Congressman, who is leaving, and he says we strip  it out, when 91 Senators say we need it.   So the Speaker said to me and Senator Cornyn--we were pretty forceful  in the meeting. I am a big fan of the new Speaker, Speaker Johnson. But  he said: Well, it might not make it in the NDAA, but we will bring to  the floor of the House a vote on the McCaul bill.  [[Page S5879]]    This is the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Chairman  McCaul, who has an amendment that is very similar to the Cornyn  amendment. Actually, it is a little bit tougher. So he doesn't like it.  Xi Jinping doesn't like it. So we said: All right, Mr. Speaker. It  sounds like a good compromise. Let's do it. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.   Since that meeting, I think I have gotten a commitment, and I think  Senator Cornyn thinks he has gotten a commitment from the Speaker of  the House to a bunch of U.S. Senators, saying: Don't worry, we got  this.   Since that time, I have been reading press reports. Now, look, the  press can get a lot of things wrong. The press is saying: No, actually,  the Speaker is not going to bring up a vote on the McCaul bill--which,  by the way, in the House, will get 340 votes easy, and if that came  back here, it would get 91, maybe more. So it would be super  bipartisan, and this guy, this dictator, would hate it. Let's do it.  Let's do it.   But just lately, the press is reporting that the Speaker is now  saying: Maybe I won't do what I told the Senators. Maybe I am going to  put some kind of Commission together, and we will study it.   Well, as you know, when you start studying things here, that is a way  to kick the can down the road.   So my first priority here is to call out the Speaker of the House and  say: Mr. Speaker, I am pretty sure you said you were going to bring the  McCaul bill to the House floor soon--maybe before Christmas but  certainly January. Let's get it voted on. We will pass it here in the  Senate, I guarantee you. The majority leader will bring it up. Let's do  that.   So I hope you continue to make that commitment, Mr. Speaker. It would  be really disappointing if somehow a Congressman who is leaving-- leaving--teams up with the people who don't want us to know how  Americans are investing in this guy's military industrial complex. That  wouldn't be good.   So I call on the Speaker to keep that commitment that he made to a  bunch of U.S. Senators recently and not put forward some kind of  baloney Commission that is just kicking the can down the road. That  wouldn't be good.   But let me end with just a reason--like, why does transparency  matter? Why does it matter? Well, I am going to give one small example,  but it is a pretty good one.   This is a venture capital firm called Sequoia. Very successful.  Americans. They benefited from being an American company working in the  American economy. Really, really smart guys and women. Highly  successful. Their executives are very wealthy, and that is great. This  is a capitalist country; I love that.   But they were also known as one of these firms that were doing what I  said: making big investments over many, many years in very high-tech  components of the Chinese economy--advanced computer chip  manufacturing, quantum computing, things like that. I think that is  wrong, that Americans and American executives and American investment  dollars are going to China to help develop weapon systems that will be  used to kill U.S. marines and U.S. sailors if we ever get in a fight in  the Taiwan Strait.   So Sequoia Capital came to meet with me a couple years ago, and I  essentially told them that. Hey, look, you are very successful. That is  great. You live in the greatest country in the world. You have done a  lot to help our economy. But why are you helping the Chinese economy?  Why are you investing in things that are going to give them a military  advantage over our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines? Why are you  doing that?   They didn't have a good answer.   It wasn't a very cordial meeting, to be honest, because we didn't see  it the same way. But at the very end of the meeting, actually, one of  them got up and said: Well, you know, Senator, if we don't do these  kinds of investments in China, the Saudis and Emirates will.   I was like: Wait. What? That is your drop-the-mic argument at the  end? You requested the meeting with me. That is a pathetic argument.  What about patriotism? What about American interests?   So I started kind of blowing the whistle a little bit on this company  in hearings and stuff. We did a lot of research. They were doing a lot  of big-time investments in some of the highest tech elements of the  Chinese economy that will help their military kill American sailors and  soldiers if we ever get in a fight. That is wrong.   So we started--some of us--putting a little pressure on these guys.  Transparency. Calling them out--Americans doing this kind of thing.  Well, some of that worked. They announced a big separation agreement.  They are not going to do it anymore. They are getting pressure from the  Congress--by the way, legitimate pressure.   Here is a headline from the Wall Street Journal: ``Sequoia Made a  Fortune Investing in the U.S. and China''--China high technology that  will help their military--``Then It Had to Pick One.'' It had to pick  one because Members of Congress were saying: Enough. That is  transparency.   So we want to know how many more Sequoias are out there. It is a  pretty legitimate ask. It is actually a very legitimate ask. It is so  legitimate that 91 U.S. Senators voted for this. And we have one  Congressman over there who is leaving--not sure where he is going;  maybe he is going to Sequoia Capital--and he is blocking it.   So we need to fix this. We need to make sure the vast majority of  U.S. Senators and U.S. House Members who want transparency on this  really important national security issue--that this gets fixed.   So once again I am calling on the Speaker to keep his commitment,  bring the McCaul bill to the floor soon--next week, 2 weeks, January.  But don't let one Congressman who is walking out the door thwart the  vast, vast majority of the U.S. Senate and the U.S. House on a very  important national security issue.   You know, a lot of us talk a lot about China and the threats. I have  been coming out here since I got elected in 2015 to talk about the  challenges of this dictator. He is a menace, dangerous, and they are  growing their power. But do you know what? A lot of it is talk. A lot  of it is talk. This was something that was action. It wasn't a huge  deal--transparency, action.   Right now, we have Republican House Members--hopefully not the  Speaker, but certainly the chairman of the Financial Committee, the  Banking Committee--who are saying: No, I want to keep it in the dark,  what Americans are doing to invest in making this guy stronger.   That is wrong. Mr. President, 99.9 percent of Americans would think  that is wrong. So we need to fix it. The House needs to take leadership  on this issue. And my Republican colleagues keep talking tough on  China. It is time to act. It is time to act.   I yield the floor.
