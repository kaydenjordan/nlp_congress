 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the victims  of the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School on February 14,  2018.   It was just a year ago that we lost 17 lives at the hands of a gunman  as part of the terrible epidemic that is gun violence in America.  Fourteen of these were young students with a bright future ahead of  them.   Today, I am here to honor the memories of Alyssa, Martin, Nicholas,  Jaime, Luke, Cara, Gina, Joaquin, Alaina, Meadow, Helena, Alex, Carmen,  and Peter and the three courageous staff members: Scott, Aaron, and  Chris.   May their souls in Heaven be a guiding light to us here on Earth as  we continue to fight against gun violence, because no parent wants to  send their kids to school, to church, or to a movie theater worried  about whether they may ever come home.   It took less than 7 minutes for a gunman in Parkland, Florida, to try  to erase these 17 people, but he could not and will not be able to  erase them from the memories of their loved ones.   Today we remember their lives by saying their names, and we honor  them by taking action. We can and must act. I, for one, will never stop  fighting to honor their legacies and make our communities safer by  ending gun violence. We as a nation shall never forget.                            ____________________
