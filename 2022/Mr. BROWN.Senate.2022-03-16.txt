 Madam President, over the course of just 3 days, the world  lost three talented, tenacious journalists to Vladimir Putin's war  crimes and brutal invasion of Ukraine.   Brent Renaud was a Peabody Award-winning documentary filmmaker who  was working to tell the stories of Putin's war when he was fatally shot  in the Kyiv suburb of Irpin on Sunday.   Then, on Monday, two more journalists with FOX News lost their lives  when their vehicle came under fire just outside of Kyiv. A cameraman  and veteran war reporter, Pierre Zakrzewski, was killed. He had been  reporting in Ukraine since February.  [[Page S1211]]    We also lost Ukrainian journalist Oleksandra ``Sasha'' Kuvshynova,  who was serving as a consultant for FOX's team in Ukraine. She was just  24 years old.   Their colleague, correspondent Benjamin Hall, was also injured, and  he remains in the hospital.   Journalists know they face danger when they report from war zones.  They put themselves in harm's way to tell the world the true stories  that we need to hear.   Today, the Presiding Officer from Minnesota joined me and dozens and  dozens of others to see the video, the pictures, and the photos of the  war in Ukraine, which were shown to us by President Zelenskyy. Those  pictures--many of them--were taken by very courageous journalists who  risked their own lives. They bring us the unvarnished truth, unfiltered  by government propaganda, at the times when we need it most. They are  committed to basic ideals of truth, accuracy, and transparency--so  committed that they put their lives on the line to make sure the world  knows what is happening. Their commitment to these ideals only makes  their deaths that much more tragic.   Today, three families and so many colleagues are grieving for these  three journalists, grieving losses that cannot be replaced. They  shouldn't have to.   This war was started by a man with no regard for the freedom of the  press or basic human rights; a man who is a former KGB agent and has  open contempt and hostility toward real reporters, toward real  journalism, toward free speech; a man who presides over a regime  wherein journalists are killed with impunity.   According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, 28 journalists  have been killed in Russia since Putin came to power 20 years ago, and  10 are currently in prison simply for telling the truth, for doing  their jobs. According to Reporters Without Borders, Russia ranks 150  out of 199 countries for press freedom. They are actually behind  Afghanistan and South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.   Last October, the United States and 18 other countries issued a  statement, warning of ``the Russian government's intensifying  harassment of independent journalists and media outlets in Russia.''   In 2020, the Russian Government began labeling many outside  journalists as ``media foreign agents''--a term reminiscent of the  worst of the Cold War.   It is not just foreign journalists; Putin's government has applied  the ``media foreign agent'' label to independent Russian outlets in the  country or to those operating near the country's border--Russian  reporters themselves. It goes against all of our values. It is the kind  of authoritarianism that the Ukrainian people bravely fight every day  now. They don't want their country to turn into a place where reporters  fear for their lives, where journalists can't tell the public the  truth. Journalists' entire job is to ask questions, to challenge  powerful interests, to--shall we say--afflict the comfortable.    Reporters put their safety and--as we saw with these three brave  journalists in Ukraine--their lives on the line, whether it is covering  floods and hurricanes in the United States or traveling the globe to  bring us the stories of war zones.   We depend on reporters in my State and around the world to bring us  the stories that impact our day-to-day lives and tell the stories that  might not otherwise be told. They are too often under attack overseas  increasingly. We recently had a President of the United States who  attacked journalists in almost every stop.   As we all stand with the people of Ukraine, let's recommit ourselves  to fighting just as hard as they are for our values, for freedom of the  press, for free speech. These three journalists made the ultimate  sacrifice to show the world the heroism of the Ukrainian people. We  pray that they are the last who have to do that.   We recognize that President Putin has been shocked by two things:  shocked by the heroism of the Ukrainian people--those fighting back,  those brave journalists, those freedom fighters, those mothers and  fathers and children who have so courageously stood up against Russia;  he is also shocked by the way President Biden so effectively has put  together an international coalition, not just for the countries you  would expect, but Germany, and Finland, and Sweden, and Switzerland-- countries that have rarely chosen sides and stepped up the way that all  of our countries have.   And while doing this, we send our sympathy and our gratitude to the  families of Brent Renaud, to Pierre Zakrzewski, to Oleksandra  Kuvshynova. They died doing the vital heroic work they love. We have a  better understanding of this invasion, of the war crimes being  committed, of how it is affecting people's lives. We have a better  understanding because of journalists like them, and we thank them from  the bottom of our hearts.
