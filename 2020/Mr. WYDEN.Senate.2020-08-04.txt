 Reserving the right to object.    Mr. President and colleagues, the only thing worse than  what the Republicans have done here--cutting off desperately needed  unemployment insurance to millions of American families and  communities--would be to allow a bill to pass that promises money  without actually delivering it. Even if this short-term extension were  to pass, State agencies--the experts in this field--have told us and  the ranking Democrat on the Finance Committee in very clear terms that  States don't have enough time to reprogram their systems and avoid a  lapse in benefits.   The State unemployment systems are not equipped to flip these  unemployment benefits on and off. Short-term extensions don't work and  will not work from an administrative standpoint.   No Senator has to take my word for it. The National Association of  State Workforce Agencies has said what I have just said: A short-term  extension isn't enough for the hard-working Americans relying on this  lifeline who don't have jobs to go back to. What about next week and  the week after that?   The only responsible route is to agree to the extension with triggers  that will lower the payments only when it is appropriate to do so, and  that means when the economy is in recovery, not when the economy is in  freefall like it still is now.   Republicans wish to cover for the fact that they refused to come to  the negotiating table for months. I looked at the record. Literally,  for months--as the author of the $600 more each month and the expansion  to cover gig workers and others--we asked Senate Republicans to join us  in negotiations. The Democratic leader, Senator Schumer, and the  Speaker, Nancy Pelosi, all made that request again and again, and  Republicans were unwilling to do that. So Republicans are trying to  cover for the fact that they refused to come to the negotiating table  for months.   Our country needs a long-term solution that ensures the extra $600  remains available for as long as this four-alarm economic crisis  continues.   I object.    Mr. President, I would like to offer a proposal that  really is going to help working families and those who are trying to  make rent, trying to pay for groceries, who every single day walk an  economic tightrope balancing their food bill against their fuel bill.   We just heard a little bit about how we really need to solve the  problem. This does that because, under our bill, S. 4143, the American  Workforce Rescue Act of 2020, what we wish to do on our side is tie  these unemployment benefits to the actual conditions of the American  economy on the ground.   We have had this proposal for months now because, to some extent--and  I see my good friend from South Dakota. He made an important point in  this discussion. He is a member of the Finance Committee, and I saw an  article in which he stated, you know, it is important for people who  are really hurting in a tough economy--it is important for them to get  benefits that let them pay the rent and buy groceries. Then my good  friend from South Dakota made a point I agree with. He said: You know,  when the economy gets better and unemployment goes down, then--in the  words of the Senator from South Dakota--the benefits can taper off to  reflect that.   That is essentially what S. 4143, the American Workforce Rescue Act  that I have authored with the Democratic leader, Senator Schumer, does  is it ensures that we are not going to have millions of workers every  month or every few months live in fear that Donald Trump and Mitch  McConnell are going to pull the rug out from under them.   We would have a benefit that would reflect economic conditions on the  ground, and it would deal with this economic challenge for all the  months until the economy recovers. That is what Senator Schumer and I  put forward some time ago. The $600 would gradually phase down based on  the State's average unemployment rate over 3 months. This would provide  certainty for families and ensure the broader economy continues to  receive the support it needs.   And, especially, it doesn't set up artificial timelines. That is what  the Senate ought to be avoiding, to just set arbitrary dates. What we  need to do is make sure that politicians--and, certainly, Donald Trump  and Mitch McConnell have been willing to pull the rug out from under  the unemployed. We need to make sure that there is a plan going  forward.   That is what S. 4143 does, the American Workforce Rescue Act. It will  provide certainty for families and ensure the broader economic recovery  will be our focus, and there will be support until we see that kind of  recovery.   So I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on Finance be  discharged from further consideration of S. 4143, the American  Workforce Rescue Act; that the bill be considered read a third time and  passed; and the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon  the table with no intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, while my colleague is here, just a brief  reaction--and I think my colleague knows that you don't go out and  negotiate from the seat of your pants on the floor.   First, I want to be clear on this proposal. This is a proposal the  Democratic leader and I, as the ranking Democrat on the Finance  Committee, worked very closely together on. It is a proposal that many  Senate Democrats think could be the basis of reform, and lots of people  who look at the future of these kinds of economic challenges find this  idea attractive. That is No. 1.   No. 2, my friend from South Dakota thinks that somehow the benefits  can just be turned on with a snap of the finger. The National  Association of State Workforce Agencies have said that the proposal  offered by the Senator from Arizona would not get benefits that make  rent and pay groceries to people anytime soon.   The question is, Are you going to solve a real economic challenge  here? The economy has faced, last week, a staggering economic  contraction. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the last  numbers, there are four unemployed workers for every job. This idea  that unemployed folks don't want to work is just insulting.   What unemployed people tell me at home is that if somebody offers  them a job on Monday night, they will be there first thing Tuesday  morning.   What is really needed are solutions to this question of unemployment  insurance that ties the benefits to the real world conditions on the  ground. In fact, when you have unemployment like this--well over 10  percent--the $600 extra per week coverage is clearly what is necessary  to make rent and pay groceries. But make no mistake about it--I see my  colleague from South Dakota leaving the floor--I listened when he said  that there ought to be a benefit for folks when unemployment is high  and that when unemployment goes down, the benefits would reflect that.  That is the American Workforce Rescue Act.   If my colleagues are saying they want to back S. 4143, I would like  to get that message in a direct kind of way.   With that, I yield the floor.                            ____________________
