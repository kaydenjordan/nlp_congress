 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding, and I thank my colleague from Texas, the ranking member of  the Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies  Subcommittee, for being such an incredible partner in our work  together, and I look forward to bringing our one-twelfth of this bill  in for a landing when we complete the appropriations process for this  fiscal year.   But, for now, Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this continuing  resolution which, yet again, puts us in a position of having to avoid  another shutdown. The House has done its part, passing ten  appropriations bills, but the Republican Senate has been delinquent in  their responsibilities.    This resolution, thankfully, buys us time, time that avoids any  budgetary anxiety that our families, businesses, and communities simply  don't need right now.   If Wall Street and Main Street agree on one thing, it is that  government shutdowns help no one. What we all want is what this  continuing resolution provides: a measure of stability. And, Lord  knows, we need that right now, given current events.   It avoids divisive policy fights and embraces shared priorities, such  as bolstering the 2020 Census Bureau preparations, which is a vital  constitutional responsibility, and ensuring our critical health  programs don't expire. And namely, it does not fund the President's  border wall, yet does provide much-needed Medicaid funding to Americans  still recovering in Puerto Rico.   I am extremely proud of our leadership, particularly our chairwoman,  for providing this budgetary certainty that our economy needs right  now, and for ensuring that the priorities of working families are  protected.   Again, I urge my colleagues to support this resolution, and I look  forward to working with my fellow appropriators to bring the FY20 final  bill in for a landing.
