 Mr. President, first of all, let me thank my colleague and  friend, Senator Klobuchar, for those sober words. As former  prosecutors, we share a lot of the same bonds and knowledge, and we  come to this in different ways sometimes than our colleagues. She  expressed so many sentiments that I am going to try--and not as  eloquently as she--to express today. So I say thank you for those  comments.   I come to the floor today both as a new Member of this body and as a  longtime admirer and student of the Senate to offer my perspective on  the situation in which this distinguished body finds itself today.   I am deeply disappointed and concerned by the process, the posturing,  and the partisanship that have degraded what should be one of the most  serious, deliberate, and thoughtful decisions we in the Senate are  entrusted to make.   Over the course of my almost 40-year career as a trial lawyer, I have  represented just about every kind of client you can imagine, from the  indigent to the CEO, major corporations and small business owners,  individuals charged with serious crimes and those charged with petty  offenses. I have also had the incredible honor of serving in the  Department of Justice and representing the United States of America.  Every one of my clients and every one of those who were on the other  side of the litigation in which I was engaged expected and deserved  fair, impartial treatment in our courts, and rightly so. But from the  moment Justice Kennedy  [[Page S6602]]  announced his retirement, the conversation about his replacement seems  to have rarely been about fairness and impartiality; instead, it has  been about power and politics.   This Supreme Court nomination almost immediately turned into a  divisive political campaign, with millions of dollars being spent to  sway Senators on both sides of the aisle, including me. In his  partisan-fueled tirade last week, Judge Kavanaugh lashed out at the so- called liberal groups who spent so much money attacking his nomination,  but he never acknowledged and others in this body have never  acknowledged that conservative groups have spent a like amount of  money, if not more, promoting Judge Kavanaugh.   I want to make my position clear today. I think that this kind of  political campaign for a seat on the Supreme Court of the United  States--a political campaign run by either political party--should be  condemned as completely contrary to the independence of the judicial  branch of our government.   Throughout this nomination process, I have repeatedly expressed my  concerns about the way it has been conducted. It was flawed from the  beginning, and it will be incomplete at the end because of a needless  rush to a confirmation. From the beginning, I have done my best, the  best that I know how, in my experience, to exercise my constitutional  duty--my duty of advice and consent--in a fair and impartial manner,  putting aside the political considerations that were being thrown at me  from every angle.   You know, I have often said in the last few months that it seems that  for those who supported Judge Kavanaugh's nomination, if I voted to  oppose, I would be seen as nothing but a puppet for my party. On the  other hand, for those people who opposed Judge Kavanaugh, if I were to  vote for Judge Kavanaugh, I would be seen as bending to a political way  to try to get reelected in a conservative State. Neither of those is  true.   My staff and I have dedicated an incredible amount of time almost  every single day since July 10 to reading Judge Kavanaugh's opinions,  his speeches, and his articles; reviewing documents at the time he  worked at the White House--at least those documents we were able to get  ahold of; watching his Senate hearing testimony and his television  appearances; meeting with my constituents and advocates; and reading  statements and emails both in support of and in opposition to Judge  Kavanaugh. This was all done in a very serious effort to give  thoughtful and fair consideration to Judge Kavanaugh's nomination  without regard to party or politics.   The one thing I did not get a chance to do was to meet with Judge  Kavanaugh. Judge Kavanaugh and the White House called my office a  couple of times early on in the process to try to get a meeting with  me, and I told them at that time or my staff told them that my process  was to listen and to read, to understand and do my deep dive into his  record and to know all that I can know about him. As a lawyer, I wanted  to watch that hearing. I wanted to see what would occur at the hearing  and how he would present himself, the questions that he answered and  the questions he avoided, so that when I did meet with him following  that hearing, it would be meaningful. It would not be a meet-and-greet,  like so many of us have in this body, but a meaningful meeting.   As soon as Chairman Grassley called for the hearing shortly after  Labor Day, as soon as that was called in August, my staff started  calling the White House to get a meeting. We were told that they would  still want a meeting, but we continued to get rebuffed. We never got  that meeting. We continued to call after the hearing, and we continued  to call at least until the time that Dr. Ford's allegations were made  public, and at that point, we knew a meeting was probably not likely to  happen.    So for all of those detractors who say that I didn't try to get a  meeting and that I didn't have the time, I did my best to follow the  process of deliberation that I felt appropriate in my due process to  make that meeting meaningful, and it never happened, through no fault  of mine or my staff.   After all that, we find ourselves in this moment of historical  significance, where we as a body have an opportunity to send a loud and  clear message to women and men throughout this country.   As I previously have said, I believe Dr. Ford made an incredibly  brave decision to come forward publicly and to testify to the full  Senate Judiciary Committee. It was hard to do, knowing how she would be  vilified. As a former prosecutor, I know how hard it is for victims to  talk about these experiences, particularly in cases of sexual assault.   I have been moved by the many reports of thousands of women who have  felt compelled by recent events to reveal similar stories that they  have buried for many years, some for decades. In the last few weeks,  women have shared with me intensely painful and personal descriptions  of assaults, some of whom I have known for a period of time but never  knew what they were carrying within them.   Many of these happened so many years ago--high school, college, as  young professionals. Often, they hadn't told anyone, not even their  closest friends and loved ones. Their experiences, while different in  detail, have so many similarities. Their feelings of fear and shame and  guilt were overwhelming at the time of their encounters. Those emotions  exert a powerful hold on these women's lives. Even if they go on to  find professional success and fulfilling relationships, it is still  buried within them, and they don't speak up because they do not want to  be known as victims or they don't want others to have to bear their  pain, knowing that nothing can undo what happened to them.   In last week's public hearing, I found Dr. Ford to be a compelling  and credible witness. Yes, there were gaps in her testimony. There  always are. There are always gaps and lapses of certain memories in  situations like these. Those who have worked with victims of assault  know that the most traumatic details are seared into their memories,  while extraneous facts may fade over time. Reactions of the women, when  they see their perpetrators, are different, depending on the  circumstances, but they never forget the pain. They never forget the  pain of what happened to them, but rather than relive it or face  condemnation or retribution, they simply keep it to themselves and go  on day after day after day.   If you watched our President this past week at his political rallies,  you can understand exactly why these women are afraid to speak out. I  am actually appalled at the President's attacks on Dr. Blasey Ford just  days after he called her a credible witness--just days after so many in  this body called her a credible and compelling witness. His message was  simply this: Keep quiet. Nothing happened here. Don't ruin this man's  life. Let's continue to stoke the political fires surrounding his  nomination.   We have heard time and again that victims must be heard--time and  again. So often have we heard that in the last 2 weeks, that victims  must be heard, but the message from the President of the United States  and those who have surrounded him is, yes, let them be heard. Just  don't listen. Just don't listen to them.   Unfortunately, that message isn't new. The President used his  platform to try to intimidate survivors into staying quiet and hiding  their pain from the world, but I think he is going to find that while  he is focused on stirring up his political base with misogynistic  comments, women around this country are rising up, and they are gaining  their strength. They are finding their foothold. They are finding their  voices in an effort to expose what for far too long has been swept  under the carpet.   Regardless of the vote tomorrow, we cannot and will not ignore where  we are in this moment of history. This is a movement that will not be  quieted, nor should it be quieted.   For Judge Kavanaugh's part, I was very disappointed in his testimony  last week. If the incident did not happen, then I understand full well  his frustration and his anger. I get it. Any man would be. It is  understandable. Both he and Dr. Ford have endured the ugliness of our  society. But, in my view, he simply went too far by leveling  unnecessary and inappropriate partisan attacks and accusations,  demonstrating a temperament that is unbecoming a sitting judge, much  less a Supreme  [[Page S6603]]  Court nominee. His testimony ran completely counter to the image he  attempted to portray in his earlier hearing, in all of his interviews  on television, and in the photo opportunities with the various  Senators.   In addition--and this was incredibly important to me because I had  watched it for some time--in simply refusing to acknowledge the need  for further investigation, for a further review of his record, as  Senator Klobuchar discussed a few moments ago, by failing to  acknowledge the need for further review and investigation into these  allegations, he demonstrated anything but the independence necessary  for our judiciary. Instead, he has bowed to the White House and to the  majority of the Judiciary Committee to plow through this nomination  process without a full review of his record and without a full, fair,  and complete investigation into the very serious and credible  allegations made by Dr. Blasey Ford.    I am certainly not alone in my views. It is not just people in the  Democratic Party or Senators on my side of the aisle. At last count, I  saw that there are some 3,000 law professors, about 40 of which are at  Yale Law School, from which Judge Kavanaugh graduated. Those law  professors have called for his nomination to be either withdrawn or  rejected. Religious organizations, including the editors of the Jesuit  Review, have done the same. I am told that just this morning, the  American Bar Association--the gold standard of review for judicial  nominations--has notified the Judiciary Committee that they are  reopening their evaluation of Judge Kavanaugh's character and fitness  based on what they witnessed in the testimony last week. That is a  significant development that just occurred this morning shortly before  our vote to proceed.   Even before the recent serious allegations of sexual assault, I  called for a pause so that we could get the documents that are needed,  including those that Chairman Grassley himself had requested. The  National Archives reported that due to the volume, even producing those  documents on a rolling basis would not take place until sometime this  month, in October. Well, it is October now, and although we don't have  those documents, we have had two hearings and now are scheduled to vote  on confirmation tomorrow. Many of those documents that could have been  produced for review were withheld after being screened by a lawyer  representing a number of people under investigation or at least  witnesses in the investigation by Special Counsel Mueller, which raises  serious questions as to what documents we got, which ones were being  held, and why they were being held.   Despite the lack of documents, the Judiciary Committee forged ahead  and conducted its hearings. Before a vote was taken, Dr. Blasey Ford  courageously came forward with her very serious allegations regarding a  sexual assault that occurred when she and Judge Kavanaugh were in high  school. Again, not for the first time, I and others called for a pause  to allow for further investigation, to update the background check that  every nominee goes through. That call was rebuffed for some period of  time.   Finally, faced with mounting public pressure, the Judiciary Committee  agreed to a second hearing. Both the committee and the White House  subsequently rejected any additional background investigation to be  conducted by the FBI. As it turned out, my colleague Senator Flake felt  compelled to call for such an investigation on the morning of the vote,  which delayed the confirmation process for another week.   While I am certainly grateful and glad that the chairman and the  majority leader and the President agreed to delay the vote in order to  allow for an FBI investigation, I believe the investigation was far too  limited to have any real use, especially since no further hearings  would ever be held.   In my career of almost 40 years as a lawyer, I have examined many FBI  reports, and I have examined many background checks. In my review of  what was submitted as a result of Senator Flake's request, the FBI was  simply not allowed to do what it does best, which is to follow the  evidence and the leads. In this case, we put the proverbial cart before  the horse. The investigation should have taken place before the hearing  so that the Senators on the Judiciary Committee could have had the  benefit of all the information they needed when questioning witnesses  and evaluating credibility, which is where this is coming down.   I believe that in cases like this, the witnesses should be compelled  by subpoena--not just Dr. Ford, not just Judge Kavanaugh, but other  witnesses who are named should have been compelled by subpoena, if  necessary, to give testimony, whether in the public hearing or by  deposition--procedures that have been invoked by this body on many  occasions.   This leads me to another more procedural point. Many of those who  want to press forward with this nomination have been invoking the  presumption of innocence, and I understand that. The presumption of  innocence, however, is afforded to those in this country in our  criminal justice system. It is afforded to those who are accused of  criminal activity, and it requires the government to prove, to rebut  that presumption. In other words, that presumption stands between  someone accused of a crime and their going to prison and having their  liberty taken away from them.   They have now said that the presumption of innocence should be  applied to judicial nominations. But the presumption applies in a court  before we can deprive someone of their liberty, incarcerate them. It is  not necessarily applicable when we are simply looking to provide  someone with a lifetime appointment to the judiciary. The presumption  of innocence for a nominee would, in effect, turn into a presumption of  confirmability that I do not believe is called for in the Constitution.    I certainly would agree, however, that given the most recent  circumstances, we, as a body, need to establish some type of standard,  some guidelines for our nominees so that this doesn't happen again.   I would say that if we were to have anything close to the high  standard of a presumption of innocence, there has to be a full and  complete investigation before any hearing in order to determine whether  the presumption can be overcome. It is the only way to do it.   Remember, in this instance, there are no appeals; there is no review.  We get no do-overs once we make this vote. We have to take the time and  put forth the necessary effort to get it right--putting forth the time,  even if it means the Supreme Court operates with eight members for a  period of time. That is OK. I went to the arguments just the other day,  and they got along just fine, listening to the arguments that were  heard that day.   The American people are understandably disgusted by the way this has  been handled. They are disgusted with people on both sides of the  aisle, and they were disgusted even before these allegations came to  light. They have reason to doubt the integrity of our independent  judiciary now more than ever, with a Supreme Court that will be so  divided and appears to be so partisan. There will forever be a cloud  over this nomination and this nomination process, regardless of the  outcome of tomorrow's vote.   Many also have reason to doubt the integrity of this body for the way  this has been handled. When facing difficult decisions, I often reflect  on what I learned from one of my most influential mentors, the late  Senator Howell Heflin, a former chief justice of the Alabama Supreme  Court. Judge Heflin often talked about the Supreme Court as the  ``People's Court.'' Every day, he said, the Supreme Court of the United  States deals with real people, their basic human rights and liberties.  It has a direct impact on the daily lives of every American, and the  people who serve on the Court should be held to the highest of  standards before being allowed the privilege of making those weighty  decisions.   I don't believe this process has led us to the person best suited to  hold this position. This isn't about politics; no, it far transcends  that. I have always said that I am inclined to vote for Presidential  nominees, but they do not have to have that ``presumption of  confirmability.'' We have serious doubts about this nominee that may  never be resolved. It certainly was not resolved by the limited  investigation that the Senators had to go view in bulk--one copy with  10 Senators sitting, passing it around. We have serious doubts  [[Page S6604]]  about this nominee. People across this country have serious doubts  about this nominee. To quote the late Senator Robert Byrd:         No individual has a particular right to a Supreme Court       seat. If we are going to give the benefit of the doubt, let       us give it to the Court. Let us give it to the country.    It was my hope that this body would wind up being on the right side  of history with this vote and not a political side chosen in the  moment. My preference would have been for the President to send us a  new, consensus nominee, much as President Reagan did many years ago  when he nominated Justice Kennedy. Send us another nominee and give the  Senate a second chance to act as a uniter, not a divider. It now  appears, however, that we will need to find another way that we, as a  body--which has been described in the past as the most deliberative  body in the world; many would question that description today--must  find another way to show the American people that we can uphold the  lofty ideals we have ascribed to.   Tomorrow, this nomination process will have run its course, but our  work for our constituents and all of those sitting in the Galleries  tonight and all of those watching across this country who will see and  follow this vote tomorrow--our work for our constituents will go on.  Our work for this country will go on. Regardless of this vote tomorrow,  it will go on, and we, as a body, have to get to a place where we look  forward, not backward.   I am confident; I know in my heart that we can restore the Senate to  the place it was when I worked here as a young lawyer, a place where  compromise meant progress, not a lost battle. Think about that-- compromise meaning progress and not a lost battle or war. We must set  aside the divisiveness, shoulder our responsibilities, and work  together. We must do so for the good of this body, for the sake of the  country that we all love.   I yield the floor.
