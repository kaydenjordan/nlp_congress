 Madam Speaker, I just spent time with my  constituents over the weekend, and everywhere I went and announced that  the government was going to remain open because of the advocacy of  Democrats, there was applause. No matter what party, what affiliation  they had, there was applause to recognize that law enforcement would be  paid, those at the border would be paid, the supplemental nutrition  program that families so desperately need would be provided for, and  the women and children program would be provided for.   However, at the same time, it is important to take note that we have  passed draconian appropriation bills that sizably cut what working  families need--the supplemental nutrition program, the WIC program,  housing.   We cannot continue on this route. We must find a bipartisan pathway  to fund this government, recognizing that we do have a deficit created  by the past administration and that we have been dug out of poverty  because of Biden's American Rescue Plan Act that cities have depended  on. These cities relied on large Federal dollars that helped them  bridge the gap during the pandemic for rural communities, as well.   Madam Speaker, we are getting ready to take a monumental step today.  Let's focus on the priorities for the American people.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from  Pennsylvania for her leadership and for managing this rule that we now  have on the floor of the House.   I stand here in the name of so many Americans who live in cities and  rural communities that are so dependent on the Federal funding that  helps to bridge local government funding, and also those who are most  vulnerable in our Nation.   As I rise today, we Democrats did come together to stop the shutdown.  As I said earlier, there was applause across my district. At the same  time, bills are passed that really shock me. Again, bills were passed  that cut $800 million from the women, infants, and children program  dealing with feeding babies. Then, one of the most talked about issues  across America--we just saw something where Habitat for Humanity is  building 39 homes under the name of the great President Jimmy Carter  and his wife. Here we are cutting $1 billion to $500 million from the  HOME Investment Partnerships Program that directly deals with the  funding that is necessary.   Can you believe the cuts in Medicare? Can you absolutely believe that  that is what is happening? The bills are being passed by the Republican  majority.   Now, I thought they were concerned about Homeland Security--I served  on this committee since 9/11--but border management funding has been  severely cut for shelter and services programs, the very programs that  are needed by those who come seeking asylum or even those who come  whose asylum will be rejected, but the burden is on those local cities.  The USCIS and the Transportation Security Administration are both  receiving cuts.   Then, of course, we are dealing with this particular legislation,  legislative branch and energy and commerce.                                time  1245    It is important to note that funding dealing with water, dealing with  climate, and dealing with renewables are all being cut.   I offered amendments in particular to deal with water that were not  accepted. I offered amendments to ensure that DACA residents could be  hired, which we have done before. Those are individuals that did not  spend any time in their foreign land, were brought here as children,  and are now doctors, paramedics, lawyers, and teachers, and because of  the DACA program we cannot hire them. How insensitive is that?   Then the attacks against the LGBTQ+ community, all of the amendments  throughout the entire time that attack them. Then to get rid of the  diversity office that we worked so hard for, to ensure that this  Congress, the people's House, the United States Senate, reflects the  wonderment of America, this wonderful experiment that the world looks  to and says: How great this land is. ``My country, 'tis of thee, sweet  land of liberty.'' That is what America is to people. How can we in  appropriations after appropriations put in these poison pills?   We stopped the shutdown, but what I can say to you is there is more  work to be done. We don't know what the vote will be on the floor  today, but I want whatever happens, as I said before, to be for the  best for the American people. That is Democrats leading.
