 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Women's History  Month to recognize a dedicated public servant from Nebraska's Seventh  District. Catherine Lang's record of leadership and advocacy for the  State's small business community has improved the lives of many  Nebraskans.   Catherine earned both her bachelor of fine arts and juris doctor  degrees  [[Page H1593]]  from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. As a leader with a passion for  fostering educational and economic opportunities for Nebraskans, she  has worked hard to build a more robust environment for businesses and  universities. She also plays an active role in several philanthropic  and public organizations.                                time  1015    Not only has she grown as a leader, the responsibilities entrusted to  her have grown as well. Catherine has been crucial in guiding State  agencies through periods of transition and expansion. Throughout her  career, she has served Nebraska as the Department of Revenue's deputy  tax administrator, the Nebraska property tax administrator, the  commissioner of labor, and as the director of the Department of  Economic Development.   Catherine inherited a legacy of service from her parents, Hugh and  Lillian Lang. Her father, Commander ``Chic'' Lang, served as a  distinguished Navy pilot during World War II and later as an instructor  at the U.S. Navy War College, and her mother enlisted in the U.S. Air  Force.   Catherine's parents instilled in her a value she has instilled in her  three sons: the importance of a college education as a door to  opportunity. Because of this, the Lang family established a scholarship  for students at the UNO College of Business for the purpose of  cultivating opportunity and character.   Currently, Catherine holds the position of State director of the  Nebraska Business Development Center and assistant dean at the UNO  College of Business. She leads statewide outreach for NBDC and builds  collaborative efforts in the Nebraska University system to support the  institution's mission of economic development.   Thank you, Catherine, for dedicating your life to serving and  inspiring others, and we thank you for strengthening relationships  within our community.                   Honoring Timothy Kenny on his Retirement     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Timothy Kenny and his  exceptional service as the executive director of the Nebraska  Investment Finance Authority, or NIFA. Timothy has been serving  Nebraskans in this role since 1994. Before he joined NIFA, he served as  director of programs for the Utah Housing Finance Agency and as  executive director of the Texas Housing Finance Agency.   NIFA administers programs to help Nebraskans finance affordable  housing, medical facilities, community infrastructure, and industrial  development projects. They also serve first-time farmers and ranchers  by providing affordable financing strategies across the Great Plains.   In the 36 years of its existence, NIFA has worked diligently to  finance over 91,000 mortgages for affordable single-family homes.  Additionally, over 23,600 affordable rental housing units for  Nebraskans living on a budget have been created. Under Tim's  leadership, NIFA has taken care of our Armed Forces by providing over  $96.1 million in home buyer's assistance.   Previously, Timothy served as a certified public accountant for a  private tax and audit practice in Dallas, Texas, and then worked his  way up to chief financial officer for homebuilding and real estate  firms in Texas and Colorado.   He now resides in Cass County, Nebraska, with his wife, Sara, three  children, and numerous grandchildren. On top of his commendable public  service, Timothy has supported his children and country through more  than 20 deployments in the United States Armed Forces.   Timothy continues to be active in Nebraska by serving on the National  Council of State Housing Agencies, the National Association of Home  Builders, the Nebraska Subprime Advisory Task Force, and the Governor's  Disaster Recovery Task Force. He exemplifies what it means to be a  Nebraskan through his hard work, service to others, and compassion for  those in need.   I congratulate Timothy on a notable career of public service and a  retirement that is well deserved.                            ____________________
