 Mr. President, while the Senate conducts an important  debate today on Yemen, we continue to negotiate an omnibus spending  bill. It will follow through on the bipartisan budget deal we struck in  February that, for the first time in a long time, will robustly fund  our military and provide substantial investment in our middle class.   For too long, the arbitrary and pointless sequester caps held back  Federal investment in jobs, scientific research, healthcare, and  education. They also handicapped our military and prevented long-term  planning at the Pentagon. The budget deal paved the way to do away with  the harmful sequester caps, and now the omnibus will put the nail in  the coffin.   Negotiations continue between the four leaders. A few sticking points  remain but we are very close to signing off on legislation that both  Houses will be able to take up and pass by the end of the week.   Mr. President, on the omni, I agree with the leader. Hopefully, we  can come to an agreement and pass it this week. It has some things no  one likes, and it has a lot of things not everybody likes but most  people like. The basic structure of it was a fair compromise, and,  hopefully, we can come to an agreement. Our staffs are working really  hard.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I would like to say a word about Puerto  Rico. Today marks the sixth anniversary of Hurricane Maria's landfall  on the island--the 6-month anniversary. We all know that the storm in  Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands was one of the most powerful  and devastating ever to have struck those islands. There was terrible  damage to schools, hospitals, water systems, roads, homes, and  businesses.  [[Page S1801]]    For months and months, people didn't have electricity or clean water  or cell service. Far too many people are still waiting for relief.  There are 120,000 people without electricity. Hundreds of thousands  continue to lose power on a temporary basis. Calculating the hours of  lost electricity service, Puerto Rico has experienced the longest  blackout in the history of the United States.   Tens of thousands are still awaiting permanent shelter, and 10,000  small businesses are closed.   Puerto Rico struggled with a severe debt and healthcare crisis before  Hurricane Maria came to its shores. The damage wrought by the hurricane  has set the island even further back, despite the valiant efforts of  its people.   Congress has passed significant relief as part of the bipartisan  budget agreement earlier this year. We have to make sure that the aid  goes to where it needs to go and that we provide additional aid if it  is required.   To the long-suffering citizens of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands,  and the thousands who have relocated to the mainland, we haven't  forgotten you. We are here to help you. You are on our minds, and we  are going to keep fighting to help you rebuild your homes, your  communities, and your beloved islands.                            ____________________     Mr. President, finally, on the tax bill, I just note  that, once again, every day the more people learn about this tax bill,  the more they don't like it. Stock buybacks continue at a hugely rapid  rate. Aid to workers is much, much smaller, and the American people are  learning this bill was of, by, and for the wealthiest Americans and the  most powerful corporations. That is wrong. We welcome the debate on the  tax bill because the more people learn about it, the more they don't  like it.   Since the beginning of the tax debate, Republicans have insisted  their bill is about cutting taxes for working Americans. Even though  the bill would direct 83 percent of the benefits to the top 1 percent,  Republicans said workers were the focus. Even though they made  corporate tax cuts permanent but let the individual tax cuts expire,  they said the middle class would be the real winners.   Democrats warned that if you gave big corporations and the wealthiest  Americans the lion's share of the tax cuts, those benefits wouldn't  trickle down to employees and the middle class. We warned that  corporations would do what they always do when they have profits-- distribute them amongst themselves. Even though big companies like AT&T  were already paying low effective corporate rates, they had been  shedding jobs and investment for years even before the tax bill.   Unfortunately, our warnings proved prescient. Almost every day, we  hear a new story about a corporation using the savings from the  Republican tax bill to purchase its own stock, called a stock buyback,  which boosts the corporation's stock price to provide a reward for  wealthy executives and shareholders.   Just this morning, the Kentucky-based chemical company Ashland  announced a brand-new $500 million share repurchasing program. And last  night, the total amount of corporate share buybacks surpassed $225  billion since the Republican tax bill became law.   Stock buybacks are a big reason why workers no longer see the  benefits of record corporate profits. Why? Because instead of investing  corporate profits in things that benefit the long-term health of the  company and its workers--like higher wages, new equipment, research and  development, or new hires--corporations spend the money on share  buybacks.   In fact, stock buybacks were illegal until 1982, which is about the  same time that wages stopped increasing with corporate profits.   Republicans dutifully remind us that companies are also handing out  bonuses. Yes, a few. But let me highlight the disparity between  buybacks and investment in workers: According to a recent analysis by  Just Capital, only 6 percent of the capital allocated by companies from  the tax bill's savings has gone to employees, while nearly 60 percent  has gone to shareholders.   The theory behind the Republican tax bill was to allow corporations  and the richest Americans to keep more of their already outrageous  wealth, and maybe the benefits will trickle down to everyone else. As  we are already seeing, that idea was a folly, and the American middle  class will eventually pay the price.   Because of the enormous cost of the Republican tax bill, $1.5  trillion, the deficit and debt will grow over the next several years  and Republicans are already targeting Social Security, Medicaid, and  Medicare for cuts to make up the difference. So on top of a tax cut  that mostly goes to the folks who need it the least, the Republican tax  bill is an excuse for Republicans to come after Social Security,  Medicare, and Medicaid.   That is why the bill is so unpopular that Republicans have abandoned  it in last two special elections in Virginia and Pennsylvania.   The American people are already waking up to the reality that the  Republican tax bill was not the middle-class miracle the Republicans  promised, and in November, they will have the chance to move America in  a dramatically different direction by voting for a party that actually  wants to focus tax relief on working America, not corporate America.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
