 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  Valdosta State University football team for winning their fourth  Division II National Championship on December 15. The Blazers prevented  a 2-point conversion with 40 seconds left in the game to defeat Ferris  State University 49-47.   With a record of 14-0 this year, Valdosta State had the Nation's top  scoring offense. The offense was led by their quarterback, Rogan Wells,  who was a finalist for best player in the country. He passed for 349  yards, ran for 39, and caught a touchdown pass in the national  championship victory.   Valdosta, though, is no stranger to victories. Located in south  Georgia, it has been recognized by ESPN as Title Town, USA. Over the  years, Valdosta teams have won a combined 452 titles across different  levels of competition and sports.   Congratulations, Valdosta State. Go Blazers.                     Recognizing Dr. George E. Francisco     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Dr.  George E. Francisco on four decades of teaching pharmacists at the  college level, nearly all of which have been spent with the University  of Georgia.   Known across campus as an outstanding teacher for his personable  approach with his students, Dr. Francisco has won numerous awards using  his own, unique teaching skills. He was awarded Outstanding Teacher at  the University of Georgia, named to Outstanding Young Men of America,  and was featured in the Georgia Pharmacist Magazine, among many other  accolades.   His students say that Dr. Francisco ``exemplifies what it means to be  a teacher in the truest sense'' and that ``he represents the kind of  professional that someday they hope to become.''   I am so proud that the State of Georgia has Dr. Francisco training  our next generation of pharmacists. Teachers like him are some of the  greatest assets of our society, and I hope that he continues to make  such an important impact for years to come.   Thank you for your work and dedication, Dr. Francisco.                    Recognizing the Life of Parker Greene     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr.  Parker Greene of Valdosta, Georgia, who passed away on December 18,  2018.   Mr. Greene was a stalwart of Moody Air Force Base in Valdosta. In  2007, he was honored with the Exceptional Public Service Award for his  work on the base. His colleagues said that they don't know if anyone  else could ``compare with his dedication and contributions to Moody.''   Mr. Greene had been working with the base since the early 1970s, when  he served as the first chairman of military affairs for the Lowndes- Valdosta Chamber of Commerce. Among a number of other contributions, he  has also worked with the Department of Transportation on roads leading  in and out of the base and even has a building there named after him.   Mr. Greene has truly been involved in every aspect with both Moody  Air Force Base and the surrounding area, touching the lives of  countless people who have been stationed there. His family, friends,  and everyone at Moody will be in my thoughts and prayers during this  most difficult time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 2076, the BOLD  Infrastructure for Alzheimer's Act, because of what it does to address  this terrible disease. According to the Alzheimer's Association, nearly  5.7 million Americans are currently living with Alzheimer's. It is  currently the sixth leading cause of death in our country.   This debilitating disease continues to grow amongst our population,  but we still struggle to understand and find a cure. But there is hope.  This legislation would award agreements to establish national and  regional centers of excellence focused on Alzheimer's disease, as well  as support State public health departments, tribes, and others working  to fight this.  [[Page H10286]]    This disease impacts not only those who have it but also the millions  of caregivers responsible for the well-being of those who have  Alzheimer's. These are often family members or close friends who have  to make sacrifices in their own lives to care for others   This legislation will make great strides in better understanding the  cognitive decline associated with the disease, the impact on  caregivers, and how we can continue to fight for a cure.   I am a proud cosponsor of H.R. 4256, the companion bill in the House  that was introduced by my good friend and colleague, Mr. Guthrie of  Kentucky.   I also want to thank those across the country who have continued to  be tireless advocates on this issue, including Ms. Donna Camacho who  has been a leader on this issue in my district. I can't overstate my  appreciation for all of the hard work and dedication that so many  people have poured into passing this legislation.   Today, with this passage, we can help bring about hope in the future  for those who are victims of this disease, like my legislative  director's grandmother, Lisa Verlsteffen, a courageous woman who lived  a long and happy life, but who eventually succumbed to the effects of  Alzheimer's after a long and hard fight.   While today's work isn't the final solution, it brings us one step  closer in the fight to eradicate this disease. I urge my colleagues to  support this legislation and vote ``yes'' on its passage.
