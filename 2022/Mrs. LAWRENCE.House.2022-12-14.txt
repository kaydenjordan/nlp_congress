 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to give my farewell speech  on the floor of the House of Representatives.   It has been the honor of my lifetime to represent Michigan's 14th  Congressional District for the past 8 years.   A few months ago, I announced that my family and I made this  remarkable, tough decision that this will be my last term serving as a  Member of Congress. For 8 years, I have been given an amazing  opportunity, an opportunity to serve and walk the Halls of Congress,  and I have enjoyed every minute of this journey.   I am deeply grateful to the people of the 14th District in southeast  Michigan who gave me their vote and trusted me to represent them in  office. I have been representing southeast Michigan for 30 years. I am  coming home.   I was trained to be a public servant in local politics, where I was  the first woman and the first African American to ever be elected to  the position of mayor in the city of Southfield, for which I served for  14 years. I also served as school board president and president of the  city council.   In this Chamber where I stand, we debate issues and confront  challenges on behalf of the American people. This thing that we call a  democracy is defined by the vote of the people and someone stepping up  for public service.   I was raised by my grandmother, who migrated from Georgia to Detroit  in the height of the American civil rights movement. I remember  watching her in tears as America marched, protested, and fought for a  nation where we would not be judged by the color of our skin but by the  content of our character.   She instilled in me the passion for democracy and the importance of  voting. She told me: Brenda, if you work hard and get your education,  there is absolutely nothing that you can't do in these great United  States of America.   For the past 30 years, I have learned how important it is to be  accessible to my constituents, to act as their voices in the rooms that  they cannot enter. I went to places of worship, met with union  representatives, walked with the people, and made sure that the door  was open so that every citizen I represented had an opportunity to have  their voices heard.    As a member of Michigan's congressional delegation, I am proud to  have legislated on issues that are important to our great State of  Michigan--water quality, union rights, justice, transportation and  infrastructure, manufacturing and the auto industry, housing, and  education. I am most proud of using my voice to fight on behalf of my  constituents.  [[Page H9742]]    The diversity of my district truly represents the diversity in  America:   I represent immigrants.   My district has an international border.   I have the Great Lakes.   I have one of the largest Jewish populations in the country.   My district is majority African American, and I have a very large  Hispanic population.   Seeing the rich diversity in my district, I founded the Congressional  Caucus on Black-Jewish Relations to foster that relationship between  those of us who are targeted the most for hate and for discrimination.   We accomplished amazing work, and I am proud of the legacy that I  will continue to support as a citizen of this country.   I currently serve as the vice chair of the Congressional Black  Caucus, which is led by my colleague and my dear friend, Congresswoman  Joyce Beatty. I have been able to serve with some legends--like John  Lewis and Elijah Cummings--in that capacity, and I know that having the  Congressional Black Caucus, the conscience of Congress, this Congress  will continue to move in the right direction.   As you know, I was a member of the United States Postal Service for  30 years. When I arrived in Washington, my top priority was to sit on  the House Oversight Committee where I could continue to fight for the  survival and the efficiency of the United States Postal Service and  fight for my postal family.   I am so proud that we passed the Postal Service Reform Act that we  have been fighting for for years. Also, I am proud of my fight for the  Flint water crisis, to make sure that we have water in America that  will not hurt or harm people and that we fight for clean water in  America.   I serve on Appropriations, where I am vice chair of the House  Committee on Appropriations. I am standing here to say that the dollars  that you pay going to the right place has been very defining. I thank  my staff for all the support they have given me, and I look forward to  coming home. I am excited to spend time with my family--my husband, my  children, and my granddaughter--and the community of southeast  Michigan.                            ____________________
