 Mr. President, I rise today to discuss an important  provision I authored in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.   Section 40336 of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, H.R.  3684, includes several provisions relating to the Act of June 29, 1940,  54 Stat. 703, chapter 460; 16 U.S.C. 835d et seq., that facilitated the  construction of the Grand Coulee Dam. The portion of the Columbia River  that flows through the Colville and Spokane Indian Reservations  formerly supported abundant anadromous salmon fisheries that were  significant culturally and nutritionally to the Confederated Tribes of  the Colville Reservation and the Spokane Tribe of Indians. Upon  completion of the Grand Coulee Dam in 1942, these fisheries were  destroyed, and the Columbia River upstream of the Grand Coulee Dam was  inundated by its reservoir waters. In 1945, these reservoir waters were  designated Franklin D. Roosevelt Lake and today are commonly referred  to as Lake Roosevelt.   The 1940 Act instructed the Secretary of the Interior to ``set aside  approximately one-quarter of the entire reservoir area for the  paramount use of the Indians of the Spokane and Colville Reservations  for hunting, fishing, and boating purposes, which rights shall be  subject only to such reasonable regulations as the Secretary may  prescribe for the protection and conservation of fish and wildlife . .  . .'' 16 U.S.C. 835d (emphasis added). Congress authorized the  Secretary in the 1940 Act ``to perform any and all acts and to  prescribe such regulations as [it] may deem appropriate'' to protect  these paramount use rights. 16 U.S.C. 835h. The portions of Lake  Roosevelt ultimately set aside for the paramount use of the Colville  and Spokane Tribes pursuant to the 1940 Act are within the Colville and  Spokane Reservations and are called the ``Reservation Zone'' of Lake  Roosevelt.   In a 1945 Opinion, Interior Solicitor Warner Gardner interpreted the  1940 Act and confirmed that the 1940 Act provided the Tribes ``special  rights'' to hunt, fish and boat within the Reservation Zones. 59 I.D.  147 (Dec. 29, 1945). Solicitor Gardner also found that the Secretary  has broad discretion to determine how to protect the Tribes' paramount  rights, including the power to ``give the Indians exclusive rights of  hunting, fishing, and boating'' in the Tribes' respective Reservation  Zones.''   In 1990, Interior entered an agreement with the Colville and Spokane  Tribes establishing the framework for cooperative management of Lake  Roosevelt between the Tribes, Bureau of Reclamation, National Park  Service and Bureau of Indian Affairs. The agreement, commonly referred  to as the ``S-Party Agreement,'' provides for the Colville and Spokane  Tribes to ``manage, plan and regulate all activities, development and  uses that take place'' within the Tribes' applicable portion of the  Reservation Zones. The 5-Party Agreement also directs that the Bureau  of Indian Affairs ``shall assist the tribes in carrying out the tribes'  management of the Reservation Zone, and undertake such other activities  as are authorized by law in support of the tribes.''   At the Tribes' request, the Department of the Interior and its agency  stakeholders previously initiated a process to consider potential  solutions, including various possible Federal administrative actions to  protect the Colville and Spokane Tribes' paramount rights. This process  involved government-to-government meetings and communications with both  Tribes and with the State of Washington. The Department of the Interior  considered several options, including rulemaking. A summary of the  parties' efforts in this regard were memorialized in a January 19,  2017, letter from Interior Solicitor Tompkins to the State of  Washington and the Colville and Spokane Tribes.   The references to the Tribes' paramount use rights in section 40336  are intended to reaffirm the 1940 act's recognition of those rights and  to recognize that the Secretary of the Interior has both a federal  trust responsibility and broad discretion to protect the Tribes'  paramount use rights.   Thank you.                            ____________________
