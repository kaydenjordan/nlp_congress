 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember the life of Sarah  Janecek, a friend who passed away unexpectedly and far too soon.   Sarah was one of Minnesota's best political commentators. As a  strategist, she understood all sides of the issues and brought humor  everywhere she went.   Over the course of her career, Sarah built relationships across the  political spectrum. She was known for lending her honesty and wit to  every encounter. She commanded respect by becoming a source of  political knowledge through her writing, newsletters, and commentary,  and she was sought after by local and national media to provide her  insights on Minnesota's unusual politics.   Our community has suffered a great loss. Sarah's bright spirit will,  indeed, be missed. My deepest condolences go out to her family and  loved ones. Sarah had a great heart, and we will all miss her.           Honoring the Legacy of Wright County Sheriff Joe Hagerty     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the legacy of Wright  County Sheriff Joe Hagerty. Joe retires after 33 honorable years of  service to the third largest sheriff's office in the State of  Minnesota. He has a reputation for honesty and has become someone that  we all trust.   Our community has been honored to have a public servant with Joe's  level of integrity and accountability. His respect for the rule of law  and compassion for his fellow citizens made him an exceptional sheriff.   During his time in office, Joe fostered a relationship with  neighboring counties to share a crime lab, which helped solve cases and  bring justice. Every single day, Joe put the safety of Minnesotans  above all else.   Sheriff Hagerty, I speak on behalf of all Minnesotans when I say:  Thank you. We wish you a happy and healthy and well-deserved  retirement.                 Recognizing Carver County Sheriff Jim Olson     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and thank Carver  County Sheriff Jim Olson for his incredible 31 years of service to the  people of Minnesota. In Jim's three-plus decades on the force, Sheriff  Olson oversaw some of Carver County's most exciting and turbulent  times.   When the Ryder Cup was held in Chaska, Minnesota, in 2016, Jim  managed safety operations and maintained a family-friendly environment  for everyone. After the passing of Minnesota legend Prince, Jim ensured  that Paisley Park in Carver County remained a safe place for Prince's  fans to mourn.   Jim has dedicated his life to Carver County, serving as an instructor  of the Carver County Citizens Academy to inform the public about the  services and role of the sheriff's office. Impressively, he also serves  as a member of the Carver County Mental Health Consortium to spread  awareness of mental health resources. He has been a faithful, selfless  servant leader to the citizens of Carver County.   Sheriff Olson, thank you for your service. We wish you the best in  your retirement.                Recognizing Outstanding Businessman Butch Ames     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of one of  Minnesota's outstanding businessmen, Butch Ames. As chief executive  officer and cofounder of Ames Construction, a family-owned and  privately held construction company headquartered in Minnesota, Butch  has built and grown the industry nationwide.   Ames Construction is known for heavy civil, transportation, and  mining construction. With Butch at the helm, the company continues to  grow and expand its reach all across the Nation. They have completed  notable projects, such as Denver's International Airport, the I-15  corridor reconstruction project in Salt Lake City, the Loop 202 in  Phoenix, and the St. Croix River Crossing in Minnesota.   Butch holds his company to a standard of professionalism and safety  that is unparalleled, serving this Nation and his industry proudly.   Congratulations, Butch.                          Recognizing Torah Academy     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Torah Academy for  entering their 73rd year educating Jewish children in Minnesota. From  the  [[Page H1133]]  beginning and to this day, Torah Academy maintains a focus on  strengthening the mind and spirit of our future leaders.   Because of educators like Dean and Rabbi Pinchus Idstein and  Principal Matthew Cleary, Torah Academy offers a quality education on  firm spiritual grounding. Pillars of our strong local community like  Dr. Joey Greenberg and his wife, Mrs. Marina Greenberg, spread kindness  and generosity to make certain Torah can execute its mission and goals.    A special thank-you to Citizens Independent Bank, that also dedicates  their support.   Torah students succeed because their community supports them, and  they are guaranteed to make their corner of the world a better place.   Congratulations to Torah Academy for a successful 73 years. We wish  you many more.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding me time.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support another bill which builds on the  good work of the House Financial Services Committee.   The Protecting Consumers' Access to Credit Act takes an important  step to provide certainty through our financial system and to support  consumers.   A 2015 court decision that we have heard other speakers talk about  today, Madden v. Midland, is making it difficult for online lenders to  offer businesses the funds they need to grow and succeed.   In Madden, the court held that, while the National Bank Act allows a  federally chartered bank to charge interest under the laws of its home  State on loans it makes nationwide, nonbanks that acquire these loans  may not be able to maintain the same rate of interest since nonbanks  are subject to limits of the borrower's State.   At a time when lenders are eager to help consumers and businesses  gain access to capital, Congress needs to step in to check this  misguided ruling.   When a federally chartered bank originates the interest on a loan,  that interest rate should remain consistent.   Representative McHenry's legislation provides that fix by codifying  the legal doctrine of valid when made.   Further, it helps community banks and credit unions access secondary  markets they need to generate liquidity while also enabling new and  emerging financial technology innovators to find easier ways for  consumers and businesses to access credit and capital.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the hard work of my colleague, our chief  deputy whip, on this important legislation. I encourage all of the  Members of this body to support the Protecting Consumers' Access to  Credit Act.   We must fix the misguided Madden ruling and take another step forward  in supporting consumers, financial innovation, and our lenders that  serve as the backbone of Main Street America.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, this is odd. Here, we  have another Member of Congress, whose State attorney general opposes  the bill, and who has banned payday lending.   So, here, Mr. Emmer is joining with Mr. McHenry and Mr. Pittenger,  whose State opposes the bill, North Carolina. Again, the two of them  are in opposition to their own State's attorney general. And now we  have Mr. Rothfus from Pennsylvania and all of these speakers on the  opposite side of the aisle who are coming here to support a bill that  will open up the opportunity for payday lenders to basically rent a  bank and put these payday loans out there at exorbitant amounts.   Mr. Speaker, again, this is rather odd to see so many Members  representing, supposedly, their constituents who come from States where  payday lending has been banned and their attorneys general oppose this  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
