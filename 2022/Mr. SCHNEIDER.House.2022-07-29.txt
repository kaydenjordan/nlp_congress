 Mr. Speaker, today I rise in emphatic support of H.R.  1808, the Assault Weapons Ban of 2022.   Over the past few weeks, survivors of the horrific shooting in  Highland Park, Illinois, came to D.C. determined to make change. They  teamed up with Uvalde, Parkland, and Newtown to demand an assault  weapons ban to reduce the chance of other communities experiencing the  trauma they all tragically bear.   Today, thanks in no small part to their efforts, the American people  will get that recorded vote. The world is watching. No other nation  experiences the grotesque number of murders from deranged individuals  turning weapons of war on kids in school, families at prayer, and  people watching a parade.   The vote we are taking today will show the families of those murdered  exactly who is on their side--who is protecting our children and  putting people over politics, and, conversely, who is on the other side  voting for their own power.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Speaker Pelosi and Congressman Cicilline for  working tirelessly to secure a timely vote, and I urge passage of this  bill.
