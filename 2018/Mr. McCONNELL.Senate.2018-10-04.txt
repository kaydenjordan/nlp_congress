 Mr. President, the Senate is considering the  nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to serve as an Associate Justice on  the Supreme Court of the United States.   When the noise fades, when the uncorroborated mud washes away, what  is left is the distinguished nominee who stands before us--an acclaimed  judge whom peers and colleagues praise in the very strongest terms, a  jurist whom the American Bar Association awarded its very highest  rating unanimously--``well qualified.''   Here is what the ABA says it takes to earn that distinction:         To merit a rating of ``Well Qualified,'' the nominee must       be at the top of the legal profession in his or her legal       community; have outstanding legal ability, breadth of       experience and the highest reputation for integrity; and       demonstrate the capacity for sound judicial temperament.    This is the nonpartisan test that my friend the Democratic leader,  among others, used to call the gold standard. Judge Kavanaugh passed  that with flying colors.   To be clear, this seal of approval comes from the ABA's Standing  Committee on the Federal Judiciary--an independent entity within the  organization. Even after the ABA's President  [[Page S6508]]  tried to play politics with the nomination last week, the Standing  Committee reaffirmed its rating yet again. Unanimously well qualified-- that is Brett Kavanaugh.   So how did we end up where we are today? How did we get here? How did  we get from a chorus of expert praise and professional respect to wild  tales of violent gangs, sexual assault rings, fist fights on boats in  Rhode Island harbors, and the possibility--get this--of an argument at  a college bar?   Several weeks ago, a confidential allegation of misconduct from  nearly 40 years ago was leaked to the press. Since then, other  allegations have poured forth. Many were just patently ridiculous--a  feeding frenzy of ridiculous accusations. While some cheered on the  feeding frenzy for political purposes, Judiciary Chairman Chuck  Grassley and his staff rolled up their sleeves and went to work. They  promptly investigated the varied allegations that materialized at the  last minute.    Chairman Grassley reopened the public hearing so that Dr. Ford and  Judge Kavanaugh could speak directly to those claims under oath. By the  way, that was after he offered Dr. Ford the option to tell her story at  any place of her choosing--either here or in California, either in  public or in private, either with staff or with Members. It was an  offer that, according to Dr. Ford's testimony, was seemingly never  actually communicated to her by her lawyers despite a professional  requirement to do so.   Now, of course, the FBI has completed a supplemental background  investigation and delivered its results to us here in the Senate. This  is now the seventh time the FBI has thoroughly reviewed Judge  Kavanaugh's background--seven FBI investigations. So what have we  learned? What do the facts and the evidence tell us after seven FBI  investigations? The fact is, these allegations have not been  corroborated. None of the allegations have been corroborated by the  seven FBI investigations--not in the new FBI investigation, not  anywhere. None of these last-minute allegations have been corroborated,  as is confirmed by the seventh and latest FBI investigation.   As Chairman Grassley stated this morning, ``Neither the Judiciary  Committee nor the FBI can locate any third parties who can attest to  any of these allegations.'' There is no backup from any witnesses,  including those specifically named as eyewitnesses by the people who  brought the allegations in the first place. Let me say that again.  There is no backup from any witnesses, including those specifically  named as eyewitnesses by the people who brought these allegations. In  addition, one person has completely recanted their whole wild story.  Another accuser went on television and backpedaled from many of their  own ridiculous charges.   The facts do not support the allegations levied at Judge Kavanaugh's  character. Instead, many of the facts actually support Judge  Kavanaugh's strong, unequivocal denial, which he repeatedly stated to  committee investigators under penalty of felony and which he firmly  restated under oath last Thursday before the full committee and the  American people, which aligns with the testimony of hundreds--literally  hundreds--of character witnesses who have known him over the years.   For goodness' sake, this is the United States of America. Nobody is  supposed to be guilty until proven innocent in this country. Nobody is  supposed to be guilty until proven innocent in the United States of  America. The Senate should not set a fundamentally un-American  precedent here.   Judge Kavanaugh's right to basic fairness does not disappear just  because some disagree with his judicial philosophy. Our society is not  a place where uncorroborated allegations of misconduct from nearly 40  years ago--allegations which are vigorously disputed--can nullify  someone's career or destroy their reputation. Is that what the Senate  is going to be known for--your nomination comes up here, and we destroy  your reputation? Is that what the Senate is going to participate in?   Above the partisan noise, beyond this shameful spectacle, which is an  embarrassment to the Senate, what will endure are the actual facts  before us--the actual facts. Upon reviewing them, only one question is  left for us to answer: Is Judge Brett Kavanaugh qualified to serve on  the U.S. Supreme Court?   There is a good reason the political opponents of this nomination  have never wanted to litigate that issue. Oh, no. They don't want to  talk about that. There is a good reason they let the politics of  personal destruction run away ahead of the facts. It is in an effort to  dodge that very good question because Brett Kavanaugh is stunningly and  totally qualified for this job.   We already know this, but, for starters, his academic and legal  credentials are second to none. He graduated from Yale with honors and  went on to Yale Law School. Then came not one, not two, but three  clerkships in our Nation's Federal courts, ending up with Justice  Kennedy. His career continued with work in the Office of Independent  Counsel and the Office of White House Counsel.   That was only the beginning. For the last 12 years, Brett Kavanaugh  has served on what is widely considered the second highest court in our  land, the DC Circuit Court of Appeals. He has written more than 300  judicial opinions. Several have formed the basis of later rulings by  the Supreme Court itself.   The litany of accomplishments is a fact--a fact. It is a matter of  public record.   Just as telling are all the accounts of Judge Brett Kavanaugh, the  person, that have been volunteered by those who have known him every  step of the way over the years. We have heard from literally hundreds  of character witnesses who have heaped praise on the Brett Kavanaugh  they know--the loyal friend and teammate; the standout student; the  talented, hard-working colleague; the brilliant legal writer; the  respected role model and mentor, particularly to women; and the devoted  husband, father, and coach. These letters and recorded testimony were  offered by men and women with nothing to gain for themselves; they were  just glad to tell the truth about a nominee who they know possesses the  character, temperament, and qualifications for this important job.   Judge Kavanaugh's professor and others who knew him at Yale describe  ``a true intellectual,'' ``a leading thinker,'' and ``a wonderful  mentor and teacher.'' One goes so far as saying: ``It is hard to name  anyone with judicial credentials as strong as those of Judge  Kavanaugh.''   His former law clerks, in full-throated support, say that Judge  Kavanaugh's work ethic ``flows from a fundamental humility.'' They say  that he gives ``unflinchingly honest advice'' and ``listens carefully  to the views of his colleagues and clerks, even--indeed, especially-- when they differ from his own.''   His legal peers here in Washington of all political persuasions  haven't minced their words either. They deem him ``unquestionably  qualified by his extraordinary intellect, experience, and temperament''  and warn the Senate not to miss this opportunity to put ``such a strong  advocate for decency and civility on our Nation's highest court.''   Let's not lose sight of the opportunity before us. This process has  been ruled by fear, anger, and underhanded gamesmanship for too long.  It is time for us to stand up to this kind of thing. We owe it to the  American people not to be intimidated by these tactics. We owe it to  the American people to underscore that you are innocent until proven  guilty.   It is the Senate that is on trial here. What kind of image will we  convey to the public? Can we be scared by all these people rampaging  through the halls, accosting Members at airports, and coming to their  homes, trying to intimidate the Senate into defeating a good man? Are  we going to allow this to happen in this country?   We will not pretend that partisan histrionics take away the basic  fairness that every American deserves. We will not be hoodwinked by  those who have tried hard to smear this good man and to drag him  through the mud. And when that didn't work, they turned on the dime and  started claiming his real sin was that he spoke up too forcefully in  defense of his good name and his family, or they decided he didn't have  a judicial temperament because he aggressively defended his good name  [[Page S6509]]  against this outrageous smear conducted in conjunction with Senate  Democrats.   Who among us would not have been outraged by having a lifetime record  drug through the mud with accusations that cannot be proven and a  blatant attempt to decide--on the part of at least some Senate  Democrats--that the presumption of innocence no longer applies in this  country? What kind of person wouldn't have been upset about that?   They claim he spoke too forcefully in defense of himself after being  accused of such outrageous behavior that cannot be proven. I admire him  for standing up for himself and standing up for his family. I would be  shocked if it were not done in an aggressive fashion, for goodness'  sake.   Let's reclaim this moment for what it should be--a chance to elevate  a stunningly talented and impressive jurist to an important office for  which he is so well qualified, so completely and totally qualified. It  is a golden opportunity to give our great Nation precisely the kind of  brilliant, fairminded, and collegial Supreme Court Justice that the  Court deserves. This is the good that Senators will have an opportunity  to do. We have a chance to do good here and to underscore the basic  tenet of fairness in our country.
