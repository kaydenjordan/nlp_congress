 I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I come to the floor today to address the  growing crisis in our country, in our cities and towns across our  country: a crisis of law and order, yes, a crisis of the rule of law, a  crisis of confidence, a crisis of solidarity. As our cities and towns  come under siege, as so many of them descend into violence and  lawlessness night after night, we witness before our eyes the fraying  of the American fabric, the breaking of American bonds.   The violence that we are witnessing is not just about the individual  lives harmed or lost, neighborhoods destroyed, businesses burned and  looted, families living in fear, whole neighborhoods cowering behind  locked doors. No. The devastation that we are seeing, the crisis that  we are facing is about the confidence in our society itself, in our  ability to come together, to live together, to find common ground, to  build this common community and pursue that more perfect union. All of  that is under threat in this current crisis of lawlessness, of lack of  respect for the rule of law, of the decline of due process and law and  order.   Let's just be clear. These are not peaceful protests that we are  seeing across the country. They are violent and increasingly violent  riots and attacks and looting, and I am sorry to say that too many in  the media and my colleagues across the aisle are appeasing the mobs and  the Marxists whose desire is to burn our cities down, to burn our  neighborhoods to the ground.   These attacks are occurring because they are increasingly enabled by  the mainstream press and local and national politicians who are pushing  a historically fraudulent version of American history, one where  America is a fundamentally racist nation, one where America is  systemically evil, one where police officers are cast as agents of  oppression.   What our leaders fail to recognize is that our police officers, the  brave men  [[Page S5514]]  and women in blue, those who choose day in and day out, of their own  volition, of their own accord, to go out to the streets, to put their  lives on the line to serve and protect their neighborhoods, their  fellow citizens, and to stand for our values--those police officers are  an example and exemplars of our deepest held and most cherished beliefs  because, without those police officers--let's just be clear--the  Constitution of the United States, the Bill of Rights, those things are  just words on a page.   Without law enforcement officers giving their lives, risking their  lives to enforce and make available the fair and equal rule of law,  well, our Constitution is just a parchment barrier. It may as well not  exist.   Now, our police officers are the best among us. They are the  guardians of our neighborhoods. They are the sentries on the streets.  But too often now, in the press, right here in this body, we hear  attacks on police officers, we hear rushes to judgment. These voices of  criticism don't see police as human beings, as working men and women  whose experience and lives mirror our own, and too often these critics  don't see the suffering, the suicides, the low morale that police  officers across this Nation face.   The consequences of this mistreatment that law enforcement are facing  in this country are becoming ever clearer. Police departments are  facing increasing retirements. They are struggling to retain the  officers they have and struggling to hire new ones. Local law  enforcement report plummeting morale as officers face increasing  violence and police departments struggle to pay their officers a salary  that is commensurate with the work that they do, work that is more  challenging today with the riots and looting sweeping across our  cities.   What our officers need is not less funding. What they need is not  defunding. What they need is not disrespect. What they need is support.  What they need is for the leaders of this country and the good men and  women of this country to say: We are with you; we support you; we will  stand with you in the important and vital job that you do. They need  more funding, not less; more recognition, not less.   Our Federal Government exists to provide for the general welfare.  Well, I believe it is time that Congress lived up to that promise. So  let's make it simple. Let's give our officers a pay raise. Let's give a  pay raise to every cop in America, and let's do it right now. Let's  provide new funding for police departments across this Nation to hire  more cops and to put them out on the beat. Let's put our money where  our mouth is and stand by our law enforcement in this vital time for  them and this vital time for our Nation.   That is why, today, I am introducing legislation to back our police.  My bill would authorize new funding through the Department of Justice  to permit State and local police to raise the salaries of officers up  to 110 percent of local median earnings. That is a real wage boost, and  it would be available under my bill right now. It would provide funding  to hire new officers to boost manpower, and it would withhold this  funding from any city or jurisdiction that defunds their police and  tries to cut officer pay.   I can tell you, for law enforcement in States like mine, in Missouri,  this could mean a raise of thousands of dollars a year, and our law  enforcement deserve it. Not only would this legislation help officers;  it would help all Americans by working to build a safer nation for our  families to thrive and our communities to grow as one people together.  Through safety, we can have solidarity.   This bill is named in honor of David Dorn, the retired St. Louis  police captain who was killed in June trying to protect his neighbors  and his friends and his own neighborhood from violent looters. It is  dedicated to all of those officers who have been a victim of violence  this year.   It is time that we rejected the false narrative that the police are  inherently oppressive; that America is inherently evil; that structural  racism and structural oppression define this country, its past, its  present, and its future; and that the police are instruments of this  oppression, of this history, of this evil.   It simply isn't true. Instead, it is time to stand, again, with our  law enforcement, to affirm the vital work that they do, to affirm the  vital role that they play in making available the rule of law for every  American, in making available and protecting the vital rights of every  American. And it is time--by recommitting ourselves to safe streets, to  the rule of law, to due process--to work on reforging those bonds of  community, of solidarity, and of togetherness that are being torn apart  night after night after night with the burning and the rioting in our  streets.   It is a fundamental choice we face. No nation can long endure  lawlessness. No nation can long endure the breakdown of the basic  operation of law. That is why the job that our law enforcement officers  do night after night on that thin blue line is so vital. It is time  that we stood up and thanked them for it. It is time that we stood up  and supported them in it.   May God bless our men and women who go to stand on that line every  night                                  ______                                         By Mr. McCONNELL (for himself, Mrs. Gillibrand, Ms. McSally, and          Mrs. Feinstein):   S. 4547. A bill to improve the integrity and safety of horseracing by  requiring uniform safety and performance standards, including a  horseracing anti-doping and medication control program and a racetrack  safety program to be developed and enforced by an independent  Horseracing Integrity and Safety Authority, and for other purposes; to  the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.
