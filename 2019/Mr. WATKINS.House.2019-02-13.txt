 Mr. Chairman, I thank my Republican leader, Mr. McCaul,  for his leadership on this issue.   Mr. Chairman, I rise today in opposition of H.J. Res. 37, and I  encourage my colleagues to do the same.   As a combat veteran, with many years of experience in conflict and  postconflict environments, I am particularly concerned about this  resolution. Passing it would pose a threat to many other important  bilateral agreements that help keep us and our allies safe and make the  world a better place.   Even the resolution is misleading. Our Armed Forces are not engaged  in hostilities in the Yemen conflict. Outside of Yemen, the U.S. Armed  Forces support an ally, through intelligence sharing, threat analysis,  and logistical support.   The strength of our international relations lies on the numerous  global relationships that we hold. We help each other understand,  forecast, and eliminate threats. This is especially true in the Arabian  Peninsula, where ISIS and al-Qaida have been notoriously active.   Furthermore, pertinent facts relating to Yemen are classified,  leaving Congressmen and -women to vote blind.   Mr. Chairman, we have a long history of free-thinking bipartisanship  when it comes to foreign policy. I ask my colleagues to think for  themselves, not merely vote along party lines.
