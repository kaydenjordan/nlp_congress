 Mr. Speaker, I rise to express concern  with H.R. 2, legislation that would place at risk United States  agriculture.   H.R. 2, with the E-Verify provision in particular, does not address  the workforce crisis and could cause a $60 billion drop in production,  resulting in a 5 to 6 percent increase in prices at the grocery store  when many families across America are still struggling to make it from  week to week.   We must develop real solutions to the labor crisis facing our  farmers, ranchers, and growers. During a tour at Warren Farms, and  speaking with farmers across eastern North Carolina, this is what they  are telling me: Enough is enough. People are fed up with divided D.C.  politics.   Our government must get out of the way of hardworking people. We  should take H.R. 2, as drafted, off the table so our farmers can  continue putting food on the table for households across this great  country.   Congress' inaction to address the labor crisis will result in farmers  losing their livelihoods.   I am here. I am right here to work with anyone who wants to make life  better for eastern North Carolina, rural America, and the American  people. We can secure the border. However, we cannot secure the border  while creating so much insecurity for our farm families.   Mr. Speaker, I am standing with American farmers.    Mr. Speaker, recently, I held farm bill  listening sessions across North Carolina's First Congressional  District, making stops in Hertford, Nash, Pitt, and Wilson Counties to  hear directly from our local agriculture community about their  priorities in the 2023 farm bill.   Mike Belch, a local farmer, stressed the importance of protecting  crop insurance.   Beth Farrell spoke about the need to ensure conservation programs  meet the needs of our growers.   Joe Martin raised concerns about pricing, that pricing must keep up  with inflation.   Maxine White and many others talked about wanting to see more  technology used in the field to ensure the next generation of growers  can effectively and efficiently create new ways to do what they do  best: feed and clothe America.   I am proud to deliver surveys from eastern North Carolinians to be  submitted for the official record for the 2023 farm bill.   I also heard about the need to address the labor crisis, including  addressing the H-2A system. I will keep fighting for our agriculture  community.                            ____________________
