 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 6782) to require the Administrator of the Small Business  Administration to submit a report on recipients of assistance under the  paycheck protection program and the economic injury disaster loan  program, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 6782         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Small Business Transparency       and Reporting for the Underbanked and Taxpayers at Home Act''       or the ``TRUTH Act''.       SEC. 2. REPORT.         Not later than 30 days after the date of the enactment of       this Act, the Administrator of the Small Business       Administration shall make publicly available, in an online       format that is sortable and searchable for key words and       downloadable (to the extent technically practicable), the       following information with respect to the paycheck protection       program and the economic injury disaster loan program:        (1) An identification of each recipient of assistance in an       amount greater than $2,000,000 from funds appropriated under       the CARES Act (Public Law 116-136) or the Paycheck Protection       Program and Health Care Enhancement Act (Public Law 116-139).  [[Page H2331]]         (2) An explanation of the decision-making processes under       which such funds were disbursed.        (3) The number of employees of each entity that received       such assistance.        (4) The date on which such assistance was disbursed.        (5) An identification of each lender or intermediary       through which such assistance was disbursed.        (6) The amount of assistance provided to small business       concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically       disadvantaged individuals (as defined in section 8(d)(3)(C)       of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(d)(3)(C)), small       business concern owned and controlled by women (as defined       under section 3(n) of such Act (15 U.S.C. 632(n)), and small       business concern owned and controlled by veterans (as defined       in section 3(q) of such Act (15 U.S.C. 632(q)), from       information voluntarily provided by such concerns.       SEC. 3. COMMITMENTS FOR 7(A) LOANS.         Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the amounts       authorized for commitments for general business loans       authorized under section 7(a) of the Small Business Act (15       U.S.C. 636(a)) under the heading ``business loans program       account'' under the heading ``Small Business Administration''       under title V of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020       (Public Law 116-93; 133 Stat. 2475) shall apply with respect       to loans made under such section 7(a), other than loans made       under paragraph (36) of such section 7(a), on and after the       date of enactment of this Act.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the bill before us today, H.R.  6782, the Small Business Transparency and Reporting for the Underbanked  and Taxpayers at Home Act, or the TRUTH Act.   The CARES Act and the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care  Enhancement Act provided over $725 billion in relief to nonprofits,  small businesses, and the independently employed who are struggling to  cope with the economic downturn brought about by the spread of COVID- 19.   By utilizing the SBA's Economic Injury Disaster Loan Program and  creating the Paycheck Protection Program, Congress took swift action to  provide a necessary lifeline. And while both programs have saved  countless livelihoods, jobs, and businesses, millions more remain left  out.   Unfortunately, it won't matter how much money Congress spends to  address these problems if Congress cannot track where the money is  going to verify that it is reaching the families and businesses that  need it most.   To that end, my colleagues and I have sent multiple oversight letters  to SBA requesting detailed data and information on the implementation  of the Paycheck Protection Program and Economic Injury Disaster Loans.  To date, we have not received anything more than what SBA has published  on their website. This is simply unacceptable.   It is vital that the administration be transparent and good stewards  of taxpayers' dollars. I am proud to support the bipartisan effort  before us today, led by my esteemed colleagues Mr. Phillips of  Minnesota and Mr. Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania.   The bill requires SBA to publish an online database of the recipients  of PPP and EIDL loans over $2 million. It would also list the number of  employees at each business benefiting from this assistance and the  amount of funds provided to underserved businesses.   This is precisely the kind of data Congress needs to ensure that the  programs are being administered as intended and, more importantly, to  ensure the scarce funds are reaching those communities and businesses  that need it most.   Furthermore, the bill includes language that will decouple the 7(a)  loan program and Paycheck Protection Program accounts.   Currently, both programs share the same appropriations account,  meaning that once the Paycheck Protection Program appropriation lapses,  the 7(a) loan program will shut down along with it. It was never  congressional intent to tie the future of both programs together, so in  order to preserve the sustainability of the 7(a) loan program, it is  necessary to decouple the two accounts.   At a time when the future of the small business economy is so  uncertain, it is of top importance to ensure the long-term  sustainability of the 7(a) loan program. This language achieves that  goal.   I applaud the bipartisanship and, more importantly, the commitment to  being good stewards of the taxpayers' dollars.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues, Republican and Democrat, to  join me in voting for stronger transparency and oversight of the CARES  Act programs. Our hardworking small business owners and the American  people deserve no less.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Phillips), the sponsor of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, when this body spent trillions of dollars to address the  economic downturn brought about by COVID-19, we included a special  inspector general to provide oversight over the expenditure of these  dollars. Unfortunately, President Trump said the special IG could not  issue reports to Congress without Presidential supervision and  subsequently removed the acting IG at the Pentagon and chairman of the  panel.   So with the erosion of accountability, transparency is needed more  than ever. Congress needs to ensure that there is no waste, fraud, or  abuse of taxpayers' dollars.                                time  1000    This data collection and transparency bill is a positive step in that  direction, providing much-needed transparency and accountability.  Knowledge is power and, with this bill, the public will finally have  the knowledge on how these programs have been implemented, where the  money has gone, who has gotten it and who hasn't.   Not only will this empower the people, it will empower Congress as we  continue working to optimize the CARES Act programs.   The bill also clarifies the program accounts for the Paycheck  Protection Program and the 7(a) Loan Program are wholly distinct,  ensuring that the SBA's flagship lending program will not shut down  when the Paycheck Protection Program appropriation lapses.   As the small business economy begins to recover in the coming weeks  and months, small businesses need to be able to access affordable  capital to rehire workers, restock their shelves, and resume  operations. This language ensures the 7(a) program will be an option  for them in the next phase of recovery.   I urge my colleagues to support this measure, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 7010) to amend the Small Business Act and the CARES Act to  modify certain provisions related to the forgiveness of loans under the  paycheck protection program, to allow recipients of loan forgiveness  under the paycheck protection program to defer payroll taxes, and for  other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 7010         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Paycheck Protection Program       Flexibility Act of 2020''.       SEC. 2.

(b) Designation in Senate.--In the Senate, this Act is       designated as an emergency requirement pursuant to section       4112(a) of H. Con. Res. 71 (115th Congress), the concurrent       resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2018.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I rise in support of the bipartisan bill before us today, H.R. 7010,  the Paycheck Protection Program Flexibility Act of 2020.   We all knew the rollout of the Paycheck Protection Program was going  to be rocky, given the size of the program and the speed with which it  was stood up.   We are thankful for the staff at SBA for their hard work assisting  small businesses during this dire time. This is, undoubtedly, the most  enormous undertaking the agency has ever performed. They have done so  under difficult circumstances and remarkably quickly.   With that said, my colleagues and I have been hearing from Main  Street small businesses that they need changes to make the program work  for them.   I think we can all agree the economic crisis brought on by COVID-19  has proven more severe and drawn out than many anticipated. In some  cases, State and local governments have extended shutdowns and stay-at- home orders. Many localities are only now allowing small businesses to  reopen, very gradually, in phases.   In other instances, small business owners have reported concerns that  the economy will not fully recover until there is an affordable, widely  accessible COVID-19 vaccine.   Regardless, the extended nature of the economic downturn has made it  necessary to enact certain legislative reforms to the program.   First, we need to give borrowers more than 8 weeks to use the funds  in order to qualify for loan forgiveness. Borrowers who took out PPP  loans early in the program are about to reach the end of their 8-week  period governing forgiveness. However, millions of small businesses  across the Nation are still facing forced closures.   Those that are reopening are required to do so in an extremely  limited manner, with only outdoor dining or curbside-only pickup at  retail stores. Those restrictions mean small businesses continue to  have a tough road ahead, and they need flexibility in how they use this  emergency capital. This provision will give them that.   The bill triples the current 8-week period in which businesses must  use funds to be eligible for forgiveness to 24 weeks. That will help  ensure businesses have more room to breathe, even in places where  reopening of the economy happens more slowly.   Second, we must extend the program through the end of the year. The  unpredictable spread of the virus, shortage of widespread testing, and  lack of a vaccine mean that we do not know exactly when the small  business sector will fully reopen and, when it does, how the ``new  normal'' will look.   The bill addresses a challenge that was created when the first set of  guidelines were issued. We have heard you  [[Page H2334]]  loud and clear. Today's legislation strikes a balance between  protecting workers by guaranteeing loans are used for payroll, with the  need to recognize that many independent restaurants face difficulty  paying rent and utilities.   The new 60/40 ratio makes certain a business can remain open, weather  the crisis, continue employing workers, and keep serving their local  communities. Congress must revamp this program to make it more  accessible for small employers to weather the uncertainty ahead.   We simply do not know if there will be another wave of infections or  additional lockdowns. This bill provides certainty to employers afraid  to use their loan proceeds or reluctant to apply to the program by  providing much-needed flexibility.   I applaud my colleagues, Mr. Phillips and Mr. Roy, for working  together in a bipartisan manner to craft commonsense solutions for  America's small businesses. I thank Ranking Member Chabot for his  assistance in crafting this bipartisan measure.   I urge all my colleagues to vote ``yes,'' and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Minnesota (Mr. Phillips).    Mr. Speaker, I would like to inquire of the Chair how  much time is remaining on each side.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  New Hampshire (Mr. Pappas).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Colorado (Mr. Neguse).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  New Jersey (Mr. Gottheimer).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I continuously hear from small businesses across the  country about the uncertainty they are facing and when they will be  able to fully reopen. In the face of that uncertainty, small businesses  need flexibility with these loans.   This bill takes an important step in providing that flexibility and  making the Paycheck Protection Program work better for the millions of  small businesses across the country that are trying to weather this  storm. And since we do not know how long this storm will last, we must  ensure small businesses are able to take advantage of the program  through the end of the calendar year and to use the loan over the  course of 24 weeks. This program is now a stronger onramp to full  employment for small employers to weather this unprecedented economic  and public health crisis.   I commend the Committee on Small Business staff on both sides of the  aisle for their dedication and hard work over these last few months. I  thank them for their commitment to our Nation's small employers and  their workers.   And I thank the ranking member, because we have always, throughout  the history of the committee, worked in a bipartisan manner. I always  say, when we deal with small business issues, there is no Democratic or  Republican approach. Those are American issues, particularly as they  relate to our economy.   Mr. Speaker, in that vein, I also thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Roy) and the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Phillips) for the great work  that they did and for the bipartisan spirit in which they brought this  bill to the floor.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge a vote in support of the legislation,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
