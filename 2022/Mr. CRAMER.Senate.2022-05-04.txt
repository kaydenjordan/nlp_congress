 Madam President, I want to honor today the  distinguished career of a remarkable North Dakota educator and artist  who is retiring from teaching this month.   Wallace ``Butch'' Thunder Hawk is an internationally renowned artist  who has been a Tribal art teacher at United Tribes Technical College in  Bismarck for 49 years. He has helped hundreds of students grow their  artistic talent and appreciate traditional Native American art and  traditions.   Beyond his classroom in Bismarck, the impact of Butch's passion for  creating and teaching Native American art has been felt around the  world. A Hunkpapa Lakota Teton Sioux, he was raised in the community of  Cannonball on the Standing Rock Reservation. Butch was influenced by  the work of his grandparents and mother, who created traditional art  including beadwork, warbonnets, and tools. Ledger art has become one of  Butch's great interests, and he has created hand-carved horse effigies,  horse memorial sticks, war shields, and traditional weaponry.   His artwork can be seen in homes and museums around the region and  world. He was instrumental in establishing the Indian Hall exhibit at  Thomas Jefferson's Monticello, helping to recreate art similar to what  Lewis and Clark would have collected during their famous expedition in  the early 1800s. Working with Harvard University's Peabody Museum of  Archaelogy and Ethnology, he and his students created several pieces  for Monticello's Indian Hall, including clubs, lances, arrows, shields,  pipes, and a quiver and bowcase. Later, following several years as a  visiting scholar at Harvard, he was a curator of an exhibit at the  Peabody Museum on Lakota images of the West. One of his horse memorial  effigy replicas is in the permanent collection at the Nelson Atkins  Museum in Kansas City, and two major art pieces are on display at the  James Monroe House in Charlottesville, VA. One of his ornaments  featuring a bison was displayed on the White House Christmas Tree in  2008.   He has said creating art and teaching honors his ancestors, his  family, his students, and other artist friends. He considers it a  privilege to share Lakota traditions with students and help them grow  their appreciation of this art.   When I heard the news that Butch Thunder Hawk was retiring from  teaching, I smiled. In previous positions I held that included  promoting all that is good about North Dakota, Butch was at the very  top of the list of our State's most treasured cultural ambassadors. A  humble, personable,  [[Page S2329]]  and honorable man, he was generous in sharing his talents and work.  Butch embodies all that is good about North Dakota and the rich  traditions of the Tribal nations located in our State. His work and  influence will resonate in his students for generations to come. On  behalf of the people of North Dakota, I thank him for his years of  teaching. And I wish him the best in his retirement, which I am certain  will include creating more art and influencing many more  people.                            ____________________
