 Mr. Speaker, this past week, I was appalled to see the  massive illegal immigration camp in Del Rio, Texas.   This single camp, which has garnered so much attention, has been shut  off from even being monitored by the media, yet it does not represent  even 10 percent of the total border violations this month.   The United States is currently recording the highest number of border  arrests in over 20 years. We hit 1 million arrests by June of this  year, and at least 420,000 more have arrived since then.   The problem is not exclusively about immigrants being forced from  their homes. Illegal immigration fuels the drug trade and human  trafficking. To stop this, we need to hire more immigration officers,  build better infrastructure along the border, and create a more secure  immigration process.   Unfortunately, in this Chamber, we are more willing to throw billions  at high-speed rail projects and environmental mandates, even build  better fences around the Capitol than we have on some portions of the  border. We can't muster the courage to roll even a single dime toward  the southern border and its improved security.   If the priorities of this House and the rhetoric of the Biden  administration officials continue down this path, then the wave of  illegal immigration will only get worse.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, Israel is arguably our most reliable ally  in the  [[Page H5114]]  world; indeed, a beacon of light and a beacon of democracy in the  Middle East. So I don't understand how we could not work earlier this  week to help them, to support them.   Well, I am glad today we could come together on both sides of the  aisle and come to an agreement on this with strong support via this  resolution. I visited Israel several times. And when you visit with the  people there and talk with them, there are people that live their lives  under a 15-second warning for when rockets may come in at random from  anywhere in the zones that are near where the rockets are launched  from, whether it is Gaza, or whether it is up north in Lebanon. What a  way to live a life.   For us to not be able to come to an agreement because of politics  earlier this week, is really sad. So I am glad for our colleagues on  both sides of the aisle to come to an agreement today and get strong  votes for this to support Iron Dome, which is a defensive mechanism,  technology that both us in the United States and Israel benefit from in  making all of our interests stronger. I am glad we can have the support  today and get it right.
