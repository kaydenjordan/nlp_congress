 Mr. President, this week we are considering a bill to  roll back the rules on some of the biggest banks in the country. Over  the course of this week, I am going to be spending a lot of time on the  Senate floor talking about the problems with this bill and how it  threatens working families and American taxpayers, but I want to start  by looking back to 2008 and the reason we have these rules in the first  place.   Ten years ago next week, Americans started holding our breaths. For  years, financial institutions had been riding high, selling dangerous  products to consumers, and making risky bets. All the while, Washington  looked the other way, cozying up to big banks, loosening rules left and  right, and shrugging off rules they couldn't get rid of. And no  wonder--the revolving door was spinning like crazy. Bank officials  became regulators and then went back to the banks, getting richer and  richer. Bank profits were sky high and getting higher.   But business built on scams and hype can't grow forever. Ten years  ago this month, Bear Stearns, an 85-year-old institution on Wall  Street, went belly up because of $46 billion in scam mortgages and  other questionable investments on its books. The failure gave the rest  of the world a glimpse of Wall Street's addiction to risky bets. The  disease spread. It turned out that a lot of other banks had invested  heavily in scam mortgages too. Investors panicked, sending the markets  into a nosedive.   When the American economy fell off a cliff in 2008, American families  got crushed. Almost 9 million people lost their jobs. Workers lost $2.6  trillion from their retirement accounts--about 25 percent of their  savings for someone who had been working for 20 years. In 2008 alone,  foreclosures spiked 81 percent, and 3.1 million notices went out to  homeowners across the country telling them they would lose their homes.  In a single year, 1 out of 54 homes in the United States was in  foreclosure.   Behind those enormous numbers were real people and real families  whose lives were shaken up and turned upside down, little kids who  worried about where they were going to live, and bigger kids who  worried about whether they would lose their chance to go to college.   I know that feeling. I lived in Oklahoma City, and my folks had  picked out our house because it was right inside the boundary line of  what my mother believed was the best school district in the county. Our  lives seemed to be on track right up until the day my daddy had a heart  attack, and then it all started sliding sideways. He was out of work  for a very long time.   My mother usually picked me up from school in our bronze, two-toned  station wagon, and one day she showed up driving the old, off-white  Studebaker that daddy had been driving back and forth to work. As I  climbed into the car, I asked where our station wagon was.   It is gone.   Gone where?   Gone.   I just kept pushing. My mother was staring straight ahead, fingers  tight on the steering wheel, and after one more ``Where?'' from me, she  answered in a low voice: We couldn't pay. They took it.   The house was next in line. My family was right on the brink of  foreclosure when my mom put on her best dress, walked into the Sears,  and landed a minimum-wage job. But that feeling--the feeling of being  on the brink, the feeling of no security, nothing under your feet--is a  feeling no family in this country should have, especially not have it  because Congress decided it was OK to let the big banks gamble with the  economy again. Yet here we are, on the verge of making the same mistake  Congress has made so many times before.    The banks don't want you to know what is in this bill because if you  did know, you would fight back. It was written by Senators in back  rooms and jammed through the Banking Committee, where its authors voted  down every single amendment, every single idea to make the bill even  one smidgen better or protect consumers just one tiny bit more. They  voted against every amendment, even if they agreed with it, because  Republicans and Democrats had locked arms to do the bidding of the big  banks.   There is a lot of dangerous stuff in this bill. Today I want to focus  on the harm it will do to America's consumers, but I will start with  what is not in the bill because what is not in the bill should make  Congress ashamed. Strong consumer protections--that is what is not in  this bill. Banks get their wish list, but consumers get next to  nothing. This bill is called the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief,  and Consumer Protection Act, but in all 148 pages, there are only a few  watered-down provisions to help consumers.   Equifax loses data for nearly half of all adults in America, lies  about it, and this Congress, these Senators, still can't manage to pass  a bill with some teeth in it to hold the company accountable. That says  it all.   This bill was written by big banks to help big banks. It is not a  bill to help American families who are still getting cheated by the  companies that make huge profits off them.   What is actually in this bill? Start with the first part of the bill,  section 101, ``Improving Consumer Access to Mortgage Credit.'' When you  get a mortgage, usually your lender spends some time combing through  your financial records to make sure you can repay the loan. That is  good. American families don't want to take out loans they can't afford,  and banks don't want to make loans that can't be repaid.   Before the financial crisis, that whole process went haywire. Lenders  were making crazy loans with balloon payments and exotic features that  consumers didn't understand. Lenders didn't care if their customers  could repay. Why? Because they got their fees up front and then sold  the loans to distant investors, and the original lender was long gone  before the homeowner got in trouble. But the families were stuck.  Eventually, the payments skyrocketed, and homeowners who couldn't keep  up defaulted and lost their homes.   After the crisis, Congress changed the rules. They told lenders that  they had to start underwriting their loans again to protect consumers  and the economy. But that takes time and money, so Congress told the  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to write a rule that says that  there is no need to investigate if the lender knows that it is issuing  a super-safe, boring, plain-vanilla loan. OK. That sounds reasonable.  But section 101 of this bill is not reasonable. It takes the CFPB rule  and stretches it in all directions, tearing open big, dangerous  loopholes. This bill that is on the floor says: Banks, have some fun  out there. It says: Bring back the greatest hits of the financial  crisis housing scams. Scoop up profits on the front end, and leave  families holding the bag on the back end.   I understand breaks for banks that make straightforward loans, but  these loans in this bill are too risky and they come at a bad time.  Rising interest rates mean that exotic products like adjustable rate  mortgages are starting to make a comeback. Bank lobbyists are dragging  us back to the bad old days when banks had free reign to scam their  customers.   Here is another section. Section 104 makes it harder to enforce anti- discrimination laws by telling loads of institutions that they don't  have to comply with a law called the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, or  HMDA. HMDA requires most financial institutions to tell the public and  the CFPB who they are lending to and at what rates and what terms.  Regulators and law enforcement then use that data to make sure that  American families don't have a harder time getting one of those loans  because of who they are or where they come from.   This bill takes a sledgehammer to HMDA by exempting 85 percent of  banks from reporting HMDA data. If this bill passes, there will be  entire communities in America where there will be no data whatsoever,  which means there will be no ability to monitor whether people are  getting cheated because of their race or their gender.   Once again, this couldn't come at a worse time. Lending  discrimination is real. A new, comprehensive report that  [[Page S1364]]  looked at housing markets all across the country just came out from the  Center for Investigative Reporting and Reveal, and its findings should  make us all sick to our stomachs.   In 2015 and 2016, nearly two-thirds of mortgage lenders denied loans  to people of color at higher rates than for White people. According to  Reveal, in the Washington metro area, ``in 2016, Native American  applicants were 2.3 times as likely to be denied a conventional home  mortgage as white applicants. For black applicants, it was 2.2 times as  likely. For Latino applicants, it was 1.9 times as likely. For Asian  applicants, it was 1.6 times as likely.   The Reveal report showed that this problem happens in giant banks and  also in small banks.   Here is the thing: None of that analysis--none of it--would have been  possible without HMDA data from big institutions and small ones.  Without the data, we would all be sitting in the dark, wondering if  maybe some mortgage lenders discriminated against African Americans or  women or Native Americans, but we wouldn't have any way to know. That  means we wouldn't have any way to change it if it was happening.  Gutting HMDA allows us--actually forces us--to look the other way when  discrimination happens, and that is disgraceful.   There is one more section in this bill that really hurts consumers;  that is, section 107, ``Protecting Access to Manufactured Homes.''  Eighteen million Americans live in manufactured homes. Many are low- income, elderly, or disabled. It is a good option for many Americans,  especially in rural areas, but it is very important to make sure buyers  don't get scammed.    Under today's law, mortgage lenders cannot steer a borrower toward a  higher cost loan so the lender can get a kickback. That is the law  today but not if this bill passes. Instead, the rules for mobile home  lenders will be weaker rules, and that means it will be much easier to  cheat buyers of mobile homes.   Congress imposed strict requirements on loan originators because  Congress knew most of us don't buy a lot of homes in our lifetime, and  we rely on the people helping us through the process to tell it  straight. Owners of mobile homes deserve the same protection as people  who buy brick-and-mortar homes. They need that protection.   Abusive lending practices are rampant in the manufactured housing  industry. In 2015, the Seattle Times wrote about Kirk and Patricia  Ackley in Ephrata, WA. Kirk worked construction, and Patricia worked at  Walmart. They had already bought the foundation for their new mobile  home when they sat down to close on their mortgage. What happened at  closing? Surprise. The interest rate was higher than they had been  told, and the payments were larger than they could afford. The mortgage  broker then convinced them to go ahead and sign up anyway, promising  that they could refinance that loan later on.   You can probably guess the end of the story. The Ackleys signed, the  lender wouldn't refinance, they lost all the money they had put in up  front, and they lost their home. It turns out that the homebuilder, the  dealer, and the mortgage lender--all three of them--were owned by one  company, Clayton Homes. All the incentives were to push the Ackleys  into a loan they couldn't afford because Clayton got the purchase  price, the commissions, and the fees, and they got the mobile home back  again. No one was looking out for the Ackleys.   The backers of this bill say that this provision will help small  lenders, but the truth is that manufactured home lending is mostly done  by giant lenders like Clayton. In fact, in 2013, Clayton alone--one  company--provided 39 percent of mobile home loans. Savings from rolling  back these consumer protections would go right out of the pockets of  working families like the Ackleys and right into the pockets of dealers  like Clayton.   The Ackleys' story is not unique. I wish it were. These same problems  happen all over the country, and they are exacerbated by the special  characteristics of mobile homes. The lifespan of a manufactured home is  shorter than a traditional home. That means the purchaser may not be  able to take out equity by reselling it.   A woman from Oklahoma told the CFPB:         I was given a loan for a single width mobile home through       [a mortgage company]. They switched it to Green Tree and next       to Ditech. The home started deteriorating in 10 years and is       now unsafe to live in, as I have had electrical problems and       many of the pipes are broken where the bathtub and faucets in       the master bathroom are not functioning. The floor under the       shower has completely caved in, windows are crooked and allow       flies to get into the house in warm weather. Most of the       floors have buckled under the legs of furniture, and the rain       has caused the areas around the windows to buckle. Walls are       little more than cardboard. I believe the flooring is       waferboard and unfit for floor foundation.        When I tried to trade this [model], the dealer [] told me       he couldn't because the house is worth much less than what I       owe and that this sounded like a Predatory Mortgage Loan. He       said that mobile homes do not have 30 year mortgages because       they don't last that long. He said my loan should have been a       15 year loan at the most. Also, right before Ditech took the       predatory loan over, they added about $100.00 to my monthly       payments, which went from $360.00 to $460.00 a month.       Ditech claims the $100.00 is for insurance; however, as of       yet they have repaired nothing, although I have made several       claims.        I was also told I should complain because when they put the       mobile home on my property, they did not put it on a cement       foundation and instead put it on the ground, which has caused       the home to sink.    This bill is designed to make it easier for the lender/dealer to  squeeze people like this woman from Oklahoma.   This bill is a punch in the gut to American consumers. If it passes,  it will be harder to police banks that sell abusive mortgages, harder  to police lenders who discriminate against their customers, and harder  to police giant monopolies that build, sell, and offer financing to  mobile home buyers. Only a bunch of bank lobbyists and their friends in  Washington would call this a consumer protection bill.   American families weren't in the back room when this bill was  written. They don't have millions of dollars in campaign cash to get  Senators' attention. They don't keep an army of lobbyists on their  payroll. No. American families are busy going to work, helping the kids  with homework, and trying to catch up on a thousand things. They are  trying to pay off student loans or maybe save a little for their own  kids to go to college. Some are trying to put aside a few bucks for a  mortgage so they can buy a home. They trust us to stand up for them and  make sure they have a fair shot at home ownership, at the American  dream. They trust us to make sure we are not turning over the keys to  our economy to the same people who crashed it 10 years ago and ran over  a bunch of American families on the way.   I know we are outnumbered, but this fight isn't over. Make no  mistake--I am going to do whatever I can to convince enough other  Senators that this is a bad deal for American families and a dangerous  one. I will push and I will tug and I will talk to anyone who will  listen about how this bill will hurt the people we were sent here to  represent. And maybe, just maybe, for once, the Senate will start  listening to voters instead of donors.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
