 Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Neal for yielding. The Inflation  Reduction Act was a huge step toward lowering healthcare costs and  energy costs for families all across the country and creating new jobs  in my home State of Michigan.   It was fully paid for by making sure the biggest corporations and the  wealthiest individuals paid their fair share in taxes.   This funding for the Internal Revenue Service helps ensure that it  has the resources to go after those wealthy taxpayers that are avoiding  paying their fair share.   It is simply not fair that billionaires like Elon Musk and massive  companies like Amazon have paid less in Federal income taxes some years  than a Bay City teacher, a Saginaw nurse, or a Midland factory worker.   Further, the Inflation Reduction Act is helping to fight inflation,  bringing down costs for Americans.   With this bill, Republicans are trying to roll back these efforts to  fight inflation.   A vote against the motion to recommit that I will offer is a vote  against the Inflation Reduction Act.   Today, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said this bill  will add $114 billion to the national deficit.   This is the first order of business for this majority.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to add the text of this  amendment in the Record immediately prior to the vote on the motion to  recommit.  [[Page H89]]     Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.
