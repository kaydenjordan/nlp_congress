 I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call  be rescinded.    Mr. President, according to ProPublica reporting, a Purdue  student from China, Zhihao Kong, who goes by the nickname ``Moody,''  wrote a letter condemning the Chinese Communist Party for killing  dissidents in Tiananmen Square in 1989.   We all know the famous image of the man who stood courageously, not  in front of one tank--most of the images that ran in U.S. newspapers  were of one guy standing in front of a tank. And if you just look at  that image, you can assume that the tank commander is some nutjob who  decided he was going to torment this kid. But if you actually look at  the image, as you can through U.S. photo archives, and you pan back  out, that first tank is one tank in a long, long, long, long line of  tanks coming that this man stands courageously in front of. It is not  one nutjob tank commander looking at this guy in Tiananmen Square; it  is an autocratic government that is scared to death of the courage of  free people. And that man stood there courageously as the Chinese  Communist Party was murdering students in Tiananmen Square.   The Purdue graduate student, Moody, decided to write an open letter  about that reminding students in America and around the world of what  happened in Tiananmen Square.   Well, guess what happened next. After Moody published his essay,  China's secret police decided to go visit his family and intimidate  them so that they might put pressure on him, asking him, commanding  him, coercing him, twisting the arms of his parents and loved ones, to  stop talking about the truth, about what happened in Tiananmen Square  in June of 1989.   When Mr. Kong refused to back down, other Chinese students at  Purdue--not Chinese students in Beijing, Chinese graduate students at  Purdue--decided that it was their obligation to harass Mr. Kong. They  pursued him around campus, and they threatened to report him to the  Chinese Embassy. Think about that for a second.   What do we think about Embassies as for? Two hundred countries around  the face of the Earth, and when you are traveling and you have a lost  passport or you suffer some, you know, petty crime or you have a family  member who has a medical emergency back home, you call up your Embassy  for help because you think these are people who love you. You are in a  foreign place and you don't maybe speak the language and the Embassy is  there to help you navigate a world where you might not know the  language, the laws, or the customs.   What happened in the United States--a freedom-loving place--is that  these Chinese students, Chinese nationals here in school at Purdue,  decided that they thought it might be their job to contact the Chinese  Embassy to tattle on Mr. Kong because the man had the courage to tell  the truth. He had spoken online. He had written online. He had been  involved in dissident events.   So what happened then, besides his parents being harassed by the  Chinese secret police and besides graduate students following him  around campus to intimidate him and threaten to report him to the  Embassy, WeChat decided that they needed to block and suspend his  account to cut off his communications with the outside world.   A few days before he was scheduled to speak at a Zoom commemoration  of the Tiananmen Square massacre, the secret police went to visit his  parents again, reminding them that they needed to make sure he put an  end to his activism--read ``truth-telling.''   It is convenient for Americans to look the other way and stay silent  in the face of this. We have seen many American professional sports  leagues; we have seen Hollywood companies lusting after Chinese middle- class markets; we have seen the Marriott hotel chain agreeing to  intimidate their own employees so that their employees didn't  acknowledge what has happened in Hong Kong and the threats currently  against Taiwan; we have seen this censorship using economic statecraft  from Beijing to intimidate Americans and American companies and  American institutions to do their bidding to suppress people who might  tell the truth.   It is convenient to stay silent. Many of our institutions have  pathetically agreed with Beijing that they would self-censor at  Beijing's and Chairman Xi's bidding.   Well, guess who didn't do that. Purdue University decided they were  not going to do that.   So there is a lot of bad stuff happening in the world because of the  expansionistic desires of the CCP, and we have a lot of Americans and  American institutions who are willing to be complicit in the CCP's  desired expansionism, but Purdue didn't. So we should pause today, just  for a minute, and celebrate that good news. We should celebrate that  courage.   Mitch Daniels, former Governor of Indiana, current President of  Purdue, decided that this was not OK, and it was important to tell the  truth about this fact, what had happened, and that this wasn't OK.   I would like to read into the Congressional Record today President  Daniels' letter to the Purdue campus 36 hours ago because we need a  hell of a lot more truth-telling like this in American life. Here is  Mitch Daniels and the Purdue leadership on behalf of not just Purdue  but American values:         Dear Purdue students, staff and faculty,        Purdue [has] learned from a national news account last week       that one of our students, after speaking out on behalf of       freedom and others martyred for advocating for [freedom], was       harassed and threatened by other students from his own home       country [in this country]. Worse still, [this student's]       family back home, in this case [the home being] China, was       visited and threatened by agents of that nation's secret       police.        We regret that we were unaware at the time of these events       and [we] had to learn of them from national sources. That       reflects the atmosphere of intimidation that we have       discovered [surrounding] this specific sort of speech.        Any such intimidation is unacceptable and [it is] unwelcome       on our campus. Purdue has punished less personal, direct and       threatening conduct. Anyone taking exception to the speech in       question had their own right to express their disagreement,       but not to engage in the actions of harassment which occurred       here. If those students who issued the threats can be       identified, they will be subject to appropriate disciplinary       action. Likewise, any student found to have reported another       student to any foreign entity for exercising their freedom of       speech or belief will be subject to significant [action].        International students are nothing new at Purdue       University, which welcomed its first Asian admittees over a       century ago. We are proud that several hundred international       students, nearly 200 of them [from China], enrolled [at       Purdue] again this fall.        But joining the Purdue community requires acceptance of       [our] rules and values, and no value is more central to our       institution or to higher education generally than the freedom       of inquiry and expression. Those seeking to deny those       rights to others, let alone to collude with foreign       governments in repressing them, will need to pursue their       education elsewhere.        Sincerely,        Mitch    Chairman Xi is a coward, and he sends his goons to intimidate people  for telling the truth. That is who Chairman Xi is. He doesn't believe  in the dignity of people. He doesn't believe that they are image- bearers of God. He doesn't believe they have the rights of free speech,  religion, press, assembly, and protest. He believes that you must  intimidate college students for telling the truth. If they are saying  something to a small group of people 6,000 miles away, Chairman Xi is  intimidated, and he is scared.   That student told the truth. We should celebrate that student. Mitch  Daniels and Purdue University stood up to that kind of intimidation. We  should celebrate that because that is what American courage looks like,  and we need a whole hell of a lot more of it.
