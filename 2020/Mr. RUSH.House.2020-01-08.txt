 Mr. Speaker, it is my distinct honor and privilege to come  before the House this evening to celebrate the memory of a major  trailblazer in our Nation, one who was a fierce crusader for justice  and equality, an American who was a quiet man, with a quiet demeanor,  but a giant in terms of his accomplishments, his courage, and the  things he did not only for his local constituency, the city of Gary,  Indiana, but the African American community and America at large.   Mr. Speaker, I am speaking of the one and only, the first Black mayor  of Gary, Indiana, Mayor Richard Gordon Hatcher.   Sadly, Mayor Hatcher passed away at the age of 86 on the 13th of  December, 2019. Although he is no longer with us, his legacy lives on.  His legacy, his work, his love, his sacrifices continue to be felt in  these very Halls of Congress, throughout the city hall of Gary,  Indiana, and indeed, throughout these State legislative halls, these  halls of municipal governments in cities all across this Nation.   Mayor Hatcher was one who carved and made a way for African Americans  who are elected officials even to this very day. When Mayor Hatcher was  first elected mayor of Gary, Indiana, there were but few elected  officials of African American descent in the Nation, but there now  exists over 10,000 African American elected officials. In some  supernatural sense, because of the hard work, the insight, the courage,  and the commitment of Mayor Hatcher, his sterling example, we all stand  on the shoulders of Mayor Richard Gordon Hatcher.   Mayor Hatcher's surprise victory over the political machine in Gary,  Indiana, in 1967 was indeed a watershed moment for Black political  participation in this Nation. Along with the election of Mayor Carl  Stokes, the first African American mayor of Cleveland, Ohio, Mayor  Hatcher became the first Black mayor of a major U.S. city, the city of  Gary, Indiana.   Mr. Speaker, in his two decades of service as Gary's mayor, Mayor  Hatcher fought valiantly in his beloved Gary and throughout his beloved  Nation for fair political representation for those whose voices had  been previously dismissed, disregarded, and downright ignored for most  of American history.   When Mayor Hatcher was elected to lead a deeply segregated Gary,  Indiana, only two of the city's department heads were African  Americans, in a city that was actually over 50 percent African  American. Within 10 years of Mayor Hatcher's tenure as mayor, 25 of  Gary's 40 department heads were African Americans.   Finally, Mr. Speaker, those who worked for Gary's government began to  look more like Gary's citizens, those who were supposed to be working  on behalf of the citizens of Gary, Indiana.   As mayor of Gary, Mayor Hatcher worked very closely with his  congressional delegation and the Democratic administration in the White  House. He secured millions of dollars in Federal funding for job  training programs for Gary's citizens and subsidized housing for Gary's  citizens, building up a vibrant economy in his beloved city of Gary,  similarly and singlehandedly, in some instances, ensuring that those  communities that were previously underserved received their fair share  of city services, Federal funding, and Federal dollars.   Mayor Hatcher's herculean efforts to ensure fair representation  extended far beyond Gary. As a young man, I was inspired and intrigued  by the electoral and political processes and systems because of the  tenure, political career, and outstanding accomplishments of Mayor  Richard Hatcher.   Mayor Hatcher was a visionary, a man who not only talked the talk,  but he walked the walk. On the streets of Gary, he was highly visible.   With all of that, his vision even surpassed and transcended Gary. In  1972, he organized the inaugural and historic National Black Political  Convention in Gary. I was there. I attended. I saw it in action. This  National Black Political Convention convened with two goals:  establishing an independent Black political agenda and electing more  Black officials to public office. Never before, not at any time, had  this been done.   Over 8,000 individual American citizens attended this historic  occasion, including some who are icons even today in our Nation,  including Reverend Jesse Louis Jackson, Coretta Scott King, Betty  Shabazz, Bobby Seale, and my colleague from Chicago, Congressman Danny  K. Davis. Many, many others were involved, inspired, educated, and  learned the value of the vote and heard for the first time that a  voteless people is a hopeless people, all because of the single vision  of this one American giant, Mayor Richard Gordon Hatcher.   Mr. Speaker, I am honored and humbled to speak in this well about  this giant of a man, telling all who have a listening ear and a seeing  eye about the work of Mayor Hatcher and that historic National Black  Political Convention. It was not just fighting the windmills, Don  Quixote-like. It produced results.   At the time of this convention, there were just 14 African American  Members of Congress, just 14. Today, there are 56 African American  Members of Congress, 56 living and breathing, hardworking Members of  this Congress who are a result of the vision of Mayor Hatcher and who  were inspired by his life and what he had accomplished.   He was our inspiration. He gave all of us an exceedingly high  standard that we live by even today.                                time  1830    Mayor Richard Gordon Hatcher spurred a wave of Black civic  participation that reverberated all throughout America. In 1973, just 1  year, 365 days, after the Gary convention, Detroit elected its first  African American mayor, Mayor Coleman Young, Atlanta elected its first  African American mayor, Mayor Maynard Jackson, and Los Angeles elected  its first African American mayor, Mayor Tom Bradley. All across this  Nation, major cities all across this Nation saw a witness, and  participated and celebrated the election of mayors in major cities all  across this Nation.   The legacy, the inspiration, the example, the instruction just didn't  stop in 1973. Even some 10 years later,  [[Page H57]]  Mayor Harold Washington was elected mayor of the city of Chicago  following the Gary model.   Congressman Davis and I were on the front lines in Mayor Washington's  election. He challenged us to register 50,000 new voters, and we rose  up to the challenge, a la just like being cognizant of what was going  on in Gary, Indiana.   That voter registration, that election rocked the entrenched Chicago  political establishment, political machine. The renowned Richard J.  Daley's Democratic machine was overturned in 1983, inspired in no small  respect by Mayor Richard Gordon Hatcher in the city of Gary, Indiana.   It just didn't stop there, Mr. Speaker. The story didn't end there.  It kept developing, it kept materializing. The civic awakening that was  started in Gary, Indiana, with the election in 1967 of Mayor Hatcher,  which ensued with the election of Mayor Harold Washington, inspired a  young man who was living in Los Angeles to move to Chicago, Gary's  neighbor. He wanted to be a part of what was going on in Chicago, in  Gary, Indiana, in urban areas, and major cities throughout the Nation.  It inspired him, a young law student named Barack Obama, to move to  Chicago, to the south side of Chicago to start community organizing and  ultimately to become a State senator from the State of Illinois, then  to become the U.S. Senator from the State of Illinois, and then finally  to become President of these United States.   So in no uncertain terms, the overwhelming outstanding achievements,  the miraculously determined achievements of Mayor Richard Gordon  Hatcher led to the election of Barack Obama as President of the United  States.   Mayor Hatcher was pivotal in Reverend Jesse Jackson's transcendent  1984 and 1988 Presidential campaigns.   In 1988, Mayor Hatcher served as his campaign vice chairman, and  Reverend Jackson in that historic campaign earned over 6.7 million  votes and Reverend Jackson, through the hard work and the inspiration  of Mayor Richard Gordon Hatcher, won 11 primary contests.   You can't undervalue, underestimate how important that was. This  happened before the election of Barack Obama.   We all stand indebted to Richard Gordon Hatcher and his life, the  life that he lived and the life that he led.   Mayor Hatcher's victory was a clarion call to all of us who aspired  and are inspired to serve as elected officials in our Nation.   If we work hard, harness the imagination, speak to the real need of  our constituents, we could also raise our voices in the spirit of  equity and fairness, justice; that we could all stand not only in the  well of the Congress, but in the State houses, in the city halls of our  Nation and of States and municipalities all over this country, even in  the White House.   We miss Mayor Hatcher. We will miss his counsel.   Again, he was a man who was not a self-promoter. He was quiet, in  some sense professorial, in some sense laid back, but a mighty, mighty,  mighty, mighty warrior, a mighty man, a giant.   I am just grateful for all that he has done for this Nation, all that  he has done for poor people all across this Nation, for the middle  class all across this Nation, all that he has done for African  Americans not only in Gary, and certainly in Gary, but in Chicago, Los  Angeles, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Detroit, other places all  across this Nation.   He inspired young people, young professionals to look at public  service as being an honorable pursuit, an honorable career, profession,  and get in there and do something not just for yourself, but do  something for your Nation, for your community, and for people who need  a voice, those who are voiceless.   In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, I want to extend my condolences to Mayor  Hatcher's family, his wife, Ruthellyn, his daughters, and let them know  that our prayers are with them, and their loss is great, our loss is  great. We lost a friend, we lost a colleague, we lost a champion, but  in some sense, we lost someone who was a steadfast, rock solid  inspiration to us all.    We mourn the loss of this American giant, former Mayor Richard Gordon  Hatcher.   With that, Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr.  Visclosky), a gentleman who represents the city of Gary right now,  another man of unmatched wisdom and intellect, the chairman of the  Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense, and my friend and colleague.    Mr. Speaker, I certainly thank the gentleman from Indiana  for his candid remarks, and he also stands in the wonderful splendor of  Mayor Hatcher's legacy and of his work and his commitment to public  service.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Danny K.  Davis), who is my colleague, my true friend, my coconspirator.    Mr. Speaker, as I close this significant moment in the  annals of this Congress, let me just say to the family of Mayor Hatcher  once again, as I reflect on my public career, as I reflect on all of us  who are public officials who represent African American communities, as  I reflect on all public officials, but particularly those of us who  have historically been denied the opportunity to serve, I want to thank  this wonderful man for giving me and others the audacity: the audacity  to act, to believe, to run, to get elected, to lead.   Mr. Speaker, I give thanks to Mayor Hatcher for showing us the way to  contribute, to add our voices to the plight of those who are seeking  the American Dream, and for giving us the audacity, the audacity to  act.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
