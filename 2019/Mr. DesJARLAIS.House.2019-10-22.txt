 Madam Speaker, today I rise in protest of the secrecy  with which the House majority is conducting its impeachment inquiry. It  is unlike anything we have seen in Congress. That is probably because,  lacking any evidence for their claims, the so-called resistance has  already determined the outcome. The same people who perpetrated the  Russia hoax are rushing forward with plan Z to remove the President  from office.   Partisan congressional staff helped to craft the specious complaint  at the heart of this impeachment inquiry. The inquiry itself will take  place in secret to avoid public scrutiny.   Some Democrats have admitted that the only way a far left socialist  candidate could replace Donald Trump is to remove him from office.   The American people want jobs, affordable healthcare, and security,  not far left socialist agendas. But with nothing else to offer, a  radical group in Congress has become obsessed with removing this  President from office. It is an attack on our democracy and our  Constitution.   Madam Speaker, my constituents care about real issues. I appeal to  more sensible Members to stop this abuse of power and concentrate on  what we can accomplish together.                            ____________________
