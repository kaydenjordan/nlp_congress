 Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, we are here talking about how to take politics out of  our infrastructure. As we just heard the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gene  Green), this is a bipartisan bill. We hear a lot of stuff about it  damaging the environment; it doesn't. We are talking about crossing a  border and taking a situation that was held up for 8 years with the  Keystone pipeline and making sure it has the transparent and consistent  approach on how we regulate these permits.   The United States is a powerhouse around the world. We want to keep  it that way. We want our country to compete freely in the global market  and continue to positively benefit our economy. My bill, H.R. 2883, the  Promoting Cross-Border Energy Infrastructure Act, supports the  construction of energy infrastructure across our North America borders.   Simply put, this bill takes the politics out of energy infrastructure  projects. The construction of these border-crossing facilities should  be done effectively and efficiently without getting caught up in our  Nation's politics. These facilities are used for importing and  exporting oil, natural gas, and electricity that enhance the trade of  our energy products that benefit our economy.   This bipartisan piece of legislation allows a transparent and  efficient process to be followed the same way every time and for every  project. Most importantly, it provides regulatory certainty to those  charged with carrying out these projects. I want to thank this House  for allowing such bills to come forth and the opportunity to allow this  bill to be heard.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, as you have heard, two of my colleagues  from Texas have just come out, obviously, in support of this bill.  There is not a lot that Texas and Oklahoma agree on, especially this  time of the year when we enter football season. Other than that, we  agree that Oklahoma is better at football than Texas.    I yield to the gentleman.    Mr. Chairman, I include in the Record a letter from the  International Union of Operating Engineers, a letter from Edison  Electric Institute, a letter from the IOSA, and a letter from the  Plains All American Pipeline all in support of this bill.           International Union of Operating Engineers, Affiliated             with the American Federation of Labor and Congress of             Industrial Organizations,                                                     July 18, 2017.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker of the House, Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Minority Leader, Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan and Leader Pelosi: The International       Union of Operating Engineers (IUOE) supports H.R. 2883, the       Cross-Border Energy Infrastructure Act, legislation that       provides clear congressional authority to the process of       evaluating transnational pipeline projects. Further, the IUOE       endorses H.R. 2910, a bill Promoting Inter-Agency       Coordination for Review of Natural Gas Pipelines Act.        We respectfully request that you support both of these       pieces of legislation when they come to the floor of the       House of Representatives this week.        The International Union of Operating Engineers represents       400,000 working men and women in the United States and       Canada, thousands of whom build and maintain the nation's       energy infrastructure. We are one of four unions that are       signatory to the National Pipeline Agreement. Operating       Engineers perform millions of hours of work on pipeline       projects around the United States every year; millions of       additional hours were performed on pipeline work by IUOE       members in Canada.        North America's energy network is inextricably linked.       Eliminating legal and regulatory uncertainty regarding the       permitting of cross-border energy facilities will promote       investment and job creation in North America, and that is why       the IUOE supports H.R. 2883. Removing these regulatory       barriers will ultimately increase the interconnection of the       North American energy network and at the same time improve       reliability, security, and affordability.        Today, the process for permitting this energy       infrastructure lives only through Executive Order. North       America's energy future is simply too important to leave to       the ambiguity and imprecision of administrative fiat.  [[Page H6013]]       Granting clear legislative authority and delegating       responsibility to an agency experienced with the National       Environmental Policy Act and permitting processes, the       Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), rather than the       Department of State, will increase the competency and       capacity of the review of cross-border energy projects. It is       a clear improvement in the administration of major project       permitting.        Updating the American domestic permitting and regulatory       framework for natural-gas pipelines is also essential.       Several steps are necessary in this regard, and H.R. 2910 is       one of them. Domestic energy production provides good-paying       jobs for members of the IUOE and other construction       craftworkers and continues to employ thousands of our       members. Uncertainty and delay during environmental reviews,       however, hinder the growth of jobs related to the nation's       energy infrastructure. Congress should give FERC additional       tools to keep federal agencies accountable and maximize       coordination in the permitting process.        H.R. 2910 requires reporting and transparency in the review       of major projects. These requirements raise the bar for       regulators and provides the public with a better       understanding of the environmental impacts that are receiving       particular rigor and examination--or perhaps needlessly       delaying the overall project-review timeline. Democrats and       Republicans supported similar reporting and transparency in       the FAST Act. Enactment of H.R. 2910 is a necessary step to       help place the booming energy sector on a sound footing for       the future.        The International Union of Operating Engineers supports       both H.R. 2883 and H.R. 2910 and respectfully requests that       you support the legislation this week when it comes before       you.        Thank you for your consideration.            Sincerely,                                                 James T. Callahan,      General President.                                   ____                                        Edison Electric Institute,                                                      July 18, 2017.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan and Minority Leader Pelosi: The Edison       Electric Institute supports H.R. 2883, the Promoting Cross-      Border Energy Infrastructure Act, which is scheduled for       floor action this week.        Timely decisions for the siting and permitting of energy       infrastructure are essential to building the smarter and more       resilient infrastructure that electric companies need to       deliver reliable, affordable, safe, and increasingly clean       energy to Americans. H.R. 2883 would replace the need for a       presidential permit for transmission lines or pipelines that       cross a U.S. border with a certificate of crossing to be       approved by the Department of Energy for electric       transmission facilities, or the Federal Energy Regulatory       Commission for oil or natural gas pipelines. The National       Environmental Policy Act and other federal laws that apply to       the project would not be affected.        H.R. 2883 would improve the process for decisions on cross-      border projects while protecting the public's interest in       such projects. We urge the House to pass H.R. 2883.            Sincerely,                                                    Thomas R. Kuhn,      President.                                   ____                                                             IOSA,                                                      June 19, 2017.      Rep. Fred Upton,      Chairman, Energy Subcommittee,      Washington, DC.      Rep. Bobby Rush,      Ranking Member,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Upton and Ranking Member Rush: The In Situ       Oil Sands Alliance (IOSA) offers strong support for the       Promoting Cross-Border Energy Infrastructure Act reintroduced       by Congressman Markwayne Mullin (R-OK) and Congressman Gene       Green (D-TX) and urges you to back its timely passage. IOSA       is an alliance of Canadian oil sands developers dedicated to       the responsible development of the resource using drilling       technologies. We support this legislation as it establishes       greater predictability in the process of developing       additional energy transportation links between our two       countries which will serve a critical role in continuing       towards North American energy independence and reducing       dependence on unstable overseas suppliers. These links will       help to ensure that growing Canadian oil sands production       remains a secure, affordable, environmentally responsible and       economically beneficial source of supply for the United       States.        Historically, Canada and the United States have enjoyed a       mutually beneficial energy trade relationship. The Canadian       oil sands provide substantial economic benefits to U.S.--for       every two oil sands jobs created in Canada, one job is       created in the U.S. Nearly 1,600 U.S. companies directly       supply the oil sands, representing $1.9 billion in sales in       2014 and 2015. Canada is the United States' most trusted       trading partner, providing 41% of U.S. oil imports in 2016.        Canada's oil sands represent the third largest reserves in       the world and are well-positioned to provide a secure and       affordable supply for American refining and consumption for       years to come. However, the benefits accruing to the United       States from Canadian oil sands development depend on       sufficient energy transportation infrastructure capacity. The       Promoting Cross-Border Energy Infrastructure Act proposes       four key modernizations of the cross-border infrastructure       regulatory process that can ensure the timely development of       projects:        Introduction of a Definitive Decision Timeline: Introducing       timing and development certainty currently absent from the       approval process, the Act requires a decision no later than       120 days after any applicable environmental review is       complete.        Determination of National Interest: Lead agencies would be       able to make national interest determination for cross border       energy infrastructure projects but the assumption would be       that cross border energy projects are in the national       interest unless determined otherwise by that lead agency.        Agency Decision-Making: By removing the requirement for a       Presidential permit, the relevant official or agency would       serve as final authority, further streamlining the process       while assuring that the lead agency is the Federal agency       with relevant subject-matter expertise. The bill would       designate FERC as the responsible official for oil and gas       pipelines and the Secretary of Energy for electric       transmission lines. These agencies already have       responsibility for evaluating aspects affecting the national       interest with respect to these types of projects. The only       change from current practice is to substitute FERC for the       Secretary of State as lead with respect to oil pipelines.       This change is appropriate given the level of expertise at       FERC for review and approval of liquid pipeline projects,       including rate setting and ensuring equal access.        Streamlining of the approval process: New certificates of       crossings and Presidential permits would not be required for       modifications to existing border-crossing projects that are       operating or for which approvals have previously been issued.        The Promoting Cross-Border Energy Infrastructure Act will       serve to enhance the existing mutually beneficial Canada-U.S.       energy partnership. Thank you for your consideration of and       support for the Act.            Sincerely,                                                   Patricia Nelson,      Vice Chair, In Situ Oil Sands Alliance.                                   ____                                                 PLAINS ALL AMERICAN                                                   PIPELINE, L.P.                                                      July 18, 2017.      Hon. Markwayne Mullin,      Member of Congress,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Gene Green,      Member of Congress,      Washington, DC.        Dear Congressman Mullin and Congressman Green: I am writing       on behalf of Plains All American Pipeline, L.P. in support of       your legislation, H.R. 2883, the Promoting Cross-Border       Energy Infrastructure Act.        This legislation will provide the needed reform of the       existing Presidential Permit process for liquid pipeline       projects crossing international borders. As you know, there       is no authorizing statute from the Congress laying out the       requirements for this program. There is no guidance in the       law on what should be reviewed, and what can be exempted       because it is too small to make a difference. There are no       laws on what criteria to use, what to examine, or a time       certain for completing a review. The unfortunate result of       the lack of clear guidance is uncertainty and delay. In fact,       the sum total of State Department rules and procedures for       this process is one single page, so almost all applications       can be dealt with subjectively, which results in a lack of       certainty for our business.        Plains All American experienced this uncertainty first hand       when we purchased seven pipelines crossing the U.S.-Canadian       border. The guidelines used by the State Department triggered       our need to apply for a new presidential permit in 2012.       These pipelines already had an ownership ``name change''       permit application that remained pending from their previous       change of ownership in 2007. Plains applications for ``name       change'' permits remained pending until 2016. So, for 4       years, the State Department had been considering whether to       issue a presidential permit for something almost as simple as       a name change at the top of the permit. There were no       operational changes of the pipelines, no change in materials       or any physical or environmental impacts.        Hopefully, having this process come under the jurisdiction       of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will provide an       objective standard with set timelines that will provide       greater certainty.        Thank you for your work,            Best,      Harry N. Pefanis,        President & COO,        Plains All American Pipeline.     Once again, I understand that there is opposition to the  bill because of a fear. But the true fear is: Are we willing to hold up  the infrastructure needs of this country for political gain? For the  years that we had from the previous administration, that is exactly  what happened. It was political.  [[Page H6014]]    What we are trying to do when we take it out of the State  Department's hands and put it with FERC is put it with a bipartisan  oversight agency that takes an approach to looking at the  infrastructure needs that this country has and saying: Is this in the  country's best interest?   They have been doing it, and they do it well.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I actually have a couple of more speakers.    Mr. Chair, I was under the impression the other side had  yielded back the balance of her time.    Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous consent to allow the minority  to reclaim the balance of her time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Kansas  (Mr. Marshall).  [[Page H6016]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gene Green), my good friend.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Gosar).    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, this bill has absolutely no effect on any environmental  law. The bill expressly provides that approval of a project under this  act does not affect the application of any other Federal laws that are  applicable to the construction, operation, or maintenance of a project.  The Congressional Research Service has reviewed the legislation and has  confirmed that fact.   My point is, other than the fact that they just want to oppose this  because, maybe, people oppose fossil fuels as a whole, this makes  sense. This is a bill that moves forward. As we stated earlier, it  takes politics out of our permitting process. It brings structure and  certainty to those that are providing our infrastructure needs.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes,'' and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, H.R. 2883 was designated the Federal Energy  Regulatory Commission, the lead agency of the permitting cross-border  oil pipelines.   FERC is an independent agency made up of a bipartisan commission that  regulates interstate transmission of electricity, natural gas, and oil.  FERC also reviews proposals to build liquefied natural gas terminals,  interstate natural gas pipelines, and cross-border natural gas  facilities.   FERC has a proven track record of working with a wide array of  stakeholders on complex pipeline projects to balance the public  interest. It is clearly the best suited agency for the job of  permitting cross-border oil pipelines.   As we learned from the Keystone XL experience during the Obama  administration, the State Department lacks the ability to pull out  politics from our Nation's infrastructure. There is nothing in this  bill that would prevent the State Department from being consulted about  an application, but FERC should take the lead on cross-border oil  pipelines.   H.R. 2883 would provide the permitting process with much-needed  consistency and transparency. The gentleman's amendment would double  down on the failures of the past and reinject bipartisan politics into  the process.   Mr. Chairman, I urge a ``no'' on this amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time for closing.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to my colleague from Texas  (Mr. Gene Green).    Mr. Chair, H.R. 2883 strikes a right balance for wise  management of our multiuse public lands and natural resources. The  amendment would upset this careful balance.   Mr. Chair, I urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition, although I do  not oppose the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I rise in support of the gentleman's  amendment, which would clarify the intent of the legislation not to  affect the application of any or other Federal laws that are applicable  to the construction, operation, or maintenance of the project.   Despite the talking points used by some of my friends, nothing in  this bill would exempt a project from complying with applicable  environmental laws or restrict the scope of environmental review.   The gentleman from Texas' amendment makes this abundantly clear. H.R.  2883 would lead to a more objective and timely decision, create jobs,  strengthen our Nation's energy security, and support affordable and  reliable energy for all Americans.   Mr. Chair, I urge a ``yes'' vote, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition to the  motion.    Mr. Speaker, this is just a procedural motion to deny the  important benefits of this legislation to the American workers,  businesses, and our collective energy security. It fits a pattern of  delay and obstruction that we simply cannot support. I urge my  colleagues to oppose this motion to recommit and vote ``yes'' on final  passage.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
