 Mr. President, today I pay tribute to the life and  contributions of a prominent Rhode Islander, Sergei Khruschev.   You may recognize his last name. His father, Nikita Khruschev, came  to power after the death of Joseph Stalin and led the Soviet Union  during some of the darkest days of the Cold War. Sergei Khruschev's  life is necessarily intertwined with that of his father. Yet Sergei was  his own man and achieved much in his own right.   Sergei Khruschev was born in Moscow in July 1935. Naturally gifted  and with a keen mind, he received a doctorate from Moscow Technical  University. He would become an accomplished rocket and computer  scientist, working on guidance systems for missiles and in the Soviet  space program. In 1964, his father was removed from power and relegated  to obscurity. During this time, Sergei helped his father write his  memoirs.   At the end of the Cold War, Sergei came to America with his wife  Valentina and joined Brown University as a visiting scholar. He became  a senior fellow at the Watson Institute for International and Public  Affairs and taught there until his retirement in 2012. Sergei used his  considerable talents to benefit students, colleagues, and fellow Rhode  Islanders. He gave generously of his time, taught at other  institutions, and gave lectures across the country.   Sergei sought to increase knowledge and understanding, particularly  between Americans and Russians. In 1991, he was quoted in The  Providence Journal stating, ``I think it is important for everyone to  understand that many of the mistakes made during the Cold War that led  to dangerous conflicts were based on misconceptions and  misunderstandings . . . ''   Fully embracing their new life in America, Sergei and Valentina  received their green cards in 1993 and became citizens in 1999. Sergei  was proud to become a citizen. Sergei and Valentina were proud members  of their Cranston community. Sergei owned a large Buick for years as it  reminded him of the cars he saw when he first visited America as a  young man with his father.   After his death, one of his colleagues described Sergei as `` . . .  very passionate about the subjects he taught'' who ``managed to infect  the students with his genuine enthusiasm and curiosity.'' The colleague  also said that even years after leaving Sergei's class, students `` . .  . recall [his] amazing combination of open-mindedness, thorough  knowledge of the subjects . . . and unassuming manner of discussion and  debate.''   It is clear that Sergei lived an impactful life, a life that broke  down walls and built bridges. I offer my heartfelt condolences to  Sergei's wife Valentina, their family, and Sergei's many friends,  neighbors, colleagues, and students.                            ____________________     Mr. President, as many of my colleagues know, the  transition from deployment to civilian life is frequently difficult.  Vet Centers, created in the wake of the Vietnam War, are community- based centers that were designed to provide critical services for  veterans, service members, and their families. Today, there is a need  to enhance these Centers to realize that original vision--which is why  I am introducing the Vet Center Improvement Act.   This legislation is an outgrowth of a Government Accountability  Office (GAO) investigation that Senator Tester and I requested into  allegations that changes to performance metrics at Vet Centers may have  negatively impacted care and additional concerns that he and I had  about their staffing practices. The subsequent GAO report concluded  that recent changes ``have the potential to negatively affect care and  create undue burden and stress on counselors providing that care at  some Vet Centers.'' This report included recommendations to improve  care, transparency, and hiring and staffing methods that form the  foundation for our legislation.   Specifically, the Vet Center Improvement Act requires periodic review  and reform of performance standards at Vet Centers; the creation and  periodic reevaluation of a staffing model, along with standardization  of position descriptions and responsibilities across Vet Centers; the  creation of a working group to implement changes to improve quality of  care for veterans and recruitment and retention of staff; and the GAO  to review Vet Center infrastructure and examine what future investments  are needed.   Additionally, our legislation creates a pilot program to provide  grants to combat food insecurity and provide necessary heating and  cooling assistance to veterans and their families. Food insecurity and  the need for heating assistance are growing issues for veterans and  others as a result of the pandemic.   I would like to thank Senator Tester for not only the attention he  has paid to this issue as Ranking Member of the Senate Veterans Affairs  Committee, but also for joining with me on this important legislation.  Our legislation has received support from such organizations as the  Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW), American Veterans (AMVETS), Disabled  American Veterans (DAV), National Community Action Foundation (NCAF),  National Association for State Community Services Programs (NASCSP),  the National Energy & Utility Affordability Coalition (NEUAC), and the  URI Feinstein Center for a Hunger Free America. I look forward to  continuing our partnership on this and other measures to improve care  for our veterans, and I hope our colleagues will join us in this  endeavor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, as many of my colleagues know, the  transition from deployment to civilian life is frequently difficult.
