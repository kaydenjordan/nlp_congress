 Mr. President, this week, I have the distinct  honor of recognizing Emma Homer of Ashland for the many years she has  helped children in eastern Montana. Her generosity and compassion is  commendable.   Emma began fostering children in 1979. For nearly 38 years, she has  opened her home, and her heart in order to help the local community.  The longevity of her noble accomplishment is truly remarkable. Over the  years, Emma has directly helped to improve the lives of over 40  children through her service as foster parent. The children she has  cared for have varied in age from infants just a few months old to  teenagers in high school.   In addition to her contributions as a foster parent, since 1981, Emma  has worked in the food service department at St. Labre Indian School.  During that time, she has helped prepare hundreds of thousands of  nutritious meals for the students and staff.   A loving home and a warm meal are essential elements in every Montana  community. Emma has helped provide both of these essentials to many  children for well over a generation. Thank you, Emma, for the  outstanding example you have set for the next generation.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the legislation to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to  permanently extend the Indian coal production tax credit be printed in  the Record.
