 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution  1170, I call up the bill (H.R. 7606) to establish the Office of the  Special Investigator for Competition Matters within the Department of  Agriculture, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        June 16, 2022, on page H5615, in the first column, the following  appeared:  Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        June 16, 2022, on page H5618, in the second column, the  following appeared: The gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Scott) and the  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Thompson) each will controll 30  minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  Scott).  Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend  their remarks and insert extraneous material on H.R. 7606.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. Schrier), my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   I want to clear up something that the gentleman just said. It is very  important. The United States Department of Agriculture is the proper  source to deal with this investigation. It needs to be investigated per  the will of the American people, and there is no agency better  equipped, better qualified, to find out what is going wrong.   According to the USDA, the language is clear on the special  investigator being a career employee. It only specifies that the  position be appointed by the Secretary and based on the qualifications  of the individual.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Minnesota (Ms.  Craig), a member of the House Committee on Agriculture.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Let me clarify something the ranking member said. Yes, I was able to  bring in all four CEOs of our meatpacking companies, and we were very  grateful that they accepted our invitation. But our ranking member made  a mistake. It wasn't all four that said in answer to my question about  whether or not they agreed or had any agreement on pricing in our meat  industry. Three said no; one said, ``Not to my knowledge.''   Now, you must understand what we are dealing with here and why just  that reply from them requires an investigation. That is what we are  here for. That is why we did the hearing, to bring those parties in.   We must act, Mr. Speaker. As I said before, we cannot continue to  lose 17,000 ranchers and farmers. Also, so many of them, thousands of  them, have not made a profit in 5 years. We have a problem.   In a report, the GAO noted that the USDA's investigations were  planned and conducted primarily by economists, without the formal  involvement of attorneys from USDA's Office of General Counsel, or the  OGC. As a result, a legal perspective that focused on assessing  potential violations was generally absent when investigations were  initiated and conducted. This is precisely why the special investigator  bill is so important, because it alleviates an issue that has not had  enough scrutiny and ensures that attorneys will be responsible for  looking into possible violations.   The GAO also found that the USDA's Packers and Stockyards Act, PSA,  investigations had not modernized to keep up with today's complex,  competition-related concerns, with consolidation at the heart of this  issue, nor had it implemented previous recommendations. It also  recommended that GIPSA and USDA's Office of General Counsel work more  closely together.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.  Pallone), the distinguished chairman of the Energy and Commerce  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Virginia (Ms. Spanberger), who is also the chair of  our Conservation and Forestry Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1  minute to the distinguished gentlewoman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Pelosi), our distinguished Speaker of  the House.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Harder), a member of the House  Agriculture Committee.    Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure  to yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), my  friend, the distinguished majority leader.
