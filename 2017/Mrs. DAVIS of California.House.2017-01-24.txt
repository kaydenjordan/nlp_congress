 Madam Speaker, let me tell you about  Chelsea, a mother of two young children, who was on Medicaid when she  was diagnosed with cervical cancer. She never missed her birth control  pills, but when she went to the clinic for treatment, she was told that  she was pregnant and could not get the surgery she needed because of  the pregnancy.                                time  1315    Why is that? Because of the Hyde rule, Medicaid would not cover the  abortion care that she needed, and her cancer treatment was delayed,  obviously compromising her health.   Instead of discussing ways to make Chelsea's situation better, we are  considering a bill that would make the ban on abortion care services  under Medicaid permanent.   This is not about women asking for free, federally funded abortions.  This is about women like Chelsea being able to receive the medical care  they desperately need.   We saw this weekend millions of women took to the streets throughout  our country in a historic movement. So let's show them that we are  listening by rejecting this bill that makes bad policy permanent.   Madam Speaker, let's leave a woman's medical decision between her and  her doctor and reject this far-reaching bill.
