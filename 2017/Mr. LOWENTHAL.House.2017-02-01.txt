 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to oppose H.J. Res. 38.   The science is clear: mountaintop removal mining is harmful to the  health of people who live near these mines. Anyone with a computer can  go to Google Earth and see the tremendous scars on the landscape from  mining companies that blast the tops off mountains and then dump the  waste into the valleys below. But largely invisible to the naked eye is  the suffering of people who live in the nearby communities because of  these harmful practices.   The stream protection rule will protect hundreds of vulnerable  families and children who live near these sites from lung cancer, heart  disease, kidney disease, birth defects, hypertension, and other health  problems.   If the majority has a problem with this final rule, as they say they  do, they should hold a hearing in the Natural Resources Committee to  discuss its merits. There we would have an opportunity to talk to the  administration and hear from those who are most affected by mountaintop  removal mining.   Instead, they have decided to bypass regular order, go straight to  the Congressional Review Act, which will take a chainsaw to this  commonsense pollution rule. This is a reckless approach.   I urge my colleagues to take time to listen to the voices of the  American people. Please put the health and safety of American families  first and vote ``no'' on this reckless resolution.
