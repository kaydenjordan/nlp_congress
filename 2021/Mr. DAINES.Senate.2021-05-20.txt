 Mr. President. Today I have the distinct honor of  recognizing A. Ed Maierle of Cascade County as Montanan of the Month  for his service to our country during World War II. Ed is also  celebrating his 100th birthday on June 6, 2021, which is the 77th  anniversary of the D-Day invasion in France.   Ed enlisted in the U.S. Navy after Pearl Harbor was bombed. He was  sent to Hawaii and became an ``Avenger,'' a member of a torpedo bomber  squadron stationed at Pearl Harbor. Ed also manned a 50-caliber machine  gun on a PBY, a WWII seaplane. He later was stationed for 2 years as  propeller specialist with a B-24 squadron on Esperitu Santo New Heberde  Island. As part of this squadron, he flew daily missions, scouting for  the dreaded A6M Zero Japanese fighter planes.   After the war, Ed was stationed for 1 year at Whidbey Island, WA,  before returning to Montana. For two summers, Ed and his wife, Mary  Alice, became the first couple in the United States to man a U.S.  Forest Service fire watch lookout tower. Following this adventure, Ed  embarked on a very successful career in the insurance business. He and  Mary Alice were very active in community service. They both shared a  strong faith in the Lord and were recognized for their 24 years of  service in the Helena area nursing home ministry.   Ed epitomizes the heart of a veteran--a Montana hero--whose selfless  service must not be forgotten. On behalf of a grateful nation, I want  to thank Ed for his service to our country, and I wish you a very happy  birthday celebration with your family.                            ____________________
