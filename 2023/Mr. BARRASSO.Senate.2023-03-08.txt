 Madam President, I, too, come to the floor today to  talk about the soft-on-crime policies of Democrats in Washington, DC.   In 2020, Democrats all across the country started their movement to  defund the police. Almost immediately, we saw burning cities across the  country, from the east coast all the way to Portland, OR.   Democratic leaders turned their backs on police officers all across  the country. As a result, police officers began to retire or resign,  and they did so in record numbers. The results were as painful as they  were predictable. Violent crime skyrocketed all across America. We saw  the fastest murder rate increase in our history. Homicides rose to a  25-year high. This is no surprise. If police officers are not able to  do their jobs, then the streets of each town in America are not safe.   Well, today on the floor, Madam President, Senate Republicans are  going to act to stop this recklessness. Thanks to the leadership of  Senator Hagerty, who is leading our discussion and our efforts, Senate  Republicans are going to vote to stop Washington, DC's radical new  legislation, this legislation that lets criminals get out of jail free.  Senate Republicans are going to vote to make our Nation's Capital a  safer place to visit, a safer place to live, and a safer place to work.   Wyoming families ask me all the time if it is safe for them to visit  Washington, DC, or if it is safe for their kids to come to Washington,  DC, for something like History Day, an opportunity to see the Nation's  Capital. Imagine that: many American families actually afraid to visit  or have their children visit our Nation's Capital.   Liberal cities all across the country have become danger zones.  Families in Wyoming watch the nightly news. They can't believe their  eyes. They see smashed storefronts in New York and in Chicago. They see  innocent people getting mugged on the streets. They see it in New York,  and they see it in Washington, DC. The cities run by liberals are not  safe. Across the country, we have hit new records for carjackings, for  assaults. But instead of backing the blue, Democrats are turning cities  into safe havens for criminals. That is exactly what has happened here  in Washington, DC.   So the city council here in Washington, DC, recently voted to  eliminate mandatory minimum sentences for every crime except for first- degree murder. Well, there is a value in mandatory minimum sentences.  It tells judges the bare minimum punishment for criminal behavior.  Mandatory minimum sentences stop liberal judges from going soft and  softer on crime. So it is no wonder that Democrats have waged war on  mandatory minimums for at least the last decade.   The new DC law would also reduce maximum sentences for violent  criminals like carjackers. For some gun charges, the maximum sentence  would go from 15 years down to less than 5. The new crime law in the  District of Columbia would mean more violent criminals free to roam the  streets of our Nation's Capital and prey on innocent people.   Even the liberal Washington Post has said that the bill that passed  the DC City Council is a bad idea.   Carjacking is already a major problem in Washington. We are seeing it  in liberal cities all across the Nation. Carjackings in DC have tripled  since 2019, and we just heard on the floor of the Senate today that a  carjacking has recently taken place right down the street from the  Capitol Building. That is today. Under the new Criminal Code, the  maximum sentence for armed carjacking would be cut almost in half.   Why would the DC City Council reward the criminals who are creating  this chaos in our Nation's Capital? These criminals and the liberal DC  City Council members are driving away tourists from my home State of  Wyoming who want to see their Nation's Capital. It is a part of  education for so many young people.   Democrats in the House got behind the DC soft-on-crime policies when  over 170 Democrats in the House voted to protect the criminals, not the  citizens.   So Joe Biden is now trying to hide his soft-on-crime record. He just  very recently announced that he would now support our Republican  position.  [[Page S687]]    This resolution we will soon be voting on will be a victory for every  American who wants to feel safe when they visit their Nation's Capital.  But Washington, DC, is just one city. It shouldn't stop here.  Democrats' soft-on-crime policies remain in effect in liberal-led  cities all across America. Democratic lawmakers and especially  Democratic mayors need to take notice of this action by the U.S. Senate  today.   It is time to start enforcing the law. It is time to get rid of  prosecutors who are weak and prosecutors who are woke. They are not  helping our country. We need to stand with law enforcement. We need to  ensure police officers have the resources they need to protect our  communities.   The American people overwhelmingly reject the soft-on-crime policies  of Democrats in Washington. America is based on the rule of law.  Lawlessness should have no place in this Nation. It is time to stop the  crime, time to stop the chaos we are seeing in cities all across our  country.   Republicans are united by solutions--solutions to make American  communities safer. That is what this body is going to vote on today: to  improve the security and the safety of those in our Nation's Capital.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I rise today to recognize the 100th  anniversary of the Kiwanis Club of Cheyenne. This is a hands-on service  organization making a profound impact on the development of Wyoming's  youth. The club is committed in every way to the betterment of the  community.   On March 10, 2023 the Kiwanis Club of Cheyenne will celebrate its  100th anniversary at the Little America Hotel and Conference Center in  Cheyenne. Seven years after the official recognition of Kiwanis  International, the Kiwanis Club of Cheyenne was formed on January 27,  1922. The international mission to serve the needs of area children  extended to Cheyenne. Sixty-five men gathered at the Plains Hotel,  electing William Bradford Ross as their first president. Ross was  elected Governor of Wyoming within a year from the club's charter date.   One of the club's first major accomplishments was the creation of  Kiwanis Park, a notable landmark in Cheyenne. In 1922, the city  solicited help from local service clubs to build parks in the vicinity  of Cheyenne's lakes. To this day, club volunteers care for the park.  The Kiwanis Club remained involved in the lake area by helping to  establish the Kiwanis Community House. This is a large, multi-purpose  meeting space in what remains of the Cheyenne park system. The house is  used for meetings, reunions, weddings, and small trade shows. The city  opened a new park in east Cheyenne in 2021. The park was adopted by the  Kiwanis Club, with members committed to both labor and financing. On  June 27, 2022, the Cheyenne City Council voted to name the park  ``Kiwanis Park.''   The Kiwanis Club of Cheyenne strives to ``develop by precept and  example, a more intelligent, aggressive, and serviceable citizenship by  providing World Class leadership development for the young people of  our community.'' That dedication to Wyoming's youth encompasses a  variety of programs. The Stars of Tomorrow talent show showcases the  incredible skills of Wyoming's youth. Key Club provides adolescents  with opportunities to develop leadership skills, build character, and  participate in service projects within the community.   The needs of Cheyenne's youth were also addressed with the  establishment of a ``student's fund.'' For many years this scholarship  program helped area high school students attend the University of  Wyoming. The club participates in the Friday Food Bag program ensuring  all Laramie County students have dependable access to nutritious food  during weekends. Other youth organizations and individuals to benefit  from Kiwanis Club support include the Future Farmers of America--now  known as FFA--Boy Scouts, Sea Scouts, the City's Youth Alternative  Program, orphaned boys, and underprivileged children through the  vocational guidance committee.   Since their beginning, the Kiwanis Club of Cheyenne has never stopped  its charitable outreach. Their positive impacts on the community keep  growing. While assisting youth is their main focus, the club helps  other groups as well. Their outreach extends to those with  disabilities. The Kiwanis Aktion Club, the only service club for adults  with disabilities, helps members become ``competent, capable and caring  leaders'' through service-oriented projects. The Kiwanis Club's  financial support was pivotal in the early days of Magic City  Enterprises. This company helps disabled individuals learn, develop and  retain necessary skills to live successfully.   A cornerstone of Cheyenne Frontier Days since 1952 is the delicious  pancake breakfasts served to locals and tourists. This includes the  famous ``chuck'' of the pancake over the cook's shoulder. This past  year, Kiwanis Club members and volunteers dedicated their time to  prepare 19,285 pancakes free of charge in 1 week. This level of sheer  commitment to the community by the members and volunteers of the club  exemplifies the strong character and selflessness of all participating  club members. The club's outreach is expansive and impressive. Not only  are the needs of Wyoming's youth met, but the needs of the Cheyenne  community are guaranteed to be addressed with resolute dedication.   The Kiwanis Club of Cheyenne is led by:         Renee Brower        President        Laura Drake        Secretary        Debbie LaFaso        Treasurer        Margaret Cox        President Elect        Larry Walters        1st Vice President        Lisa Trimble        2nd Vice President        Pamela Freeman        Assistant Secretary        Kim Lovett        Assistant Treasurer        Samuel Weinstein        Past President        Rhianna Brand        Board Member        George Costopoulos        Board Member        Scott Royce        Board Member        Richard Russell        Board Member        Rich Wessenberg        Board Member        Patrick Brady        Board Member        Denise Newell        Board Member        Deborah Dancik-Paxton        Board Member        Melissa Stutz        Board Member        Travis Vogel        Board Member    It is an honor for me to rise in recognition of this significant  milestone for the Kiwanis Club of Cheyenne. Bobbi joins me in extending  our congratulations to the Kiwanis Club of Cheyenne on their 100th  anniversary.                            ____________________
