 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of  families and children everywhere who have been affected by childhood  cancer.   This month, September, is Childhood Cancer Awareness Month. As I  think about the meaning behind this month, I realize that childhood  cancer has had a significant impact on my district in west Tennessee.   According to the American Childhood Cancer Organization, more than  15,000 children under the age of 21 are diagnosed with cancer each  year. It is heartbreaking that any family must endure the pain caused  by childhood cancer.   Thanks to the countless efforts by doctors, nurses, and researchers,  the childhood cancer survival rate has now reached over 80 percent.   Back home, we are fortunate to have state-of-the-art facilities  dedicated to childhood cancer research with personnel working each and  every day to see that our children are receiving the best possible  care.   St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis provides top-notch  cancer treatment to nearly 7,500 patients from all over the world each  year.   From medical personnel to volunteers to families sharing their  testimonies, my area is filled with many who have dedicated their lives  to the pursuit of an end to childhood cancer.                                time  1030    Now, here in Congress, I have supported numerous initiatives to fight  so that all children have a chance of survival. Most recently, I  cosponsored and voted for the Childhood Cancer STAR Act, which was  signed into law by President Trump this past summer.   The great Danny Thomas, the founder of St. Jude, believed that no  child should die in the dawn of life. We have come so far to increase  the odds of survival and recovery. But we won't stop there. I feel  fortunate knowing that each day we are one step closer to finding cures  and ensuring that every child has the chance to live.                            ____________________
