 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Rion-Bowman  VFW Post in Harrisonburg, Virginia, which recently celebrated its 100th  anniversary.   Founded in 1921, VFW Post 632 was the first Veterans of Foreign War  chapter founded in the Shenandoah Valley and is one of the oldest in  the Commonwealth of Virginia.   Combat veterans of every conflict since World War I have called this  post home, and it has been led by 73 dedicated commanders over the  years.   Current Senior Vice Commander Christopher Rexrode noted the  significance of celebrating this milestones during the pandemic, which  has forced far too many veterans' clubs across the country to close. He  is thankful his post has been able to keep its doors open and continue  to serve as a place for veterans to gather, connect, and share  experiences and comradery on a daily basis.   Congratulations to VFW Post 632 on this great achievement, and I wish  them another 100 years of success.                            ____________________
