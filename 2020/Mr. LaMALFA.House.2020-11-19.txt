 Madam Speaker, I rise to recognize National Rural  Healthcare Day.   One in five Americans calls rural America home, including the great  people of northern California.  [[Page H5942]]    We have some great healthcare providers, and I would like to thank  them for their efforts, especially during the pandemic, to keep  everyone safe and healthy.   As great as it is to live in our State, we have a severe shortage of  physicians, and recruiting new ones has proven to be a challenge.   The 12 community health centers and teaching health centers serve  over 200,000 patients alone. These medical facilities provide much- needed short-term care but also help train physicians who will plant  their roots, hopefully, in underserved areas and be available for their  patients long term.   Community-based programs with stable funding are sometimes the only  way that people in rural areas can get the care they need.   Let's hope we can have a stronger push and use National Rural  Healthcare Day to spotlight more of this issue.                            ____________________
