 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 75th  anniversary of the Allied invasion of Normandy, known as D-Day, or  Operation Overlord, and to recognize those who sacrificed to begin the  liberation from Nazi Germany.   On June 6, 1944, over 4,400 Allied soldiers crossed the English  Channel and gave many of their lives while storming the beaches code  named Omaha, Utah, Gold, Juno, and Sword.   Madam Speaker, 2,501 of those soldiers who died on those beaches were  Americans who never got to return home.   The impact that this had on our communities back home was great-- take, for example, the Bedford boys from a small town in Bedford,  Virginia. Thirty-five men who had grown up together boarded landing  craft that day and embarked towards France, and 19 of them didn't make  it back.  [[Page H4339]]    This small Southern town is an example of the sacrifices made by many  small towns and families all across this country during that effort  that day and during that war. They did it to protect our freedom, our  American way of life, and those of our allies around the world to help  defeat the grip of the National Socialist German Workers' Party regime.   We will always be grateful for those who gave that day, for those who  survived, and for those who didn't come back, and that is why it is  important to always mark this day, D-Day, June 6.                            ____________________
