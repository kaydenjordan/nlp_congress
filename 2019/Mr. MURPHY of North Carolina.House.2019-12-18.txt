 Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to  these baseless Articles of Impeachment and the unprecedented process  that has been used in this effort to impeachment the duly elected  President of the United States.   It is a mockery of American justice.   In 1788, one of our Founding Fathers, Alexander Hamilton, wrote in  the Federalist Papers:         In many cases, impeachment will connect itself with the       preexisting factions . . . and in such cases, there will       always be the greatest danger that the decision will be       regulated more by the comparable strength of parties,       majority and minority, than by real demonstrations of       innocence or guilt.    What does this mean? It means that the majority can exert its  influence regardless of justice.   In this statement, Hamilton warned us about the danger of mob rule.   Democrats have a criminal and have been searching for a crime for 3  years, but this President has not committed a crime.    As the leader of American foreign policy, the President has a  constitutional obligation to root out corruption in countries to which  we provide aid. This is not an abuse of power. It is his job.   One of the articles is obstruction of Congress. The only thing that  has been obstructed is this President's right to due process.   I don't blame the President for refusing to fully participate in this  guilty-until-proven circus. This is not how our Founding Fathers framed  American justice.   This is a tragic day in our Nation's history. We have individuals  that hate this President more than they love this country.   Our country needs prayer, and not this disruptive partisanship.
