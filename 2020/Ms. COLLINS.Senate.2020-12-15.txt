 Mr. President, I rise to honor a member of my staff,  Mark LeDuc, who will soon retire after decades of distinguished  service. Mark exemplifies the ideal public servant, demonstrating  integrity, thoroughness, a spirit of inquiry, and hard work in every  undertaking. Above all, Mark has always demonstrated his belief that it  is an honor to serve the people of Maine and our Nation.   Mark was born in New Jersey, but his father's final tour of duty in  the U.S. Navy brought the family to Maine, where they were finally  home. I first met Mark in 1986 at a campaign event for then- Representative John McKernan, who was running for Governor of the State  of Maine. He had recently graduated from a joint degree program at  Columbia Law School and the School of Public and International Affairs  at Princeton University. He had just moved back to Maine with his wife  Marie, whom he had met while they were both studying at Princeton.   Mark and I both went on to work in the Governor McKernan's  administration. Mark served as head of the Governor's legislative  staff, and I was commissioner of professional and financial regulation  in his cabinet. At the time, Maine's workers compensation market was in  the midst of a crisis, leading to a 17-day State government shutdown.  Mark and I worked closely together on the reform legislation that ended  the shutdown and successfully resolved the crisis.   Mark held other roles in State government, but it was during his  service in the Governor's office that I first saw and came to  appreciate his ability to master complex issues and his dedication to  public service.   Mark joined my Senate staff in 2003. He has served in various roles  since that time, first in my personal office, then on my Homeland  Security and Governmental Affairs Committee staff, and now as chief  counsel on my Aging Committee staff. Through the years, Mark has  advised me with expertise and thoroughness on a wide range of issues.  He served as my lead economic staffer on such legislation as the 2003  tax cuts, the 2008 Troubled Asset Relief Program, the American Recovery  and Reinvestment Act, the Dodd-Frank financial regulatory reform  legislation, and the Collins capital standards amendment. He also  advised me on the economics of the 2010 Patient Protection and  Affordable Care Act and later put his knowledge of State insurance  regulation to work when he helped me to draft the Lower Premiums  Through Reinsurance Act.   Mark's most significant professional accomplishment may very well be  the Paycheck Protection Program that he helped me craft earlier this  year. During the devastating COVID-19 pandemic, this program has helped  to sustain more than 50 million American jobs, including more than  250,000 jobs in the State of Maine, and I so appreciate the great  knowledge and untiring energy he put into this crucial project. It was  important, and it helped real people--the small business owners and  their employees who are the backbone of communities across our Nation.   Mark has achieved great professional success, but what he is most  proud of is his family. Mark and Marie have three daughters: Miriam- Rose, Julie, and Karen. While I am delighted for him that in his  retirement he will have more time to spend with the family he loves so  dearly, his absence as a member of my staff will be deeply felt.   Mark is a true public servant. He performs his work not for accolades  but for a belief in helping people and doing what right. I wish him and  his family all the best as they embark on this next chapter.                            ____________________
