 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this  resolution and to call attention to the ongoing crisis at our southern  border.   President Biden and Secretary Mayorkas have turned our southern  border into a land of lawlessness, triggering one of the worst national  security, humanitarian, and public safety disasters our country has  ever seen.   On day one, President Biden immediately repealed strong border  security policies that were working. Under Biden and Mayorkas, we have  shattered every illegal immigration record on the books, even as  Mayorkas knowingly deceives Congress and the American people by saying,  ``our border is closed.''   This administration's policies deliberately unleashed chaos by  turning control of the border over to Mexican cartels and human  traffickers, while simultaneously obstructing States' efforts to secure  the border and denying CBP and law enforcement officers the resources  necessary to stop the flow of deadly drugs, human slaves, and, very  likely, terrorist cells into our country.   As a Representative of the great State of Texas, I see the results,  the consequences of these deadly policies every day throughout my  State.   This bill is crucial for ensuring public policies and public spaces  that are paid for with taxpayer dollars do not become vast encampments  for unvetted migrants, many of whom will be indebted to violent  cartels.                                time  1245    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the passage of this  important national security reform. It is clear that Secretary Mayorkas  has no regard for the rule of law, and he does not take securing our  border seriously.   Make no mistake, as long as Mayorkas remains in office, our border  will remain unsecured and vulnerable to human and drug trafficking.   I stand firm in advocating for his impeachment, and I call on the  Biden administration to offer border States the support they need to  keep our communities safe.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today because our Nation is in  crisis. One cannot overstate the absolute border disaster and national  security threat that we have been living under as a direct result of  Biden's, Mayorkas', and the Democrats' deliberate actions.   None of this is an accident. On day one, they got to work eliminating  successful Trump border policies that had us at the lowest levels of  illegal immigration in years, actually, probably illegal immigration in  our history. From that first day, the Biden administration made clear  that they would not enforce our laws and that they would not protect  our country. They did this knowing the consequences.   They ignored Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement  whose officers warned that these actions would create an unprecedented  disaster and dangers for Americans.   Guess what, Mr. Speaker?   That is exactly what happened.   President Biden and Secretary Mayorkas have opened our borders to  more than 10 million illegal immigrants, including millions of known  got-aways and God knows how many potential terrorists and narco gang  members into our country. By the way, that is more than the population  of 38 States.   Mr. Speaker, we have had enough. Cities all across America are being  overrun. Mexican cartels own the southern border. They are causing tens  of thousands of fentanyl deaths in our country ushering in a new era of  human slavery and crushing our cities and towns.  [[Page H5978]]    We are feeling the pain of Biden's border crisis not just in New York  City where the border crisis is defunding the police department and  other city services, but all across the Nation where it is driving up  crime rates in our communities, letting fentanyl kill our children, and  allowing terrorists into our Nation.   What is happening in New York City should be a wake-up call for  cities all across America, but it is just the tip of the iceberg. Texas  right now is being particularly hit hard and continues to have to fight  its own Federal Government to be able to take care of its citizens.   Our Nation is less safe because our borders are not secure, and  President Biden and Secretary Mayorkas continue to make things worse.  It is clear. They have no regard for the law, they don't want to secure  our borders, and they don't care about keeping us safe.   If they cared about keeping Americans safe, why would they want our  public spaces, which are paid for with taxpayer dollars, to become  massive encampments for unvetted illegal immigrants, many of whom are  indebted to dangerous and violent cartels?   Although this national security bill is an important reform, it is  clear that as long as Secretary Mayorkas remains in office, our border  will remain unsecured and vulnerable to human and drug trafficking.   Taxpayers in cities all across the country are footing multimillion- dollar bills. Hundreds of thousands of families are losing loved ones  in fentanyl-related deaths.   The American people deserve better. I stand firm in calling for  Secretary Mayorkas' impeachment. I urge the Biden administration to  work with border States like Texas to offer the support that we need to  keep our communities safer.
