 Mr. Speaker, I think all of us have heard, in some  way, paraphrased: While Rome is burning, much fiddling is going on.   I am grateful for all of the Members of Congress who helped construct  this legislation.   I want to remind my friends, as the authorizations proceeded in the  1990s into the 2000s of the Violence Against Women Act, the last  authorization was technically supposed to be in 2010, but it took 3  years until 2013. Working with advocates who represent almost 200  groups, Republicans and Democrats, organizations who deal with women  impacted by domestic violence and other sexual assault issues and acts,  they indicated that they wanted to see this bill expanded to cover  Native American women, they wanted to protect immigrant women who are  left vulnerable, they wanted to make sure it was gender-neutral in many  instances. But, as I recall, in 2010, it was Native American and  immigrants, so it took 3 years. And all the bill wanted to do was to  simply protect people who are vulnerable.   In this bill, that has been 3 years in writing--with every  opportunity with the preceding chairman of this committee, preceding  Congress, and members on the Judiciary Committee to sit with us to  work--I, for one, remember constant meetings with staff and members  interested, Democratic members, in how we can work together.   This bill is long in waiting for prosecutors and law enforcement.  They are waiting on the $291 million for stock grants and resources for  women's shelters.   This bill is a bipartisan bill. I thank Mr. Fitzpatrick for his work.  And in this bill is a whole section on healthcare that Mr.  Fitzpatrick's bill allowed us to put in.    It is an important contribution to this legislation.   There is an amendment by Mr. Gohmert, my friend from Texas, on female  genital mutilation. It is an amendment that we worked on, in discussion  about reporting on the incidences with Indian women, Native American  women. My amendment was joined, supported, by Republicans in the  Judiciary Committee.   This bill is bipartisan, but, most of all, it is a response to  desperation of need. The Violence Against Women Act is long overdue for  being reauthorized. This is a strong product that covers so many issues  to protect women and to ensure that those who have convictions with gun  violence do not allow them to come and kill an innocent mom with her  children.   Mr. Speaker, we must pass this bill. The rule is a good rule. Support  the rule.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Rule and the underlying bill of  H.R. 1585.   The Violence Against Women Act (``VAWA'') is landmark legislation  which--through policy reforms, interstate cooperation and grant  allocation--has been pivotal in providing a national response to  protecting half of the population.   Equally important, it has ushered in a seismic transformation on how  society perceives violence against women.   The law has enhanced and improved the lives of girls and women, boys  and men.   There are many similarities between the year that VAWA initially  passed in 1994, and the moment in which we all find ourselves today.   When it was first passed, the country was experiencing reverberations  to yet another polarizing battle to fill a seat on the Supreme Court.   Then the courageous victim sharing her truth was Anita Hill.   Today, as VAWA is yet again scheduled to expire, the country is  assessing the ripples created by the #MeToo movement.   But despite the passage of over a quarter-century since its first  enactment, the malignant treatment received by a courageous person  willing to share her story unfortunately endures.   The need to create a safe space for victims of violence, especially  women, supported with substantial resources to address this scourge has  taken on a new urgency in this era of the #MeToo movement.   When discussing VAWA, we cannot forget the victims of domestic  violence like Brittany Smith, who was 23 years old and was gunned down  last year in Houston, by her boyfriend and San Diego-based Marine; nor  can we forget Charlene Caldwell, a mother and grandmother beaten to  death last year by a baseball bat at the hands of her boyfriend in  Houston.   Domestic violence was alleged in both of these horrific events.   Unfortunately, there are too many stories like Charlene's or  Brittany's.   The stories of these two women remind us of the urgency to protect  survivors now, before it is too late, because many of these deaths are  preventable.   Despite the experiences of #MeToo survivors or victims like Ms. Smith  or Ms. Caldwell, all is not for naught.   Since VAWA's codification in 1994, more victims report episodes of  domestic violence to the police and the rate of non-fatal intimate  partner violence against women has decreased by almost two-thirds.   VAWA has also led to a significant increase in the reporting of  sexual assault.   For example, the percentage of victims of rape and sexual assault who  report the assault to the police increased from 28.8 percent in 1993-- the year prior to VAWA's initial passage--to 50 percent in 2010.   In the first 15 years of VAWA's validity, rates of serious intimate  partner violence declined by 72 percent for women and 64 percent for  men.   Research suggests that referring a victim to a domestic violence or  sexual assault advocate has been linked to an increased willingness to  file a police report--survivors with an advocate filed a report with  law enforcement 59 percent of the time, versus 41 percent for  individuals not referred to a victim advocate.  [[Page H2999]]    This progress cannot be allowed to stop.   Congress must continue sending the clear message that violence  against women is unacceptable.   Prior to VAWA, law enforcement lacked the resources and tools to  respond effectively to domestic violence and sexual assault.   Each reauthorization of VAWA has improved protections for women and  men, while helping to change the culture and reduce the tolerance for  these crimes.   The Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2019 improves  current law in several important respects, and takes a holistic  approach to the goal of eliminating the harm faced by victims of  violence, and making vital services accessible to victims of this  scourge.   For example, this iteration of VAWA contains guidance on the use of  grants to activate judicial and law enforcement tools to develop and  enforce firearm surrender policies; expands permissible use of grant  funding for programs focused on increasing survivor/law enforcement/ community safety; and provides legal assistance for dependent children  in appropriate circumstances.    It also updates programs designed to reduce dating violence, help  children exposed to violence and engage men in preventing violence  against women.   Additionally, the bill improves services for victims of domestic  violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking.   It provides policies, protection, and justice for young victims of  violence, including extending the Rape Prevention and Education grant  program, addressing bullying of young people, improving grants focused  on prevention education for students, and expanding relevant training  for school-based and campus health centers; and reauthorizes and  updates programs designed to reduce dating violence, help children  exposed to violence, and engage men in preventing violence.   This bill also recognizes the cascading ills associated with  identifying, eliminating, and preventing the reemergence of domestic  violence.   This bill expands grants under the Public Health Service Act to  support implementation of training programs to improve the capacity of  early childhood programs to address domestic violence, dating violence,  sexual assault, and stalking among the families they serve; preserves  and expands housing protections for survivors; provides economic  security assistance for survivors, by reauthorizing the National  Resource Center on Workplace Responses; protects employees from being  fired because they are survivors of sexual assault or domestic  violence; and protects survivors' eligibility to receive Unemployment  Insurance.   Recognizing that many women are victimized at the hands of intimate  partners, this iteration of VAWA helps prevent ``intimate partner''  homicides, by including provisions expanding firearms laws to prohibit  persons convicted of dating violence from possessing firearms,  prohibiting persons convicted of misdemeanor stalking from possessing  firearms, and prohibiting individuals subject to ex parte protective  orders from possessing firearms.   Accordingly, the bill helps protect Native American women, by  including provisions to improve the response to missing and murdered  Native American women, improving tribal access to federal crime  information databases, and reaffirming tribal criminal jurisdiction  over non-Indian perpetrators of domestic violence, sexual assault,  dating violence, stalking, and trafficking for all federally recognized  Indian tribes and Alaskan Natives.   Additionally, this bill protects the Office on Violence Against Women  in the Department of Justice from being de-emphasized, merged, or  consolidated into any other DOJ office.   VAWA is central to our nation's effort to fight the epidemic of  domestic, sexual, and dating violence and stalking.   This work did not happen on its own.   It was the product of a collaborative effort of stakeholders,  including victim advocates.   It was the product of those willing to share their stories of the  abuse suffered at the hands of those who were entrusted to love, but  instead harmed.   The courage, strength, and resilience displayed by survivors has  reminded all that we must continue to foster an environment for victims  of violence to come forward and expose episodes of violence against  women.   This bill represents the good that can come when courageous people  with a story to tell come forward with the belief that through their  pain, the lives of others can be helped.   Having listened to concerned stakeholders from all pockets of the  country, we have put pen to paper and produced a bill that is endorsed  by the bipartisan National Task Force to End Sexual and Domestic  Violence (NTF), which is a national collaboration comprising a large  and diverse group of 35 national, tribal, state, territorial, and local  organizations, advocates, and individuals that focus on the  development, passage and implementation of effective public policy to  address domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and  stalking.   Indeed, there is no reason our work on this cannot be bipartisan, as  has been the custom of prior Congresses in authorizing this critical  piece of legislation.   The love for a spouse, the comfort of a mother and the best wishes  for a sister know no political allegiance.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Collins and I have been working on any number of issues dealing  with criminal justice reform, and certainly we have spent the last  couple of years on the Judiciary Committee. He may not recall, but  working with our chairman in the last session of Congress, who  acknowledged that the Judiciary Committee had many opportunities to  work together--and I totally agree--one of those issues was, of course,  the Violence Against Women Act. We engaged with the staff quite  extensively because we wanted this to be a bipartisan bill.   So, for a 3-year period, we engaged, I engaged, many women of this  Congress  [[Page H3010]]  engaged, and we think we have come up with a product that recognizes  that, as we speak here today, there are women who are dying from  domestic violence. As we stand here today, law enforcement will tell  you that the most difficult, or one of the most difficult, calls they  have to make is a domestic violence call.   Maybe it is like my constituent, Candice, whose bill I introduced,  who was laying in the bed with a little baby and her other children  were moving around the house, and a significant other--a husband, a  boyfriend--took his gun and killed Candice while that baby was lying  next to her. The little children had to hear that, and they were  scurrying. They had to run to another house to try to get help for  mommy.   You see, ladies and gentlemen, this is not about a score of the  National Rifle Association, because this is not a gun bill, this is a  lifesaving bill. This is a bill that a Republican from Pennsylvania,  Mr. Fitzpatrick, put a health provision in, he expanded the Public  Health Service Act.    His bill will allow more services to come for those  children and those survivors of domestic violence, it will expand the  capacity of early childhood programs to address domestic violence,  dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking. It will put in $291  million, so that date rape kits, DNA kits, will not be backlogged, so  that law enforcement will have resources, and so that prosecutors will  have resources.   Candice cannot be brought back. And we introduced that bill at a time  when no one wanted to see anything having to do with protecting us from  guns. Now we have a statement that respects Candice's life by  indicating that if you have been convicted, you need not have a gun  around your family, it should be in a lockbox.   What more can we do to be fair and balanced and draw bipartisan  support, even to the extent of joining with my friend from Texas to  have a bill amendment that deals with female genital mutilation.   We have worked hard. This bill deserves 100 percent support of this  Congress, because while we talk lives are being lost.   Mr. Chairman, I ask my friends to support the legislation that we are  debating, H.R. 1585.   Mr. Chair, I rise in support of the Violence Against Women  Reauthorization Act of 2019.

The love for a spouse, the comfort of a mother and the best wishes  for a sister know no political allegiance.    Madam Chair, I claim time in opposition to the  amendment, although I am not opposed to the amendment.    Madam Chair, I thank Congresswoman Wagner for her  continuing leadership. It has been a pleasure to work with her over the  years in the House Committee on the Judiciary on the question of human  trafficking and sex trafficking.   I am delighted to join this amendment, along with Congresswoman  Maloney from New York. We have a long history of working on the issues  of human trafficking and sex trafficking.   Madam Chair, the International Labor Organization estimates that  there are 40.3 million victims of human trafficking. Twenty-five  percent of them are children; 75 percent of them are women and girls.   It is a tragedy, but one out of seven endangered runaways reported to  the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children were likely  child sex trafficking victims. Of those, 88 percent were in the care of  social services or foster care when they ran.   From 2007 to 2017, the National Human Trafficking Hotline has  received 34,700 sex trafficking cases inside the United States; and, in  2017, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children indicated  that children continue in 2017, again, to be sex trafficked. The  International Labor Organization, again, estimates that there are 4.8  million people trapped in forced sexual exploitation.                                time  1615    What is necessary to know is that sex trafficking can be a revolving  door. It is income that sex traffickers and human traffickers use.   I am very delighted to join with Congresswoman Wagner's amendment to  this bill dealing with violence against women because it is an expanded  bill that answers the concerns of so many.   I am glad that this amendment will ensure that the Creating Hope  through Outreach, Options, Service, and Education for Children and  Youth program, the CHOOSE Children and Youth program, can continue to  be programs that address sex trafficking.   It is important to note, in particular, that it is answering the  question of the gap in services in our States for young women who are  at risk and who are struggling to restart their lives. We must ensure  that, once these individuals have been victimized, sex trafficked, we  do all we can to help them heal and recover.   I ask all Members to join in supporting this amendment, which  emphasizes that sex trafficking is a part of our trying to stop and  stomp out for good violence against women. I ask all Members to support  the Wagner-Jackson Lee-Maloney amendment.   Madam Chair, I rise in strong support of the Wagner/Jackson Lee/ Maloney Amendment to H.R. 1585, the Violence Against Women  Reauthorization Act of 2019.   The Wagner/Jackson Lee/Maloney makes an improvement to the bill by  drawing attention to the lack of services for child sex trafficking  services and which draws attention to groups like CHOOSE Children and  Youth (Creating Hope through Outreach, Options, Service and Education  for Children and Youth) for educating and preventing sex trafficking.   Madam Chair, while we live in the richest, most powerful country in  the history of the world, in our nation we still see the prevalence of  sex trafficking.   It is important that as we do this work before us today, we emphasize  that sex trafficking is also a form of violence against women and  children.   The Congress--this body--must work to ensure that services for sex  trafficking victims are available.   The Wagner/Jackson Lee/Maloney Amendment addresses the gap in  services in our state for young women who are risk and who are  struggling to restart their lives.   Crime, and especially crimes falling within the umbrella of offenses  addressed in VAWA are unconscionable and intolerable in a civilized  society.   We must ensure that once these individuals have been victimized, we  do all we can to help them heal and recover.   This Jackson Lee/Wagner/Maloney Amendment works towards that end.   I ask all members to support the Wagner/Jackson Lee/Maloney Amendment  and I thank the gentlelady from Missouri for her work.                          Notes on Sex Trafficking             Sex Trafficking is an extension of human trafficking         The International Labor Organization estimates that there       are 40.3 million victims of human trafficking globally.        81 percent of them are trapped in forced labor.        25 percent of them are children.        75 percent are women and girls.        The International Labor Organization estimates that forced       labor and human trafficking is a $150 billion industry       worldwide.        The U.S. Department of Labor has identified 148 goods from       75 countries made by forced and child labor.        In 2017, an estimated 1 out of 7 endangered runaways       reported to the National Center for Missing and Exploited       Children were likely child sex trafficking victims.        Of those, 88 percent were in the care of social services or       foster care when they ran.        There is no official estimate of the total number of human       trafficking victims in the U.S. Estimates indicate that the       total number of victims nationally reaches into the hundreds       of thousands when estimates of both adults and minors and sex       trafficking and labor trafficking are aggregated.        From 2007 to 2017, the National Human Trafficking Hotline       has received reports of 34,700 sex trafficking cases inside       the United States.        In 2017, the National Center for Missing & Exploited       Children estimated that 1 in 7 endangered runaways reported       to them were likely sex trafficking victims.        The International Labor Organization estimates that there       are 4.8 million people trapped in forced sexual exploitation       globally.     Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from New York (Mr. Nadler), the chairman of the Judiciary  Committee.    Madam Chair, I am holding up this bill, H.R. 1585.  We are very grateful for the many victims who, once this bill is  passed, will be able to both be honored but also be protected.   At the same time, with the gentlewoman's help, we want to make sure  [[Page H3037]]  that sex trafficked victims are not left out of important historic  legislation like H.R. 1585. With her amendment--and I am pleased to  join it with Congresswoman Maloney--we are ensuring that sex  trafficking and the victims of sex trafficking will be heard, their  voices will be heard. More importantly, there will be resources and  programs that will address their pain but also address their ability to  restore their lives.   I ask my colleagues to support the Wagner-Jackson Lee-Maloney  amendment to H.R. 1585, the Violence Against Women Act.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
