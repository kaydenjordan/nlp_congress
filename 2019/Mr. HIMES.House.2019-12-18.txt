 Madam Speaker, I rise today in anger and hope.   I am angry that President Donald Trump has treated his oath of office  so disrespectfully that now we must hold him to account.   The truth is clear to anyone not deliberately looking away. The  President withheld military aid and a White House meeting unless and  until a vulnerable Ukrainian President announced a nakedly political  investigation.   It didn't matter if the Ukrainians uncovered any wrongdoing. The mere  announcement of an investigation would damage his political opponent.   Mr. Trump didn't care about stopping corruption in Ukraine. He never  mentioned the word ``corruption'' once in the infamous July 25 call.  This was not an attempt to reduce Ukrainian corruption.   It was an attempt by Donald J. Trump to aim Ukrainian corruption  straight at the heart of the Presidential election of 2020.   The President knows this, which is why he has not given this Congress  a single email, phone record, or document.   That is not the behavior of a man with nothing to hide. It is, simply  and undeniably, contempt of this Congress.   But what makes this impeachment essential is that the President's  abuse of power has not stopped. As we speak, he continues to urge  foreign interference in our democracy: beseeching China to investigate  the Bidens, sending Rudy Giuliani overseas to chase Russian conspiracy  theories.   This morning, the President tweeted, ``I did nothing wrong,'' all  caps. He believes it, too. He sees nothing wrong with inviting Russian,  Ukrainian, or Chinese interference into our election.   He did it, he continues to do it, and he sees nothing wrong with it.  He will wake up tomorrow and do it again if we don't stop him today.   Therein lies our hope.  [[Page H12178]]    Madam Speaker, I am proud today to answer the call to defend our  democracy and the United States Constitution, and I urge my colleagues  to do the same.
