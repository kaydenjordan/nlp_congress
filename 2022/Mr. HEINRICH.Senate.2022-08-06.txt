 This amendment disrupts the carefully negotiated  delicate balance of this agreement, putting really the entire  reconciliation vehicle at risk.   Therefore, I would urge my colleagues to vote no on the amendment.                          Vote on Amendment No. 5409     Mr. President, these are all problematic amendments  that would jeopardize the underlying legislation and the progress on  climate, on prescription drugs, and on a whole host of other things. So  we should all vote no. We should pass this important bill, and we  should be done with this.                          Vote on Amendment No. 5487
