 Madam Speaker, I rise today in  recognition of Rachel O'Kelley, the chair of the science department and  a biology teacher at John A. Holmes High School in Edenton, North  Carolina. Earlier this month, she was awarded the prestigious Milken  Educator Award. This national honor is given to teachers who display  distinguished service and commitment to their communities.  [[Page H1197]]    Rachel O'Kelley is 1 of only 40 teachers around the country to  receive this award and the sole honoree for North Carolina. Each and  every day, she goes above and beyond the status quo to challenge and  engage her students through thoughtful, creative, and demanding  activities.   As we strive to entice students to follow the STEM course of study,  it is wonderful to have bright and driven teachers like Rachel who  inspire students to fulfill their potential and form the minds of  future generations.   It is my pleasure to honor Ms. O'Kelley here on the House floor for  her continued devotion to eastern North Carolina's next generation of  leaders.                            ____________________
