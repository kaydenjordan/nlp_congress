 Madam President, today I pay tribute to a great  leader and an exceptional officer of the U.S. Army, COL Thomas von  Eschenbach, now serving as the director, Capabilities Development and  Integration Directorate at the U.S. Army Aviation Center of Excellence  at Fort Rucker, AL, as he prepares to retire from military service on  May 31, 2019.   COL Thomas von Eschenbach has served our Army and our Nation for more  than 28 years. He has been a true professional; a dedicated soldier,  leader, and officer. Throughout his career he has commanded our great  soldiers at many levels; he has deployed to combat numerous times in  defense of the Nation; and he has been assigned critical positions in  our military. Colonel von Eschenbach has provided outstanding  leadership, advice, and sound professional judgment on numerous issues  of enduring importance to the Army, Congress, and this Nation.   A native of Alabama, Colonel von Eschenbach was commissioned a second  lieutenant of aviation upon graduating from Auburn University ROTC as a  Distinguished Military Graduate. His first assignment after flight  school was at Fort Bragg, NC, where he served as a platoon leader,  company executive officer, and battalion staff officer. He next served  in Germany as a troop commander and division staff officer.   Upon his return from Germany, Colonel von Eschenbach served as a  small group leader and later company commander in the Aviation Branch  Captains' Career Course and Warrant Officer Advanced Courses at Fort  Rucker, AL. As a field-grade officer he returned to Fort Bragg and  served as the battalion executive officer and operations officer for an  attack battalion, and later brigade operation officer in the 82nd  Combat Aviation Brigade to include a deployment to Operation Iraqi  Freedom.   After an assignment in Army Human Resources Command, Colonel von  Eschenbach commanded an Air Cavalry Squadron Task Force during a  deployment to Operation Enduring Freedom in Jalalabad, Afghanistan.  After this command, he served on the Army staff as the Deputy Director  for Army Aviation.   For the past 4 years, Colonel von Eschenbach has served as the  director of the Capabilities Development and Integration Directorate at  the U.S. Army Aviation Center of Excellence. In this role he was  responsible to the development of future doctrine and concepts, force  structure, and capability requirements for Army aviation to ensure our  aviation forces and soldiers  [[Page S1985]]  have the right concepts and equipment to prevail in future conflicts.   On behalf of the State of Alabama, the 116th Congress, and the United  States of America, I thank COL Thomas von Eschenbach, U.S. Army, and  his entire family for their commitment, sacrifice, and contributions to  this great Nation. I join my colleagues in wishing Colonel von  Eschenbach future success as he transitions to other opportunities to  serve the Army and our country.                            ____________________
