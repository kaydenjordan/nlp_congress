 Mr. President, today I wish to honor  Mr. President, today I wish to recognize and  congratulate Dr. Ray E. Stowers, the recipient of the prestigious  American Osteopathic Foundation, AOF, Lifetime Achievement Award. This  honor is awarded to outstanding osteopathic doctors who have made  substantial contributions to the profession and exemplified a lifetime  of commitment to the practice. Receiving the award at the AOF honors  gala, Dr. Stowers humbly said, ``Professionally, there's always a sense  of appreciation for being recognized by your profession and for that  I'm very grateful.''   I am grateful for Dr. Stowers' passion for improving community health  and his achievements on this front.   Following the completion of his doctor of osteopathic medicine  degree, Dr. Stowers served rural Kansas and Oklahoma for 25 years,  establishing five rural health clinics and acting as the only physician  for a 300-mile radius. With his passion for rural medicine, he went on  to establish the Oklahoma Rural Health Policy and Research Center to  promote clinical training and telemedicine. This kind of dedication and  innovative thinking demonstrates Dr. Stowers' expertise and desire to  help those in underserved areas.   Dr. Stowers, the proud father of four children and nine  grandchildren, has been named Family Physician of the Year by the  American College of Osteopathic Family Physicians, Physician of the  Year by the Tennessee Osteopathic Medical Association, and was awarded  the Distinguished Service Certificate by the American Osteopathic  Association.   His educational outreach is inspiring. Dr. Stowers founded the  Lincoln Memorial University-DeBusk College of Osteopathic Medicine, and  its auditorium has been named in his honor. Additionally, he acted as  the associate dean for rural health at Oklahoma State University and  now serves as the dean of osteopathic medicine and vice president at  the Arkansas Colleges of Health Education, the first and only private  institution devoted exclusively to healthcare and wellness.   When speaking of his incredible leadership accomplishments as,  president of the American Osteopathic Association and Oklahoma  Osteopathic Association, Dr. Stowers said, ``I was just getting into a  position to make a difference with the way things are. The thing that's  driven me the most is looking where I could make the biggest  difference.'' The world needs more men of the caliber and character of  Dr. Stowers. He is a transformative, influential leader in the field of  osteopathic  [[Page S6914]]  medicine. His continued efforts ``serving the underserved and promoting  a healthier Arkansas'' will help improve countless lives and  communities.   I extend my sincere congratulations to Dr. Stowers on this honor and  thank him for dedicating his career to providing outstanding care and  service to all patients. We can be tremendously proud of his  accomplishments and look forward to his further contributions and  leadership.                            ____________________
