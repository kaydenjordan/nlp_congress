 Mr. Chairman, I rise to strongly oppose the Roskam  amendment which would force a Federal ban on the territories without  our consent.   I am sure Congressman Roskam would not want an amendment forced on  his constituents without his consent or input. All five members from  the territories oppose this amendment, as cockfighting is a culturally  significant practice in many of our islands.   As importantly, this amendment dictates to the territories without  any opportunity for our constituents or their elected representatives  to have any say.   Guam and other territories have enacted local laws to regulate  cockfighting. Congress should not force this on more than 4 million  Americans. Are you aware we are denied the right of a vote against this  amendment on this House floor?   So many issues affecting the territories require Congress' attention:  disaster recovery, poverty, healthcare, infrastructure, education, and  equal voting rights on this floor. That is what we should be thinking  about, and the House should be spending more time addressing these  priorities.   I was not consulted on this matter, and neither were any of the other  representatives from the territories. This is not fair, Mr. Chairman.  This is not fair.   Yes, I agree. We should all be treated equally. Then why aren't the  territories allowed to come down on the floor and to vote for final  passage? That is the question I want to ask you. Let's be fair all the  way.   Mr. Chairman, I ask this sponsor to withdraw this amendment so that  we can provide our input and maybe we can work toward an agreement.  Otherwise, I urge all Members to oppose the Roskam amendment.
