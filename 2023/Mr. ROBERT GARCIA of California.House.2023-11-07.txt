 Mr. Speaker, we all know that Social  Security and Medicare are core promises that we make as a country to  every American. More than 66 million seniors, people with disabilities,  and children rely on Social Security, but make no mistake, my  colleagues in the majority are committed to cutting these programs down  to the bone.   In 2020, even our new Speaker wrote a budget proposal that called for  raising Medicare and Social Security eligibility ages. It called for $2  trillion in cuts to Medicare and $750 billion in cuts to Social  Security. It would be devastating to millions of people, including 8  million veterans who rely on Social Security and Medicare every single  day and middle-class people across the country who would see their  benefits cut. Cost of living increases that seniors rely on would also  be slashed.   The new Speaker is calling for a commission, which would be empowered  to slash Social Security and fast-track his extreme proposals through  Congress.   Speaker Johnson is so out of touch that he also claimed Roe v. Wade  and reproductive rights now require us to make more cuts to Medicare  and Social Security. This is not the agenda the American people accept  or support.   Congress should come together to pass H. Res. 178 and commit to  protecting Social Security and Medicare for all Americans. No cuts and  no stripping benefits away from the people who work for them.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to defeat the previous question so  we can bring up this important legislation.
