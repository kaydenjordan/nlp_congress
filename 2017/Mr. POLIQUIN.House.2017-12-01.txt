 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman. He forgot pine  trees, but that is okay.   Mr. Speaker, I am thrilled to stand up and support H.R. 1699,  Preserving Access to Manufactured Housing Act, and I salute Congressman  Andy Barr from Kentucky to bring this forward.   Maine, Mr. Speaker, has some of the highest homeownership rates in  the country. We love our homes in Maine. I represent the rural part of  our State, and in our State, Mr. Speaker, we have times of the year  where the weather is pretty tough.   If you are building a home that is not manufactured in a warehouse,  sometimes you literally cannot build that home because of the weather,  the snow, and the cold, and what have you. But there is nothing more  important, Mr. Speaker, nothing more important than making sure moms  and dads across America and across Maine have an option, have as many  options as possible to house their kids, to take care of their kids,  and make sure they are safe. Manufactured housing, in many parts of the  country, is the only affordable option.   Now, H.R. 1699 makes a small, technical change such that folks who  want to get into a home and want to take part in the great American  Dream of homeownership have the opportunity to get a loan to do this.   Government, Mr. Speaker, is supposed to help our families, not get in  the way. Here is an example of us being able to remove an unnecessary  restriction that hurts our families and prevents them from having an  opportunity to get in their first home.   We need more options, not less, Mr. Speaker. Let's help our families  and not get in the way. I salute Mr. Barr for this great bill. I am  fully in support of this. Let's help our families get into manufactured  homes if this is what they want and this is what they can afford.
