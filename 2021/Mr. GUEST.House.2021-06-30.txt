 Madam Speaker, tonight the eyes of the Nation will be on  TD Ameritrade Park in Omaha, Nebraska, as the Mississippi State  Bulldogs face the Vanderbilt Commodores to determine who will be  crowned the national champion in NCAA Baseball.   Mississippi State will not only be playing for their fellow students,  the faculty, and alumni, but also for our great State as they seek to  bring home the first Division 1 National Baseball Championship in  Mississippi history.   Led by the offense of Tanner Allen, Rowdey Jordan, and Kamren James  and the pitching of Will Bednar and Landon Sims, this group of athletes  has brought life and excitement back to the people of Mississippi in  the wake of a deadly pandemic.   We could not be prouder of these young men and all that they have  accomplished. Tonight, I and the entire State of Mississippi will be  hanging on every pitch of this winner-take-all game at the College  World Series.   Good luck and Hail State.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, this legislation includes more than $715  billion in wasteful spending.   One out of every two dollars would go toward Green New Deal  requirements. Funding for passenger rail for big cities has been  increased eight-fold in this bill, sacrificing our rural roads and  bridges for costly urban projects. The Electric Charging Station Grant  Program in this bill would receive four times more funding than a rural  grant program and take away funding from States that don't comply; even  in States like Mississippi, which has less than 1,000 electric  vehicles.   This bill is bad for our economy. It is bad for our rural States. And  without significant change, this bill is bad for America.                                time  1800
