 Madam Chair, as I travel throughout my district, I  hear Arizona's concerns about the integrity of our elections, our  elected leaders, and those who serve them in the highest positions of  our government.   At a time when millions of Americans feel uncertain about the state  of our democracy, Congress must act.  [[Page H2519]]    I am proud to support H.R. 1, which will strengthen our democracy and  close ethics loopholes.   I want to thank the chairwoman and the ranking member for agreeing to  adopt my three amendments to the underlying bill. These amendments,  which include my Taxpayers DIME Act and my Protecting Defense Dollars  Act, will do right by our taxpayers by increasing transparency and  accountability when it comes to travel, including on government and  military aircraft.   These amendments will crack down on bureaucrats abusing ethics rules  in place of lavish travel on private jets, first-class flights, and  more. Several of these amendments have previously received bipartisan  support.   Regardless of party, those who serve the American public must be held  to the highest ethical standards. Our ability to hold government  officials accountable to taxpayers is a hallmark of our democracy, and  we must work to uphold that right.   Again, I thank my colleagues for including my commonsense amendments  in this package.
