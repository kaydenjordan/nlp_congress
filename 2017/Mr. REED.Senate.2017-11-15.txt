 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the nomination of  Dr. Mark Esper to serve as the next Secretary of the Army. The Senate  Armed Services Committee held a hearing on his nomination on November  2, and he was voted out of committee shortly thereafter.   Dr. Esper is a proud graduate of the U.S. Military Academy. Following  his graduation from West Point, Dr. Esper served as a rifle platoon  leader and subsequently deployed with the 101st Airborne Division  during the 1991 Gulf war. He went on to command an airborne rifle  company that supported a NATO rapid reaction force. As such, Dr. Esper  has learned the trade of a soldier from the very basics, leading other  young Americans in combat. To me, that is probably the best training  one could have to be a Secretary of any service.   Following Dr. Esper's active duty service, he transferred to the  Virginia National Guard. He ultimately retired with the rank of  lieutenant colonel.   In addition to Dr. Esper's military career, he also has a wealth of  public policy service, having worked on Capitol Hill as Majority Leader  Bill Frist's national security adviser, as well as serving in the  Department of Defense during President George W. Bush's administration.   Finally, for the past 7 years, Dr. Esper has worked at Raytheon,  where he rose to the senior echelons of the company to serve as the  vice president for Government Relations.   The U.S. Army is one of our greatest institutions, and if Dr. Esper  is confirmed today, he will be leading an organization at a time in  which it is facing many challenges. Most urgently, the Army must  continue to improve full spectrum readiness while, at the same time,  deploy soldiers around the world.   The Army also continues to grapple with modernizing the force, to  include how best to make targeted investments in programs and canceling  those efforts that are underperforming or are cost prohibitive.  [[Page S7230]]    Based on Dr. Esper's qualifications and experience, as well as his  testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee, I will vote in  favor of his nomination to be the next Secretary of the Army.   Dr. Esper's unique perspective will enable him to tackle many  challenges facing the Army head-on, and I trust that as the next  Secretary of the Army, he will do his best to lead the men and women,  and their families, who serve this Nation so ably and courageously.   Once again, I would like to say that with his experience as an  infantry platoon leader at the front, with soldiers of the 101st  Airborne Division, he knows--as few people do--the real cost of our  national security and the real challenge of being in our Army. It is  keeping faith with those men and women and it is doing everything they  can and we can to protect this Nation. With that experience, I am very  confident that he will be an extraordinary Secretary of the Army.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER.
