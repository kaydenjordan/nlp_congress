 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to H.J. Res.  30.   When we, as Americans, are given the opportunity to know what  investments to make, the kind of investments that we can make, and the  kind of impacts that they will have, that matters. That choice should  always be with each one of us. The investments that we make might have  an impact on the rest of the world.   Many of us would be outraged if we knew that our investments went  toward forced labor activities in China and other parts of the world.  Yet, this resolution would make it difficult for hardworking Americans  to determine what investments are being made in their name.   Our constituents deserve the freedom to access this information and  to have the right to ensure that their money is being invested in a way  that is aligned with their values.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to reject this resolution and  protect the rights of Americans to make financial and moral decisions  about the kind of investments that they want their retirement to be  made of.
