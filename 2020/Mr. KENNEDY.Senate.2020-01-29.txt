 Mr. Chief Justice, along with Senator Blackburn and  Senator Cornyn, I send a question to the desk for the House managers  and for counsel to the President.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. In the case of such a question, addressed to both  sides, they will split the 5 minutes equally.   The Senators ask:         Why did the House of Representatives not challenge       President Trump's claims of executive privilege and/or       immunity during the House impeachment proceedings?    We will begin with the House managers.   Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. Mr. Chief Justice, distinguished Senators,  thank you for your question. The answer is simple. We did not challenge  any claims related to executive privilege because, as the President's  own counsel admitted during this trial, the President never raised the  question of executive privilege.   What the President did raise was this notion of blanket defiance,  this notion that the executive branch, directed by the President, could  completely defy any and all subpoenas issued by the  [[Page S650]]  House of Representatives, not turn over documents, not turn over  witnesses, not produce a single shred of information in order to allow  us to present the truth to the American people.   In the October 8 letter that was sent to the House of  Representatives, there was no jurisprudence that was cited to justify  the notion of blanket defiance. There has been no case law cited to  justify the doctrine of absolute immunity. In fact, every single court  that has considered any Presidential claims of absolute immunity such  as the one asserted by the White House has rejected it out of hand.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Counsel for the President.   Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Justice, Senators, thank you for that  question.   Let me frame this partly in response to what Manager Jeffries said,  and I went through this before. The idea that there was blanket  defiance and no explanation and no case law from the White House is  simply incorrect. I put up slides showing the letter--the letter from  October 18 that explains specifically that the subpoenas that had been  issued by the House, because they were not authorized by a vote from  the House, were invalid. And there was a letter from the White House  counsel saying that. There was a letter from OMB saying that. There was  a letter from the State Department saying that. There was specific  rationale given, citing cases--Watkins, Rumely, and others--explaining  that defect. The House managers--the House, Manager Schiff--chose not  to take any steps to correct that.   We also pointed out other defects.   We asserted the doctrine of absolute immunity for senior advisers to  the President, which has been asserted by every President since the  1970s. They chose not to challenge that in court.   We also explained the problem that they didn't allow agency counsel  to be present at depositions. They chose not to challenge that in  court.   These are specific legal reasons, not blanket defiance. That is a  misrepresentation of the record. And there was no attempt to have that  adjudicated in court. The reason there was no attempt is that the House  Democrats were just in a hurry. They had a timetable. One of the House  managers said on the floor here--they had no time for courts. They had  to impeach the President before the election, so they had to have that  done by Christmas. That is why the proper process wasn't followed here,  because it was a partisan and political impeachment that they wanted to  get done all around timing for the election.    Thank you.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, counsel.   The Senator from Vermont.    Senator Moran, my colleague from Kansas, and I send a  question to the desk for counsel for the President.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you.   The question is for counsel for the President:         What did Hunter Biden do for the money that Burisma       holdings paid him?    Ms. Counsel BONDI. Thank you for the question.   Mr. Chief Justice, Senators, as far as we know, Hunter Biden has said  he ``attended a couple of board meetings a year.'' Here is what we do  know: Hunter Biden did attend one board meeting in Monaco. Now, we also  heard that when Zlochevsky--the owner of Burisma--fled the Ukraine, he  was living in Monaco. So Hunter Biden did attend a board meeting in  Monaco. We also know that Hunter Biden went to Norway on a fishing  trip, and he took his daughter and his nephew. So he took two of Joe  Biden's children with him on a fishing trip to Norway with Zlochevsky.  That is as much as we know, other than his statement that he attended  one or two board meetings.   Factually, that is what he said, and the timeline shows that. Again,  Devon Archer was on the board with him, and then Hunter Biden remained  on the board. Factually, in the record, that is as much as we know that  he did involving Burisma and Zlochevsky.   The Norway trip was in June of 2015. He remained on the board until  April of 2019. We also know that, prior to then, a Ukrainian court in  September of 2016 canceled Zlochevsky's arrest warrant. We also know,  on December 15, Vice President Biden called President Poroshenko. Then,  in mid-January 2017, Burisma announced all legal proceedings against  the company and Zlochevsky had been closed.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Democratic leader is recognized.
