 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, we spend a lot of time in this House focusing on that  which we disagree on. I think if we spent more time focusing on what we  have been able to do together and agree on, we would be a better House.   So I rise not to talk about the disagreements that the Speaker and I  had, we had many differences, we are of different parties, and we had  different perspectives, but I rise and thank Speaker McCarthy for that  on which we could agree, because when we could agree, he took that  opportunity to act upon that agreement.   It was good for the House, it was good for the country, and it was  good for me.   So I thank Kevin for what we agreed upon and what we were able to do  together here and abroad to try to bring us together, try to lift us  up, and try to make sure that when we could work together we did work  together.                                time  1200    It is an example that we ought to follow because it was a positive  example.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Calvert for giving me the opportunity to  come to this floor as a former majority leader, as a partisan Democrat,  to say and recognize the work that Speaker McCarthy did to try to, when  we could, move forward in agreement in a positive, constructive way.  Good luck and Godspeed.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding. He is one of  the great gentlemen of this institution, a man of faith, a man of great  intellect, a man whose heart and conscience form his stances on issues.  I am so blessed to be his friend.   Mr. Speaker, save for the gentleman from Texas, these seats are  empty. The House of Representatives has adjourned for the year. We have  adjourned to go home.   Mr. Speaker, I say we have adjourned. We won't adjourn technically  until we finish special orders and perhaps 1 minutes. We have no more  business, but we have an unfinished agenda, an unfinished agenda to  confront the enemies of freedom and democracy.   Mr. Speaker, when President Zelenskyy came to our Nation's Capital  back in September, he visited the Declaration of Independence and the  United States Constitution in the National Archives. Standing before  our Nation's founding documents, he said, and I quote President  Zelenskyy: ``It is not the evil empire but the lack of unity that can  bring freedom to its knees.''   He reiterated that message this week as our Members prepare and are  currently returning home for the holidays. We get to return home and  celebrate with our families in comfort and warmth. Mr. Speaker, the  Ukrainians huddled amid snow and mud on the front lines of freedom will  not have that luxury. The tens of thousands of Ukrainian children  abducted by Putin's regime do not get that privilege. Neither do their  families.   Zelenskyy is right, Mr. Speaker. We do face another evil empire  today, a new axis of evil: Vladimir Putin, Xi Jinping, Kim Jong-un, and  the autocrats in Iran and in other parts of the world and its many  proxies, including Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthi rebels, and others who  all stand as threats to democracy and freedom.   As these dictators and despots continue their assault on democracy,  freedom, and international law, they watch whether the free world, of  which we should be and for all intents and purposes are the leader of,  waiting for that free world to stand together to oppose them. We will  not have that opportunity until 25 days from now.   These past few months, Congress had an opportunity to send them that  message of unity and strength. We have not done that.   Over 300 Members of the House, Mr. Speaker, voted to provide Ukraine  additional aid all seven times it came to this floor. We are not not  united on this issue. We simply have not brought it to the floor to  express that unity and message to all the world.   An overwhelming majority of Members also wanted to provide aid to  Israel, including myself. Mr. Speaker, Speaker Johnson acknowledged the  need to aid our allies, saying in Florida the other day: ``Ukraine is  another priority. Of course, we can't allow Vladimir Putin to march  through Europe, and we understand the necessity of assisting there.''   Mr. Speaker, we have all gone home without undertaking that  responsibility. Sadly, we apparently don't understand the urgency of  that assistance.   Instead of giving us a clean vote to act on that consensus, Speaker  Johnson needlessly complicated the issue by tying it to his  Conference's partisan proposal to overhaul our border policy.   That decision, Mr. Speaker, was inconsistent with his cosponsorship  of H.R. 395 back in 2017, which said the purpose of that bill was ``to  end the practice of including more than one subject in a single bill .  . . enacted by Congress.''   Mr. Speaker, the reason we have not acted on Israel, the reason we  have not acted on Ukraine, the reason we have not come to the defense  of democracy and freedom in Ukraine and to oppose terrorism in Israel,  the reason is contrary to that one-purpose bill that Speaker Johnson  was the sponsor of. He wants to put multiple issues in that, including  border security, which we have been working on for 15 years but haven't  been able to come to consensus.   We should be and we are in consensus on Ukraine, but we did not act.  Evidently, they think that ethical principles only apply when it is  politically convenient.   I agree that we need to fix the broken immigration system and address  the situation at the border, but this is not the way to do it, not at  the expense of the defense of freedom and democracy.   House Republican leadership spent the last week advancing a sham  impeachment inquiry, a bill about whole milk, and legislation about  duck stamps while Ukraine twisted in the wind. Our House should have  had only one priority this week--ensuring democracy's survival.   By failing to provide this aid, our Congress signaled to our friends  and  [[Page H6974]]  foes alike that America chooses reluctance over resolve, doubt over  determination, and division over decisiveness. That posture of  uncertainty puts our national security at risk.   The America First contingent of the Republican Party sends an even  more damaging message. Time and time again, leaders of the American far  right praise Putin, demonize Ukraine, and spread misinformation about  the war.   Tucker Carlson, once one of the most-watched people on American TV,  has become one of the most-watched people on Russian state television,  where propagandists often play clips of his segments.   President Trump continues to play into Putin's hands, as well. Trump  recently said that if reelected in 2024, he would end the war in  Ukraine within 24 hours. There is only one way to do that--give up,  retreat, turn tail on the defense of democracy and Putin.   In response--and this is instructive--Putin said, ``We cannot help  but feel happy about it,'' meaning Trump's claim that he would end the  war in 24 hours. Giving up is the only way to do that.   Mr. Speaker, we have seen this kowtowing just recently on Capitol  Hill. This week, Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene tweeted:  ``Zelenskyy is here in D.C. today begging for your money, and  warmongering Washington wants to give him limitless American dollars.''   That, of course, is not true, but it warms the heart of Vladimir  Putin. She went on to say: ``How much money will Washington spend to  slaughter an entire generation of young Ukrainian men as Washington  fights its proxy war with Russia?''   I can remember, because I have been here a long time, when Republican  friends accused the Democratic side of the aisle of too often blaming  America first. Of course, that is what Marjorie Taylor Greene said.   It is disgusting to say that we are slaughtering Ukrainians when  Putin's forces are doing just that every day.   We are doing everything possible to keep Ukrainians alive. Ukrainians  courageously give their lives, as so many of our American forebearers  have done, in defense of their country, in defense of their  sovereignty, and in defense of their people's lives. Ukrainians  courageously give their lives to defend their democracy, their country,  and their families.   They will continue to do so with or without our support. Our aid,  however, may well determine whether their sacrifice leads to victory or  defeat. Yet, Mr. Speaker, the chairs are empty.   In another tweet, Congresswoman Greene asked: ``Why doesn't anyone in  Washington talk about a peace treaty with Russia, a deal with Putin  promising he will not continue any further invasions?'' Putin's  promises have no credibility.   ``Washington wants war,'' she said, ``not peace.''   That is a lie. Washington wants peace, but it is not prepared to pay  for peace with being dominated by a dictator.   Believe me, we want peace, but we want a peace that lasts. A promise  of peace from Putin is worthless. He is a former KGB officer turned  dictator who has built his career one lie, one deception, and one  betrayal at a time.   He already broke one peace agreement, the 1994 Budapest Memorandum,  in which Putin, on behalf of Russia, agreed to respect Ukraine's  sovereignty and borders in exchange for Ukraine's nuclear arsenal.                                time  1245    He has the nuclear arsenal. Ukraine was either the third or fourth  largest holder of nuclear weapons in the world, and they gave them up  in return for Putin's promise that their borders would be secured and  unviolated.   Then it went into Crimea, and the West's response was weak. He is in  Crimea today, notwithstanding the fact that that is under Ukrainian  sovereignty.   Putin went back on that pledge when he took Crimea. He didn't stop  with Crimea, however. He went into eastern Ukraine, and there is no  reason to expect that he will stop with Ukraine.   Winston Churchill once said, an appeaser is one who hopes that if he  feeds the crocodile enough, the crocodile will eat him last, but surely  the crocodile will eat him.   John F. Kennedy shared the same wisdom in his book, ``Why England  Slept.'' He wrote, ``Any person will awaken when the house is burning  down. What we need is an armed guard that will wake up when the fire  first starts or, better yet, one that will not permit a fire to start  at all.''   The seats in this House are empty today while the fire threatens  democracy and freedom in Ukraine, which is the front line of democracy  and freedom today.   Mr. Speaker, the fire rages. Our inaction only stokes the flames. If  you don't believe me, listen to what Russian State TV is saying. Allow  me to quote from the transcript of a broadcast earlier this week: What  is happening in the U.S. is beneficial for us. That is a quote from  Russian TV, controlled by Putin.   The seats are empty, and Putin is happy.   They went on to say: ``Ukraine is losing. Russia is winning. This is  it. Their funding and weapons came to an end.''   They were relying on the United States of America, that shining city  on the hill that stands for freedom, individual rights, democracy,  religious freedom. That beacon on the hill is less bright today because  these seats are empty.   Putin said: As of now, well done, Republicans--his words, not mine-- well done, Republicans, for standing firm. That is good for us.   ``Us'' is Russia. ``Us'' is the dictator. ``Us'' is the aggressor.  ``Us'' is the international lawbreaker, criminal, and murderer.   Just a few hours ago, at an end-of-the-year press conference, Vladmir  Putin said of Ukraine: ``Everything is coming from the West, but the  free things will run out some day, and it seems it is already  happening.''   In other words, Putin is saying the West is retreating from the  defense of freedom, and the seats in this body are empty.   There is nothing that Putin and the rest of the axis of evil likes to  see more than our Congress divided, our country divided, and our  coalition divided. We must not give them that satisfaction.   If we neglect to send these resources without condition and without  delay, we fail not only the people of Ukraine, but the people of Israel  and the people in Palestine, to whom we want to give relief and  humanitarian aid.   We fail the America envisioned by our Founding Fathers, a Nation with  the courage to stand up to forces of empire and despotism. We fall  short of the principles they enshrined in our founding documents, the  very same documents that President Zelenskyy made his pilgrimage to a  few months ago.   Mr. Speaker, when we return to the Capitol on January 9, each Member  of this Congress will face a choice. Will we, as Zelenskyy said, allow  freedom to be brought to its knees or, Mr. Speaker, will we be standing  strong, standing united against the evil empire.   Regrettably, the seats are empty today.   Every week, every day, every hour we fail to act, we risk allowing  the enemies of freedom to make that decision for us. We must not let  that happen.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me the time.
