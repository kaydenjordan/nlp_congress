 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule I, I demand a  vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the Journal.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a  quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not  present.    Madam Speaker, I rise today to, once again, express my  sincere support for AM radio.   Yesterday, my good friend, Representative Jake LaTurner of Kansas,  and I led a bipartisan resolution promoting the use of AM radios in  automobiles.   Not only is AM radio a pillar of our communication infrastructure,  but it is a beacon of our resilience and a representation of our unity  as a nation.   It connects us. It informs us. At times, it has saved us.   One in five Americans regularly turns to a radio station for their  local news, and nearly one-half of all adults in our great Nation  derive part of their news from radio broadcasts--not TV, not social  media, but radio.   Our AM radio stations reach a staggering monthly audience of 82  million Americans.   This is not a voice whispering into the void. This is a loudspeaker  that broadcasts to the masses. It is a reliable source of news and  information to tens of millions of citizens.   Madam Speaker, let's keep the airwaves alive. Let's keep the people  informed. Let's keep AM radio in our cars and trucks.                            ____________________
