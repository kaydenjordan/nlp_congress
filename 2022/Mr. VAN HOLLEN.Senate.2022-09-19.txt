 Mr. President, throughout the past five decades, the  Senate has recognized the important role of the Uniformed Services  University of the Health Sciences--USUHS--in maintaining the health and  readiness of our Nation's uniformed services. Today, I am proud to  congratulate this fine institution, located in Bethesda, in my State of  Maryland, on its 50th anniversary.   Public Law 92-426 established USUHS in 1972 to ensure continuity and  leadership for uniformed medicine. USUHS is our country's only Federal  graduate and undergraduate degree-granting health sciences university  in support of the Department of Defense--DOD--and the Nation. Since its  founding, USUHS has graduated more than 11,000 military health  professionals.   USUHS has met every goal and mission envisioned by the founders of  this remarkable institution. It is the only institute of higher  learning to provide a unique military curriculum that educates and  trains leaders in healthcare relevant to the military mission. USUHS  provides its students a rigorous healthcare education combined with  equally demanding training in leadership, military medicine, and public  health. Students learn in a variety of settings, including modern  classrooms and laboratories, a renowned simulation center, major  military hospitals and clinics, summer operational experiences with  military units, and progressively challenging field exercises. Students  leave USUHS prepared to care in any setting, from a modern tertiary  care hospital or primary care clinic, to the sickbay of a warship, the  cargo bay of a critical care air transport flight, an operating room in  a combat support hospital, or a treatment tent in a refugee camp.   The USUHS Hebert School of Medicine, compared with any other U.S.  medical school, contributes the highest number of physician accessions  to the military services. USUHS alumni comprise 25 percent of the  Military Health System physician force. An independent analysis of  USUHS conducted by the Institute for Defense Analysis found that, on a  value basis that factors in retention, USUHS may offer the highest  return on physician education and training investments. They concluded  that USUHS graduates deployed more than 250 percent longer than other  accession sources--an average of 731 days compared to 266--have higher  proportions of officers in the mid- and senior-rank levels compared to  other accession sources, have higher representation in special  operation units compared to other accession sources, and attain a  higher percentage of specialty board certification compared to other  accession sources. The school's graduate education programs in  biomedical sciences, public health, clinical psychology, health  professions education, and health policy have granted more than 1,000  graduate degrees. Many of these alumni are now serving as key leaders  in the Federal Government, academia, research foundations and  laboratories, and in public health. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic,  USUHS School of Medicine alumni supported under-resourced communities,  as well as national and global preparedness and response efforts, and  were involved in evaluating new COVID-19 test methods, including those  that received emergency use authorization approvals. The USUHS Daniel  K. Inouye Graduate School of Nursing educates advanced practice nurses  for the Federal Nursing Chiefs to provide the Nation with the highest  quality graduate nurse clinicians, scientists, scholars, and leaders  dedicated to Federal service, health readiness, and global engagement.  Its nurse anesthesia program is consistently ranked among the top four  in the country by U.S. News & World Report's Best Graduate School  rankings, which also ranks the school's doctor of nursing practice  degree program in the top 13 percent in the country. The USUHS Graduate  School of Nursing has received multiple national recognitions and was  acknowledged by the National League for nursing twice, as a Center of  Excellence for enhanced student learning and faculty development. The  USUHS postgraduate dental college's 19 postgraduate dental specialties  and 26 postgraduate year-1 programs ensure that military dentists  attain advanced skill sets beyond those acquired upon graduation from  dental school. These advanced dental skills are essential to meeting  the needs of warfighters before, during, and after military operations.  The university's college of allied health sciences awards undergraduate  college credit and degrees to enlisted medical professionals and  trainees and has graduated more than 3,500 students from its 23  programs since its inception.   Over the past five decades, USUHS has played a critical role in  national defense, in times of war and peace. USUHS graduates continue  to be integral to combat deployments, humanitarian missions, disaster  response, and public health crisis response throughout the world. USUHS  provides its expertise to DOD and the Nation in global health, TBI,  PTSD, disaster medicine, neuroscience, and human performance. During  the recent wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the Military Health System  achieved the highest rate of survival from battlefield injury in the  history of the world. USUHS graduates and faculty have not only made  important contributions to clinical practice in combat environments  around the world, but to medical science and research, benefiting both  the military and the public at large.   The value of the university's science is increasingly recognized by  the National Institutes of Health--NIH--and other funders; USUHS is  ranked 80 of  [[Page S4819]]  900 U.S. institutions of higher learning, putting it in the top 10th  percentile in total research and development expenditures by the  National Science Foundation. USUHS researchers generate high-impact  military-relevant discoveries and products to protect the health of our  forces and assure the national health security of the United States.  Since its founding, USUHS has filed more than 2,273 patents for  research discoveries and technology inventions. Its faculty have been  the recipient of eight consecutive Federal Laboratory Consortium  Technology Transfer Awards for their ground-breaking work.   USUHS's centers focus on advancing research, education, and public  health. Its National Center for Disaster Medicine and Public Health has  been at the forefront of the national Stop the Bleed and First Aid for  Severe Trauma campaigns to encourage bystanders and high school  students. USUHS was designated as the Nation's first National Stop the  Bleed Campus in 2019. The USUHS Center for Biotechnology--4DBio3--uses  3D printers to produce military-relevant medical products in extreme  austere environments for the benefit of our warfighters. It has also  developed technology to generate red blood cells which would allow for  whole blood transfusion and could become the answer to blood shortages  on the battlefield, other remote locations, and in hospitals. The  Surgical Critical Care Initiative at USUHS created an application to  accurately predict whether a patient, who has just been admitted to the  emergency room, would need a massive blood transfusion. USUHS  researchers and trauma surgeons have also led the development of  knowledge, skills, and abilities metrics that are being used to inform  changes to patient workflow, increasing surgical workloads, and,  ultimately, enhancing readiness within the Military Health System.  These KSA metrics have proven vital to measuring military surgeons'  individual clinical skills readiness, while also providing data to  leadership, increasing clinical readiness-generating workload within  the MHS.   USUHS has long met and exceeded the original intent of its founders  to educate a career cadre of physicians to support our Nation's  military. Over the past 50 years, USUHS has contributed immeasurably to  the health and future of our Nation, through its stellar education and  training programs, its innovative research, and its development of the  next generation of military medical leaders and scientists. I am  delighted to recognize and congratulate the remarkable students,  faculty, and staff of USUHS for their outstanding work and commitment  to serving our country, and my best wishes for a happy golden  anniversary to our Nation's Uniformed Services University of the Health  Sciences.                            ____________________
