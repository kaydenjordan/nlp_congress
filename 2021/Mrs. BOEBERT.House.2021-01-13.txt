 Glory to God.   Madam Speaker, I rise today to oppose this impeachment and denounce  the recent violence on the Capitol, just as I opposed the previous  impeachment and the violence we have all witnessed all summer long  across our great country.   Make no mistake here, the hypocrisy of the left is on full display.         Go to the Hill. Get in the face of some Congresspeople. We       have got to fight in Congress, fight in the courts, fight in       the streets. Take him behind the gym and beat the hell out of       him. Go and take Trump out tonight.    Sound familiar? What about the gentlewoman from New York who defended  the looting by saying looters just want loaves of bread? The last I  checked, Best Buy and Tesla and stores of the like do not produce baked  goods.   Where is the accountability for the left after encouraging and  normalizing violence? Rather than actually helping American people in  this time, we start impeachments that further divide our country.   I call bull crap when I hear the Democrats demanding unity. Sadly,  they are only unified in hate.
