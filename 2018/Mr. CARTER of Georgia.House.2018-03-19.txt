 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding. I also thank him for his leadership in this area and for  putting this together tonight. This is an important message that all  Americans should hear and that all Americans will share in.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak about the benefits already  impacting the First Congressional District of Georgia since the Tax  Cuts and Jobs Act was signed into law.   A few weeks ago, I traveled the district and visited with businesses,  with students, and with senior citizens to discuss how tax reform is  helping them.   Nine Line Apparel, a business in Savannah, told me that the Tax Cuts  and Jobs Act allows them to give more to their employees, a small  difference helping their employees to take vacations, buy Christmas  presents for their children, and make it easier to provide for their  families.   Lee Container Company in Homerville, which I visited a couple of  weeks ago, said the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will enable them to purchase  more equipment and grow their business.   I also had the opportunity, Mr. Speaker, to visit with students at  Savannah State University. I shared my excitement that, for upcoming  graduates, job creation from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will generate  high demand for employees, increasing wages and making the job search  easier than it has been in years past. Needless to say, they were  excited to hear this good news.   Mr. Speaker, the results from my trips around the district were  encouraging, and I am proud we could pass tax reform benefiting all  income levels, American businesses, and our whole economy.   Mr. Speaker, this legislation will truly go down as some of the most  significant tax reform this country has ever seen. It is certainly the  most significant tax reform in the last 30 years.   The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will put money in people's pockets, will  stimulate our economy, will create jobs. It is good for our economy and  good for our country.
