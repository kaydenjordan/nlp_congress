 Madam Speaker, due to a medical condition, I was unable to  vote on the following Roll Call on February 13, 2020.   Had I been present, I would have voted: ``yea'' on rollcall No. 70  (Final Passage of H.J. Res. 79)--Removing the deadline for the  ratification of the equal rights amendment (Rep. Speier--Judiciary).
