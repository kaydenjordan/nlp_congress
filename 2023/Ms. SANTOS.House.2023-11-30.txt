 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, every Member expelled in the history of this institution  has been convicted of crimes or were Confederate turncoats guilty of  treason. Neither of those apply to me, but here we are.   On what basis does this body feel that precedent must be changed for  me?   Mr. Speaker, I am an American citizen, duly elected, and elected to  represent the Third District of New York. I have been convicted of no  crimes.   My loyalty to this country that gave me life, liberty, and the  pursuit of happiness is true and unquestionable. I stand here today  debating for the second time in less than a month for the same exact  reasons that were brought up last time.   The difference is that one can say I have been indicted once more by  the findings of the Ethics Committee--a process that, by the admission  of the chair himself, was not complete and conclusive because they  didn't want to put more time into it, as if this committee runs on a  schedule that, quite frankly, is in a rush.   Mr. Speaker, some Members have been under investigation for over 5  years. Some leave while still under investigation. I am not trying to  be arrogant or spiteful or disrespectful of the committee, but I am  curious to know: What is the schedule of the Ethics Committee?   Why rush this? To deliver a predetermined outcome sought out by some  Members of our Conference or some Members of this body?   This is what it looks like to me. It is a predetermined necessity for  some Members in this body to engage in this smear campaign to destroy  me. I will not stand by quietly. If they want me out of this body--the  people of the Third District of New York sent me here--if they want me  out, they are going to have to go silence those people and take the  hard vote.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1500
