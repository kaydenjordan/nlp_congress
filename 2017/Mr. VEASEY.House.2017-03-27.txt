 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include any extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, today's Special Order is going to be about  the theme: What do we have to lose?   That was something that you heard during the Presidential campaign.  Specifically, we want to focus on what do we have to lose: $54 billion  in domestic spending.   Earlier this month, President Trump released his budget named America  First, a Budget Blueprint to Make America Great Again. After reading  Trump's budget, I can't help but wonder: Is this truly a mirror of his  campaign to put Americans first?   The easy answer to that is ``no.''   According to the Trump budget, America comes dead last. In fact, this  budget proposal is all talk when it comes to helping U.S. students  access education and well-paying jobs. One of the most alarming things  about the budget is how it affects the education of students at  minority-serving institutions.   Mr. Speaker, HBCUs, Historically Black Colleges and Universities,  were first created in 1964 to educate Black Americans excluded from  segregated public and private universities, and this budget will  perpetuate the inequalities that currently exist for Black students.   Today, HBCUs continue to provide students--no matter their race or  their economic background for that matter--the ability to receive a  quality education. According to the United Negro College Fund, 70  percent of all HBCU students rely on Federal grants and workstudy  programs to finance their education.   After Trump pledged to support and strengthen HBCUs during a meeting  with the presidents of HBCUs in the Oval Office, the budget at hand is  another unfulfilled promise. A recent letter from the president of the  UNCF, United Negro College Fund, explained the complete elimination of  the Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants, as proposed  under the Trump budget. This would negatively impact more than 55,000  HBCU students.   Helping low-income students achieve higher education is very serious,  and we know that these cuts would hurt. Proposed reductions would also  hurt the Federal workstudy initiatives, and it would eliminate another  26,000 students the ability to pay for college expenses or to improve  their employment prospects.   I knew a lot of students who worked under the college workstudy  program when I was a student in college, and I can tell you just how  critical that program is. For a lot of kids, that is the difference  between going to college and not being able to go to college. Having  that job on campus allows you to earn money, but stay on campus,  affording you more time to be able to study and do other things that  you need to do in order to be a successful student.   Also, according to the Center for American Progress, the Trump budget  will hit minority communities the hardest. The budget also calls for  $200 million in cuts to Federal TRIO programs, which help low-income,  first-generation, and disabled students; and GEAR UP, a program that  helps prepare low-income middle and high school students for college.   It shouldn't be any surprise to us that President Trump would want to  gut funding to help disabled students succeed. We saw this sort of  nastiness on the campaign trail, and we really do need to see how we  can, again, boost these programs because they have been helping so many  kids for a long time.   I can tell you of someone who utilized a Pell Grant Program. I am  sure there are many Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle that  had to use the Pell Grant Program. Similarly, the Trump budget keeps  the Pell Grant Program, but it cuts $3.9 billion in critical funding  for many students.   According to the National Center for Education Statistics, the Pell  Grant Program is the largest Federal grant program. The same study  found that the program sends up to $5,900 to students and families that  earn less than $40,000 a year and prioritizes funding for families  earning closer to $20,000 or less.   Again, if you are a low-income family, being able to utilize that  money, particularly at that level--$40,000 and below, $20,000 and  below--even if you were doing a little bit better than that, you know  that that is not a lot of money, and that is why these Pell Grant  Programs are so important.    Pell Grant continues to be an important program that helps level the  playing field for African Americans and helps to minimize student loans  after graduation.   A study by Brookings reported that Black students who graduated, as  of October 2016, owed over $52,000 in student loan debt, compared to  White graduates who owed approximately $28,000. By reducing funding,  Trump is limiting a child's ability to achieve economic mobility and  move toward the American Dream.   I am going to ask that my colleague from the great sunshine State of  Florida (Mrs. Demings), who is going to help lead this Special Order  hour, talk a little bit about how important a lot of these programs are  to her State. Her State has many great universities, including, in  Tallahassee, Florida A&M University, one of our Historically Black  Colleges and Universities that have produced so many great graduates  from that school. Although the African-American students may not go to  FAMU--but they may go to Florida State, they may go to Gainesville to  the University of Florida, they may go to the University of Miami--they  need this money in order to be successful.   In the gentlewoman from Florida's work as a Member of Congress and  her previous work in law enforcement, the gentlewoman works closely  with families, with kids who are trying to pull themselves up and make  a difference. I think that America would love to hear from the  gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. Demings) just because she has seen  firsthand, again, what these grants, this job training, TRIO, and these  other programs mean to these students.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. Demings).    Mr. Speaker, we have a lot to talk about tonight dealing  with HBCUs, dealing with TRIO, dealing with these programs like GEAR  UP, Pell Grants, jobs and job training, college workstudy.   I want to invite one of our colleagues up, one of our leaders,  Representative Jim Clyburn from the State of South Carolina. One of the  demographics that often go overlooked in this debate is the plight of  rural African-American students. Representative Clyburn, not only does  he understand and empathize with the plight of the urban African- American student, but he also understands again some of the struggles  that the rural African-American student faces and how their ticket out  of their hometown to be able to go experience something different is  education. Many of these kids, Representative Clyburn will tell you,  have never had the opportunity to get far outside of their hometowns in  rural America.                                time  1945    These programs give them the opportunity to do so. So I want to  invite our assistant leader to come up. He is a graduate of South  Carolina State University, the Bulldogs, one of our esteemed HBCUs, and  again, I just appreciate his voice on this topic.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr.  Clyburn).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the assistant leader. I really  appreciate his comments, and I want to thank him for standing up for  these students and everyone else out there who is trying to do  something to help eliminate poverty.   The gentleman's 10-20-30 plan was really hailed as something that we  should all take a closer look at. It was a bipartisan approach and a  look at poverty because it affected so many different people's  districts. I just want to thank the gentleman for being an advocate in  this area.                                time  2000    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from the great State of  California (Ms. Bass).   Karen Bass also is someone that really takes these topics seriously.  She has always been someone who has delved very deeply into the budget  and into domestic spending and how it impacts our communities. I just  really appreciate her taking part to really share what we think is  important as it relates to this budget.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Bass very much for  her comments and remarks. I really appreciate the gentlewoman always  taking this subject to task very seriously and to heart.   Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania  (Mr. Evans), who has really made this, again, one of his priorities  also. Philadelphia is one of those cities where many people have  benefited by a lot of these domestic spending programs, including  students like I talked about a little earlier. I would now like to hear  from my esteemed colleague from the State of Pennsylvania, Mr. Dwight  Evans.    Mr. Speaker, I really appreciate Representative Evans'  thoughtfulness and his participation on the topic.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Maxine  Waters), who is my colleague from Los Angeles County. The gentlewoman  is known as a fighter in her district not only on these domestic  spending issues and not only in her district, but throughout the entire  United States.   I am very happy that she is participating, and I know that she has  been very vocal about those developments, dealing with the budget and  dealing with other issues that affect us here in Washington, D.C. I  really appreciate the gentlewoman's participating in tonight's  discussion.    I thank Representative Waters for her comments on this  very timely matter.   Mr. Speaker, how much time do we have remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr.  Scott), my good friend, who is also a leader on education issues and  domestic spending. I thank him very much for participating tonight.    Mr. Speaker, before I close out this Special Order hour,  I do want to thank my colleague from Florida, Representative Val  Demings, for participating, and I want her to just share some last  words on this subject: What do we have to lose? I know she has a few  more things that she wants to share with everybody.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Demings for her words  and inspiration, and I really appreciate her perspective, again. Now  she is getting an opportunity to see this as a Member of Congress, but  the 27 years that she spent in law enforcement, it gave her a bird's- eye perspective on what happens when we don't invest in education, when  we don't invest in health care, when we don't invest in things that  help families uplift themselves and give themselves opportunities to  pull one another out of poverty. I just want to thank her again for  participating in tonight's Special Order hour.   Mr. Speaker, we have a lot to talk about because we do have a lot to  lose, and I thank everybody for participating.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 8 o'clock and 29 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Tuesday, March 28, 2017, at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
