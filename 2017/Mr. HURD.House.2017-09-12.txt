 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 2454) to direct the Secretary of Homeland Security to establish a  data framework to provide access for appropriate personnel to law  enforcement and other information of the Department, and for other  purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2454         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Department of Homeland       Security Data Framework Act of 2017''.       SEC. 2. DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY DATA FRAMEWORK.         (a) In General.--The Secretary of Homeland Security shall       develop a data framework to integrate existing Department of       Homeland Security datasets and systems, as appropriate, for       access by authorized personnel in a manner consistent with       relevant legal authorities and privacy, civil rights, and       civil liberties policies and protections. In developing such       framework, the Secretary shall ensure, in accordance with all       applicable statutory and regulatory requirements, the       following information is included:        (1) All information acquired, held, or obtained by an       office or component of the Department that falls within the       scope of the information sharing environment, including       homeland security information, terrorism information, weapons       of mass destruction information, and national intelligence.        (2) Any information or intelligence relevant to priority       mission needs and capability requirements of the homeland       security enterprise, as determined appropriate by the       Secretary.        (b) Data Framework Access.--        (1) In general.--The Secretary of Homeland Security shall       ensure that the data framework required under this section is       accessible to employees of the Department of Homeland       Security who the Secretary determines--        (A) have an appropriate security clearance;        (B) are assigned to perform a function that requires access       to information in such framework; and        (C) are trained in applicable standards for safeguarding       and using such information.        (2) Guidance.--The Secretary of Homeland Security shall--        (A) issue guidance for Department of Homeland Security       employees authorized to access and contribute to the data       framework pursuant to paragraph (1); and        (B) ensure that such guidance enforces a duty to share       between offices and components of the Department when       accessing or contributing to such framework for mission       needs.        (3) Efficiency.--The Secretary of Homeland Security shall       promulgate data standards and instruct components of the       Department of Homeland Security to make available information       through the data framework under this section in a machine-      readable format, to the greatest extent practicable.        (c) Exclusion of Information.--The Secretary of Homeland       Security may exclude from the data framework information that       the Secretary determines access to or the confirmation of the       existence of could--        (1) jeopardize the protection of sources, methods, or       activities;        (2) compromise a criminal or national security       investigation;        (3) be inconsistent with the other Federal laws or       regulations; or        (4) be duplicative or not serve an operational purpose if       included in such framework.        (d) Safeguards.--The Secretary of Homeland Security shall       incorporate into the data framework systems capabilities for       auditing and ensuring the security of information included in       such framework. Such capabilities shall include the       following:        (1) Mechanisms for identifying insider threats.        (2) Mechanisms for identifying security risks.        (3) Safeguards for privacy, civil rights, and civil       liberties.        (e) Deadline for Implementation.--Not later than two years       after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of       Homeland Security shall ensure the data framework required       under this section has the ability to include appropriate       information in existence within the Department of Homeland       Security to meet its critical mission operations.        (f) Notice to Congress.--        (1) Operational notification.--Not later than 60 days after       the date on which the data framework required under this       section is fully operational, the Secretary of Homeland       Security shall provide notice to the appropriate       congressional committees of such.        (2) Regular status.--The Secretary shall submit to the       appropriate congressional committees regular updates on the       status of the data framework required under this section,       including, when applicable, the use of such data framework to       support classified operations.        (g) Definitions.--In this section:        (1) Appropriate congressional committees.--The term       ``appropriate congressional committees'' has the meaning       given the term ``appropriate congressional committee'' in       section 2(2) of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C.       101(2)).        (2) National intelligence.--The term ``national       intelligence'' has the meaning given such term in section       3(5) of the National Security Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C.       3003(5)).     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Sixteen years after the 9/11 attacks by al-Qaida terrorists on our  homeland,  [[Page H7244]]  most Americans would be dismayed that information-sharing stovepipes  still exist.   While information sharing since that fateful day has improved  dramatically, we still have work to do at the Department of Homeland  Security. When the DHS was created, 22 component agencies were brought  together with different missions, databases, and legal authorities.   The DHS personnel have to deal with a costly, cumbersome process to  search and vet information against a large number of databases, using  different logins, passwords, and legal restrictions.   The DHS data framework was designed to bring together these vital DHS  datasets, including travel and cargo information, investigative data,  and critical infrastructure data, among others.   The other important element of the framework is the replication of  the platform on a classified network to allow classified analysis and  vetting of law enforcement data against intelligence information.   Given the importance of the Data Framework Initiative, the need to  weigh security versus civil liberties, as well as the Federal  Government's history of delays and cost overruns on IT projects, it is  critical that this program receive congressional oversight.   This bill provides the first authorization for the data framework,  mandates privacy and security safeguards, as well as training for  Department personnel with access to the system.   In addition to the personnel training and privacy safeguards, this  bill also requires the Secretary to ensure information in the framework  is both protected and audible.   I was pleased that the Committee on Homeland Security included this  bill in the DHS authorization bill, which passed the floor in July, and  I urge my colleagues to again support this measure.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Miss RICE of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2454, the Department of  Homeland Security Data Framework Act of 2017.   Mr. Speaker, the Department of Homeland Security Data Framework Act  directs the DHS to consolidate existing intelligence databases and  systems at the Department in order to establish a data framework.   Specifically, H.R. 2454 requires the DHS to ensure that the data  framework is accessible to DHS employees who the Secretary determines  have an appropriate security clearance, have responsibilities that  require access to framework information, and are trained in applicable  standards for safeguarding and using such information.   By strengthening the DHS data framework, authorized personnel from  each of the components and offices at the Department will have easier  access to the data that they need in a timely manner.   Additionally, the DHS Security Data Framework Act of 2017 allows the  DHS Secretary to incorporate into the data framework systems  capabilities for auditing and ensuring the security of information  within the framework. Such capabilities include mechanisms for  identifying insider threats and security risks, and safeguards for  privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties.   The anniversary of 9/11 is a time for reflection and remembrance, and  also a time to enhance our defenses. We cannot allow weak data  infrastructure to leave the homeland vulnerable to attacks, and I thank  my good friend and colleague from Texas, Mr. Hurd, for introducing this  commonsense legislation, and I urge my House colleagues to support this  bipartisan legislation.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, this is an important bill that has strong  support on both sides of the aisle. It maintains effective security  measures while consolidating systems, creating a more feasible way for  the men and women at the DHS to access the data that they need to  fulfill their critical mission.   I thank Mr. Hurd for his diligence on this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support H.R. 2454, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from New York (Miss  Rice), for her work on these initiatives. And I thank Chairman McCaul  and the ranking member for the bipartisan way in which we focus on  these important issues of homeland security.   Mr. Speaker, again, I want to urge my colleagues to support H.R.  2454, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 2442) to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to require an  annual report on the Office for State and Local Law Enforcement, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2442         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Federal Information Resource       to Strengthen Ties with State and Local Law Enforcement Act       of 2017'' or the ``FIRST State and Local Law Enforcement       Act''.       SEC. 2. ANNUAL REPORT ON OFFICE FOR STATE AND LOCAL LAW                     ENFORCEMENT.         Section 2006(b) of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6       U.S.C. 607(b)) is amended--        (1) by redesignating paragraph (5) as paragraph (6); and        (2) by inserting after paragraph (4) the following new       paragraph (5):        ``(5) Annual report.--For each of fiscal years 2018 through       2022, the Assistant Secretary for State and Local Law       Enforcement shall submit to the Committee on Homeland       Security and the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of       Representatives and the Committee on Homeland Security and       Governmental Affairs and the Committee on the Judiciary of       the Senate a report on the activities of the Office for State       and Local Law Enforcement. Each such report shall include,       for the fiscal year covered by the report, a description of       each of the following:        ``(A) Efforts to coordinate and share information regarding       Department and component agency programs with State, local,       and tribal law enforcement agencies.        ``(B) Efforts to improve information sharing through the       Homeland Security Information Network by appropriate       component agencies of the Department and by State, local, and       tribal law enforcement agencies.        ``(C) The status of performance metrics within the Office       of State and Local Law Enforcement to evaluate the       effectiveness of efforts to carry out responsibilities set       forth within the subsection.        ``(D) Any feedback from State, local, and tribal law       enforcement agencies about the Office, including the       mechanisms utilized to collect such feedback.        ``(E) Efforts to carry out all other responsibilities of       the Office of State and Local Law Enforcement.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2442, the Office for State and  Local Law Enforcement Information Sharing Review Act, introduced by the  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).   The Office for State and Local Law Enforcement is authorized in  section 2006(b) of the Homeland Security Act and is located within the  DHS Office of Partnership and Engagement. The office largely serves as  a source of information on DHS resources available to State and local  law enforcement partners, as well as a point of contact for questions  regarding DHS policies and programs.   This bill requires a report on the activities of Office of State and  Local Law Enforcement within the Department of Homeland Security. The  report must include how the office is working to improve information  sharing between DHS and law enforcement agencies, an overview of the  performance metrics used by the office to measure success, feedback  from State and local stakeholders, and an overview of ongoing  activities.   This reporting requirement will ensure the office is continually  identifying areas for improvement in the Department's information- sharing efforts with State and locals, and coordinating with relevant  DHS component agencies to close these gaps.   I applaud the gentlewoman from Texas for including a sunset on the  reporting requirement after 5 years. While the information gathered  through this report will be valuable for congressional oversight, it is  important that we do not continue to require never-ending reporting  requirements from the Department.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this measure, and I  reserve the balance of my time.                                           House of Representatives,                                      Committee on the Judiciary,                                  Washington, DC, September 5, 2017.      Hon. Michael T. McCaul,      Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman McCaul, I write with respect to H.R. 2442,       the ``Federal Information Resource to Strengthen Ties with       State and Local Law Enforcement Act.'' As a result of your       having consulted with us on provisions within H.R. 2442 that       fall within the Rule X jurisdiction of the Committee on the       Judiciary, I forego any further consideration of this bill so       that it may proceed expeditiously to the House floor for       consideration.        The Judiciary Committee takes this action with our mutual       understanding that by foregoing consideration of H.R. 2442 at       this time, we do not waive any jurisdiction over subject       matter contained in this or similar legislation and that our       committee will be appropriately consulted and involved as       this bill or similar legislation moves forward so that we may       address any remaining issues in our jurisdiction. Our       committee also reserves the right to seek appointment of an       appropriate number of conferees to any House-Senate       conference involving this or similar legislation and asks       that you support any such request.        I would appreciate a response to this letter confirming       this understanding with respect to H.R. 2442 and would ask       that a copy of our exchange of letters on this matter be       included in the Congressional Record during floor       consideration of this bill.            Sincerely,                                                     Bob Goodlatte,                                                          Chairman.  [[Page H7246]]                                          ____                                          House of Representatives,                                  Committee on Homeland Security,                                  Washington, DC, September 6, 2017.      Hon. Bob Goodlatte,      Chairman, Committee on Judiciary,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Goodlatte, Thank you for your letter       regarding H.R. 2442, the ``Federal Information Resource to       Strengthen Ties with State and Local Law Enforcement Act of       2017''. I appreciate your support in bringing this       legislation before the House of Representatives, and       accordingly, understand that the Committee on Judiciary will       forego further consideration of the bill.        The Committee on Homeland Security concurs with the mutual       understanding that by foregoing consideration of this bill at       this time, the Judiciary does not waive any jurisdiction over       the subject matter contained in this bill or similar       legislation in the future. In addition, should a conference       on this bill be necessary, I would support your request to       have the Committee on Judiciary represented on the conference       committee.        I will insert copies of this exchange in the Congressional       Record during consideration of this bill on the House floor.       I thank you for your cooperation in this matter.            Sincerely,                                                 Michael T. McCaul,                          Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security.    Miss RICE of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2442, the Federal Information  Resource to Strengthen Ties with State and Local Law Enforcement Act of  2017, or the FIRST with State and Local Law Enforcement Act.   Mr. Speaker, today we consider H.R. 2442, a bill to require the DHS  to submit an annual report to Congress on the activities of the Office  for State and Local Law Enforcement.   This bill, authored by the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee),  seeks to highlight the activities of this important hub of outreach to  State and local law enforcement within the DHS.   The report is to include detailed information on those efforts,  including steps taken to improve them and performance metrics to  evaluate the effectiveness, and feedback received from State, local,  and Tribal law enforcement agencies.   Yesterday, the Committee on Homeland Security released a staff report  that looked at the DHS' progress, over the past decade, at implementing  the 9/11 Commission Act.   With respect to information sharing, it found that policies and  procedures have been reformed, at all levels, to ensure that critical  national security information is shared, and recommended that the DHS  continue to refine its channels for sharing such information to ensure  that they evolve to address the threat, landscape, and stakeholder  needs.   Constructive engagement, through the Office for State and Local Law  Enforcement, is central to this effort.   Sixteen years after the September 11 attacks, it is important that we  stand together and recommit ourselves to doing all we can to prevent  future terrorist attacks. I urge my House colleagues to support this  bill.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, the FIRST with State and Local Law  Enforcement Act seeks to ensure that, for years to come, State and  local law enforcement know that the DHS is a full partner in their  efforts to keep their communities secure.   As such, I encourage my colleagues to support this bill, H.R. 2442,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues once again to support  H.R. 2442, and I yield back the balance of my time.
