 Mr. Speaker, I traveled to the southern  border to witness the challenges firsthand.   First and foremost, I thank the Brownsville port of entry field  operation officers and Border Patrol agents at the central processing  center in McAllen for working around the clock to ensure our Nation is  secure.   While in Texas, I witnessed a drug bust, asylum seekers, and an  unaccompanied minor in detention. I heard about the strain on the men  and women fighting to keep our citizens safe.   Mr. Speaker, one officer told me you could double the workforce  tomorrow, and there would still be plenty of work.   These workers are doing more with less, so we must ensure they have  the technology, infrastructure, and recruitment tools to help secure  our border most effectively.   Immigration reform must be safe, orderly, and humane.                            ____________________
