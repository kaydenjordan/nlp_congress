 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1450, the  Treating Tribes and Counties as Good Neighbors Act, introduced by my  good friend and colleague, Representative Fulcher of Idaho.   St. Louis County, Minnesota, is the largest county east of the  Mississippi River and the place I have always called home.   St. Louis County is a checkerboard of Federal and non-Federal land.  As such, there are many actors managing the land, be it the Bureau of  Land Management or the U.S. Forest Service that manage our Federal  lands, or the States, the counties, and the local Tribes that manage  our non-Federal lands.   Since its introduction over two decades ago, the Good Neighbor  Authority program has facilitated co-stewardship of our Federal and  non-Federal lands. By partnering Federal land managers with State  stakeholders, we have created healthier forests, lowered fire risks,  and better conserved our landscapes.   However, the most successful stewardship of our public lands occurs  when all parties are brought together and everyone is able to do their  part.    Unfortunately, our counties and Tribal partners, who do a lion's  share of the work on Federal lands, are still unable to access the Good  Neighbor Authority program.   H.R. 1450 will allow our counties and federally recognized Tribes to  access this critical management tool and allow them the ability to  reinvest in restoration projects. This will build on the success of the  program and further benefit our conservation efforts across this  Nation.   This bipartisan bill passed both the Natural Resources Committee and  the Agriculture Committee with broad support. I am hopeful that the  House can continue this forward momentum today.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this  legislation.
