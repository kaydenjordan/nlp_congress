 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 2740) to posthumously award a Congressional Gold Medal to Rabbi  Michoel Ber Weissmandl in recognition of his acts of valor during World  War II.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2740         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Rabbi Michoel Ber Weissmandl       Congressional Gold Medal Act of 2017''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) Rabbi Michoel Ber Weissmandl was born in Hungary on       October 25, 1903, later moving to Slovakia to study under       Rabbi Shumel Dvoid Ungar in Nitra.        (2) During his time in Nitra, he quickly became a senior       figure within the local Jewish community and Yeshiva.        (3) Weissmandl was responsible for some of the daring       efforts to save the Jewish people of Slovakia from the       Holocaust, which include the establishment of a ``Working       Group'', an underground organization that raised funds to       negotiate ransom with German and Slovakian officials in order       to delay mass deportations.        (4) During the Nazi regime, Weissmandl used his contacts       from England to obtain visas, becoming one of the first to       actively protect people of Jewish ancestry in Europe.        (5) Weissmandl also wrote telegrams to generate awareness       of the Jewish people's plight and encouraged other strategic       approaches to stop the Holocaust, including the bombing of       railroad tunnels to prevent the transportation of persons to       concentration camps.        (6) Weissmandl established a Working Group--a wide variety       of people from different political and ideological       spectrums--whose common goal was to save people from the       ``Final Solution''.        (7) The Working Group was one of the first to document in       writing the accounts of Auschwitz Escapees in a document       widely referred to as the ``Auschwitz Protocols''.        (8) Weissmandl himself later translated the initial       documentation from German to Hebrew and included a widely       known addendum that pleaded for action.        (9) Weissmandl wrote the first known appeal for the use of       Allied air resources to disrupt the Holocaust.        (10) In 1942 when Slovakia started deportation for       ``resettlement'', Rabbi Weissmandl was the first to inform       the Working Group that people were being murdered and not       sent to work as originally claimed.        (11) Rabbi Weissmandl also played an instrumental role in       Solomon Schoenfeld Kindertransport rescue, helping save       hundreds of lives.        (12) Rabbi Weissmandl came to America and in 1945       immediately got to work to establish a home and Yeshiva for       Holocaust survivors. The Yeshiva of Nitra he established in       Mount Kisco, New York, was the first Yeshiva campus in       America and became and example that other institutions       followed.        (13) Rabbi Weissmandl has significantly influenced the       flourishing communities of Talmudic scholars in Brooklyn, New       York, and generally across the United States.       SEC. 3. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL.         (a) Presentation Authorized.--The Speaker of the House of       Representatives and the President pro tempore of the Senate       shall make appropriate arrangements for the presentation, on       behalf of Congress, of a gold medal of appropriate design, to       Rabbi Michoel Ber Weissmandl in recognition of his acts of       valor during World War II.        (b) Participation by Weissmandl Committee.--For the purpose       of the presentation referred to in subsection (a), the       Speaker and President pro tempore shall ensure that the       Weissmandl Committee may accept the medal on behalf of       Michoel Ber Weissmandl.        (c) Design and Striking.--For the purpose of the       presentation referred to in subsection  [[Page H9475]]       (a), the Secretary of the Treasury (hereinafter in this Act       referred to as the ``Secretary'') shall strike a gold medal       with suitable emblems, devices, and inscriptions to be       determined by the Secretary.

SEC. 4. DUPLICATE MEDALS.         Under such regulations as the Secretary may prescribe, the       Secretary may strike and sell duplicates in bronze of the       gold medal struck pursuant to section 2 at a price sufficient       to cover the cost of the bronze medals (including labor,       materials, dies, use of machinery, and overhead expenses) and       the cost of the gold medal.       SEC. 5. NATIONAL MEDAL.         (a) National Medal.--The gold medal struck under this Act       is a national medals for purposes of chapter 51 of title 31,       United States Code.        (b) Numismatic Items.--For purposes of sections 5134 and       5136 of title 31, United States Code, all medals struck under       this Act shall be considered to be numismatic items.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2740, the Rabbi Michoel  Ber Weissmandl Congressional Gold Medal Act of 2017, introduced on  April 25, 2017, by our colleague, Representative Nydia Velazquez,  cosponsored by Representative Mast of Florida.   The bill authorizes the award of a Congressional Gold Medal to the  Jewish rabbi for his acts of valor during World War II to save many  Jewish people from Slovakia from persecution, the atrocities and the  Holocaust committed by the Nazis during the Second World War.   Mr. Speaker, I wholeheartedly support this legislation, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, Rabbi Weissmandl's life story is uplifting and  his actions are inspiring. This Gold Medal is an overdue honor and is  supported by 296 Members of the House.   Mr. Speaker, I urge its immediate passage, and I want to thank  Chairman Hensarling, Ranking Member Waters, Representative Velazquez,  and Representative Mast for their leadership on this important  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
