 Madam Speaker, a year ago, President Putin launched an  unlawful invasion of the people of Ukraine, and it has changed the  world, a war that has led to nothing but destruction and human  atrocities.   I have seen these atrocities firsthand when I traveled to Ukraine  last September--the bombing of homes, of hospitals, of schools; the  impacts on innocent women and children; the deportation of families;  and the atrocities go on and on.   President Putin is a war criminal. I am proud that he has sanctioned  me and many of my colleagues for our support of Ukraine and for  standing up for their democracy. They are standing up for our  democracy, as well.   Putin thought he could divide us and Ukraine would immediately fall.  He was wrong, wrong, and wrong. The Western world is united as one  because freedom and democracy are worth fighting for, and that is what  this is all about.   We need to continue to provide financial support to Ukraine,  including fighters, tanks, ATACMS, HIMARS, what it takes for them to  win this war because there is no other option.   This is the test of our time, and we must rise to meet that test at  this time.                            ____________________
