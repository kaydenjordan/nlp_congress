Madam Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr.  McGovern), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.  During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Madam Speaker, last night the Rules Committee met and  reported a rule, House Resolution 75, providing for the consideration  of four measures: H.J. Res. 7, H.R. 139, H.R. 382, and H.R. 497.   The rule provides for consideration of all four measures under closed  rules, with 1 hour of debate each equally divided and controlled by the  chair and ranking minority member of the committees of jurisdiction or  their designees. The rule provides one motion to recommit for each  measure.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of this rule and in support of  the underlying bills.   Today, the Republican majority begins the long process of reversing  the policy failures of President Biden and the previous Democratic  majority.   Madam Speaker, Republicans last week demonstrated that Republicans  are committed to governing for the American people. Toward that end,  Madam Speaker, House Republicans have had one of the most productive  legislative weeks in recent memory. Our new governing majority has  demonstrated that it is no longer a closed shop, which was business as  usual in a Democratic House in the last Congress.   Instead of a lethargic Congress, Republicans, in only 3 short weeks,  have set a precedent that I hope subsequent Members will emulate. The  new Republican majority is eager to begin the important work that  America has sent us here to do.   Instead of legislating for the few at the expense of the many,  Republicans are making good on our commitment to America. We are  dismantling the COVID surveillance state. We are protecting the  conscience rights of our healthcare workers. We are demanding that  government employees show up to do their jobs like the rest of America  has done. We are terminating and rescinding the interminable extensions  of President Bidens's public health emergency declaration.   Sometimes, Madam Speaker, I almost feel as if I have been trapped in  a Dickens novel. In this tale of two cities, it seems the Biden  administration is clearly of two minds on the COVID pandemic, one being  the best of times: the administration's policies to combat the pandemic  have been a resounding success. But then, on the other hand, we are  still living through a crisis that requires emergency measures that  have to be prolonged indefinitely.   The American people spoke in the last election, Madam Speaker. Their  message was clear enough. Their message by electing Republicans was  enough is enough.   Now, thanks to Chairman Graves and H.J. Res. 7, the American people  can be assured that President Biden's national emergency will be  rescinded. Americans will finally have a government that recognizes the  reality across our Nation, the very words spoken by President Biden on  ``60 Minutes'' last September: ``The pandemic is over.''   Madam Speaker, nowhere is the contrast more evident between  Republicans and Democrats than what is included in this rule today. The  Republican majority is already hard at work passing commonsense  legislation that will benefit our people, that will benefit all  Americans, not just a connected few.   Madam Speaker, just like you, one of the most vital services I  provide to the constituents of the people of the 26th District of Texas  is communicating with Federal agencies on their behalf. Through this  communication, I am able to ensure timely services like passport  services, Social Security benefits, Medicare enrollment, veterans'  benefits, and many more. Over the past few years, I have seen that  these services have been severely delayed or even halted--completely in  some cases--because what do you get? No one answers the phone, or you  get an out-of-office response from a Federal agency.   I submit that is entirely unacceptable. In fact, last week, I  introduced a bill called the REACT Act, in a bipartisan fashion, to  require a timely response from executive agencies after inquiries from  Members of Congress. However, in order for the agencies to fulfill  their responsibilities, they first have to get back to work.   H.R. 139, the SHOW UP Act, would end the unproductive telework  policies to ensure that these Federal agencies are back at work for the  American people.   Madam Speaker, I strongly support this bill, and I urge other Members  to support the underlying bill, as well as the rule.   Madam Speaker, again this September, President Biden, in a candid and  unguarded moment, officially admitted that the pandemic is over, and  then for emphasis he repeated it. Despite this declaration, this  administration just reauthorized the twelfth extension of the COVID-19  public health emergency.   I think all of us who were here at the time agreed that, in March  2020, the country was very much in a public health emergency. However,  now the landscape has changed, and now the American people are  transitioning back to their normal routines.   Today, the Biden administration's lack of transparency has, yet  again, put our country in a very difficult position. Throughout the  last 3 years and 12 extensions of this public health emergency, people  have had ample time to seriously discuss a plan to avoid disruptions to  patients and providers as we transition out of this pandemic.   This new House majority has been pressing the administration to come  up with a plan to make permanent the policies that work and unwind  those policies that don't. While there were several successful policies  and innovations that came out of the emergency declaration, not just  telehealth and hospital at-home flexibilities, this administration has  repeatedly failed to provide a plan.   The public health emergency cannot serve as a permanent means for the  Biden administration to subvert Congress to enact their radical agenda.   Madam Speaker, I support Congressman Guthrie's efforts to officially  end this public health emergency, and I look forward to transitioning  back to regular order.   Madam Speaker, our healthcare workers across America are still  subject to President Biden's vaccine mandate enforced by the Centers  for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The healthcare industry is already  suffering from a severe workforce shortage that will have drastic  effects on our ability to take care of patients.   Republicans have been crystal clear on the issue, Madam Speaker. We  never have and never will support Federal vaccine mandates. The  personal health decision of whether to receive a vaccine should be left  between a patient and their doctor. The Federal Government has no place  in demanding what an American must do for their personal health and  certainly as a condition of employment.   For Texas specifically, one of our hospitals lost over 150 workers  due to  [[Page H522]]  the Federal vaccine mandate. This decision has deepened the staffing  shortages back home, especially in rural areas, leaving all of us ill- equipped to deal with day-to-day functions.   Madam Speaker, I will conclude by saying that I stand in strong  support of this rule and the underlying bills that they will allow to  be debated.   Madam Speaker, I urge my fellow Members to support the rule, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I disagree with everything the gentleman just said, except his kind  remarks on me being named vice chair of the Rules Committee.   I do think it is somewhat ironic he brings up redistricting. After  all, it was Democrats' gerrymandering in the State of New York that led  to the court throwing out their map. As a consequence of the court map,  we elected more Republicans from New York than anyone thought possible,  which delivered the majority.   Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Roy) to speak on the rule.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds for the purpose  of response.   First off, the Speaker has been very clear that it is not negotiable.  There will be no cuts to the Social Security and Medicare. But more  importantly, the only person who is cutting Medicare right now is  President Biden.    Ask any doctor in this country: Has your pay been cut in the last 4  years? And they will answer resoundingly in the affirmative.   Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr.  Massie), to speak on this rule, another new member of the House  Committee on Rules.    Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Gosar) to speak on the rule.    Madam Speaker, may I inquire how much time is remaining?    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. McCormick), a new Member elected last November, to speak  on the rule.    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from Georgia.    Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   In preparing for this debate today on the rule, I reflected on the  iconic photograph of the sailor kissing his girlfriend on the streets  of New York at the end of the Second World War. Think about that for a  moment.   My parents were married in 1946. My wife's parents were married in  1945. The end of the Second World War, the optimism of that couple on  the streets of New York, then gave rise to basically my generation, the  baby boom generation.   I was thinking back to about a year ago when there was a video making  the rounds on the internet of an elementary school class where the  teacher said masks are no longer required and the unbridled joy of  those young students as they ripped off their masks, never to have to  put them on again.   We are standing on the precipice of just such a moment today, and  this truly is a historic moment. It is one that the American people  should look back on and say this was the time. This is the time for  optimism and to, without fear, embrace the future because  [[Page H529]]  we know the good things of which our country is capable.                                time  1315    Now, I do need to thank some of our fellow Members; specifically, the  chairwoman of my committee, the Energy and Commerce Committee,  Chairwoman Rodgers, Chairman Sam Graves of the Transportation and  Infrastructure Committee, and Chairman Comer of the Oversight and  Government Reform Committee for their hard work in delivering for the  American people by bringing these bills to the floor and helping ensure  that commitment to America and the future.   The Republican majority has again demonstrated that our governing  agenda will be devoted to improving the lives of our Nation's citizens.  Our governing majority will continue to focus on the issues that matter  most to our people: combating the rising energy costs, sky-high  inflation, rampant crime, our porous southern border, and the fentanyl  crisis.   These are the issues that the American voters rightfully demand that  their Representatives address. The Republican majority is committed to  solving the crises that the previous Democratic majority has inflicted  on our Nation.    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and  I move the previous question on the resolution.
