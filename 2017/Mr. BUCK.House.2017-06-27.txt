A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I call  up House Resolution 382 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 382         Resolved, That at any time after adoption of this       resolution the Speaker may, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule       XVIII, declare the House resolved into the Committee of the       Whole House on the state of the Union for consideration of       the bill (H.R. 1215) to improve patient access to health care       services and provide improved medical care by reducing the       excessive burden the liability system places on the health       care delivery system. The first reading of the bill shall be       dispensed with. All points of order against consideration of       the bill are waived. General debate shall be confined to the       bill and shall not exceed one hour equally divided and       controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the       Committee on the Judiciary. After general debate the bill       shall be considered for amendment under the five-minute rule.       In lieu of the amendment in the nature of a substitute       recommended by the Committee on the Judiciary now printed in       the bill, it shall be in order to consider as an original       bill for the purpose of amendment under the five-minute rule       an amendment in the nature of a substitute consisting of the       text of Rules Committee Print 115-10. That amendment in the       nature of a substitute shall be considered as read. All       points of order against that amendment in the nature of a       substitute are waived. No amendment to that amendment in the       nature of a substitute shall be in order except those printed       in the report of the Committee on Rules accompanying this       resolution. Each such amendment may be offered only in the       order printed in the report, may be offered only by a Member       designated in the report, shall be considered as read, shall       be debatable for the time specified in the report equally       divided and controlled by the proponent and an opponent,       shall not be subject to amendment, and shall not be subject       to a demand for division of the question in the House or in       the Committee of the Whole. All points of order against such       amendments are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of       the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report       the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been       adopted. Any Member may demand a separate vote in the House       on any amendment adopted in the Committee of the Whole to the       bill or to the amendment in the nature of a substitute made       in order as original text. The previous question shall be       considered as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to       final passage without intervening motion except one motion to       recommit with or without instructions.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Buck) is  recognized for 1 hour.    Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Polis), my  friend, pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Polis), my  friend, pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Colorado?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule and the  underlying legislation.   House Resolution 382 will ultimately drive down healthcare costs and  make care more affordable to millions of Americans across the country.   In 2017, we have had a conversation in America about how health  insurance costs have drastically increased in the past 7 years. We need  to fix our health insurance market, a task that House Members and  Senators have been working hard on for the past few months, but if we  are truly going to address out-of-control health insurance costs, we  need to start looking at the cost of supplying care itself. That is  where H.R. 1215, the Protecting Access to Care Act of 2017, plays a  vital role. H.R. 1215 focuses on lowering the cost of care by placing  checks and balances on the excessive and frivolous lawsuits faced by  doctors and other healthcare providers.   A GAO report found that rising litigation awards are responsible for  skyrocketing medical professional liability premiums. Unfortunately,  these premium costs are passed on to the patient and, in many cases,  are passed on to American taxpayers. The reforms in H.R. 1215 will make  care more affordable for patients and will improve access to care,  especially for rural America.   Over time, unending and excessive lawsuits have limited the amount of  doctors nationwide, particularly in States that have not instituted  their own reforms. With a string of frivolous lawsuits levied against  our medical community, many Americans who would become doctors and  practice in certain parts of the Nation simply decided against it.   The reforms in H.R. 1215 will especially help rural and underserved  urban communities, where quality healthcare can be difficult to access.  Incentivizing medical professionals to serve in communities that might  otherwise be overlooked should be one goal of our healthcare reform  efforts.   I know the healthcare challenges faced by so many in eastern  Colorado, where access to quality care is sometimes limited. We need  doctors who are willing to invest in these communities, but we need to  empower these doctors by freeing them of frivolous and excessive  lawsuits.   Beyond just access to care, the growth of frivolous malpractice  lawsuits has led to a change in the way care is provided. Many  providers are forced to practice defensive medicine. In doing so,  doctors order unnecessary, excessive diagnostics not because the  patient needs them, but because the doctor attempts to avoid a  frivolous lawsuit. The practice of defensive medicine increases costs  for the patient without providing any discernible benefit.   The legislation we are considering is key to increasing the  affordability of care and the access to care for all Americans.   This bill is supported by the American Hospital Association and the  American Academy of Family Physicians. The American Medical Association  has also voiced their support.   But let me be clear: The bill before the House today does not limit  access to justice for legitimately wronged or injured patients. It does  not hamper a wronged patient from recovering damages for their  injuries.   The bill simply imposes a $250,000 cap on noneconomic damages, a  provision that has worked well in California, where this legislation  has already been successfully implemented and modeled for decades. But  there is no cap on economic damages that a patient may incur in a  malpractice situation, and the bill's cap does not preempt any State  law that otherwise caps any form of damages at amounts either higher or  lower than the cap in H.R. 1215.   The legislation also limits the contingency fees that lawyers can  charge when bringing a malpractice case on behalf of a client. In other  words, we don't want to incentivize lawyers to push forward with  illegitimate cases. We want patients who have been wronged to have  access to a fair trial, where they walk home with the winnings in their  own pocket, not their lawyer's.   H.R. 1215 builds on the successes of medical malpractice reforms in  States like California and Texas. In these States, similar laws have  increased access to affordable medical care. They have created an  environment where doctors can focus on helping patients rather than  spending time in endless litigation and dealing with threats from the  trial bar.   The legislation before us, while creating a uniform national playing  field, protects State laws by allowing flexible reforms to be used at  the discretion of States. State courts will still hear medical lawsuits  as always.   The reforms at hand today deal with care that was provided or  subsidized by the Federal Government, including through a tax benefit.  [[Page H5194]]    We must pass this legislation for the American taxpayer. The taxpayer  doesn't deserve to have their hard-earned dollars simply end up in the  pockets of trial lawyers due to frivolous lawsuits. That is why H.R.  1215 is a critically needed reform.   Unlimited and opportunistic lawsuits help no one except trial  lawyers. Consequently, our doctors have to increase their costs and  practice expensive defensive medicine, costing patients and taxpayers.  And when our physicians are impacted, so are we.   Trial lawyers too often stand between patients and their doctors.  With the looming threat of excessive, unending lawsuits, healthcare  providers have to worry more about the trial lawyer at their door than  the patient in their office. H.R. 1215 places important limits on these  lawsuits so that the truly wronged are compensated without enriching  trial lawyers at the same time.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Proudly, no.    Proudly, no.    Proudly, no.    Proudly, no.    Proudly, no.    Proudly, no.    Proudly, no.    Proudly, no.    Proudly, no.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I know my friend from Colorado did not mean to insult me  when he referred to me as a lawyer, but I want to make a quick  distinction.   I spent 25 years as a prosecutor, not a lawyer. Prosecutors put  people in prison and make the world safe for all of us; lawyers get  people out of prison and make the world less safe for all of us. I want  to make that distinction.    I yield to the gentleman from Colorado.    Reclaiming my time, do not tell prosecutors that they are  merely lawyers. To be a prosecutor is a higher standard.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Kansas (Mr.  Marshall).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I just want to make one point.   I have heard a number of times now that this bill is a solution  searching for a problem or it does nothing to help our underlying cost.   The Congressional Budget Office, the very office that my friend  relies on for the most recent estimate of those that will decide not to  seek insurance under the Senate healthcare bill, has estimated that  this bill will save taxpayers $50 billion over 10 years and reduce  medical malpractice insurance premiums by 25 percent to 30 percent.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I will remind my friend from Colorado that the  very $250,000 cap that we are talking about in this bill is the same  cap that has been adopted by the Colorado State Legislature.    Mr. Speaker, I would remind my friend again that the States  that have adopted any cap--it could be $250,000, it could be $500,000,  it could be $1 million in non-economic damage caps--will not be  affected by this bill. This bill only affects those States that have no  caps, and it is Federal money that is being used to pay for these.    Mr. Speaker, I want to inquire of my friend from Colorado,  he mentioned when he was introducing the gentleman from Virginia that  there are schools that are closing because gym roofs are falling in. I  know a number of very generous individuals that would like to  contribute.   Does the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Polis) have the names of any of  those schools for us?   I yield to the gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my friend's newfound sense of  bipartisanship. The Affordable Care Act was passed without a single  Republican vote in the House, without a single Republican vote in the  Senate, and without any concern of Republican thoughts about how  healthcare should be run in this country. Now that the Affordable Care  Act is, in fact, failing; now that we have over 90 counties in America  that have zero health insurers to choose from in the individual market;  and now that we see the Affordable Care Act in a death spiral, all of a  sudden, we are concerned about the bipartisanship and how to fix the  problem.   We have heard zero amendments in the past 6 years to the Affordable  Care Act that would have, in fact, improved the Affordable Care Act  from the other side of the aisle while they had the President in the  White House, and now, all of a sudden, we are looking for  bipartisanship and solutions. We will find that bipartisanship and  those solutions in the future.   Mr. Speaker, if we truly want affordable healthcare in this country,  then we need to address the cost of supplying care. H.R. 1215 strikes  at the heart of skyrocketing medical care. By limiting frivolous and  unending lawsuits, doctors can focus less on the courtroom and more on  the patient in the operating room.   The reforms made by H.R. 1215 will be especially important for rural  America and underserved urban America. Doctors will be able to afford  to live and practice in these communities, providing the attentive and  responsive care that all Americans deserve, not just Americans who live  a few miles from a major hospital.   I encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this  legislation. I know Democrats and Republicans have different policy  approaches to reforming our healthcare system, but this legislation has  already been implemented by Democrats in the State of California, where  it has proven successful. Now we have the chance to apply this approach  more broadly, in a way that will help millions of Americans. This  effort has been bipartisan in the past and should be bipartisan today.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the sponsor of this bill, Representative Steve  King.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the resolution, and I urge a  ``yes'' vote on the underlying bill.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the rule  governing debate of H.R. 1215, the ``Protecting Access to Care Act of  2017'' and the underlying bill.   I oppose the rule for H.R. 1215, the ``Protecting Access to Care Act  of 2017'' for the following reasons:   There were twenty-five amendments proposed by colleagues from both  sides of the aisle.   Only five of those amendments were made in order.   What did all five of those amendments have in common?   These amendments were all submitted by my Republican counterparts.   The rule for this bill incorporates none of the amendments offered by  my Democratic colleagues.   Mr. Speaker, that exclusion is problematic.   The amendments not made in order reflect the crippling partisanship  of the House majority.   I also oppose the underlying bill on the merits, because it limits  noneconomic damages to a mere $250,000, which if enacted, would have a  disproportionately adverse impact on women, the poor, and other  vulnerable groups.   When given the opportunity, members refused to incorporate an  amendment that would increase that cap to reflect the cost of inflation  and a concern for the humane treatment of those individuals affected by  medical malpractice.   H.R. 1215 provides immunity for health care providers who dispense  defective or dangerous pharmaceuticals or medical devices.   Finally, I oppose the bill, because it creates an excessively short  statute of limitations period, makes it harder for victims to obtain  adequate legal representation, and imposes the risk of loss on victims  rather than wrongdoers.   Mr. Speaker, there are numerous examples of people who have suffered  at the hands of medical providers and whose lives will never be the  same.   Consider the case of Olivia, an exceptionally bright high school  senior from Santa Monica, California, who had gained early acceptance  to Smith College in Massachusetts.   She never made it to Smith College, because after a medical procedure  was completed and while Olivia was still under anesthesia, a fellow-in- training pulled the catheter causing Olivia's vital signs to plummet.   Hospital staff waited more than ten minutes to resuscitate her, but  it was far too late for Olivia.   She passed away, and her promising future disappeared.   This tragedy never should have happened.   Mr. Speaker, instead of wasting time on this giveaway to special  interests, we should be improving the Affordable Care Act, and opposing  any bill that would leave over twenty million Americans uninsured, and  investigating Russian involvement in our democratic processes.   For these reasons, I oppose the rule and the underlying bill.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Polis is as follows:              An Amendment to H. Res. 382 Offered by Mr. Polis         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections:        Sec. 2. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the       Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare       the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       2475) to provide for the long-term improvement of public       school facilities, and for other purposes. The first reading       of the bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order       against consideration of the bill are waived. General debate       shall be confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour       equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking       minority member of the Committee on Education and the       Workforce. After general debate the bill shall be considered       for amendment under the five-minute rule. All points of order       against provisions in the bill are waived. At the conclusion       of consideration of the bill for amendment the Committee       shall rise and report the bill to the House with such       amendments as may have been adopted. The previous question       shall be considered as ordered on the bill and amendments       thereto to final passage without intervening motion except       one motion to recommit with or without instructions. If the       Committee of the Whole rises and reports that it has come to       no resolution on the bill, then on the next legislative day       the House shall, immediately after the third daily order of       business under clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into the       Committee of the Whole for further consideration of the bill.        Sec. 3. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 2475.                                   ____           The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to  [[Page H5200]]       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous  question.   The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the ayes appeared to have it.
