 Madam Speaker, I thank the ranking member, Mr. Polis, for  yielding me the time.   Madam Speaker, I rise today to oppose the rule and underlying bill by  my Republican colleagues. The Republican bill favors big Wall Street  megabanks and financial interests over the American people. I would ask  my Republican friends: Don't you remember the financial crash of 2008  and who created it?   Their bill repeals a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau rule  which cuts down on those companies' abilities to use so-called forced  arbitration clauses which prevent cheated or defrauded consumers from  going to court. In other words, they prevent the victims from going to  court. They want to handcuff the customers, not the megabanks that took  them to the cleaners.   This takes us back to the days of when the fine print in the credit  card or other financial agreement prevented consumers from banding  together in class action lawsuits to challenge illegal behavior by the  most powerful financial giants in the world. Try to deal with one of  them as an individual. They don't even return phone calls, for heaven's  sake. You get in that robo system for hours and hours, and then the  phone call cuts off.   Republicans want to dismantle the Consumer Financial Protection  Bureau, even after the agency's work for consumers resulted in $12  billion in relief to 27 million Americans who were harmed, and that is  just the beginning.   Why is this Republican-led Congress so keen on protecting companies  like Wells Fargo that used arbitration clauses and class action bans to  create fraudulent accounts, overcharge customers with debit fees and  mortgages, and even avoid responsibility for their misconduct? Criminal  misconduct.   You can laugh. Come and meet the millions of people who have lost  their homes across this country or are underwater on their mortgages.  There is no justice for them.   The idea that banks can rip off consumers by abusing obscure clauses  buried deep in their contracts is totally outrageous.    The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's rule banning  the use of these clauses is simply a commonsense step to ensure that  all consumers have equal access to justice. This is the people's House.  We should protect consumers from the wolves. Our job is to keep them at  bay, not make it easier for them to prey on the American people. This  is not what President Trump ran on.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' and stand with  America's consumers over special interests, particularly the financial  predators that brought this country to ruin.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge all of my  colleagues who voted ``yes'' on continuous and strengthened sanctions  on the Russian Federation. That was the correct vote, and I commend the  leadership of Ohio's Senator Sherrod Brown, the leading Democrat in the  other body on the Banking Committee who fought for this package.   The bill also holds Iran, North Korea, as well as Russia accountable.  Specifically, Russia for interference in our Democratic Republic, but  also for its ongoing human rights violations, its illegal invasion and  occupation of Crimea, and continued military violence in eastern  Ukraine with over 10,000 dead due to Russian aggression.   This bill will impose sanctions on people involved in human rights  abuses, those who launch cyber attacks and those who supplied weapons  to the Assad government in Syria. President Trump and his staff  regularly question the intelligence that shows Russia interfered in our  election.   Given the President's priorities lately, it is imperative that  Congress send a clear message and make it more difficult to undercut  sanctions without congressional approval.   This package tells the world: Congress won't stand by idly. But what  a sad day we have reached when there is doubt whether sanctions against  Putin's Russia, liberty's proven adversary, will be even signed by this  President of the United States.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Garamendi and  Congressman Tonko for their comments. It is a pleasure to be with them  tonight, and also Congresswoman Michelle Lujan Grisham. She really has  been such a leader, not just for New Mexico, but for the whole issue of  health across our country. I am really pleased to join all of them.   And I will just say, as a member of the Appropriations Committee, the  American people should know, this past week we tried very hard to pass  an amendment that would simply ask the executive branch to report back  to us on how much money we were spending as a country in Medicare,  Medicaid, at the VA, the Department of Defense, for certain classes of  drugs in our country.  [[Page H6290]]    Now, don't you think it would be right for us to know, since we are  spending tax dollars, that if we are spending more money on, let's say,  a diabetic medicine than a heart medicine, whatever medicine it is, it  would be good for us to do cost accounting to go back and look at what  we are paying?   Do you know we were not able to get that simple reporting-back  amendment on how much pharmaceuticals are costing the people of the  United States, because the Republican members of our committee blocked  it.                                time  1900     They voted ``no.'' They don't want to know how much the  American people are spending through their tax dollars at the Federal  level because the goal is to figure out how this money was being spent  and to hold those companies responsible to look at what costs were over  time and so forth.   It is amazing and it is really wrong what the pharmaceutical industry  is doing to the people of this country. They are killing people. People  cannot afford the medicine that they need.   Yesterday, and I give this as homework, in The New York Times, there  was a great story titled, ``When Health Law Isn't Enough, the Desperate  Line Up at Tents.'' It was written by what must be a brilliant young  reporter named Trip Gabriel, and it reported about a charity group in  our country called the Remote Area Medical Expedition. They were in  Wise, Virginia, somewhere south of here.   What it is is a group of charitable citizens who are in optometry.  They are doctors. They are dentists. They donate their time over a  weekend, and they go to places in our country that don't have medical  care.   So no American should assume that everybody has care and that  everybody has insurance, even with the current system.   I will tell you, if you want your eyes opened, read that story.   Over one weekend, over 2,000 people came. There were people there who  were diabetic who had no medication. One woman, they reported in the  story, came with a dispenser for insulin, but the needle was broken.  Her glucose reading was over 500.   They talked about people who were there for glasses. They couldn't  afford glasses. One woman was diagnosed with vision of 20/100 in one  eye, and they were looking for glasses that would fit her.   They had a gentleman who was coughing, and he thought he had black  lung disease. It turned out what he really had was sleep apnea. Finally  somebody diagnosed what his problem was.   They start out with the story about a gentleman who showed up at that  event, and he took them to the trunk of his car and showed them the  pliers he was using to rip out his teeth because he had so many decayed  teeth and he hadn't been to the dentist in years. They had dentists.  They had all kinds of physicians. They had nurses trying to help  people.   I read that article and I thought: This is America? This is America?   Here are just the first few sentences, if I might. It says: ``Anthony  Marino, 54, reached into his car trunk to show a pair of needle-nosed  pliers like the ones he used to yank out a rotting tooth.   ``Shirley Akers, 58, clutched a list of 20 medications she takes,  before settling down to a sleepless night in the cab of a pickup truck.   ``Robin Neal, 40, tried to inject herself with a used-up insulin pen,  but it broke, and her blood sugar began to skyrocket.   ``As the sun set in the mountains of southwest Virginia, hundreds of  hurting souls were camped out or huddled in vehicles, eager for an  early place in line when the gates swung open at 5 a.m. for the  Nation's largest pop-up free clinic.''   That free clinic is called the Remote Area Medical Expedition. I just  read that. There were several photos in the paper. This is America.   So, for the Senate, particularly the leader of Senate who comes from  Kentucky, a State that is noted to have very poor medical care, where  there are large rural areas where many people, including those who are  single who get none of this coverage--right? The single are especially  discriminated against--how that could be pushed forward by someone from  the State of Kentucky, I simply don't understand it.   And here in this House, where we tried so hard to save the Affordable  Care Act and to make necessary changes to it, a lot of those changes  are needed in these rural States that don't have enough people to  really set up a large enough exchange. We need to lump two or three  States together so you get a pool that is insurable. We know how to fix  this. But we don't need to take more people off health insurance,  millions and millions and millions, because we have millions who still  are uninsured, and we have industries like the pharmaceutical industry  fighting us against trying to get affordable medications to our  constituents.   I want to thank you for being here tonight and for fighting the good  fight for the American people. Really, to have almost a trillion  dollars of money given away over the next 10, 15 years to the  wealthiest people in our country? You know what? They have doctors.  They can afford insurance. Frankly, they don't need more money. They  might benefit by a little less money, actually. Their heirs certainly  would. We need a little rigor out there, even among the wealthy in our  country, to help us to heal this Nation and to deal with its real  medical problems.   I will just say this. We were checking today on the diabetic costs  across our country. One facility in Ohio, just one veterans facility,  over 30,000 veterans in that facility have been diagnosed with  diabetes. Many, many of those veterans go for the treatment of dialysis  in order to help them to deal with their condition. For 1 year, that  treatment costs $100,000. Over a 10-year period, it costs $1 million  per person who goes through dialysis.   Imagine if we were able to prescribe food as medicine, which  hospitals are doing in many places, and help people learn how to not  become so severely diabetic. We would save so much money across this  country, including with our veterans. And more important than money, we  would save their lives. We would save the amputations. We would save  all of the costs that diabetes incurs over the years. So people would  learn how to be healthier.   I want to thank you for being here. I am proud of you two gentlemen,  Congressman Garamendi and Congressman Tonko. You are honorable  gentlemen. You have come here from both ends of the country, New York  and California. We are here tonight because we know what the American  people want. They want affordable healthcare. They want affordable  medicine. They are willing to do their part, and nobody should be left  out.    We can find that answer as the United States of America. We don't  have to accept this set of death panels that they are figuring out over  there in the Senate: who is going to die, who is not going to have  health insurance, who is going to be shortchanged. Because when that  wheel of fortune turns, you never know who in your family is going to  get sick. You simply don't know, and no one should be without coverage.   I thank you for being here on the floor tonight and for doing what  the American people expect us to do, and that is to defend and protect  them.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the kind gentleman for yielding, and  I thank him for arranging this Special Order this evening. I thank  Congressman Chabot for his kind words and all the Members who have come  to pay tribute to our beloved colleague, Ralph Regula.   Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to honor my late friend and respected  colleague who served 18 terms and was a gentleman farmer, the very  Honorable Congressman Ralph Regula of Ohio. Ralph passed away earlier  this month in Bethlehem Township, Ohio. He was 92.   To his beloved wife, Mary, for whom we all hold deep affection, and  their family--Martha, Richard, David, and their children--please let me  extend heartfelt sympathy and deepest affection.   I had the privilege of serving with Ralph for 26 years, many of those  on the Appropriations Committee.   As others have mentioned, Ralph Straus Regula was born in Beach City,  Ohio, on December 3, 1924, right before the Great Depression.   In 1948, he graduated from Mount Union College in Alliance, Ohio, and  went on to receive a degree in law as a night student from William  McKinley School of Law in Canton, and then went on to serve in the  United States Navy during World War II.   Some of my memories of Ralph include him pulling into the  congressional garage on so many occasions in his spiffy red pickup  truck, always thinking about what was happening back in Ohio on his  farm. That truck had many purposes.   So many evenings we were in the same building and I could see him  walking down the hall with Mary, his wife, well after 9 p.m. in the  evening after having put in a very long day here in Congress.   The press never reports about the Members who are dutiful and do  their work. They generally focus on those who run into a little bit of  trouble or get into a fracas, but Ralph Regula was the type of citizen  who holds this Republic together.   He was first elected in 1972 and was a longstanding, prominent figure  in our body, serving 36 years in the House by the time of his  retirement. At the time he retired, he was dean of the Ohio delegation  and number three in seniority on the Republican side of the powerful  Appropriations Committee. His service embraced the tenure of seven U.S.  Presidents.   As a lawmaker, Ralph was a champion of cross-party collaboration, as  others have referenced, and he was a moral compass in an era of  personal enrichment. Ralph is remembered as a hardworking,  constructive, affable, intelligent, and effective Member. He set a very  high standard.   I tried to write words that remind me of Ralph--certainly  ``talented,'' ``honest,'' ``hardworking,'' ``sensible,''  ``understated,'' ``straightforward,'' and ``even-tempered.''   If you never met him, he was sort of a cross between Andy Griffith  and Robert Redford. He was even-tempered and not vindictive--and he had  reason to be vindictive. He described himself as a conservative in  spending but a progressive in programs.   A proud Canton resident, he worked tirelessly to honor the legacy of  his hometown hero, President William McKinley. Regula sought to  preserve the fellow Ohioan's memory by fighting to keep the name Mount  McKinley for the summit in Alaska, homage to the man who represented  his same district.   During my time in the House, I have had the pleasure of serving  alongside Ralph on the Appropriations Committee, where he was  distinguished for sensible solutions that worked for Americans and for  Ohioans.   When he served on the Labor, Health, and Human Services Subcommittee,  he instructed me, when I got to Congress: This is where you really help  people.   Ralph was dedicated to that. He had such a heart, but he didn't wear  it on his sleeve. He supported working people. There are many votes he  cast in favor of the minimum wage. His father was a coal miner. He  understood what it was to do that kind of work for a living.   On the centennial of the Metro Parks' creation, we remember his  adoration and commitment to our public lands, founding one of northeast  Ohio's proudest landmarks, the Cuyahoga National Valley Park. He  dedicated so many of his years to creating that park, the Ohio and Erie  Canal system, and expanding that park to among the top 10 most visited  in the United States of America.   He attended to Ohio while he attended to the Nation. He had the guts  to pass new user fees for all national parks to raise money to improve  them, so he was thinking of the future.   He was the founder and leader of the Steel Caucus in this House--that  was one of the first places that I met him--and an early and effective  voice about foreign dumping and about the importance of manufacturing  in America, the importance of that steel industry and having fair trade  among nations.   With his wife, Mary, he was instrumental in creating the National  First Ladies' Library in Canton, Ohio, a most amazing place, with  important untold stories about valorous women in our country that, for  years, had been largely hidden from the public.   I recommend that the public go to the website of that library and  just read about the First Ladies of this country--not just who they  were, but  [[Page H6296]]  what they endured. I learned so much that I didn't know.   Ralph brought phenomenal experience to his public service. Others  talked about how he had practiced law, serving in the Navy, held a  degree in business administration, served as a school administrator, a  teacher, a principal, State legislator, and served on the Ohio Board of  Education. He was so level-headed.   An article in the The Washington Post reported that he introduced  language in appropriations bills and procedural maneuvers to fight  efforts to change Alaska's Mount McKinley name. Obviously, he held the  seat that was once occupied by President McKinley, the 25th President,  who, sadly, was assassinated in 1901.   As a graduate of the old William McKinley School of Law in Canton,  Mr. Regula did not want to see the name of his fellow Buckeye erased  from the tallest peak in North America. Ralph said: The law says it is  Mount McKinley, and no President can change the law by the flick of a  pen.   When he set his mind to it, he prevailed. His vast experience on the  legislative front led him and drove his successful efforts to invest  millions and millions of dollars in the improvement of healthcare for  the American people, as well as Ohio institutions such as the Cleveland  Clinic, University Hospitals, Case Western Reserve University, and  MetroHealth.   He championed the Great Lakes and fought mightily to find a way to  clean up coal. I can remember being on the Republican side of the  aisle. He said: Congresswoman Kaptur, you have got to help me clean up  coal.   He was always looking for a way to try to make life better. He  advocated for the National Endowment for the Arts. He worked to clean  up Florida's Everglades and led the construction of the popular  children's farm here in Washington at the National Zoo.   When people come to public service at the national level, they learn  that it is very hard to accomplish things over a brief period of time.  It takes a long time. It takes decades to do something of merit. Ralph  certainly achieved that.   In 2010, the Cleveland Plain Dealer quoted him. I will end my tribute  to him this evening with a quote that he gave to the Plain Dealer. He  said: ``Inflammatory rhetoric may satisfy the partisans, but it does  little or nothing to move the legislative ball to the goal line.'' He  was talking about the necessity of breaking legislative gridlock and  advocating bipartisan compromise.   I think by Congressman Bob Gibbs being on floor tonight, by my being  on the floor tonight, in a bipartisan spirit, giving tribute to Ralph  Regula, this is a life that Members of Congress can learn from: real  achievement, real merit, real honor. He brought real meaning to the  word the ``Honorable'' Ralph Straus Regula.   May God let him rest in peace and bless his spirit.
