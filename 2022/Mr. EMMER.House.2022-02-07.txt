 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to once again address the crisis  hurting every household in America: runaway inflation.   The January 12 Consumer Price Index report showed inflation has  increased 7 percent over the last 12 months, the fastest increase since  1982.   Rural communities are being hit harder than anyone else. In my  district, inflation has increased 8 percent over the past year.  Americans are paying more for essentials everywhere, from the grocery  store to the gas station, and working families are being hit the  hardest.   Like many of my colleagues, I believe the primary driver of this  inflation is unchecked government spending. Unfortunately, even though  inflation has reached historic highs, this issue continues to be  ignored by many of my Democrat colleagues.   Whether you agree with me or not, we owe it to the American people to  identify the root cause and begin to address the problem. I have  introduced legislation to do just that, and I hope all of my colleagues  will join me in supporting efforts that put an end to this ongoing  problem that harms every single American, especially those living  paycheck to paycheck and trying to raise a family.                    Recognizing Deputy Chief Dan Szykulski     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Deputy Chief  [[Page H980]]  Dan Szykulski. In January, Dan retired as deputy chief of the Blaine  Police Department.   Dan served with the Blaine Police Department for 38 years. During  that time, he saw many changes in the city and his department.   Deputy Chief Szykulski had the respect and admiration of his fellow  officers. Often described as a hard worker and team player, Dan was  always there to lend a hand on emergency calls or bring in home-cooked  meals for officers working on holidays.   Dan earned numerous awards during his career, including the Chief's  Compassion Award and a Certificate of Recognition from the city of  Blaine. I should note, however, that possibly my favorite thing about  Dan was his reputation as the best hockey player in the station. He  will certainly be missed at the annual Guns and Hoses hockey game.  Maybe he will be able to return with an alumni exception.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Dan thank for his service, and I congratulate  him on his retirement.                         Recognizing Dr. Richard Lee     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the career of Dr.  Richard Lee. Dr. Lee is retiring as executive director of the Central  Minnesota Mental Health Center.   Dr. Lee has led the center for the past 6 years. In that time, Dr.  Lee has been a champion for expanding mental health resources in  central Minnesota. I have had the privilege to work with Dr. Lee and  have been fortunate to visit the Central Minnesota Mental Health Center  to see the great work they do.   Under Dr. Lee's leadership, the Central Minnesota Mental Health  Center cultivated and expanded strong community partnerships with local  counties, law enforcement, and healthcare agencies. Dr. Lee also helped  develop and expand the Co-Responder Program that partners mental health  professionals with law enforcement officers to respond to behavioral  health calls.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Dr. Lee for the incredible impact he has had on  expanding access and availability of mental health care in central  Minnesota and wish him an enjoyable and well-deserved retirement.               Honoring the Life of Gregory ``Butch'' Bakeberg     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Gregory  ``Butch'' Bakeberg, a constituent, a friend, and a leader in  Minnesota's agriculture community.   Butch passed away last month at the age of 74, but his legacy and  work for the Sixth District and the city of Waverly, Minnesota, will  continue to have an impact.   Butch was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, but moved to Waverly where  his family owned and operated Goldview Farm. Butch and his wife, Faye,  were active in their community for decades, getting involved with the  Wright County American Dairy Association and helping start the Wright  County Breakfast on the Farm Committee. Butch and Faye were known to  host countless agricultural-related events on their farm with the goal  of educating fellow Minnesotans on dairy farming. They also host the  occasional Sunday mass on the family farm as well.   Last year, I had an opportunity to visit Butch on his family's farm,  and I am glad I did. Butch and Faye truly represent the best of  Minnesota, and while we mourn the loss of a leader in our community,  Butch's contribution to our community will live on for years to come.                         Remembering Loral I. Delaney     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Loral I.  Delaney. Loral I passed away on September 19, 2021, after battling  breast cancer.   Loral I was a shooting-sports legend. In 1957, at the age of 19,  Loral I competed in her first event, the Minnesota State Trap Shoot,  which she won with a near-perfect score. Loral I would go on to win  seven Grand American World Trapshooting Championships, five of them  consecutively. Loral I remains the only woman to win more than two  championships in a row and more than four in total.   Loral I not only loved to compete, but she had an incredible passion  for animals, as well. She and her husband, Chuck, ran Armstrong Ranch  Kennels in Ramsey, Minnesota, providing grooming and training for some  of Minnesota's premier hunting dogs. Loral I also founded an event  known as Game Fair, an annual event known and beloved by sportsmen and  -women and hunting enthusiasts throughout Minnesota and beyond.   Loral I leaves a tremendous legacy behind her; she will be missed  dearly. To Chuck and her family, we offer our sincere condolences.                            ____________________
