 Mr. Speaker, I reflect on all that House Democrats have  done for the people this year and how much harm the grim reaper of the  Senate, Mitch McConnell, has done by purposefully stalling our  legislative agenda.   Our Democratic House majority has worked relentlessly for the people  to  [[Page H9352]]  strengthen the health, economic security, and well-being of every  family in every community, and we have made real progress.   We ended the Trump government shutdown, which inflicted needless pain  and chaos into the lives of our fellow Americans and New Mexicans whose  paychecks, financial security, health, and well-being were held hostage  by the President.   We stood strong and prevailed for the American people and did not  give him the immoral, illegal border wall.   To improve the safety of our communities, we sent to the Senate  commonsense, bipartisan gun violence prevention legislation that would  make our children safer.   As vice chair of the Democratic Women's Caucus, I am proud that we  have worked to strengthen women's personal and financial security by  passing a strong reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, the  Debbie Smith Reauthorization Act, and the Paycheck Fairness Act to  ensure equal pay for equal work.   To bolster the paychecks and retirement security of working families,  we passed the Raise the Wage Act to increase the Federal minimum wage  to $15 an hour, giving a raise to 33 million Americans, including 20  million women. We also passed the Butch Lewis Act to protect the  pensions of more than 1 million workers and retirees.   To live up to the promises that we made to our veterans, we have  passed dozens of bipartisan bills, including fixes to end unjust and  unfair taxes on military families; expanded benefits for blue water  Navy Vietnam veterans exposed to Agent Orange; and legislation to  reduce barriers for women veterans to access the VA, including an  antiharassment initiative.   To address our climate crisis, we passed the Climate Action Now Act  and multiple bills to protect our public lands for generations to come.  I have introduced legislation myself to promote natural solutions to  climate change, such as H.R. 4269, the Climate Stewardship Act, and for  the adoption of clean energy, H.R. 5221, the 100% Clean Economy Act.   I am especially proud to have led the bipartisan effort on House  passage of the Chaco Cultural Heritage Area Protection Act to protect  my ancestral homeland from oil and gas drilling.   We have fought for those who have been the targets of hateful  rhetoric and policies of this administration. We passed H.R. 6, the  American Dream and Promise Act, to help Dreamers stay right here in the  United States, their home, the only country they know.   Democrats have taken a stand to end discrimination against LGBTQ  Americans by passing the historic Equality Act, H.R. 5.   To stand up for human rights, we passed bipartisan legislation to  recognize the Armenian genocide as the atrocity that it was, hold  Turkey accountable for attacking our Kurdish allies, reject the  President's disastrous decisionmaking in Syria, and uphold America's  commitment to human rights and the rule of law in Hong Kong.   In light of the threats our democracy faces from foes foreign and  domestic, we passed H.R. 1, the For the People Act; the SAFE Act; and  the SHIELD Act to strengthen our elections and democracy and boost our  defenses against foreign attacks on these systems. We passed H.R. 4,  the Voting Rights Advancement Act, to protect the right of all  Americans to participate in our democracy.   The Democratic House has sent Senator McConnell more than 275  bipartisan bills, yet he still refuses to take them up. The American  people deserve and demand action, and we call on Senator McConnell to  put our legislation up for a vote.   I am proud to have worked alongside my colleagues in this House  majority to move these important issues forward for the people.                            ____________________
