 Mr. Speaker, I am proud to stand today to congratulate my  friend and colleague from the great State of Ohio, Congresswoman Marcy  Kaptur who on March 18th will become the longest serving woman U.S.  Representative in U.S. history.   Marcy, for 35 years, has served this nation and the people of Ohio  with distinction.   It is my honor to serve with someone that never backs down from a  fight and leads on all the things that are important to Ohio and all  Americans.   I applaud her for her commitment and dedication to revitalizing our  cities, ensuring fair trade deals and good jobs for American workers,  increased funding for defense and energy security, and protecting the  Great Lakes.   She has accomplished and contributed so much yet never forgot where  she came from or the people that have helped her to become.   On behalf of the people of Ohio's 11th Congressional District, I  thank her for her service and congratulations on this historic  achievement.                            ____________________
