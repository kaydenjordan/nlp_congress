 Today, I should be in my district working for my  constituents. Instead, I am back here in Washington because the  majority could not resist another made-for-TV impeachment.   American workers are losing their jobs and struggling to feed their  families. Small businesses are being forced to lay off workers and  close their doors. Families are, tragically, losing loved ones to the  coronavirus.   Instead of creating or even saving American jobs, or negotiating  additional COVID relief, we are debating an impeachment that has been  preceded by no inquiry, no meaningful debate, and no due process.   In 1 week's time, Joe Biden will be the President. The American  people need us to rise above the heat of the moment, to focus on their  needs, and to deliver real solutions.   Because the majority decided we should debate whether or not to  remove a sitting President in just 2 hours, I will be brief: I oppose  this Article of Impeachment.
