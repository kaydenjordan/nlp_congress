 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Maryland for  his courtesy.   Mr. Speaker, there is a document that I hold in my hand that covers  the epidemic apparently that is taking siege over America. It contains  the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the United  States.   The Declaration of Independence paraphrases we are all created equal  with certain inalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of  happiness.                                time  1315    I am honored to serve in this body and, with honor, walk through the  halls and look at the historical depictions of the early years.   Just coming back from D-Day in Normandy, I am reminded of the brave  men and, certainly, women who served in the United States military,  supporters in World War II, but, in particular, the men who stormed the  Normandy beach.   I am reminded, I am sure, of the words of General Dwight D.  Eisenhower, who said: The world is watching, and they will join you in  marching to victory.   This Constitution has the Ninth Amendment, the right to privacy. It  has the right to freedom of religion and freedom of access and freedom  of speech. And all that is being done here today is to acknowledge not  only the poor 15-year-old, 13-year-old, and 14-year-old that my good  friend from Maryland talked about, but, all over the country, denying  poor women access to health services that should really be based upon  their faith, their God, their family, and their medical provider.   In some of the bills in Missouri and in some of the bills that are  being proposed in Georgia, Alabama, and in my own State of Texas, it is  litigation that would get you healthcare. It is no respect of the  individual human being, the person, who may have to go back to the  antics of yesteryear, dealing with the tactics of coat hangers of which  many of us are aware.   Let me also say that underlying in this rule is the opportunity for  the force of the authority of the Article I Congress to enforce  individuals to come before congressional committees, such as the  Committee on the Judiciary, which we will debate later.   It is invested in this Constitution, because of Article I authority  and the collegial response that the Founding Fathers wanted us to have,  that there are no unequal branches--there is a number one branch--and  one branch should not ignore and disrespect the other branch.   Therefore, if Article I branch, which we are in, asks for witnesses  and then is blocked by another branch that has no greater status--read  the Constitution.   In this rule, we have tried to correct the imbalance and  inappropriateness that is occurring in this body and in this process,  and so I ask my colleagues to support the rule and the underlying  legislation to restore the Constitution.    Mr. Speaker, I think it is appropriate to correct a  number of statements that have been made on the floor.   First of all, this is not the end. Director Mueller made this the  beginning. When he concluded the report, he left a very large direction  to the United States Congress. He recognized that he could not follow  up because of policies at the DOJ regarding indictment in the process  of the administration.   So the Congress, in its due diligence, took the responsibility not to  target anyone, but to simply uphold the rule of law. In upholding the  rule of law, we had an empty seat by Attorney General Barr, an empty  seat by Mr. McGahn, an empty seat by Ms. Hicks, Ms. Donaldson, and we  hope not an empty seat of the author of the report.   So all this resolution does is authorize the committee to seek civil  enforcement of its subpoenas against Attorney General Barr, requiring  him to provide Congress with the key evidence underlying the Mueller  report as well as the unredacted report itself, and former White House  Counsel Donald F. McGahn, requiring him to provide documents and appear  for testimony.   He is not covered by executive privilege. In fact, executive  privilege does not cover--his duty is to the White House Office of the  General Counsel, or the White House counsel's office, not to the  individual officeholder, the President. He has personal lawyers.   And we didn't break the law. 6(e), which is grand jury materials, our  committee diligently said let's work with the Department of Justice, go  to court, and decide what we can see.   We are simply following this little book that many have died for, and  that is the Constitution of the United States, and those words in the  Declaration of Independence that said we all are created equal, with  certain unalienable rights of life and liberty and the pursuit of  happiness.    The American people would not want a Congress that  turned its back on, frankly, the rule of law.   For those of us who had the special privilege of going to Normandy  this past week, we got a great sense of pride, of the courage of  Americans, the bravery of those young men, and all I could think of is  how important it is to all of us to adhere to those wonderful  principles.   So, again, there is no targeting here. This is not a way to do policy  or legislation. We can fight that battle on the floor of the House.   But if you read those volumes and end it in the last pages of Volume  2, you know that Director Mueller asked us to finish the task of  looking into elements that he did not or could not and the underlying  issues.   Let me also say, as we do that, we do it forthrightly because, in  2020, we want to make sure that every American has the right to vote  and every American is not undermined by a foreign operative interfering  and taking the election away from you.   I support the resolution. We must stand for the rule of law.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 430, authorizing the  Committee on the Judiciary to initiate or intervene in judicial  proceedings to enforce certain subpoenas and for other purposes.   It is an honor to serve in this body.   We are the successors and heirs to an august freedom earned centuries  ago, expanded for successive groups and defended through the blood,  sweat and tears of the nation's fighting forces.   It is this debt that took me to the beaches of Normandy to pay my  respects on the 75th Anniversary of the D-Day invasion.   We are heirs to this legacy, and we are heirs to this ingenious  system of separation of powers.   The system they laid down presumes equality of power among the  branches.   As custodians of Article I, we have a duty to ensure the rigors of  the Constitution are upheld.   This includes that when the Second Branch, Article II, flouts the  investigative prerogatives of the Congress, there must be recourse and  accountability.   As a senior member of the House Judiciary Committee, I have to say  that it is regrettable that we are here.   This is because a hallmark of our constitutional republic is that no  person is above the law.   Congressional oversight has been the tradition going back to the  first years of our republic.   And the congressional prerogative of oversight has been a tool in the  Article I arsenal as a way of asserting our power and protecting  against the worst excesses of an executive.   This comports with the founding of our government, which sought to  prevent the concentration of power in an autocratic executive, which  was anathema to the Founders.   Which is why the events of the last many months have been so  confounding.   The decision by this executive to flout all lawfully authorized  subpoenas has been unprecedented.   This dispute between the political branches should work itself out,  but because of this presidential obstinacy, we are in this predicament,  which is why we must pass this H. Res 430, Authorizing Subpoena  Enforcement Litigation.   This Resolution, H. Res. 430, builds on the House Judiciary  Committee's contempt finding against Attorney General Barr.  [[Page H4421]]    The resolution authorizes the Committee to seek civil enforcement of  its subpoenas against: (i) Attorney General Barr requiring him to  provide Congress with the key evidence underlying the Mueller Report as  well as the unredacted report itself; and (ii) former White House  Counsel Donald F. McGahn, II requiring him to provide documents and  appear for testimony.   The resolution further affirms that all committee chairs, when  authorized by the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group, retain the ability  to seek civil enforcement of their own subpoenas.   The resolution adds that when committees proceed to court, they have  any and all necessary authority under Article I of the Constitution,  ensuring that they have the maximum range of legal authority available  to them.   For example, on other key issues--such as the Department of Justice  defying a subpoena to produce counter-intelligence documents relating  to Russia's interference with the 2016 election, or the Commerce  Department defying a subpoena to produce documents relating to the  addition of a citizenship question to the 2020 Census--the committees  can enforce these subpoenas without a floor vote.   This resolution ensures the House can conduct meaningful oversight on  issues critical to Americans' lives while continuing to deliver on  pocketbook issues.   The President's disregard for congressional oversight allows the  Administration to cover-up his many disastrous policy decisions such  as: attacking affordable healthcare coverage for millions of Americans  including those with pre-existing conditions, tearing apart vulnerable  immigrant families, misappropriating military funds for his ill- conceived border wall, and rolling back landmark civil rights  protections for minorities.   The information subpoenaed by various congressional committees,  including documents and testimony, is information to which Congress is  constitutionally entitled and that past Administrations have routinely  provided.   President Trump has prevented fact witnesses referenced in the  Mueller Report from testifying or providing documents to Congress.   This is despite the fact that the Report detailed the Russian  government's sustained attacks on our elections; over 170 contacts  between President Trump's campaign and associates and agents of the  Russian government; as well as numerous efforts by President Trump to  impede or thwart House investigations scrutinizing his own conduct and  that of his Administration.   In keeping with the President's sweeping public refusal to comply  with congressional subpoenas, the White House and the Administration  are fighting to keep the truth from the American people.   This resolution ensures we can conduct oversight on issues that are  critical to Americans' lives while continuing to deliver on pocketbook  issues.   The information subpoenaed by various congressional committees,  including documents and testimony, is information Congress is  constitutionally entitled to and which past Administrations have  routinely provided.   Congress not only is constitutionally entitled to the underlying  evidence in the Special Counsel's Report and key fact witness  testimony, it requires this information so that it can fulfill its  legislative, oversight, and other constitutional responsibilities.   This resolution follows past precedent used by Democratic and  Republican Majorities while reinforcing an important principle in the  House Rules.   This Administration's disregard for the legislative and judicial  branches has reached a tipping point.   Despite representing a coequal branch of government, this  Administration is flagrantly disregarding the role Congress and the  Judiciary must play in our democratic system.   Mr. Speaker, the foregoing has been the basis for this Resolution.   It was my hope that this was not needed.   But the President has proven me wrong, which is why this Resolution  is needed.   I urge passage of the Resolution.
