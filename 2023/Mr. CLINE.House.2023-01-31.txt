 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to stand in support of the House  concurrent resolution to denounce socialism in all its forms.   For decades, the embrace of socialist ideas around the world has led  to evil regimes denying their people of their fundamental human rights  and subjecting them to imprisonment and abuse.   Countless Cubans, Venezuelans, Russians, Chinese, Cambodians, and  Koreans have escaped from murderous regimes to come live a better life  in America. They are all a true testament to the promise of the  American Dream and the hope of prosperity.   These survivors are members of our family, our friends, and our  neighbors, like Pablo Cuevas from Rockingham County.   Born and raised in Cuba, Pablo worked on his parents' farm, which was  apparently dispossessed by the Marxists. Pablo fled Cuba in 1958 during  the Cuban Revolution and resettled here in America. He served on the  Rockingham County Board of Supervisors in my district for 30 years and  continues to be a leader in our community.   Mr. Speaker, socialism has led to painful human tragedies such as  starvation, torture, and mass murder, taking more than 100 million  lives around the world.   As oppressive and violent regimes still exist today, this resolution  reaffirms our support for freedom, democracy, and human rights. May we  always ensure that dangerous socialist, un-American policies are never  brought to pass here in our great country.           Woodstock Fire Department Celebrating 200th Anniversary     Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the 200th anniversary of  the all-volunteer Woodstock Fire Department.   Tracing its history back to 1823, the department has served the  Shenandoah Valley as one of the oldest departments in the Commonwealth  and the Nation.   Today, the department has 40 active volunteers who selflessly risk  their lives every day to ensure the safety of their neighbors and the  preservation of the community.   The department is led by Captain Zach Hottel, a third-generation  volunteer himself, and truly represents the spirit of service. Captain  Hottel and the volunteers' dedication to serving others, who are  sometimes experiencing the unimaginable, defines what it means to serve  your neighbor. It is an example we should all strive to follow every  day.   The Woodstock Fire Department is commemorating its founding of  February 8, 1823, with a bicentennial birthday bash at the Woodstock  fire station.   Congratulations again to the Woodstock Fire Department on this  incredible milestone. I wish them another 200 years of success in  serving the people of the Shenandoah Valley.                            ____________________
