 Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate the 50th  anniversary of the incorporation of the town of Mountain View, WY.   On August 19, the folks of Mountain View will come together for the  town's 50th birthday party celebration with food, music, games, and  fireworks. This event is an exceptional example of Mountain View's  strong sense of community. The town of Mountain View was incorporated  on November 20, 1973, in Uinta County, WY. Wilford Stoddard became the  first mayor, along with council members Eldon Tripp, Jack Byrne, Alfred  Davidson, and James Cox. Located in Bridger Valley, at the base of the  Uinta Mountain Range, the town is far older than 50 years. Mountain  View was platted on 40 acres within the county on February 26, 1898.  Today, the town spans over 550 acres.   In 1843, fur trapper Jim Bridger set up a trading post on the Black's  Fork River just a few miles from present day Mountain View. The post  served travelers on the Oregon Trail and later the Mormon and  California Trails. In 1858, the U.S. Army took over the post and named  it Fort Bridger. The army abandoned the fort in 1890. As Americans  began moving west, many settlers in Bridger Valley and what is today  Mountain View established ranches. Today, Mountain View remains deeply  rooted in agriculture, feeding Wyoming and the rest of the country.   The views and scenery of Mountain View are unparalleled. The town  serves as a hub offering its residents and visitors remarkable  opportunities for fishing, camping, and hiking in the Uinta Mountains.  The Uintas are one of only two major mountain ranges in the United  States that run east to west. One of the earliest local businesses in  Mountain View was Benedicts, the town's only grocery store. Started in  1938 as the Benedict Trading Company by Harlen Benedict, the store is  still a cornerstone of the community. Another local and long-standing  business is the Union Telephone Company. Founded by John Woody in 1914,  Union provided the first phone service in Bridger Valley. John Woody  used rifle cartridges as plugs and jacks on his first homemade  switchboard. Managed by four generations of the Woody family, the  company is still headquartered in Mountain View where they serve over  40,000 Wyoming customers. In June 1937, the people of Mountain View and  the surrounding Bridger Valley unified to create the first electric  utility under President Franklin D. Roosevelt's Rural Electrification  Administration. Bill Riding served as the first general manager for the  newly formed Bridger Valley Electric Association. The association  continues to provide Mountain View with power in 2023.   Mountain View boasts a long and rich local history. From the time of  the fur trappers, to the Nation's westward expansion of the 19th  century, to modern day, Mountain View truly embodies the culture of the  Cowboy State.   Mountain View is led by these dedicated individuals:         Bryan Ayres, Mayor        Tori Carter, Council        Jenny Harvey, Council        Jamy Ferrin, Council        Kelly Bonner, Council        Penny Robbins, Clerk/Treasurer        Amanda Fraughton, Deputy Clerk        Mark W Harris, Attorney        Tammy Murray, Deputy Clerk        Heather Ayres, Deputy Clerk        Jacob Porter, Public Works        Steven Kendall, Public Works        Spencer Bates, Public Works        Steve Catlin, Public Works        Allister Bunch, Police Chief        Dexter Moehler, Fire Chief.
