 Madam Speaker, I thank the distinguished subcommittee  chair for yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the en bloc, which includes my  important amendment highlighting the United States' continued enabling  of the Saudi Arabia-led coalition's ongoing blockade of Yemen.   The war in Yemen is now in its sixth year, and it is clear that there  is no military solution to the conflict.   While the Biden administration announced earlier this year that it  would limit U.S. involvement in the conflict, it has never been  authorized by Congress, and more needs to be done.   This begins by pushing for an end to the Saudi blockade of Yemen,  which has exacerbated what continues to be the world's worst  humanitarian crisis, with at least 400,000 Yemeni children facing  starvation and potential death.   The blockade limits delivery of food, fuel, and other critical  supplies to the Yemeni people. This is unconscionable when Yemen is  already facing the devastation of civil war and an ongoing public  health crisis caused by COVID.   Madam Speaker, we have to do better. I encourage my colleagues to  support this en bloc to send a message that the blockade of Yemen needs  to end.
