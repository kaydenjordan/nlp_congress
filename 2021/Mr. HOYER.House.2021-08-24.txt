 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this rule. This rule  allows the Congress of the United States to do the people's business in  two critical areas--actually, three.   Number one, it provides for us to receive from the Senate the budget  and to do what the Republicans did on their tax bill: act on a budget  reconciliation bill.   You did that. You, of course, didn't pay for it. We are going to pay  for this.   Secondly, this rule allows us to proceed on a piece of legislation  which seeks to make sure that the Voting Rights Act, protecting the  most important asset a citizen has, and that is their right to vote or,  as our Speaker has said, the voice of those not empowered. That is not  exactly what it was, Madam Speaker.   Two of these items are critical, and when we talk about saving lives,  the reconciliation bill and the budget, the Build Back Better Act is  going to save lives and enrich the quality of lives of our people.   Thirdly, this rule will allow us to proceed to adopt the bipartisan-- 69 Senators voting for it--infrastructure bill. It is not a perfect  bill. It is not our bill, and it is limited in some respects in terms  of its addressing one of our most important challenges and enemies, and  that is climate change. It nevertheless is a very, very substantial  investment in America, its growth, people, and jobs.   Vote for this rule. It is a good bill for the people.    Madam Speaker, how pleased our friend would be that Nikema  Williams is presiding, his successor. He was one of her mentors.   Madam Speaker, how proud you must be to preside at this critical time  in our history.   Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Selma, Alabama, Terri  Sewell. I have been with Terri and her church, worshipped with her,  prayed  [[Page H4408]]  with John Lewis in her church, walked down the streets of her town and  over a bridge called the Edmund Pettus Bridge. And unlike John Lewis,  when we walked across it, there were Alabama troopers to protect us  rather than prevent us from voting.   Madam Speaker, I have heard a lot of discussion on the floor today  about how there is no problem in America; people have full access. Too  many people that I talk to throughout the country have told me that is  not the case.   The Supreme Court passed a ruling and said, Oh, everything was fine.  And as soon as they did, as soon as they took this preclearance off,  State after State after State enacted legislation to make it more  difficult to vote; like that.   Justice Ginsburg made an analogy in Shelby that the Supreme Court was  saying, Oh, well, there is no problem left. She said it was like the  man with the umbrella who had the umbrella up; wasn't getting wet. It  was raining, but he wasn't getting wet. So he gave the umbrella away  and said, I'm okay. I am dry. And then immediately, of course, he got  all wet.   Madam Speaker, I am proud to join my sister, Terri Sewell; John's  sister. John called me brother, and he called all of us brothers and  sisters, in this, the beloved community that he envisioned. That was  King's vision, as John was his disciple.   Today, we are honoring the legacy of a historic Member of this House.  In my view, I have served with two historic Members of the Congress of  the United States and the Senate and the House. There were a lot of  famous, but two historic figures: One was John Lewis. And the other is  Nancy Pelosi, the first woman Speaker and, in my view, the most  effective Speaker with whom I have served in the 40 years that I have  been here.   John Lewis was my dear friend, and he was your dear friend. I called  him the most Christlike person I have ever seen, our dear Saint John,  who preached to us the gospel of getting into ``good trouble'' and  creating a beloved community; the gospel of John Robert Lewis.   He would be proud of us today for bringing this bill to the floor. He  worked hard on this bill. I can remember sitting--  Jim Clyburn and I,  and John Lewis and others--sitting in my whip's conference room,  working on voting rights' legislation.   So let us honor his memory today with strong support for its voting  rights' protection, for its reversal of the damage wrought by the 2013  Shelby v. Holder ruling, and for its recognition that our democracy is  imperfect if it is not open to all eligible to vote.   In that ruling, Shelby v. Holder, the Supreme Court erred in its  assessment of how necessary the Voting Rights Act's preclearance  section was for protecting Americans' right to vote. You are not  protecting Americans' right to vote if the relief that you can seek is  after the fact, after the governor or the President or the Senator or  the House of Delegates or representative, Member has been elected. It  is too late. That is why preclearance was so critically important to  reform and to protection of voters' rights.   In her powerful dissent, as I said, Justice Ginsburg pointed out that  throwing out preclearance when it has worked and has continued to work  to stop discriminatory changes is like that gentleman giving away his  umbrella.   Indeed, since 2013, we have seen a veritable downpour of  discriminatory and exclusionary voter suppression measures. I hear  people arguing--I heard a Texan argue on this floor about how it is so  easy to vote in Texas. Yet, we see them fighting for legislation, which  half of their body--or not quite half, unfortunately--but a big number  of their body who represents minority citizens says, No, you are wrong.  You ought to walk in our shoes and find that they are making it more  difficult for me to vote.   Since 2013, we have seen a veritable downpour, as I said. The John R.  Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, sponsored by Terri Sewell, would  confront this tempest head on. We have seen a campaign of voter  suppression efforts in Republican-led jurisdictions that have changed  their laws and voting rules to make it harder for eligible Americans to  vote.   Their leader, Donald Trump, says there was fraud, there was theft.  The problem is the Republican judges to which they appealed said no.  The problem is Attorney General Barr, who covered up almost everything  that Donald Trump said, even he couldn't say that there was fraud.                                time  1715    And so they justify these laws by somehow there is fraud out there,  they are stealing our elections. That is baloney. It is the same kind  of lie that Donald Trump continues to parrot. And if you say, like Liz  Cheney did, he is lying, you are kicked out of your party.   We have seen a campaign of voter suppression over and over and over  again, making it harder for eligible Americans to vote,  disproportionately targeting African Americans. I am not an African  American. It is hard for me to walk in those shoes.   I try to empathize, but I know if I am not Black, I can't really be  as knowledgeable as I would be if I were Black, and I was every day  subjected to discrimination, or if I were another person of color.   They have reduced early voting opportunities that help working people  cast ballots. They want to eliminate--they haven't in every place--mail  balloting, because they feel somehow if I don't see them when they fill  out that form and attest that they are who they are under penalties of  perjury that somehow----   Now, I can understand, from a party that in the last seven elections,  in the last quarter of a century, have elected a number of Presidents,  only one got a majority; only one, but they won the electoral college  vote. That is why some Republicans said: Are you crazy? You confirm the  electoral college, because it is what is protecting us against the  majority.   They purged voter rolls so that people who believed themselves to be  registered because they had registered and voted in the past, showed up  to vote but were turned away.   I sponsored the Help America Vote Act with a guy named Bob Ney, who  was from Ohio and a Republican, and a dear friend of mine.  Unfortunately, he got in trouble, but he is a good man, still a good  man. And we provided for provisional ballots, which simply said, if you  made a mistake and came to the wrong precinct, fill out the ballot, we  are going to check it tomorrow or the next day and make sure you are  eligible to vote, and if you are, we will count it. That made sense;  efforts to eliminate those.   These are real and pressing challenges facing our elections and our  democracy; not imaginary fraud, but active and visible voter  suppression. We have a duty, my colleagues, Democrat and Republican  colleagues, we have a duty, a responsibility, a moral responsibility to  make sure that people can vote and that we facilitate their vote, not  impede it. Not make it more difficult. Facilitate it. Encourage them.  Lift them up and let them vote.   And we owe it to John Lewis and the other heroes of Selma, and all  the other small towns and byways and big cities and big States, where  people fought, demonstrated, were bruised, battered, beaten, and yes,  some died, so that their brothers and sisters could have the vote.   My colleagues, it falls to us now, today, to continue their march  forward, and to carry on their work. There are no Alabama troopers  waiting on the other side that are going to beat us or batter us or  prevent us. We are not at risk. Whatever way we vote, we are going to  walk out of there today and we are going to be fine.   But we have a moral responsibility to those who fought here and  around the world to protect the vote, to protect democracy.   I urge my colleagues, Madam Speaker, to join you, to join me, to join  our fellow colleagues in voting for H.R. 4, and for the protection of  voting rights in our country. H.R. 4 the people.                            Parliamentary Inquiry     Madam Speaker, parliamentary inquiry.    Madam Speaker, is it appropriate on the floor of the House  to tell the truth?
