 Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this  resolution to remove the arbitrary deadline to ratify the equal rights  amendment. This year is the centennial of the 19th Amendment, yet women  are still fighting for full and equal rights under the law.    Women continue to face many barriers to true equality, including  pregnancy and gender discrimination, unequal pay, and a lack of access  to a full range of reproductive healthcare services. The equal rights  amendment to the Constitution would provide for fundamental equality  for women regardless of who is President, who is on the Supreme Court,  or changes in Federal law.   Congress first approved the equal rights amendment in 1972, and my  home State of Oregon was quick to ratify it the following year. Now, 38  States--the required three-fourths under the Constitution--have  ratified the amendment. Today Congress will stand with our States and  make it clear that it is time--actually way past time--to adopt the  equal rights amendment. It is not too late to do the right thing. It is  not too late for equality.   Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this  resolution.  [[Page H1138]]
