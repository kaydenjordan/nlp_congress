 Mr. Speaker, Chaz Karidis of Madison County, Illinois, had  dreams of being a husband and a father. His family said he wanted to be  a good role model for his younger brother.   Sadly, those dreams came to an end in November of 2013 when Chaz's  mom, Kari, received a phone call that no parent wants to receive. Kari  learned that Chaz had lost his battle with heroin addiction just after  his 23rd birthday.   As a parent and a grandparent, I can't imagine the agony in receiving  that call.   This painful loss of a child led Kari to launch a nonprofit that  provides support and assistance to the companions of people suffering  from addiction. Sadly, organizations like Kari's are needed now more  than ever.   In 2016, there were almost 2,000 opioid overdose fatalities in  Illinois alone. That is nearly twice the number of fatalities that  occur in motor vehicle accidents.   Opioid overdose deaths have increased 82 percent between 2013 and  2016 in Illinois; not counting how much it has increased around this  Nation.   These aren't just numbers, and they aren't just statistics. These are  moms and dads and sons and daughters and neighbors and friends.   Addiction doesn't care about your race, your income, your gender, or  your politics. That is why I am proud to join my Republican and  Democrat friends this week in the passing of legislation that focuses  on treatment and recovery, prevention, protecting our communities, and  fighting against synthetic drugs. If we work together, we can save  lives and continue to restore hope in our communities.   To the folks at home, if you see someone struggling with addiction,  please encourage them to seek help through the local drug and alcohol  treatment centers. Don't wait for a phone call, the one you want never  to come.                            ____________________
