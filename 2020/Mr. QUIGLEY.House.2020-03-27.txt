 Mr. Speaker, this legislation is a bold, bipartisan deal  to address the ongoing health care crisis, protect workers, and assist  small businesses.   This is first and foremost a health care crisis. Until we address  this pandemic, our economy will not recover.   I was proud to lead a bipartisan letter with Dave Joyce in support of  the $130 billion direct hospital funding included in this bill.   The most important thing Congress can do after addressing the health  care crisis is to provide direct assistance to the American people.   Thanks to the tireless work of leadership from both parties, many  individuals with working class salaries will receive a one-time direct  payment of around $1200.   And we have provided unemployment assistance that goes well beyond  the initial proposal by ensuring that every worker--including gig  workers--are protected.   We cannot ask taxpayers to foot the bill for rescuing our economy  without the promise of accountability.   This bill prevents any secret bailouts and ensures no member of this  administration can benefit from this crisis.   Each legislative measure we pass is just a single step.   There will be more need and Congress will need to act to address  those needs as they arise.  [[Page H1858]]    I will be keeping in close contact with my constituents, so I know  exactly what their needs are on the ground and bring that back to  Congress so no one is forgotten or left behind.
