 Madam Speaker, this week is National Police Week, and I  rise to honor the brave men and women of law enforcement who gave their  lives to protect our communities.   In 1962, National Police Week was established by President John F.  Kennedy, a Democrat. But back then, honoring our fallen officers was a  bipartisan issue, Madam Speaker. Today, many Democrats are so set on  demonizing law enforcement they won't even use this week to honor those  lives that have been lost in the line of duty. It is a shame that  supporting law enforcement has become such a political nonstarter for  my colleagues across the aisle.   Police officers in our communities are cracking down on gangs,  getting drugs off the streets, and stopping crime before it happens.  They are keeping all of us safe and deserve to know those who made the  ultimate sacrifice will never be forgotten and will always be honored.   Law enforcement, particularly our local sheriff's offices and police  departments in Tennessee's Second Congressional District, will always  have my gratitude for the great work they do to keep us safe from bad  folks.                            ____________________
