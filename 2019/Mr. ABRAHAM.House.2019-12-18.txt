 Madam Speaker, what is shameful is that Speaker Pelosi  has allowed this Democratic witch hunt to move forward. She is the one  that has abused her power, and we should be debating her removal from  the House.   Reagan said that: ``The trouble with our liberal friends is not that  they are ignorant, it is just that they know so much that isn't so.''   Democrat extreme partisanship will set a dangerous precedent for this  Nation. And mark my words, Madam Speaker: This sinister attempt to  remove this lawful President will not go unnoticed.
