 Mr. President. I rise today to honor the  career of Doug Bibby, president of the National Multifamily Housing  Council--NMHC--on the occasion of his retirement. For the past 30  years, Mr. Bibby has been a positive force in the housing sector,  working to support families' pursuit of safe and affordable housing  across this country.   More than two decades ago, Mr. Bibby became the president of the  National Multifamily Housing Council, one of the Nation's leading  associations representing the multifamily housing sector. Throughout  his tenure, Mr. Bibby has led with empathy, clarity, and dedication.  Early in his presidency, he outlined goals for the council and the  apartment industry at-large, highlighting the benefits of this housing  option for families. With that in mind, Mr. Bibby made housing  affordability and safety a top priority through legislation,  partnerships, and programming. His leadership was essential during the  pandemic as he helped advocate for passage of bipartisan legislation  that led to over $50 billion in rental assistance going to households  in need amidst the crisis.   At the helm of the council, Mr. Bibby formed their diversity, equity,  and inclusion commitment strategy, recognizing its significance to the  future of the multifamily industry. He took on the role of mentoring  the next generation of leaders as a top priority. In addition, Mr.  Bibby was committed to introducing a pipeline for new talent to enter  the industry, which led to the formation of NMHC's Emerging Leaders  Program.   Mr. Bibby left a productive, positive and enduring mark on the  apartment industry, a sector that provides homes for almost 37 million  Americans and contributes $3.4 trillion to the economy annually. His  legacy will be felt for generations to come. Having delayed his well- deserved retirement more than once, I commend him for his many years of  dedication and wish him the best in this next chapter of his life. I  congratulate him and wish him a well-earned, enjoyable and fulfilling  retirement.                            ____________________
