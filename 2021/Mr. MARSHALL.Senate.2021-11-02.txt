 Madam President, I wish to honor two brave  citizens of Junction City, KS, Braden and Jayden Harper. These young  gentlemen put themselves in the face of danger to save two toddlers  from a near fatal accident.   In September, Braden and Jayden were helping their aunt wash her car,  when they heard screaming coming from a nearby house. They thought at  first it was just other children playing on a trampoline, but soon the  screaming sounded more like people in peril. The two boys peered over  the fence of a nearby house to find the source of the noise and saw  twin toddlers not even 2 years old about to drown in a swimming pool.   The second they saw the situation, Braden and Jayden hopped over the  fence and made a beeline for the pool to rescue the two toddlers. Both  the twins were unharmed in the incident, thanks to the Harpers.   Because of their efforts, the Harper brothers not only were  acknowledged as heroes in school, but also by the Junction City Police  Department. Now, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing Braden  and Jayden for their heroics.   These two young men have truly shown what being a good neighbor and  good citizen means. They have made their families and the great State  of Kansas proud.                            ____________________     Madam President, today I wish to congratulate  Julia Misemer, of Blue Valley West High School in Overland Park, KS, on  her fourth consecutive State champion title in golf. She is the only  golfer to achieve 4-time 6A State champion in Kansas history.   The Blue Valley West senior recorded back to back 73s in the 2-day  Class 6A State tournament held at Emporia Municipal Golf Course. Her  excellence also helped the Jaguars take home the team State  championship. Julia is now a four-time Eastern Kansas League Champion,  four-time 6A regional Champion, and four-time 6A State Champion--making  her the most decorated golfer in Kansas high school history.   This year alone, Julia has also finished second in the Justin Thomas  Junior Championship, second in the Girls Junior PGA Championship, and  first in the UHY Kansas City Junior Tournament. She is currently ranked  23rd nationally by the American Junior Golf Association. Julia was also  a member of the Junior Ryder Cup Team which participated in an  exhibition match at this year's Ryder Cup at Whistling Straits in  Kohler, WI. This incredible career of talent and consistency on the  golf course has been rewarded by an offer to play at the University of  Arizona, which she accepted.   I take pride in distinguishing Julia Misemer as an exceptional  competitor in the world of Kansas high school sports and national  junior golf. I look forward to seeing Julia continue her athletic  excellence at the collegiate level and beyond.   I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing Julia's achievement and  wish  [[Page S7597]]  her the best of luck as she begins playing at the next level.                            ____________________
