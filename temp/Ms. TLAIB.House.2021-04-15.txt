 Mr. Speaker, did you know that over 40 percent of mothers  are sole or primary breadwinners for their families? It has been over  50 years since the Equal Pay Act was signed into law, yet the problems  that preceded that legislation remain today. So it is time for the  Paycheck Fairness Act.   Mr. Speaker, across the country, women are paid 80 cents to the  dollar that men are paid, and the number is significantly lower for  women of color. Black women make roughly 60 percent to the dollar.  Native-American women make about 57 cents. And Latina women make just  over 50 to the dollar.   The discriminatory wage gap is costing women thousands of dollars a  year for doing the exact same work as their male counterparts. And I  see this right here in my community and my district where women are  forced to work longer hours, harder, just to make ends meet and put  food on the table for their families.   My community is one of the poorest in the Nation, and the wage gap is  one of the biggest factors for families who are really trying to get  out of the cycle of poverty and get the support for their children so  they can thrive.   I am grateful to my colleagues on the Committee on Education and  Labor for bringing this long overdue legislation.
