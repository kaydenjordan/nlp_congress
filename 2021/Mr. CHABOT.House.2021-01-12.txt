 Mr. Speaker, what happened last Wednesday at the Capitol  never should have happened. The actions of those who attempted to  breach the Capitol Building, and then ultimately did, are inexcusable.  Lawlessness and violence are never acceptable, whichever side of the  political divide one may fall. Those who broke the law should be and  will be identified and prosecuted.   In the aftermath of last week's tragic events, most Americans  continue to be saddened, angry, and wanting answers, and they are  looking to us to provide a positive example of how to bring our Nation  back together. Unfortunately, if what we are doing this evening is any  indication, Congress might not be up to the task.   The Democrats' attempt to invoke the 25th Amendment and to once again  impeach President Trump a week before he will be leaving office anyway  are, in my opinion, misguided. The push to encourage the Vice President  to invoke the 25th Amendment is especially ill advised.   The Constitution is clear that the role for Congress to play under  the 25th Amendment is to decide if the powers provided thereunder have  been properly invoked in the event of a dispute between the President  and Vice President or the majority of the Cabinet. In other words, we  are to serve as judges under the 25th Amendment, not instigators.   By encouraging the Vice President to take action, supporters of this  resolution are abandoning our constitutional role, which could have a  significant legal consequence down the road. And even more importantly,  rather than help to heal a divided nation, the Democrats' effort will  likely drive us even further apart.   Instead, Mr. Speaker, we should be turning our attention toward  uniting the American people. It is time for us to tone down the  political rhetoric, to work together, to solve the problems that face  our Nation. It is time for us to put aside our differences and find  common ground. After all, we are all Americans.
