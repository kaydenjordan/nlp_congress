 Mr. President, I have a motion at the desk.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the motion.   The bill clerk read as follows:  [[Page S7657]]             The Senator from Maryland [Mr. CARDIN] moves to commit the       bill H.R. 1 to the Committee on Finance of the Senate with       instructions to report the same back to the Senate in 3 days,       not counting any day on which the Senate is not in session,       with changes that--        (1) are within the jurisdiction of such committee; and        (2) in order to fix and enhance our country's       infrastructure, help create jobs, and responsibly use one-      time revenue for one-time spending, designate the revenue       raised by the deemed repatriation provisions of the bill for       infrastructure improvements.    The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.    Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this  motion.   This motion will send H.R. 1 back to the Committee on Finance with  instructions to return it within 3 days to deal with one of the  principal purposes of this act, and that is to create jobs. I am  pleased that I am joined in this effort by Senators Feinstein,  Blumenthal, Udall, Casey, Stabenow, Klobuchar, and Harris.   As I explained yesterday--but I want to just go over this, if I  could--this particular motion is based upon a bipartisan recommendation  in the last Congress that came out of the Senate Finance Committee. We  had working groups that took a look at the different aspects of our Tax  Code in areas that we need to reform, and there was general agreement  that we need to deal with the fact that American companies have earned  earnings overseas, and they have parked those funds overseas and have  not brought them back to the United States because of the differential  tax rates between our corporate taxes and the tax rates overseas. The  American companies were not willing to pay the taxes. So, therefore,  they leave the money overseas. To bring that money back is called  repatriation. So the money comes back to the United States. We have  done this before, and we imposed a lower tax rate in order to get the  money back here in the United States.   The challenge with that proposal is a couple things. But, first, it  is not a permanent revenue flow. It is a one-time-only revenue flow. We  had the numbers on the House-passed bill, which would bring in  somewhere around $300 billion of one-time-only revenue.   The problem is that H.R. 1 includes provisions that use those  revenues that bring that in as repatriation but uses the money on a  permanent basis to give permanent tax relief to businesses and that  puts us deeper in a hole as it relates to the deficit of this country.   This bill already is too expensive. We know that. I think my  Republican colleagues know that. The American public knows that--that  it will add to the deficit. We now have not only the scores that we  traditionally use from the Joint Committee on Taxation as to how much  it would cost, and we know it is somewhere in excess of $1.5 trillion-- closer to $2 trillion if you extend all the sunsets that are in the  bill--but, even now, we have the so-called dynamic score that takes  into consideration predicted economic changes that try to make it more  favorable, and that is in excess of $1 trillion. That is unacceptable.  It should be unacceptable to every Member of this body.   This amendment will help us in doing that, in that it will take at  least the $300 billion, which is one-time-only revenue, and not allow  it to be used in the budget itself. Instead, we wall that off and use  it for infrastructure.   I serve on the Environment and Public Works Committee, in addition to  the Senate Finance Committee. I can tell you that the unmet  transportation needs, water infrastructure needs, and energy  infrastructure needs in this country are well documented. We know we  need to modernize our transit systems, our roads, our bridges, our  water infrastructure, and our energy infrastructure. We need to  modernize them, particularly if we are going to be competitive. This  motion will set up the right priority for modernizing America's  infrastructure.   What does that mean with regard to jobs? Speaker Ryan used the number  of a little less than 1 million jobs that are created spending $1.5  trillion. That is about $1.5 million per job. That is not very good by  anyone's standards. We have projections that $300 billion--far less  than $1.5 trillion--will create 4 million great jobs here in America.   Here is a chance to really create jobs but at the same time produce a  much more up-to-date, modern transportation system for this country. I  have the honor of representing Maryland in the Senate. I can tell you  that we need significant resources to update our transit system. The  WMATA system is old and needs improvements, and needs further  investments. We are in the second worst congested area here in  Washington. We need investments in roads. Our bridges are in serious  trouble. We have a major water main break every day in this country-- every day. We need billions of dollars to fix our water infrastructure.   Here is an opportunity for us to speak to two major priorities. One  is fiscal responsibility. Let's do this in the right way, not spend  one-time-only money. Two, we can take care of the international tax  problems of American companies that have money overseas. Third, we can  repair our infrastructure without raising the debt.   I urge my colleagues to support this motion so that we can really  create jobs and not add to the deficit and to help the people of this  country.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.    Mr. President, I understand we now have a new bill. I am  looking at Senator Wyden hold up that new bill. I got a sheet that  looked as if it came from K Street that gave us a list of changes that  will be included in the managers' package. I looked at the list, and  somewhere around 50 or 60 new provisions were on that list. Many of  those were not bills that had been filed, so we had no idea what was  going to be included in it.   None of those issues--in fact, nothing in this bill has been subject  to an open hearing in the Finance Committee. Now we are going to be  asked, I understand, maybe later tonight to vote on those changes.  Quite frankly, I don't know what those changes are, and I am not going  to have an opportunity to go over those with my constituents. That is  wrong. That is not the process we use to change the Tax Code of this  country, a major tax reform bill. That is an outrageous process, to say  that we are going to vote on a new bill without an opportunity to  understand it, without any hearings, without an opportunity for  constituents to give their views on it, and I must state that I find  that very offensive.   I want to talk about one provision in particular, and I hope we will  have a chance to do something about it during the amendment process. As  I understand it, the revised provisions in regard to State and local  tax deduction still restrict what taxpayers can deduct on their Federal  tax returns in regard to State and local taxes that they pay. I admit,  this could have been modified, but what I understand is that the  modification is that taxpayers will be able to deduct up to $10,000 of  property taxes but will not be able to deduct any of their State taxes,  whether they are income taxes or sales taxes, in regard to the Federal  taxes.   In my State, we have county income taxes that will not be deductible,  if I understand correctly, under the proposal we will be voting on. If  that is, in fact, correct, that is absolutely wrong, and I want to tell  you why. Many of us spent years in the State legislature. Our  distinguished Presiding Officer was Governor of his State. We respect  State and local governments. It is the same taxpayers that pay the  taxes to the counties, to the State, and to the Federal Government.    We believe in federalism. Our Nation was founded on federalism. I was  proud of my record as speaker of the Maryland House of Delegates and of  working on a federalism task force set up by President Reagan to look  at the proper way to respect the rights of the States and local  governments. Now we are saying we are not going to respect their  ability to finance their operations. I say that because we are going to  tax the tax. We are not going to respect that the same taxpayer is  paying the State of Maryland's taxes or the State of Tennessee's taxes.  That is wrong. That is an affront, I believe, to the Constitution of  this country, but it has an impact.   It is going to be much, much more difficult for our States to be able  to raise the revenues they need to support our schools and for public  safety and health. All those services are going to be much more  difficult for our States to be able to finance because of this change  that is included in the Senate bill. It is going to be more difficult  for local governments. The cap on property taxes is real and will  affect local government's ability to raise property taxes. But in  Maryland and other  [[Page S7680]]  States, our local governments have other sources, including income  taxes, that no longer are going to be deductible.   That is going to affect my State's ability to adequately fund public  services. Whether it is education, whether it is transportation,  whether it is healthcare, all of that is going to be negatively  impacted and it is wrong.   I will give you a number, because I know the number in Maryland.  Almost 50 percent of Maryland taxpayers deduct State and local taxes as  an itemized deduction. They are going to be disadvantaged by the  provision that is included in the Senate bill, and it is wrong. It also  has unintended consequences, but it is going to have other  consequences.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.    Mr. President, later I will come back and speak on some  of these other issues, but I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.    If my colleague will yield----    If my colleague will yield----    In going over the history as to how the income tax came  about, it really was part of Federalism. They needed the consent of the  States to change the Constitution. It was a partnership with our  States, and that is why, from its inception, there has been respect for  State and local taxation as a deduction from the Federal income tax.   This is not a special interest; this is how we finance government. We  finance government at the Federal level, the State level, and the local  level. If this bill becomes law, we are violating it.   Mr. President, I will ask my colleague from Oregon to let me have a  minute more for two or three more points on this that I think are  important; that is, there are effects that are going to take place as a  result of the limitation of State and local taxes. We are going to see  effects on property values. The Realtors and real estate industries  have made that clear. It is going to affect the tax base of local  government.   This bill is going to affect charitable giving. Why do I say that  charitable giving is part of this? Because I was talking to the mayor  of Baltimore, Catherine Pugh, earlier today. She has serious problems  with law enforcement in Baltimore. She is depending upon private groups  and their generosity to help deal with the problems of Baltimore. It is  going to be much more difficult for private groups to be able to get  charitable contributions if this bill becomes law. So there will be  impact on this that will affect our State and local governments, in  addition to the elimination of the State and local tax deduction.   Here is one last point, if I might make it, in regard to middle- income taxpayers. I respect greatly my colleagues on the other side of  the aisle and the charge that they show, but these charges don't  include the effect of the increase of the estate tax because that has  not been made part of the calculations. It does not take into  consideration 13 million people who no longer are going to have health  insurance. That has not been taken into consideration in the charge  they are showing.   It doesn't take into consideration, in the charge, that the  corporation profits they are going to make as a result of these tax  cuts are going to most likely go to stock buyouts, rather than helping  the workers. That is not reflected.   So when you take a look at all of it--and we do have some analysis  that has been done that is objective--middle-income taxpayers are at a  disadvantage under this tax bill.   I thank my friend from Oregon for yielding me that time.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.
