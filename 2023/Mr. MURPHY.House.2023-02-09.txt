 Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart.   Today, we honor six North Carolinians who died in a plane crash off  the coast of Carteret County on the 13th of February 2022. Four days  from now will be the 1-year anniversary of this horrific tragedy.   Last March, we held a moment of silence in their remembrance. No  words can describe the pain and devastation that our community has  felt. Yet, I continue to be moved by the outpouring of love and support  from individuals not only across North Carolina but this great Nation.   Today, I am introducing legislation with the entire backing of the  North Carolina delegation to designate six creeks in Carteret County  after six of the individuals who lost their lives.   My bill, the Down East Remembrance Act, gives exact latitudes and  longitudes as to the creeks' locations. They will be named after Noah  Styron, Hunter Parks, Kole McInnis, Stephanie Fulcher, Jacob Taylor,  and Daily Shepard.   Upon adoption, these names will become part of the fabric of eastern  North Carolina.   May God bless them and their families and give them peace.                            ____________________
