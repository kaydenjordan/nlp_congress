 Madam Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules,  I call up House Resolution 274 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 274         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House the joint resolution (S.J.       Res. 7) to direct the removal of United States Armed Forces       from hostilities in the Republic of Yemen that have not been       authorized by Congress. All points of order against       consideration of the joint resolution are waived. The joint       resolution shall be considered as read. All points of order       against provisions in the joint resolution are waived. The       previous question shall be considered as ordered on the joint       resolution and on any amendment thereto to final passage       without intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate       equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking       minority member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs; and (2)       one motion to commit.        Sec. 2.  Upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in       order without intervention of any point of order to consider       in the House the resolution (H. Res. 271) Condemning the       Trump Administration's Legal Campaign to Take Away Americans'       Health Care. The resolution shall be considered as read. The       previous question shall be considered as ordered on the       resolution and preamble to adoption without intervening       motion or demand for division of the question except one hour       of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and       ranking minority member of the Committee on Energy and       Commerce.        Sec. 3.  It shall be in order at any time on the       legislative day of April 4, 2019, for the Speaker to       entertain motions that the House suspend the rules as though       under clause 1 of rule XV. The Speaker or her designee shall       consult with the Minority Leader or his designee on the       designation of any matter for consideration pursuant to this       section.     Madam Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Burgess),  pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  be given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Madam Speaker, on Monday, the Rules Committee met and  reported a rule, House Resolution 274. It provides for the  consideration under closed rules for S.J. Res. 7, with 1 hour of debate  equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member  of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and for the consideration of H.  Res. 271, with 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the  chair and ranking minority member of Committee on Energy and Commerce.  It also provides suspension authority for Thursday, April 4.   Madam Speaker, before I begin, I want to recognize that today marks  the 230th anniversary of the Rules Committee being formally constituted  for the first time.   Now, the Ways and Means Committee--which my Massachusetts friend and  colleague, Richie Neal, chairs--likes to point out that they are the  oldest standing committee in the House. While that is true, I would  like to remind my friends that the Rules Committee is the oldest  committee in the House, being first created on this day in 1789 as a  select committee. So it is especially appropriate that we are on the  floor today to do some important work before us.   For the record, Madam Speaker, the Ways and Means Committee can  celebrate their 230th anniversary on July 24.   Now that I have cleared that up, the first measure included in this  rule is S.J. Res. 7, and we are taking action on this because Yemen is  in crisis. In a country of roughly 28 million people, an estimated 22  million of them are in need of humanitarian assistance.   That is 75 percent of the population facing famine, disease, and  displacement. Half the country is at risk of starvation.   The famine and disease facing children is particularly sobering. Save  the Children estimates that as many as 85,000 children under the age of  5 have died because of hunger and disease since 2015.   All told, this is one of the world's worst humanitarian crises, the  site of the fastest growing cholera epidemic ever recorded and the  biggest food emergency on the planet.   Yet, it wasn't caused by some natural disaster. It is entirely man- made, the result of a Saudi-led military conflict. Seemingly every day,  bombs fall on weddings, hospitals, buses, and homes, as civilian  neighborhoods are regularly targeted.   This is not some abstract war happening half a world away. In fact,  the United States is intimately involved in this conflict. We have  supported the Saudi reign of terror by providing logistics,  intelligence, ground support, and midair fueling of bombers. Virtually  all the bombs that fall on Yemen say ``Made in the United States of  America.''   Make no mistake, Madam Speaker, the United States is involved in a  war in Yemen today. But if our constituents look through the  Congressional Record, they wouldn't find a vote authorizing it. That is  because this body abdicated its responsibility to declare war when it  began 4 years ago.                                time  1230    Now, we took one of our most sacred responsibilities and handed it to  the executive branch. It is not the first time we have done it, but it  is becoming a habit around here. We first let the Bush administration  decide the contours of our involvement abroad, and that continues  through the Trump administration today.   If that wasn't outrageous enough, past Republican Congresses used  every legislative trick in the book to block Members from even debating  our role there. On two separate occasions, they went so far as to strip  War Powers Resolutions related to Yemen of their privilege. It was  unprecedented.   But when it comes to Saudi Arabia, this administration and my  Republican friends were all too content to look the other way when they  murdered a Washington Post journalist. They lured him into a consulate  in Turkey, they murdered him, and then they used a bone saw to  dismember him. We know, based on our intelligence reports, that the  highest level of the Saudi Government was involved in that terrible  human rights atrocity, and the Trump administration did nothing. They  rationalized it. They justified it. They basically turned a blind eye.   When it comes to human rights, this administration has abdicated its  moral authority. That should be of concern to everybody in this  Chamber, whether you are Democrat or Republican, because if the United  States stands for anything, we need to stand out loud and foursquare  for human rights. If the President of the United States and his  administration don't want to do it, then we should.   No Congress should be complicit in abdicating our Article I  constitutional responsibility. Thankfully, this Democratic Congress is  doing the opposite. We are reasserting our power, and we are taking a  stand when it comes to human rights.   Thanks especially to the dedication of Speaker Pelosi, Chairman  Engel, Congressman Ro Khanna, Congresswoman Jayapal, Congressman Pocan,  and the entire Congressional Progressive Caucus, we are considering a  bipartisan measure that makes clear it is time for the United States'  involvement in Yemen to end. No more excuses.   This is virtually identical to the resolution we passed in February.  The difference this time is that this is the first opportunity that  this House has had to send something on the war in Yemen right to the  President's desk.   So I urge all of my colleagues: seize this opportunity. We have a  constitutional responsibility and we have a moral obligation to get  this done.  [[Page H2949]]  Don't let any legislative maneuvers deter us from ending our Nation's  complicity in this humanitarian catastrophe. Let's pass this resolution  free of changes that would prevent it from going right to the  President.   Let me make that more clear: if we change a single word, we will  derail this resolution.   Now, the second measure included in this rule is H. Res. 271, in  response to a war of a different kind: the Republican war on  healthcare. The Trump Justice Department recently moved in Federal  Court not only to strike down preexisting condition coverage under the  Affordable Care Act, but to overturn this law completely.   If the President succeeds in Texas v. U.S., the protections for  preexisting conditions will be gone. The Medicaid expansion will be  nullified. Insurance premiums will skyrocket. I could go on and on and  on and on.   Striking down the Affordable Care Act would be a tragedy felt by  every single American. We would return to the days when our health  insurance marketplace was like the Wild West, when insurers were free  to decline or limit coverage because someone had acne, or received an  organ transplant, or even because they were a victim of domestic  violence. That is how messed up our system was, and that is the system  that this President and many of my colleagues want to return to.   Now, for the life of me, I cannot understand what President Trump and  his allies in Congress have against Americans getting healthcare. For  nearly a decade now, they have worked endlessly to sabotage the  Affordable Care Act through Congress, the courts, and administrative  actions. Apparently, they are not happy that 20 million people have  gained healthcare coverage because of this law, or that 130 million  Americans with preexisting conditions can get care. We should be  celebrating these advancements. But, instead, some on the other side  won't be satisfied until the Affordable Care Act is repealed  completely.   Now, this Democratic majority has taken a different course. On the  very first day of this Congress, we brought the full weight of the  House of Representatives to bear in this lawsuit. As a result, the  House Counsel has already intervened in this case to protect the  healthcare Americans depend on.   Now, this resolution is our chance to speak with one voice against  the administration's attempts to abolish the ACA. I have seen my  friends on the other side issue sternly worded press releases and  strongly worded letters to the administration. But now it is time to  back up words with votes, and then I hope they will work with us moving  forward as this majority takes action to reverse the administration's  healthcare sabotage and strengthen healthcare for every single  American.   Madam Speaker, I believe that healthcare ought to be a fundamental  right for every single person in this country. It is unconscionable to  me that rather than working with us to strengthen the Affordable Care  Act and rather than working with us to expand healthcare protections,  my Republican friends have chosen instead to wipe it out. I don't know  how anybody could think like that. I don't know what motivates the  President of the United States and some on the other side of the aisle  to move in that direction.   Now we are told by the President that even though he doesn't have a  plan to replace this, if he succeeds in nulling and voiding the  Affordable Care Act, he said: Well, we will provide you one in the year  2021.   So, Madam Speaker, the man who has spent all of his time trying to  rip protections away from people with preexisting conditions, the  person who wants to not allow you to keep your kids on their insurance  until they are 26, the leader of our country who doesn't believe in  capping insurance when it comes to people with lifetime illnesses, the  person who doesn't want to lower the cost of prescription drugs--I  could go on and on and on and on--says: I want to repeal it, I want it  gone, I want the courts to null and void it; and then just trust me,  and then we will come up with some magical plan, some secret plan,  after the election.    I don't think the American people are going to fall for that kind of  nonsense, and they shouldn't because healthcare is not a Democratic  issue or a Republican issue. It is a moral issue. It is not even an  issue, it is a value that all of us should share.   So I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support us in  sending a message loud and clear to the administration that we have had  enough of their attempts to sabotage the healthcare bill, we have had  enough of their trying to take health insurance away from the American  people, and that we are going to stand here and make it very clear that  we do believe that everybody is entitled to good healthcare in this  country.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I have to give the Republicans credit for one thing.  They are consistent on the issue of healthcare, in trying to avoid  talking about the issue at hand.   We are not talking about universal healthcare, although I support  universal healthcare. We are not talking about Medicare for All,  although I personally support Medicare for All. We are not talking  about the Canadian system or the German system or any other system.   We are talking about preventing this President and his Republican  allies from null and voiding the Affordable Care Act, thereby taking  away healthcare protections for every single American. We are talking  about preventing the President from throwing  [[Page H2951]]  tens of millions of people off health insurance. We are talking about  protecting the over 100 million people in this country who have  preexisting conditions. That is what we are talking about.   I loved it when the gentleman from Texas said that the first vote  that the Republicans asked for in this Congress was a procedural motion  to protect people with preexisting conditions. Does the gentleman not  know that people with preexisting conditions already have protections  under the Affordable Care Act?    I mean, it sounds to me--and it seemed to me at the time--that that  Republican procedural vote was about covering your rear and not about  serious legislating, about trying to get the American people to believe  that we really do care about healthcare and we really do care about  protecting people with preexisting conditions, even though we all know  here that that is just not the case.   When I hear the gentleman say that the Republicans care deeply about  people's healthcare and want to make sure that everybody gets coverage,  it is just not true. The reason I say that so emphatically is because I  have been around here for the last few years, and I have watched the  dozens of votes that the Republicans have brought up, one after another  after another after another after another, to repeal healthcare  protections for people in this country without proposing an  alternative.   Now, the President is saying: Trust us.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a Politico article that just  appeared that is entitled ``Trump punts health care until after 2020.''                       [From POLITICO, April 1, 2019]                  Trump Punts Health Care Until After 2020                    (By Quint Forgey and John Bresnahan)   just last week the president had seemed to go all in on a new effort to                             wipe out obamacare         President Donald Trump signaled Monday that congressional       Republicans would wait until after the 2020 elections to vote       on a GOP replacement for Obamacare--putting off a presumably       savage legislative battle on a hot-button campaign issue       until after his re-election bid.        ``Everybody agrees that ObamaCare doesn't work. Premiums &       deductibles are far too high--Really bad HealthCare! Even the       Dems want to replace it, but with Medicare for all, which       would cause 180 million Americans to lose their beloved       private health insurance,'' the president tweeted.        ``The Republicans . . . are developing a really great       HealthCare Plan with far lower premiums (cost) & deductibles       than ObamaCare,'' Trump continued. ``In other words it will       be far less expensive & much more usable than ObamaCare. Vote       will be taken right after the Election when Republicans hold       the Senate & win . . . back the House.''        Trump claimed that the as-yet-unseen Republican proposal       ``will be truly great HealthCare that will work for       America,'' writing online that ``Republicans will always       support Pre-Existing Conditions.''        The unexpected string of tweets added drama to a week that       has seen Obamacare return to the fore as a policy issue.        The president's pledge comes days after his Justice       Department endorsed a federal court ruling to eliminate the       Affordable Care Act in its entirety, moving to invalidate the       landmark health care law despite objections within Trump's       orbit from Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and       Attorney General William Barr. The ruling by District Judge       Reed O'Connor had suggested that the Obamacare statute, which       has passed muster with the Supreme Court, was actually wholly       unconstitutional.        The president appeared on Capitol Hill the next day, saying       that the Republican Party ``will soon be known as the party       of health care.''        Trump's call to again put Obamacare repeal on the table for       Hill Republicans was seen as a potential disaster-in-the       making by GOP leaders, who knew their incumbents and       candidates were badly hurt by it last November. And it was an       invitation to Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) to pound home       the issue once more, as she plans to do with a House vote       this week condemning the administration's decision not to       defend Obamacare in court.        Trump's efforts to eradicate Obamacare have also endangered       some of the administration's health initiatives, such as       lowering prices for prescription drugs and combating opioid       abuse and HIV.        In public and private, Republican leaders made clear that       they didn't want anything to do with the president's most       recent maneuver. They begged Trump to back down and made       their displeasure known to other administration officials, as       well.        GOP lawmakers even took the position that if Trump wanted       to lay out his own health care proposal, then they would be       willing to look at it. But Senate Republicans--facing a tough       electoral fight to maintain their majority in 2020--have       refused to sign on to a new administration drive before       seeing the specifics, giving them room to disavow any Trump       proposal if it hinders their own political outlook.        ``I look forward to seeing what the president is proposing       and what he can work out with the speaker,'' Senate Majority       Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said in a brief interview       Thursday, adding: ``I am focusing on stopping the Democrats'       `Medicare for None' scheme.''        McConnell is up for re-election this cycle, as are       vulnerable GOP incumbents including Cory Gardner of Colorado       and Susan Collins of Maine, who said she doesn't want the       Justice Department to push to strike down Obamacare.        The Affordable Care Act has been a thorn in the side of       Republicans since it was enacted in 2010. After the GOP took       back the House in the midterm elections that year, GOP       lawmakers repeatedly passed legislation designed to repeal       Obamacare.        Once Trump was elected president on a promise of different       and better health care options, Republicans seemed on the       path to finally scrapping the law, only to see a 2017       ``skinny repeal'' effort fail unexpectedly in the Senate.       That attempt collapsed when Arizona Sen. John McCain--upset       with the irregular way the legislation was being handled--      stunned his colleagues by voting against it.     The President says: Repeal everything, and then we will  share our secret plan after the election.   Give me a break. The bottom line is that the American people want us  to be on their side, not on the side of big health insurance  corporations, not on the side of big drug companies. They want us to be  on their side.   It wasn't too long ago when people would be provided insurance that  didn't cover anything. It was junk insurance. There are people on the  Republican side and people in this White House who are eager to get  back to those bad old days.   Stop trying to take away people's healthcare. Stop trying to get in  bed with corporate interests that basically are fighting every attempt  to make sure that people have access to good, quality care in this  country.   By the way, if they repealed the Affordable Care Act, that repeals  essential benefits protections, which guarantee that every insurance  company has to provide you coverage when you get sick. That wasn't  always the case.   This is a ridiculous fight that we are having here. I cannot believe,  after the midterm elections, after it was made crystal clear by the  American people to the Republicans that they wanted no part of their  effort to take away healthcare in this country, that here we are doing  it all again.   Now, maybe they didn't intend it this way. The President wasn't on  message and came out for repealing the Affordable Care Act outright,  and now they have to kind of scramble to try to, again, cover their  rears. That is what is happening here.   It is really disillusioning, I think, for people who are observing  these proceedings that we are back again fighting over whether or not  people are entitled to good healthcare, whether people are entitled to  protections under our healthcare laws.   I think this is a ridiculous fight for the Republicans to be waging.  But if they want to fight it, they own it. I think they will see, in  2020, that the American people are having none of it.   Madam Speaker, on the war in Yemen, we cannot wait. The starving  children in Yemen cannot wait on this President or on my Republican  colleagues to do the right thing.   Just to highlight how bad the war is, here are a few statistics. I  noticed the gentleman from Texas barely talked about how horrific the  situation is in Yemen, but let me give you a few statistics.   Madam Speaker, 130 children under 5 die each day from hunger and  disease as a result of this war. The number of cholera cases in Yemen  is 1 million. You heard that right. This is the largest cholera  outbreak in recent history. Finally, 3-year-olds in Yemen have lived  through 18,000 air raids already.   As I mentioned in my opening statement, the bombs that are dropping  on civilian populations say ``Made in the United States of America.''  All of us should be outraged by that, and not only by the Saudi  Government's behavior in Yemen, but the Saudi Government's behavior in  general.   Yet, what is the response by this administration and their Republican  allies? Send Saudi Arabia more weapons.  [[Page H2952]]  Sell them more weapons. Turn a blind eye to what is going on in Yemen.  Let's make believe that the murder of Washington Post journalist Jamal  Khashoggi never happened.   Again, we need to stand firmly on the side of human rights.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Let me just say you have got to love the Republicans. I mean, they  have been in charge of this House for 8 years previously. They were in  charge of the entire government the previous 2 years. They had the  House, the Senate, and the White House. They didn't even need a  supermajority in the United States Senate to be able to get whatever  they wanted through, and they couldn't do it.   So the bottom line is this: You had your chance. The American people  rejected your attempt to take away healthcare from millions of people.  The American people believe people with preexisting conditions ought  not to be discriminated against by insurance companies, and so they are  having none of what you are selling here.   So you can make excuses all you want, but, unfortunately for the  country, you were in charge of the House, the Senate, and the White  House for the previous 2 years.   Madam Speaker, I am happy to yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Khanna), who has been a leader on the issue of Yemen,  and I commend him for his efforts.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I have great respect for the gentleman from Texas, the former chair  of the Ways and Means Committee. But I just want to remind my  colleagues again that my Republican friends have been in charge of this  institution for 8 years. They were in charge for 2 years of the House,  the Senate, and the Presidency, and they showed us what they were  about.   The gentleman says that they are not going to let the courts take  away protections for people with preexisting conditions. Well, my  Republican friends tried to do that on dozens of occasions. They  brought legislation to the floor that would have ripped protections  away from people with preexisting conditions. That is their record. It  is there for anybody to see.   Now they are saying: ``Oh, we are now for protecting people with  preexisting conditions''? Their whole existence in the majority has  been about taking protections away from people. Give me a break. I  mean, people know what is going on here.   I appreciate the resolution that the gentleman wants to offer to say  we all should work together. Look, I am happy to work with my  Republican friends to find ways to improve protections for people.   But I want to remind them, when they were in the majority, they  didn't want anything to do with us because we wanted to protect  people's healthcare. We wanted to protect people with preexisting  conditions. We wanted to make sure that parents could keep their kids  on their insurance until they were 26. We wanted to lower the cost of  prescription drugs. We wanted to put a cap on people with chronic  illnesses so that they wouldn't go bankrupt. We wanted to make sure  that insurance companies had to offer you real protections. We had  essential benefit protections there.   So we are happy to build on that. What we are not happy to do is to  work with them to take these things away, and that is what their  leadership has been all about for 8 years in the House. And then when  they controlled the House, the Senate, and the White House, that is  what they tried to do.   Thankfully, some thoughtful Republicans in the Senate didn't go along  with it, so they didn't get their way. And now they are trying to use  the courts to try to undermine what this body has done.   Madam Speaker, let me inquire of the gentleman from Texas how many  more speakers he has.    Okay. Then I will reserve the balance of my time.    We were expecting one more speaker, but she didn't show  up. If the gentleman is ready to close, I am ready to close.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, I just find it a little bit interesting that for the  last couple of days, my Republican friends have been assailing us for  introducing a sense of Congress resolution, and here we have a sense of  Congress resolution from them.   I guess you can't make this stuff up.   But in any event, look, I will say to my colleagues, you don't need  to defeat the previous question to make clear that you believe that  people with preexisting conditions should be protected, because this  sense of Congress wouldn't do that.   We have a law that does that now, a law that, unfortunately, my  Republican friends have been trying to repeal for years.   So if Members want to protect people with preexisting conditions,  then they ought to support us on our sense of Congress resolution.   So, Madam Speaker, when it comes down to it, both of these  resolutions that we are offering today are about what this Congress is  willing to tolerate, whether we are willing to tolerate our Nation's  involvement in the Saudi-led war in Yemen, despite never having  authorized it in the first place. Do we really want our Nation to be  partners with a regime that murders journalists like Jamal Khashoggi?   President Trump has said of Saudi Arabia: ``They have been a great  ally.'' Well, I disagree.   And I hope that this Congress will now speak with one voice that we  will not look the other way when it comes to the murder of a U.S.  reporter, that we will not look the other way when it comes to the  murder of innocent people in Yemen, bombing school buses, bombing  weddings, bombing funerals.   Enough. We have to say enough. We are no longer okay with the U.S.  and Yemen going on unchecked for another year.   This is about whether this Congress is going to tolerate the  administration trying to rip away millions of people's healthcare as  well. I know I am not--and many of my colleagues aren't either--willing  to tolerate that.   This morning, I joined with many Members of Congress in the House and  Senate, including Leader Pelosi and Senator Schumer. We marched from  the House and the Senate to the Supreme Court to call on this  administration to stop its assault on Americans' healthcare.   Abolishing the Affordable Care Act may be just a talking point to the  President, but this law is literally a matter of life and death for  people. Millions and millions of Americans could lose their insurance  coverage. Premiums and out-of-pocket costs could skyrocket, and  lifesaving healthcare could once again be out of reach.   The President and his allies claim to support protections for  preexisting conditions, they claim that the Republican Party is the  party of healthcare, but their actions say otherwise.   When this House voted on the first day of this Congress to allow us  to intervene in Texas v. U.S., more than 190 Republicans sided with the  President on his brutal assault on Americans' healthcare.   The majority is not going to stand for it.   Enough is enough. Enough with the unauthorized wars abroad, enough  with the assault on people's healthcare.   Madam Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the previous question, this  rule, and the underlying resolutions.    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and  I move the previous question on the resolution.
