 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Hensarling for his  leadership, and especially a thank-you to the gentlewoman from New York  (Ms. Tenney), my friend, for her outstanding leadership on this issue;  and I rise in support of her legislation, the Community Institution  Mortgage Relief Act.   Homeownership is part of the American Dream; however, an ill- conceived rule promulgated by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau  has made it harder for Americans to purchase a home.   In typical one-size-fits-all Washington bureaucrat fashion, the  Bureau's rule places excessive escrow and mortgage servicing  requirements on the backs of smaller community financial institutions  and mortgage servicers.   What the Bureau missed is that these lenders are rarely in subprime  lending and frequently hold the loan in portfolio for the term of the  loan. This means these lenders have a very strong incentive to ensure  that taxes and insurance premiums are being paid because they are  taking on 100 percent of the downside risk if the borrower fails to  hold up their side of the deal, and, therefore, an escrow account isn't  necessary.   However, as a direct result of the rule, there is less consumer  choice and more expense. That is because many community financial  institutions are leaving the market or have been forced to charge home  buyers more so they can afford to hire the extra professional staff  they need to comply with this rule.   For these reasons, I support the Community Institution Mortgage  Relief Act, which exempts community financial institutions with assets  of $25 billion or less from much of the regulatory burden of the  Bureau's rule.   Again, I want to thank my good friend from New York, Congresswoman  Claudia Tenney, and our chairman, Congressman Jeb Hensarling, for their  leadership on this issue, and I urge my colleagues to vote for the  Community Institution Mortgage Relief Act.
