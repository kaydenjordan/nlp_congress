 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5890) to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services  to provide assistance to States in complying with, and implementing,  certain provisions of section 106 of the Child Abuse Prevention and  Treatment Act in order to promote better protections for young children  and family-centered responses, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows                                 H.R. 5890         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Assisting States'       Implementation of Plans of Safe Care Act''.       SEC. 2. ASSISTING STATES WITH IMPLEMENTATION OF PLANS OF SAFE                     CARE.         (a) In General.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services       shall provide written guidance and, if appropriate, technical       assistance to support States in complying with, and       implementing, subsections (b)(2)(B)(iii) and (d)(18) of       section 106 of the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act       (42 U.S.C. 5106a) in order to promote better protections for       young children and family-centered responses.        (b) Requirements.--The guidance and technical assistance       shall--        (1) enhance States' understanding of requirements and       flexibilities under the law, including clarifying key terms;        (2) address State-identified challenges with developing,       implementing, and monitoring plans of safe care;        (3) disseminate best practices related to developing and       implementing plans of safe care, including differential       response, collaboration and coordination, and identification       and delivery of services, while recognizing needs of       different populations and varying community approaches across       States;        (4) support collaboration between health care providers,       social service agencies, public health agencies, and the       child welfare system, to promote a family-centered treatment       approach;        (5) prevent separation and support reunification of       families if in the best interests of the child;        (6) recommend treatment approaches for serving infants,       pregnant women, and postpartum women whose infants may be       affected by substance use that are designed to keep infants       with their mothers and families whenever appropriate,       including recommendations to encourage pregnant women to       receive health and other support services during pregnancy;        (7) support State efforts to develop technology systems to       manage and monitor implementation of plans of safe care; and        (8) help States improve the long-term safety and well-being       of young children and their families.        (c) Construction.--The guidance and technical assistance       shall not be construed to amend the requirements of the Child       Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (42 U.S.C. 5101 et seq.).        (d) Definition.--For purposes of this section, the term       ``State'' has the meaning given such term in section 3 of the       Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (42 U.S.C. 5101       note).     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 5890.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5890, the Assisting  States' Implementation of Plans of Safe Care Act.   In 2016, a staggering 2.1 million Americans experienced an opioid  abuse disorder. To put that in perspective, the number of fatalities  based on opioid abuse in the most recent year approaches the number  60,000. To put that in perspective, it is nearly sixfold the number of  alcohol-related deaths on our highways. It is nearly twofold the number  of automotive deaths on our highways. It is, in fact, greater than the  number of deaths from automobiles plus nonsuicide-related firearms  deaths combined.  [[Page H5126]]    What is more troubling is that this number only takes into account  those who directly suffered from substance abuse. What it does not take  into account are the many people who experienced the secondhand trauma  of a loved one struggling with opioid addiction.   One of the greatest tragedies of the opioid epidemic is that  thousands of children have been swept up by the current of the epidemic  due to the substance abuse of a family member or other adult tasked  with caring for them.   The Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act, CAPTA, recently amended  in 2016 by the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, CARA, requires  States to implement a plan of safe care to protect the health and  safety of young children and promote a family-centered approach to  treatment and service delivery. Unfortunately, the requirements  included by CARA failed to provide States with substantive guidance and  information, which has led to significant confusion and poor  implementation of plans of safe care.   States and localities might benefit from written guidance and  technical assistance provided by the Department of Health and Human  Services as they strive to meet Federal requirements and address the  known challenges in their individual plans. Through an enhanced  understanding of the requirements, States will be able to better  protect the well-being of children and infants when working with  families impacted by the trauma related to opioid abuse.   It is clear the opioid epidemic is already multigenerational in  nature, as children must confront the pain of an addicted parent or  guardian. By strengthening States' responsiveness and plans of safe  care, we can help give these children the protection they need while  strengthening families for long-term success and stability.   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the  gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Foxx), the honorable chairwoman.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close if the gentlewoman  from Oregon would like to conclude her remarks.  [[Page H5127]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Florida, as well as the  chairwoman from North Carolina and my friend and colleague from Oregon  (Ms. Bonamici).   I strongly urge my colleagues of every political stripe to recognize  that, perhaps while responsibility is best exercised when taken and not  given, we contemplate here the outcomes for so many innocents who are  unable to determine their circumstance, that is, indeed, children who  are born into this horrific affliction of opioid addiction, and  understand that, while one might wax poetic about things like personal  responsibility and accountability, the Federal Government does, indeed,  have a role to fill a vacuum where the States have not acted in the  circumstance wherein those who suffer suffer by virtue of circumstances  far, far beyond their control.   I would hope that the Members of this body on both sides would find  themselves compelled by the sheer mathematical magnitude of the  epidemic that is the opioid crisis--again, one that takes more lives  than nonsuicide gun violence and automobile accidents combined, and one  that impacts not just those who exercise choices but those impacted by  circumstances far beyond their control--with this but a humble step,  not a panacea, towards creating a better circumstance wherein all  Americans experience something closer to an equal opportunity to  prosper.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues across both sides of the political  spectrum to vote in favor of H.R. 5890, and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
