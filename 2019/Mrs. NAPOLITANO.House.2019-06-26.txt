 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Petty  Officer Raul Guerra and the work of the Bring Raul Home Committee.   Petty Officer Guerra was born in 1942, grew up in Los Angeles County,  was beloved by his friends and family, and known for his love of  journalism.   Petty Officer Guerra enlisted in the Navy Reserves in 1965 and was  deployed to Vietnam as a Navy journalist. On the evening of October 8,  1967, Petty Officer Guerra volunteered for a combat mission to support  a major airstrike over North Vietnam. His plane was tragically shot  down and crashed. Due to heavy terrain and hostile territory, he was  pronounced killed in action. His remains were not recovered.   A local paper, the Whittier Daily News, in 2007 reported that a local  Navy seaman's remains had been found, which was part of a long process  to return Petty Officer Guerra's remains home.   His former classmates, Ruben Valencia, and Donna and Gary Petersen  formed the Bring Raul Home Committee. They worked over 12 years to  diligently spread his story, search for living family members, and held  many meetings with the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency.   The DPAA, in February 2019, notified the committee of the closure of  Petty Officer Guerra's case, that he would finally return home, whereby  he received full honors at LAX, Los Angeles International Airport,  escorted by numerous, caring people.   Petty Officer Raul Guerra was finally laid to rest after 52 years on  April 25, 2019.   I extend my deepest sympathies to the family and friends of fallen  Petty Officer Raul Guerra and recognize the dedication and years of  work shown by the Bring Raul Home Committee.                            ____________________     Mr. Chair, I was absent during rollcall vote No. 418  due to a meeting I was having as Chairwoman of the Water Resources and  Environment Subcommittee with the Assistant Secretary of the Army for  Civil Works R.D.
