 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Florida for  taking the initiative to claim this time on the floor of the House of  Representatives and bring up this topic.   I point out, Mr. Speaker, to the people who are paying attention here  at least, whether or not that is you, that this is the most complex  issue that the United States of America faces and has ever faced.   We might face a tax issue or a national defense issue, and we might  face a healthcare issue. They are very complex and very detailed. But  almost everything else, you can make your mistakes, fix them, and move  on, but it doesn't multiply itself throughout the multiple generations  that we have.   Immigration is very complex. At the heart of it is something that I  heard the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Yoho) reference, and that is the  word ``1986.''   I revere Ronald Reagan, and I always have, except for the two times  in all of history that he let me down. 1986 was the time he did that,  when he granted amnesty to what turned out to be more than 3 million  illegal aliens in this country.   It wasn't the number of illegal aliens who were granted a reward for  breaking our laws. Instead, it was the destruction of the rule of law.  Once you reward people for breaking the law, you get more lawbreakers.  More lawbreakers destroy the law.   In the center of everything that I have done on immigration here in  this Congress in 16\1/2\ years has been about the restoration of the  respect for the rule of law, in particular with regard to immigration.  Yet I see on the other side of the aisle a constant push to erode and  degrade the respect for the rule of law and the rule of law itself.   We are dealing with sanctuary cities, sanctuary counties, sanctuary  States, and sanctuary jurisdictions. In the last Congress, we passed  sanctuary legislation that went over to Senator McConnell's desk that  would have shut it all off and given a victim standing to go to court  to sue the political subdivision for compensation for the damage caused  by turning people loose on the streets who should have been  interdicted, put back in the condition they were in before they broke  the law.   I am a little bit extra emotional about this tonight, Mr. Speaker,  because I get the news from Des Moines, Iowa. I am going to be delicate  about how I say this because I don't want to prejudice an impending  prosecution.   We have a triple murder that took place in Des Moines, Iowa, that  peaceful city, a triple murder. The individual who was arrested for  that triple homicide went into the custody of the Des Moines police for  maybe a few hours. Shortly, his name came off the roster for being in  their custody.   When you check, he is in ICE's custody. It has now been announced  that the individual who is a suspect for a triple homicide in the  peaceful city of Des Moines, Iowa, is an illegal alien, a criminal  alien.   He also had been interdicted for a hit-and-run just a couple of  months ago, turned loose on the streets of Iowa, now potentially  becoming guilty of killing three individuals, a mother, an 11-year-old  daughter, and a 5-year-old son.                                time  2000    ``Illegal alien,'' well, we are not supposed to say that because it  hurts their feelings.   And one of our Members of this Congress has introduced legislation-- now, by the way, it is Joaquin Castro, whose brother is running for  President of the United States. He has introduced legislation to  eliminate the use of the term ``illegal alien'' in Federal statute  because it hurts people's feelings.   Hurts people's feelings, when we have people going to their graves at  their hands. I think their feelings are hurt a lot worse. And our  compassion needs to be for those who have been killed and those who  have been injured and those who have been abused in many ways. But to  just change the terminology of the reality is just a political  statement.   And I would add, on top of that, the policies that have been  advocated on the other side of the aisle are the policies that  culminate in open borders.   Open borders mean, picking a particular number that came out of DHS,  in April, 4,117 illegal aliens interdicted in a single day.   So I got out my little calculator, and I divided 4,117 into 710,000,  which is the average size of a congressional seat. That meant that  every 24 weeks another congressional district, an entire congressional  district in Iowa, is supplanted by illegal aliens coming into America.  And that number could well be as many as 50, 60, or 70 seats over the  period of a Census time.   So I point this down, in conclusion here, and compress it so that  even those folks who are the least likely to understand this will  understand what I am about to describe.   If you were to clear out a county in the desert of Nevada so that  there wasn't a single person living there, and then as we interdict  these folks on the border at the rate of 4,117 in a single day, and  over 24 weeks you accumulate the equivalent of an entire congressional  district, you put them into that county, the Census shows up and counts  them--710,000. 710,000 of them then become an entire congressional  district. That entire congressional district couldn't elect a single  person because there wouldn't be a single citizen there in 24 weeks.   So that means anybody can move there and vote for themselves, come to  Congress, and represent 710,000 illegals--that is how bad it is--in  only 24 weeks.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Florida.
