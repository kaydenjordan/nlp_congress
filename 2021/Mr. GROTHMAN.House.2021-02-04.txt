 Madam Speaker, our wonderful country, America, has been  given material wealth beyond belief, plus natural beauty that I think  is greater than anything around the world.   In 1973, how did this country respond to those gifts? The United  States Supreme Court, in Roe v. Wade, legalized abortion, something  that even in days before the ultrasound, almost was universally  condemned around the world. Since that time, 62 million unborn babies  have had their lives cut short in America.   The United States is one of only seven countries in the world where  late-term abortions are legal, joining countries like China, North  Korea, Vietnam, and then Singapore, Canada, and Holland.   Now, we, under the current administration, look to push for still  more  [[Page H338]]  abortions by talking about removing the Hyde amendment allowing for  taxpayer funding and, even worse, repealing the new Mexico City policy  in which the United States gives money to organizations abroad who will  wind up performing abortions. That is what the United States will  become known for around the world.   How is this to respond to the natural wealth and beauty we have been  given.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, before we deal with the purpose of this  speech, I would like to make some observations about changes that have  been made in the last few weeks and other rapidly changing aspects of  American life.   One of the few positive observations I have made since I was a  Congressman is the freedom people have normally had to see their  Congressmen. Eccentric people can stand at the base of the Capitol  steps a few yards away and hand out their pamphlets, nice and free.  Easy to meet their Congressmen, for those of us who like to walk  outside and not use the tunnel.   Now, a chain-link fence stands around the Capitol with razor wire on  top. Let's be honest. After about midnight on January 7, I think most  of us felt pretty safe.   Now, we are almost a month later, and we still have National Guard  folks in full combat, ready to protect us. We have the wire on top of  the walls, as well as Constitution and Independence Avenues shut down.   I feel like I am in East Germany in the 1970s. I am not sure exactly  what East Germany was like, but that is how I kind of visualize it,  around maybe their parliament or whatever, fencing, police, always  afraid of the people.   It is a fitting background for our brave new world order in which our  high-tech oligarchs are censoring ideas. Perhaps that is this  background to the new censor regime. It seems almost appropriate.   Our high-tech oligarchs are censoring ideas which are unpopular with  the wealthy and powerful in our country. Eventually, we will need some  antitrust enforcement or legislation to open up Twitter and allow  American citizens to hear all points of view, including points of view  that the great and powerful of our country do not want to have heard.   I would like to thank the German, Mexican, and French Governments for  their support as Americans try to regain their roots as a country with  a free flow of ideas.   In the meantime, my plea to the Speaker and majority leader is please  tear down the walls around this Capitol and begin to undo the damage  done to our freedoms.   Now, back to the purpose of the speech.   One more time last week, I returned to our southern border, and  already, we are seeing the results of, I think, reckless comments made  by our Chief Executive.   We are getting to the point where we have had 300 unaccompanied  minors a day crossing our southwest border. That is because we have had  a President who has made comments that indicate that the United States  is not sincere in protecting our southern border.                                time  2130    It does result in more money and more presence for drug cartels at  the Southern border. So people understand, people do not just walk  across the border. Mexicans are charged $3,000 a person; Central  Americans, $5,000 a person; Brazilians, $9,000 a person; and Asians,  $20,000 a person to cross the border.   And when statements are made indicating that we will no longer be  enforcing the border, those statements are conveyed by the cartels to  people who they believe will pay to get across. We are, therefore,  seeing the increase of people at the border, including unaccompanied  minors who are supposedly people we want to protect.   Last week, on the Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday, just in the Sasabe  section alone, after I left that area, there were 120 unaccompanied  juveniles. Some already part of a criminal element, but given that they  have to deal with the cartels to get across the border, it certainly is  not a good influence on them.   Also while I was down there, I heard in the last year, on the Tucson  sector alone--and there are seven or eight sectors along our Southern  border--well over 100 people were found dehydrated to death. This is  the result of the current system in which we do not secure our border.   Unfortunately, despite the verbiage which indicates we are going to  be less stringent in enforcing our border, we are also going to stop  building the wall. First of all, you are throwing away about 5,000 jobs  right away, and supposedly we are supposed to be looking for new jobs.   But more than that, when you end these contracts, you wind up having  to pay companies for parts of the wall that have been built but haven't  been put up yet, pay them to undo or fill in holes which have been  placed there in anticipation of a full wall, pay them to undo the  damage to roads. And roads are part of the wall system that is going to  be built down there. As a result, we are spending a lot of money which  could be used to put in more wall and is not.   I should point out that when you put up a wall, it saves money as far  as the number of Border Patrol agents you need. If you don't have a  wall, it should take about two or three border agents a mile to patrol  the border. With a wall, it is about one agent for every two miles.  Another benefit for having a wall.  [[Page H375]]    But above all, the idea of paying money to wrap up the project rather  than paying money to complete the wall is a waste of money and a real  problem.   Another thing I found out, with the wall, you are going to have less  injuries to Border Patrol agents, which is probably one of many reasons  why when I have gone down at the wall, I have yet to find a Border  Patrol agent or a sheriff's deputy for the counties along the Southern  border who is not in favor of the wall.   We are going to wind up losing money as we pay money to care for  people crossing the wall, losing money to our society as we have more  drugs coming across the Southern border. And not surprising, as  marijuana becomes more legal in the United States, more of the drugs  that cross the Southern border are fentanyl, are meth, are heroin,  resulting in more deaths all around the country. Another reason why we  should be taking our Southern border seriously.   I, therefore, strongly encourage my colleagues, as we look at future  appropriation bills, to pay attention to the border. We cannot go back  to the days of completely anybody can come across there, because, like  I said, you are going to wind up with more people dehydrated to death  in the desert. You are going to wind up with more unaccompanied minors  who are going to be dealt with by the tender arms of the drug cartels,  which control all the immigration and illegal immigration across the  Southern border.   So, please, I ask my colleagues, do what I did. Go down to Arizona.  Go down to Texas. See the situation we have. See whether anybody could  possibly think going back to the old system is humane in any way. It is  not humane to minors. It is not humane to the people who are guided by  the cartels. It is not humane to the people who cross the border and  wind up dehydrating across our Southern edge.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
