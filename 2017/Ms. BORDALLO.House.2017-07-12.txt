 Mr. Chairman, I would first like to commend Chairman  Thornberry, Ranking Member Smith, and the committee staff who have  worked many long nights on the National Defense Authorization Act for  Fiscal Year 2018.   While there are very real questions about the top line number, and I  believe it would be inappropriate and reckless to have any additional  funding come off the backs of nondefense spending, this is an important  step forward in rebuilding our military readiness.   This bill includes additional operations and maintenance funding to  support more combat training center rotations and needed investment in  the facilities sustainment, restoration, and modernization accounts,  providing more training opportunities and better maintenance facilities  to live, work, and operate in. However, readiness cannot be bought back  in a year, and these targeted investments must continue.   Furthermore, the bill provides authorities to right-size civilian  personnel shortfalls that have stressed maintenance backlogs at our  shipyards and our depots. It also will make more effective the  Department's Quarterly Readiness Report and raise the minor military  construction threshold and clarify unspecified projects to provide  additional flexibility to the Department.   I would especially like to thank Chairman Thornberry for following  through on his commitment last year to work with me to include my  provision that would help address critical workforce shortages  affecting military  [[Page H5537]]  construction and healthcare essential to the military buildup on Guam.  I also thank our Ranking Member Smith and Readiness Subcommittee  Chairman Joe Wilson for working with me on this issue and on this bill.  I look forward to continuing to work together to protect the full  intent of this legislation.   The readiness portion of this bill also includes provisions to  support ship repair in the western Pacific, as well as full funding for  critical military construction projects.                                time  1945    Given our posture, our strategic needs and challenges in the region,  it is essential that we continue to sufficiently resource and support  an active and engaged Indo-Asia-Pacific force.   I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the  aisle as this process continues.   And lastly, Mr. Chair, I would like to commend Vickie Plunkett for  her over two decades of service in the House of Representatives, and 10  years on the House Armed Services Committee.
