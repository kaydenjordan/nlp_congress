 Mr. Speaker, I rise today because it has been 6 years since  the attack on the American consulate in Benghazi and ask that we  reflect on the four patriotic Americans who lost their lives:   Petty Officer First Class Glen Doherty and Senior Chief Petty Officer  Tyrone Woods were Navy SEALs, doing what they loved, serving as  security personnel in Libya and working to protect United States  diplomats.   Ambassador Chris Stevens and Staff Sergeant Sean Smith served for a  combined 31 years with the U.S. State Department.   In honor of their memory, I am asking that our colleagues cosponsor  the Gold Medal Act, H.R. 2315, to formally recognize these four men  with the Congressional Gold Medal for their heroism and dedication to  our country.   I am asking that every Member of the House think about their 12  grueling hours of close-quarters combat, the crack of those AK-47s  firing at them and next to each one of them, the indirect fire that  their compound was taking, the fires that burned their bodies, the  unanswered calls for help. Think about their lifesaving actions on  behalf of others and the fact that it cost them their own lives.                            ____________________
