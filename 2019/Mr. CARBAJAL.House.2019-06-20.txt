 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I am offering an amendment to make it clear  to the administration that we will not sit idly by as they attempt to  open up our shores to further oil and gas development. We will not  allow our treasured natural resources to be sold to Big Oil, and we  will not put corporate profits above protecting our environment and our  local coastal economies.   My amendment would put in place a moratorium on offshore oil and gas  drilling and related activities in the four planning areas off the  Pacific Outer Continental Shelf for fiscal year 2020.   My constituents on the central Coast have seen firsthand the  devastating impacts of some of the largest oil spills in California  history, like the 1969 Santa Barbara oil spill. Most recently, the 2015  Plains All American oil spill in my district cost $92 million to clean  up. These incidents show us that we cannot afford yet another  disastrous oil spill.   In contrast, California's coastal region generates over $1.9 trillion  of GDP and supports more than $731 billion in wages.   Future oil drilling would pose a direct threat to our local  economies, businesses, and tourism, which are tied to our clean oceans  and healthy ecosystem.   Since the 1969 oil spill in Santa Barbara, there has not been a new  or expanded lease in California State waters, or one in Federal waters  since 1984.   This policy has enjoyed support from both Republican and Democratic  administrations. Yet this administration today seems tone deaf to this  reality. Instead, they are asking to hold seven new lease sales in the  four planning areas off the Pacific Outer Continental Shelf.   I urge passage of my amendment, which would protect nearly 650,000  jobs in our region.   Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Washington (Mr.  Kilmer).    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
