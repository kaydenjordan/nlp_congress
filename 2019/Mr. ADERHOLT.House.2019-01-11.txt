 Madam Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Calvert for  yielding and for his leadership on this bill that we passed back in  December.   Unfortunately, as you know, I am rising, Madam Speaker, in opposition  of H.R. 266.   What we have before us today, however, is yet another Democrat  appropriations bill that fails to reflect the House priorities. This  time, it ignores 93 percent of all the House Member requests that were  included in the House bill and in the report.   I would like to point out just a few of the many House Member  priorities that were addressed in the House Republican Interior and  environment bill that are not addressed in this current bill.   Compared to the House Republican bill, this bill reduces funding for  hazardous fuel reduction projects by $21 million. It also reduces  funding for operation and maintenance of the National Park System by  $27 million. It does not include any of the Endangered Species Act  reforms, which are absolutely necessary for the law to work in a  practical way.   Therefore, Madam Speaker, rather than spending our time debating  Senate-passed legislation, which fails to reflect any House priorities,  I ask that the Democrats come to the negotiating table so we can secure  our border, so we can keep America safe, and so we can resolve this  partial shutdown that we are now entering on its 21st day.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill.
