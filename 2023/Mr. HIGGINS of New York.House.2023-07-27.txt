 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Elaine  Newberg, who will celebrate her 100th birthday on August 24.   Born in 1923, she grew up in Philadelphia and attended the University  of Pennsylvania.   A gifted pianist, Elaine once performed with the Philadelphia  Symphony Orchestra. She went on to become a music teacher, producing a  number of popular musicals worthy of the best theaters.   Passionate about helping students find their way, Elaine became a  guidance counselor, serving as president of both the Long Island and  New York State School Counselor Association.   Elaine and her husband, Marvin, a World War II veteran, raised two  children, Richard and Shanti. Richard is an Emmy-winning journalist in  Buffalo and Shanti is a social worker.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Elaine  Newberg's dedicated life of service, passion, and creativity as we wish  her a very happy 100th birthday.                            ____________________
