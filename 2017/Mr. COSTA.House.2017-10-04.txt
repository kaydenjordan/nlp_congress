 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to spotlight the statement of  Lieutenant General Jay Silveria, the superintendent of the United  States Air Force Academy, made after an incident involving racial  slurs.   His speech made three clear points:   First, the appropriate response for horrible language and horrible  ideas is a better idea.   Second, we currently have the opportunity to think about our defining  values as Americans and to stand firm on our values.   Lastly, if you cannot treat someone with dignity and respect, then  you need to get out.   Lieutenant General Silveria is a role model. I stand here to share  these words because we in Washington need to hear and heed them. We  must think about who we are as a nation and we must stand firm in our  values. After all, we are Americans. Our values have always defined us.   So we simply cannot accept the words and actions of those who do not  treat others with dignity and respect. We must respond to horrible  language and hateful ideas with better ideas and a strong resolve to  rise above hate. This is how we become a better and a stronger nation.                            ____________________
