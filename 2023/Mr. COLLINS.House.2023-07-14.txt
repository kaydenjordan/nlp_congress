 Mr. Speaker, we worked a little late last night. We  voted to get rid of this leftwing socialistic woke agenda that has not  only been crammed down the throats of the American people but crammed  down the throats of our military.   That is right. We got rid of DEI and CRT. It is gone. Now we can get  back to protecting the citizens of this country. We also are protecting  the citizens of the unborn. We got rid of abortions that are paid for  by taxpayers in our military.   We did one more thing, Mr. Speaker. We gave those serving a needed  pay raise and increased their lethality so that they can stay ahead of  China.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the House to pass the NDAA today. Hold the line,  negotiate, and fight for this bill when it comes back from the Senate.                            ____________________
