 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in favor of the HOPR Act, H.R. 2915.   Mr. Speaker, I commend my colleague, Mr. Correa, for his continued  leadership on this issue to help bolster our domestic supply chains.   This bill requires that, to the maximum extent possible, at least  one-third of the funds obligated for the procurement of the Department  of Homeland Security uniforms and gear covered by the HOPR Act be used  to purchase goods manufactured by entities that qualify as United  States small businesses.   Additionally, this bill directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to  conduct a study of the adequacy of uniform allowances provided to  Department frontline personnel to determine what improvements can be  made to current uniform allowances, including increasing allowances.   Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to join me in supporting H.R. 2915, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my bill, H.R. 5652, the DHS  Acquisition Review Board Act of 2021.   The Department of Homeland Security invests billions of dollars each  year in its major acquisitions. These programs include buying IT  systems to help secure our border, Coast Guard cutters to increase  marine safety, and tools to help TSA screen travelers more efficiently.  These acquisitions, and others, enable the Department to execute its  many critical missions.   In fiscal year 2021 alone, DHS planned to spend more than $7 billion  on its major acquisition programs, and ultimately, the Department plans  to spend more than $200 billion over the programs' entire life cycles.   However, the Government Accountability Office, GAO, and the DHS  Office of the Inspector General, OIG, have reported on the longstanding  challenges DHS faces in managing its major acquisition programs, which  began with the inception of the Department and continue to this day.   For example, in January 2021, GAO reported that of the 24 major  acquisition programs it audited, 10 had been in breach of their cost or  scheduled goals, or both, at some point during fiscal year 2020.   Also, in 2018, the OIG reported that DHS components have an ongoing  tendency to acquire systems before they adequately define their  requirements or develop performance measures. We cannot allow this to  continue.   Given these challenges and the significant level of DHS investment in  these programs, it is important for Congress to ensure that the proper  oversight structures are in place. That is exactly what this bill  intends to do.   This bill amends the Homeland Security Act to include the DHS  Acquisition Review Board, which has already been formed by the  Department.   The bill outlines specific responsibilities and parameters for the  Board, which it exercises today, including its membership and how often  the Board should meet, such as at certain key points in the programs'  life cycles.   The Board is held at the Department level and is chaired by the  acquisition  [[Page H6296]]  decision authority--normally, the Under Secretary for Management or a  designee--and consists of individuals who manage DHS' mission  objectives, resources, and contracts.   The Board's primary oversight role is to review major acquisition  programs for proper management, oversight, accountability, and  alignment with the Department's strategic functions.   The Board keeps acquisition programs accountable to the Department,  Congress, and the American taxpayer, most importantly, by doing the  following.   First, it ensures that the Department considers tradeoffs between  cost, schedule, and performance before approving a program to proceed  to the next phase of acquisition.   Second, it determines whether programs are using acquisition best  practices.   Third, it requires senior DHS leaders to review the programs'  progress and see that the program requirements are being met as they  should.   This bill also requires the Board to document the actions and the  decisions that it makes, including rationale for its decisions, which  are then submitted to the Committee on Homeland Security in the House  and the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs in the  Senate.    In conclusion, this bill simply proposes to codify better oversight,  management, and accountability of the Department's acquisitions.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, Congresswoman Demings, for  reaching across the aisle and cosponsoring this commonsense bill with  me. I also thank Ranking Member Katko and Representatives Garbarino,  Higgins, and Miller-Meeks for cosponsoring this bill as well.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 5652, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today for H.R. 5574, the TRANSLATE Act.   According to the United States Census Bureau, approximately 67  million U.S. residents speak a language other than English at home.  This legislation requires TSA to ensure that its communications  materials in airports are in the primary languages of individuals who  travel through and work in our country's airports.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1400     Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
