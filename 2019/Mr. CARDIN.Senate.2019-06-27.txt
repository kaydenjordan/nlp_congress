 Mr. President, I would like to call the Senate's  attention to the Youth Summer Jobs and Public Service Act of 2019 that  I am introducing today with my colleague from Maryland, Senator Van  Hollen. This legislation authorizes the Department of Labor to award  Summer Employment for Youth grants to connect youth with jobs that  serve their local communities and private businesses over the summer  months.   Since the mid-1990s, my home city of Baltimore has organized the  Youth Works program out of the Mayor's Office of Employment  Development. The Youth Works program provides individuals between the  ages of 14 to 21 with a summer job with employers ranging from private  businesses, local community nonprofit organizations, to city and State  government agencies throughout the City. At these summer jobs,  participants are provided with meaningful work experiences, are able to  learn to develop the attitudes and grit necessary to compete in the  workforce, gain exposure to a variety of career fields, and have a  safe, stable environment over the summer months during the day. For the  2019 Youth Works session that begins next week, Baltimore youth  participating in the program will have a job for five days a week, five  hours per day from July 1st through August 2nd and be paid a minimum of  $10.10 per hour for their service.   This program has grown to be one of the largest youth summer  employment programs in the Nation. After the unrest in my home city in  April 2015, the Federal Department of Labor provided the Maryland  Department of Labor, Licensing and Regulation and the Baltimore City's  Mayor's Office of Employment with a $5 million grant to develop  innovative job training strategies and work opportunities for youth and  young adults across Baltimore. This Federal grant increased the number  of individuals able to be served by the Youth Works program from an  historic average of 5,000 participants to the more than 8,000 served  today. Last year, Youth Works provided 8,600 Baltimoreans with jobs at  more than 900 different worksites across my home city. I'm proud to say  that some of those individuals who participated in the Youth Works  program over the course of multiple summers while in high school have  recently graduated and were hired by State agencies such as the  Maryland Department of Natural Resources. Baltimore youth and their  families clearly see the value of this program, with more than 14,000  individuals applying for Youth Works slots this upcoming summer.   Unfortunately, due to the lack of funding between the partnership  between the City, State, private business, and philanthropic ventures,  more than 5,000 Baltimore City youth who sought summer employment will  be denied the opportunity to gain experience in the workplace, foster  confidence that they are capable of being successful in a new  environment, and lose the security of a safe environment over the  summer. We can and must do more to help individuals willing and eager  to start their careers.   The Youth Summer Jobs and Public Service Act would seek to eliminate  the waiting list for Baltimore students seeking to participate in Youth  Works or other summer employment programs around the Nation. If  enacted, my legislation would allow States to compete for Summer  Employment for Youth grants to serve communities like Baltimore that  have high concentrations of eligible, low-income youth. The grants  would be utilized by local communities to carry out programs like the  Youth Works program that provide summer employment opportunities that  are directly linked to academic and occupations learning by providing  meaningful work experiences. States competing for grants would be  required to partner with private businesses to the extent feasible and  to prioritize jobs and work opportunities that directly serve their  communities, such as through summer employment with local community  nonprofit organizations and city and State government agencies. This  additional Federal funding can boost existing programs such as Youth  Works and allow other communities across Maryland to establish their  own programs and develop Maryland's next generation of workforce.   I am proud to lead this Senate effort with my colleague from Maryland  and appreciate the work of Representative Cedric Richmond of Louisiana  who initially led this effort in the U.S. House of Representatives and  will shortly introduce companion legislation this Congress. I urge my  Senate colleagues to join with me in this effort to connect youth with  summer employment opportunities and start their journey towards  fulfilling, successful careers.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be  printed in the Congressional Record following my remarks.   There being no objections, so ordered.                                  S. 2036         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,  [[Page S4635]]            SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

Senator Van Hollen and I have just introduced a  resolution which pays tribute to Alex's life, calls for justice and  accountability in his murder, and procedures to ensure other families  do not suffer this same tragedy.   Luis Alejandro ``Alex'' Villamayor was born on July 3, 1998, to  parents Puning Luk Villamayor and Luis Felipe Villamayor in Rockville,  Maryland. Those who knew him remember him as a smart, loving, and  compassionate young man with a good sense of humor. Alex was committed  to his parents, siblings, and friends. He was a devoted member of his  church and always sought to help those less fortunate.   Alex Villamayor moved with his family to Paraguay at the age of six.  He attended high school there and graduated with honors from the Pan  American International School and was accepted to attend Montgomery  College in Maryland in the fall of 2015 to study business management.  He ultimately planned to pursue a career to help and support the  Paraguayan people, but was tragically murdered on June 27, 2015, in the  city of Encarnacion.   Alex's death was wrongfully ruled a suicide by Paraguayan  authorities, who had not properly investigated the death at that point  and failed to collect blood and DNA samples from individuals present at  the scene of the crime, conduct gunshot residue analysis, or collect  cellular phone records and data from individuals present at the crime  scene.   After Alex's family noted gross inconsistencies in accounts of his  death, Alex's body was exhumed for additional forensic examination,  which found that he had been raped and physically assaulted prior to  his death. Finally, in September 2015, Alex's death was ruled a  homicide. Rene Hofstetter and Mathias Wilbs were charged with crimes in  relation to Alex Villamayor's murder and Paraguayan authorities opened  a formal investigation of Alain Jacks Diaz de Bedoya, who was also  present at the time of Alex's death. While the charges against, Mr.  Diaz de Bedoya were eventually dropped, in April 2018 Rene Hofstetter  was convicted of homicide and sentenced to 12 years in prison and  Mathias Wilbs was sentenced to two years and 10 months on obstruction  of justice.   In spite of these convictions, I remain concerned about the handling  of this case. In spite of an offer to assist, the Government of  Paraguay never allowed the FBI to provide technical assistance for the  investigation. Our Ambassador at the time told media outlets that ``the  investigation and the handling of this case has been worrisome.'' Of  even greater concern, members of Alex's immediate family continue to  face grave physical threats in Paraguay for their pursuit of justice.   Senators Van Hollen and I continue to offer our deepest condolences  to the Villamayor family and, through this resolution, call on  Paraguayan authorities to finally allow the FBI to assist in this case  and provide the necessary protections to Alex's family. We similarly  ask the Department of State to prioritize justice for Alex Villamayor  in its diplomatic engagement with the Government of Paraguay and to  review its procedures for providing services to the families of United  States citizens slain or assaulted abroad.   On this sad anniversary, we remain committed to honoring the life of  Alex Villamayor and working to ensure this tragic story does not repeat  itself.                            ____________________
