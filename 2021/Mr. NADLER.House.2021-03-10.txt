 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 188, I call up  the bill (H.R. 8) to require a background check for every firearm sale,  and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous material on H.R. 8.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, gun violence impacts all of our communities, and no  place is immune from its reach, including our homes, our streets, our  schools, and even our places of worship. That is why we must take swift  and decisive action to reduce the daily toll of gun violence that  afflicts our Nation. H.R. 8, the Bipartisan Background Checks Act of  2021 is sensible and effective legislation to do just that.   Under current law, gun sales conducted by licensed firearms dealers  may only be completed if the buyers clear background checks. This bill  would simply extend that requirement, with limited exceptions, to guns  transferred by unlicensed individuals as well. That simple change to  close a gaping loophole in the law is one of the most effective steps  we can take to address the scourge of gun violence in this country.   According to one study, 22 percent of gun owners in the U.S. acquired  their most recent firearm without a background check. We do not know if  they were felons, fugitives, domestic abusers, or otherwise prohibited  under the law from possessing firearms. A huge volume of guns was sold  with no questions asked. It is time to close this dangerous loophole.   There is no reason to continue to make it easy for people who are  legally prohibited from possessing firearms to acquire them. The  evidence clearly shows that background checks work and significantly  curb gun violence. One study found that a Connecticut law requiring  background checks was associated with a 40 percent decline in gun  homicides and a 15 percent drop in suicides. On the other hand, when  Missouri repealed its background check law, the State's gun homicides  increased by 23 percent and suicides increased by 16 percent.   Gun violence of this magnitude is a distinctly American problem. A  recent study in the American Journal of Medicine found that compared to  29 other high-income countries, the gun-related murder rate in the  United States is 25 times higher. Even when you adjust for population  differences, Americans are disproportionately killed by gun violence.  This is a disparity that we can remedy by passing this bill.   With the exception of certain limited transfers, such as gifts to  family members and transfers for hunting, target shooting, and self- defense, H.R. 8 would extend the current Federal background check  requirement--which applies now only to licensed gun dealers--and would  require virtually all transactions to undergo a background check to  help ensure that firearms do not end up in the wrong hands.   I thank Representative   Mike Thompson of California for drafting  this important legislation and for being a champion of gun violence  prevention in Congress.   Simply put, H.R. 8 will save lives. I urge my colleagues to support  this legislation and to support safer streets, safer schools, and safer  communities.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the distinguished majority leader of the House.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from California (Mr. Thompson), the sponsor of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, the fact is that 160 families every day buy  guns. All this bill does is to say that people who obtain guns from  unlicensed dealers, as well as licensed dealers, must be subject to the  background check, and that will save a heck of a lot of lives.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from California (Mr. Swalwell).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Raskin).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. Jayapal).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Georgia (Mrs. McBath).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. Dean).

Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Massachusetts (Mrs. Trahan).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Kelly).    Mr. Speaker, how much time remains?    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from California (Mr. Levin).

Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from New York (Mr. Bowman).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer).    Mr. Speaker, may I ask how much time remains.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from New York (Mr. Jeffries).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Garcia).    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close. I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, since the House passed H.R. 8 more than 2 years ago, an  estimated 80,000 people have lost their lives to gun violence. We have  had too many moments of silence and too many expressions of sympathy.  Too many families are grieving the loss of a loved one.   Expanding background checks is overwhelmingly supported by the  American public because they know that it will make a meaningful  difference in reducing gun violence and saving lives. It is time to  enact this important legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, that is correct.             Amendments En Bloc Offered by Mr. Nadler of New York     Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 188, I offer  amendments en bloc.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 45 seconds.   Mr. Speaker, this en bloc amendment includes several amendments that  strengthen the bill and that thoughtfully modify it to account for  practical considerations surrounding the use and misuse of firearms.   Among this group are a provision that clarifies the exchange of  firearms between family members, a measure to protect more expansive  State firearm laws, an amendment that would ensure ATF background check  forms are available in Spanish, and a proposal that would allow for  temporary transfers for pest control.   Representative Jackson Lee's amendment concerning suicide is  particularly important as it highlights the tragic consequences that  access to firearms can have on those who intend to harm themselves.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the en bloc  amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 188, I call up  the bill (H.R. 1446) to amend chapter 44 of title 18, United States  Code, to strengthen the background check procedures to be followed  before a Federal firearms licensee may transfer a firearm to a person  who is not such a licensee, and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous material on H.R. 1446.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1446, the Enhanced Background Checks Act of 2021,  is a critical bill to provide law enforcement the necessary time to  keep firearms out of the hands of those who are not legally eligible to  own them.   The 2015 massacre at Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, which killed  nine innocent people, stands as a tragic reminder of how current  background check laws sometimes fall short.   Under current law, a licensed gun dealer conducting a background  check on a prospective purchaser is permitted to sell the firearm to  the purchaser if there has been no determination from the background  check system, commonly called NICS, after 3 business days.   This is the case even if the system has not indicated that the person  has actually passed the background check. Often, we refer to this as a  default proceed transaction.   While 96 percent of background checks are processed within 3 business  days, an analysis of FBI data showed that over 35,000 guns were  transferred to prohibited purchasers between 2008  [[Page H1304]]  and 2017 because of the default proceed rule.   On average, over the course of the last decade, 10 prohibited  individuals have been able to purchase guns at licensed firearms  dealers through the default proceed rule every single day.   The cases in which there is a delay are the very cases that ought to  be carefully investigated.   If NICS is unable to return an instant determination--and especially  if there is no report after 3 days--there is cause for concern. There  may be a good reason that these individuals should not own firearms,  but the current system allows the transfer nonetheless.   Under this legislation, as under current law, a sale may proceed  immediately once a background check clears a purchaser, which is the  case in the vast majority of instances.   This bill provides, however, that for checks taking longer to  complete, the FBI will have 10 business days for the initial background  check investigation period. If the check is not completed during this  time, an individual may submit a petition for expedited review. If a  petition is submitted, unless NICS provides an answer within the next  10 business days, either clearing the transaction or stopping it, a gun  dealer has the discretion to complete the sale and transfer the  firearm.   We must ensure that firearms transfers are lawful, and in some  instances, that requires additional time. That is why H.R. 1446 is  needed, to prevent the sale of firearms to prohibited individuals by  providing the FBI with additional time to complete background checks.   H.R. 1446 is a sensible and necessary approach to closing a dangerous  loophole, and I commend our colleague, Congressman  Jim Clyburn, the  distinguished Democratic whip, for introducing this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly support this legislation, and I reserve the  balance of my time.                                time  1600     Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  South Carolina (Mr. Clyburn), the sponsor of this legislation, and the  distinguished majority whip.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from South Carolina.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Pelosi), the distinguished Speaker of the House.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Georgia (Mrs. McBath).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Kelly).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from New York (Mr. Espaillat).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the distinguished gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Raskin).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Maryland.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. Dingell).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   I have never heard such pernicious nonsense as we have heard today  from our Republican friends.   They say that this legislation will violate gun rights. But all this  legislation does is close a dangerous loophole that puts weapons in the  hands of individuals who should not legally be permitted to purchase  them merely because the FBI is not able to complete the background  check in time.   The FBI under this legislation will have 10 days maybe instead of 3  days to complete the background check and decide whether someone is too  dangerous to have access to guns. That is all this legislation does.   To say that it infringes on the Second Amendment, Mr. Raskin pointed  out that Justice Scalia in the Heller decision upheld this kind of  legislation.   So stop with the nonsense, pass this legislation, and make the  American people safe.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 188, I offer  amendments en bloc.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself 45 seconds.   Madam Speaker, the amendments contained in this en bloc amendment  include important changes to the bill that will provide Congress  additional information to inform our future decisionmaking.   Representative Burgess' amendment would require reporting to Congress  on the number of NICS denials referred for investigation after a  firearm was sold to a person who was later found to be ineligible.   Representative Levin's amendment adds State-level data tracking which  will facilitate our review of which State gun safety measures have been  effective and which should be considered on the Federal level.   Representative McBath's amendment would require critical reporting on  the impact of the bill on victims of domestic abuse.   Lastly, Representative Neguse's amendment makes data available to the  public regarding NICS denials.   These are valuable additions to H.R. 1446.   Madam Speaker, I urge all Members to support them, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from California (Mr. Levin).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Clarke).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Speier).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close. I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Our Republican friends insist on misreading the bill. They insist on  talking about things that aren't in the bill.   The bill takes away the rights of nobody except those who have  threatened their wives, threatened their former wives, threatened other  people in the community. Those are all the people who are affected.   Yes, we extend the NICS system from 3 days to 10 days. That means  that if the NICS system hasn't reported back within 3 days, the FBI  gets up to 10 days. At the end of 10 days, they can't stop you from  getting a weapon unless the records show that you are not entitled to  get the weapon because you are a danger to the community. That is what  this bill does.   To misread it and say it gives any rights to felons, or to gun  buyers, or to people who are criminals because they disobey the law, of  course people who disobey the law are criminals. But that is not what  the bill deals with.   The bill simply says that it effectuates a system that says that  people who are threats to the community may not get guns. And it does  not limit the time beyond 10 days to make that decision.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
