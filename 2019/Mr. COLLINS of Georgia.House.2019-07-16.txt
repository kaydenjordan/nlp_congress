 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this is the third time that I have stood in this well  this year on this floor about this subject, and I have been clear at  every juncture: Racism, bigotry, and anti-Semitism will find no refuge  in the people's House.   We expect each other to speak fairly, truthfully, and respectfully of  all our fellow Members of Congress and of the President--not because we  agree with each other all the time, but because we have great respect  for the Americans who elected us and to represent them from one end of  Pennsylvania Avenue to the other.   I come here today, Mr. Speaker, with much grief and many questions.  The first may be procedural, but it is not trivial.   The Democrats wrote a resolution last night. It is on the floor  today. I just have a question: What happened to the 72-hour rule  ensuring Members have an opportunity to review legislation and seek  feedback from constituents before voting on it? What happened to  regular order? This never came through committee.   Why does the House have rules if the Democratic majority only follows  them when politically convenient? And, also, as was brought up in the  rules debate, there was even no consultation with others who would want  to be a part of this.   The President has every right to be frustrated with Congress for the  work that we have failed to do on multiple fronts, including the  border. I also understand that his recent tweets make it hard for us to  move forward.   Attacks are like quicksand: They trap and they defeat us before we  know it. They are distracting us from legislating. That was true when a  lawmaker implied last week that a Member of the House leadership was  singling out ``newly elected women of color'' and when other  Representatives were accused of enabling a racist system.   It is true as we see little to no concern from my colleagues across  the aisle when a foreign flag is raised over an American facility or a  terrorist firebombed another facility.   It is true when the President of the United States, out of  frustration, tweeted this weekend, and it is true of many comments  coming from lawmakers today.   In fact, it is interesting for my chairman to say that they have  called out the President every time but, also, many times--and this is  just a small listing of every week that they have not called out their  own Members for things that I cannot read on this floor.    Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, we are too quick this Congress to allow  political ends to justify procedural means. But that is not democracy  rooted in our unalienable rights, rights the second clause in this  resolution affirms. The resolution is simply a lesson in political  expediency.   Integrity is a prerequisite to our covenant to govern by the consent  of the people, which this resolution also affirms.   We knew when we voted for the House rules this January that we could  not, in this Chamber, use certain language about other democratically  elected leaders. We agreed to let ideas compete for our votes and use  rhetoric as a tool to build bridges instead of as kindling to burn  those bridges down. Yet not a week goes by, as we have already pointed  out, without Members of this body issuing statements or tweets that I  could not and will not read from this floor without violating our  rules.   It is amazing, but not surprising, that some of my colleagues are  using this platform to call for impeachment since many have been making  that call since November of 2016--no justification then, and definitely  not now.   You see, Mr. Speaker, pleas for decorum are not merely a refuge for  lawmakers who find themselves in the minority. Decorum is a symptom of  a healthy and confident democracy. When we can debate ideas on this  floor, decorum ensures democracy's every voice can be heard.   I would like to lend my voice to the chorus of lawmakers supporting  the first 15 clauses of this resolution, but for the misguided title  and the fourth page of this resolution, we could have had a suspension  vote.   To its credit, the resolution states the House of Representatives  ``is committed to keeping America open to those lawfully seeking refuge  and asylum.'' I agree.   Everyone who votes for this resolution will now be on record as  opposing illegal immigration, and I hope we can all work together to  address the border crisis based on that common foundation.   Again, you don't need a vote on this resolution to do that. You  simply have to look at the border and acknowledge the crisis.   But we will still have a problem with this resolution. We cannot, by  our own House rules, support a resolution that labels the President in  this way, and I will not.   The rules that have governed this body since the first United States  Congress do not allow us to devolve in that way. However, it doesn't  mean that we can't condemn racial or ethnic prejudice. It doesn't mean  we can't decisively reject anti-Semitism, as we have on this floor. In  my view, we have not done it so far in this Congress to that extent,  but we have time for a clarion call on that front. I know some  colleagues on both sides of the aisle who could join each other in that  conviction.   Our own standards of decorum, however, in fact, empower us to welcome  to America every person who respects our laws and wants to help defend  our freedoms. These standards also give us a platform to admit when we  and those around us make mistakes.   When we consider the power of this Chamber to legislate for the  common good, I wonder why my colleagues have become so eager to attack  the President that they are willing to sacrifice the rules, precedents,  and the integrity of the people's House for an unprecedented vote that  undercuts its very democratic processes.   I wonder, if the comments in view today are what some of my  colleagues say they are, why this resolution had to rephrase them to  make its point. The resolution condemns comments in a way that exposes  the breathtaking partisanship of today's exercise.   The resolution quotes only three words from the comments it rejects-- the words ``go back'' and ``invaders.'' Beyond those three words, the  resolution substitutes its own phrasing and editorializing for the  words this resolution has in view.   Again, a partisan show. That is a tell that today's resolution is  more of a political jab than anything else. It is, therefore, a signal  for us to take a moment to look inward.  [[Page H5847]]    I wonder if, when we are tempted to accuse our sister, our brother,  our fellow American, political foe, or Madam Speaker of racism--by the  way, I do not believe that the President is a racist. I do not believe  the Speaker of this House is a racist. I do not believe the majority  leader is a racist. I do not believe the minority leader is a racist.  We can go down this line. I do not believe that. Then why do we insist  on using this floor to litigate the propriety of statements made  outside these walls?   We assign a lot of wicked intent to a lot of tweets, even though 280  characters offers us the least context for making our points and  endless potential for misunderstanding each other.   To be fair, a lot of political speech today seems to be made to  deepen our divide by highlighting our differences, and that is a cause  for sadness. That is exactly what the rules of decorum in this body are  designed to guard against.   We have a choice this afternoon, Mr. Speaker. We can pursue  escalation against our fellow Americans, or we can pursue  reconciliation on their behalf. Only one of those options makes room  for this body to do its job: the legislating of the solutions for the  challenges of the American people.   Many of the Members are my friends, and I am thankful for the chance  to work alongside each of them every day. But, today, we renew our  commitment to the democratic ideals of this Chamber by voting against a  flawed resolution, against a political statement, against something  that could not even be written in a proper way without adding editorial  and paraphrased comments.   I would ask each of my friends on both sides of the aisle to evaluate  what is before them, evaluate what we have done, and evaluate what we  don't take up for political convenience when it is our side saying it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the  gentleman from California (Mr. McClintock).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Gonzalez).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Meuser).                                time  1445     Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds  to the gentleman from Pennsylvania.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from West Virginia (Mrs. Miller).    Mr. Speaker, I ask for a time check on both  sides, please.    Mr. Speaker, at this time I yield 3 minutes  to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Duffy).    Mr. Speaker, point of order.    Point of order.    Mr. Speaker, I was just going to ask the  gentle Speaker of the House if she would like to rephrase that comment.    Mr. Speaker, I make a point of order the  gentlewoman's words are unparliamentary and request that the words be  taken down.    Mr. Speaker, I made a point of order that the  gentlewoman's words were unparliamentary and request they be taken  down.    Mr. Speaker, I request that the gentlewoman's  words are unparliamentary and request that they be taken down.    Mr. Speaker, I have a motion at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--yeas 190,  nays 232, not voting 10, as follows:                               [Roll No. 480]                                 YEAS--190       Abraham      Aderholt      Allen      Amodei      Armstrong      Arrington      Babin      Bacon      Baird      Balderson      Banks      Barr      Bergman      Bilirakis      Bishop (UT)      Bost      Brady      Brooks (AL)      Brooks (IN)      Buchanan      Buck      Bucshon      Budd      Burchett      Byrne      Calvert      Carter (GA)      Carter (TX)      Chabot      Cheney      Cline      Cloud      Cole      Collins (GA)      Comer      Conaway      Cook      Crawford      Crenshaw      Curtis      Davidson (OH)      Davis, Rodney      DesJarlais      Diaz-Balart      Duffy      Duncan      Dunn      Emmer      Estes      Ferguson      Fitzpatrick      Fleischmann      Flores      Fortenberry      Foxx (NC)      Fulcher      Gaetz      Gallagher      Gianforte      Gibbs      Gonzalez (OH)      Gooden      Gosar      Graves (GA)      Graves (LA)      Graves (MO)      Green (TN)      Griffith      Grothman      Guest      Guthrie      Hagedorn      Harris      Hartzler      Hern, Kevin      Herrera Beutler      Hice (GA)      Higgins (LA)      Hill (AR)      Holding      Hollingsworth      Hudson      Huizenga      Hunter      Hurd (TX)      Johnson (LA)      Johnson (OH)      Johnson (SD)      Jordan      Joyce (OH)      Joyce (PA)      Katko      Keller      Kelly (MS)      Kelly (PA)      King (IA)      King (NY)      Kinzinger      Kustoff (TN)      LaHood      LaMalfa      Lamborn      Latta      Lesko      Long      Loudermilk      Lucas      Luetkemeyer      Marshall      Massie      Mast      McCarthy      McCaul      McClintock      McHenry      McKinley      Meadows      Meuser      Miller      Mitchell      Moolenaar      Mooney (WV)      Mullin      Newhouse      Norman      Nunes      Olson      Palazzo      Palmer      Pence      Perry      Posey      Ratcliffe      Reed      Reschenthaler      Rice (SC)      Riggleman      Roby      Rodgers (WA)      Roe, David P.

A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                         Motion Offered by Mr. Nadler     Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from California (Mr. McCarthy), the minority leader.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, point of order.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        July 16, 2019, on page H5854, the following appeared: Calling  African countries * * * countries is racist, and telling four  Members of this body to go home is racist.   Madam Speaker, point of order.      The online version has been corrected to read as follows with a  small cap title inserted in the proper position in debate: Calling  African countries * * * countries is racist, and telling four  Members of this body to go home is racist. POINT OF ORDER  Madam Speaker, I make a point of order that  the gentleman's words are unparliamentary, and I insist they be taken  down.    Madam Speaker, I now withdraw my point of  order.    Madam Speaker, I yield as much time as he may  consume to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Scalise).    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of  my time.   Madam Speaker, I will not belabor this. I have made many of the  points that I have said before. I think this was rushed to the floor. I  think this is what happens, unfortunately, when things are rushed.   There are things that need to be done, and the decorum of this House  is important. We have had a long lesson of that today.   The very essence of the resolution, which has issues beyond, needs to  be considered. When we do this, then I think, as I said in my opening-- and I will stick by what I said then--this needs to be voted down. This  does not need to go forward.   We need to get to a certain time when we are back to, literally,  doing the people's business. This is the third time, Madam Speaker,  that I have been on the floor doing this--third time--more time than I  have done on immigration, more time than I have done on any other  bills, bills that could actually get signed into law.  [[Page H5856]]    As my whip said a few moments ago, there are things we could sit down  and find common ground on, but it seems like common ground is gone.   There are some of us willing to reach our hands across the aisle and  say, ``Let's find common ground because people are hurting. Why don't  we solve those?'' Instead, we continue, seemingly, to want to continue  to go to the press release or to the political statement, which is  frustrating. I understand, but we have to get better.   We have to look at this and ask: What happens to the American people?  What happens to the people who sent us here, who are looking at this  and asking what they need to do to make their lives better, not the  lives in this body?   When we understand that, that is when we come together. That is when  we take the decorum of this House. That is when we find ways to speak  to each other as friends who have been elected to serve a common  purpose. That is our higher aim. When we denigrate that, we are not  being honest with ourselves.   Let's get to the people's business. There are budget issues looming.  There are caps looming. There is a debt ceiling looming. There are  still problems at our border, which is a crisis. These need to be  fixed.   Let's take up those bills. Let's have honest debate. I will put a  bill up; you put a bill up. Let's do what we are supposed to do here,  have markups, run things through committee. Let's take seriously what  we said to do.   We both, at times, as parties, have been guilty of not doing that.  Let's focus now--at least where we are now--and say this is not the way  forward and this is not where we need to be because of the many  problems inherent in the resolution itself but, also, the way it was  brought to us. We have seen that play out on the floor today.   Is that really how we are going to leave it with the American people,  that rules can be broken and then nothing is done about it? Is that  really where we are going to be, that we are not going to bring issues  to the floor that can be discussed, that have been brought through  committee, that actually affect people's lives?   That is the frustration I have, Madam Speaker.   Time for debate on this needs to be done. We need to vote ``no.'' We  need to move forward.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
