 Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a bipartisan  amendment to protect our coast in Louisiana.   I am proud to be joined by my fellow Louisianians in offering it  today. They are joining me because this amendment reflects one of the  most important tasks our State faces: restoring our coast.   Put simply, if we don't restore our coast, none of the other work  that we do really matters. Our coast is singularly important to our  culture, our food, our industry, and our way of life.   We lose a significant amount of our coast to coastal erosion. We know  that our fisheries and our fishermen depend on a robust coast. We know  that by protecting it, we protect our economy and we protect those  things that are critically important to the State of Louisiana.   Our coast is not only an economic powerhouse and an environmental  treasure, it is also physical safety of our neighbors, our  neighborhoods, and our visitors.   This amendment would make sure that we have the funding to continue  using dredged materials to rebuild our coast.   This beneficial use is one of the keys to creating our new wetlands  and is a large part of our all-out effort to restore our coast by  rebuilding and shoring up our coast.   I am proud to sponsor this funding, proud to have bipartisan support  for it, and proud to ask that all Members join us in passing this  incredible measure that is so important to Louisiana. This is not  Republican nor Democrat, but it is good government. It is  environmentally sound, it is good for Louisiana, and it is good for  business.
