 Mr. President, today I would like to recognize the  life of an extraordinary individual, Dr. Woodie Flowers.   As an engineer, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of  Technology--MIT--and an integral part of FIRST--For Inspiration and  Recognition of Science and Technology--Woodie helped educate and  inspire people in New Hampshire, across the country, and around the  world.   I first had the privilege of meeting Woodie in the 1980s when I was  doing legal work for MIT. Almost immediately, I recognized his  curiosity and eagerness to learn, his patience and understanding, and  his desire to collaborate and work effectively. Woodie extended that  ethos and enthusiasm for education to every aspect of his life,  including through his groundbreaking leadership at MIT and FIRST.   Throughout his career, Woodie brought a unique vision to his work  [[Page S6887]]  and frequently stressed that technology is changing at a pace that the  human brain simply cannot keep up with. This understanding and concern  led him to emphasize the importance of teaching critical thinking and  an allegiance to objective truth, which he posited would push back  against the tribalism and binary thinking afflicting our society.   As part of his efforts to bridge division and expand human  understanding, Woodie served as a mentor to countless students. While  following Woodie in a speaking program was certainly a daunting task, I  always looked forward to hearing his perspective at FIRST events. The  major theme that Woodie sought to impart to students is that life is  not a zero sum game. He would encourage them to work and compete with  ``gracious professionalism,'' where you work hard and challenge one  another to be your very best, but you always engage with respect and  kindness. FIRST encourages its participants to consider the annual  contest as ``coopertition,'' and Woodie used the opportunity to  interact with the students and coaches as a way to reinforce this  critical concept, that success comes through bringing out the best in  each other and in humanity.   Woodie understood what a good leader should be, and his vision and  example are characteristics that all Americans should aspire to. And in  many ways, his confidence in our ability as human beings to solve  problems and transcend our most basic tribal instincts, informed by  science and grace, was uniquely American.   Dr. Woodie Flowers was one of the most brilliant, kind, and creative  people I have ever met, and it was an honor to know him. I extend my  condolences to Woodie's talented and magnificent wife and partner,  Margaret, and their entire family. And I join them and the FIRST  community in mourning an extraordinarily intelligent inventor,  humanist, and American.   We will miss Woodie more than I can say, but I am certain that his  legacy will live on through the countless lives he has touched. The  world is a smarter, better, and more hopeful place because Woodie  Flowers lived his life with love and purpose.                            ____________________
