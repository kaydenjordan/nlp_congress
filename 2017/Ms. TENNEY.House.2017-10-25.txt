 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Life Is Washable,  an organization that provides comfort and support to individuals  suffering from sensory processing disorders.   Locally, through their partnership with the Jim and Juli Boeheim  Foundation, Life Is Washable provides friendly access sensory safety  kits at sporting events and concerts across the region.   Often, guests suffering from a sensory disorder or a medical  condition that impacts the senses, including autism or dementia, find  it difficult to enjoy loud, brightly lit events.   The tools in these kits range from earmuffs to antiglare glasses, and  help ensure that those with sensory needs can enjoy a sporting event or  concert comfortably without the usual burdens they experience. This  innovative approach has helped improve the quality of these events for  those with sensory disorders across the country.   So far, several major venues in New York have begun using these kits,  including the Veterans Memorial Arena in Binghamton and the Carrier  Dome in Syracuse.   We are grateful to Life Is Washable for the important steps their  staff has taken locally to reduce the burdens on those suffering from a  sensory processing disorder.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I am grateful to Congressman Zeldin.  Obviously, we, from New York, all are so proud for his service as an  Iraq veteran, and also for his leadership in serving both in the State  Senate and also representing our great State in the House of  Representatives on this very important issue.   Mr. Speaker, on October 13, President Trump made the informed  decision to decertify the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, the  JCPOA--or I am going to refer to it as the Iran nuclear deal--and to  develop, for the first time, a holistic strategy to address the Iranian  menace. I applaud this sound choice, which prioritizes the safety and  security of our citizens and the American homeland.   Predictably, the flawed deal with Iran has done nothing to stem that  rogue nation's aggression and misbehavior domestically, in the Middle  East, and throughout the globe. Quite to the contrary, by front-loading  the benefits to Iran, the Iran nuclear deal is funding these  destabilizing and dangerous activities.   Human rights abuses continue against the Iranian people as citizens  who dare to speak out against the oppressive regime face imprisonment  or abuse. Supporters of the Iran nuclear deal told the American people  that this deal would lead to a more open Iran, with a renewed  acceptance of diverse voices and opinions from within.                                time  1915    Mr. Speaker and my colleagues, there have been already over 450  executions in Iran this year alone. Obviously, the so-called moderates  within the regime with whom we negotiated the Iran nuclear deal either  aren't as moderate as we thought or are simply irrelevant in this  regime.   The American people were told further that the Iran nuclear deal  would bring Iran into the fold and make the nation a more productive,  contributing member of the international community.   Sadly, but not surprisingly, Iran's transgressions in the region  continue to be appalling. The Iranian regime is expanding its malicious  network of control through increased financial and military support for  terrorist organizations, including Hezbollah and Hamas.   In Syria, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps has provided fighters  and expertise to the brutal Assad regime that gases and brutalizes its  own citizens. Iran has shown no signs that it is interested in pursuing  peace or even curbing its malevolent behaviors. Chants of ``death to  America and ``death to Israel'' continue as Iran rapidly develops its  missile program and engages in proxy conflicts with the U.S. and our  allies.   I thank the President and my colleagues, as I indicated, especially  Congressman Lee Zeldin from New York, for continuing to shine the light  on this important national security issue.
