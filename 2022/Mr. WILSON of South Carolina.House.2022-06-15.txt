 Mr. Speaker, yet again, the world is  uniting against war criminal Putin and his murderous invasion of  Ukraine.   The European Union is set to sign an agreement with Israel and Egypt  which will free itself from Putin energy reliance. EU leaders say they  will reduce Russian oil and gas imports, cutting financial resources to  the Putin war machine where young Russians are sacrificed by Putin for  personal gain of oil, money and power, while conducting mass murder in  Ukraine.   In the plan, Israel will export natural gas in a pipeline to Egypt  where it will be turned into liquified natural gas, then delivered to  EU member states. I appreciate the service of Egyptian Ambassador to  the U.S. Motaz Zahran.   During a trip to Israel this week, European Commission President  Ursula von der Leyen said, The Kremlin's behavior only strengthens our  resolve to break free of Russian fossil fuels.   In conclusion, God bless our troops who successfully protected  America for 20 years in the global war on terrorism as it continues to  move from the safe haven of Afghanistan to America.   As the co-chair of the EU Caucus and the Israel Caucus, I especially  appreciate the cooperation we see today.                            ____________________
