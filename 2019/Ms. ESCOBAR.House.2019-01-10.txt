 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to proudly deliver my first  floor speech as the new Representative for Texas' 16th Congressional  District.   Born and raised in El Paso, Texas, a resilient, beautiful community  along the U.S.-Mexico border, I am a proud fronteriza and know  firsthand the realities of the border.   That is why I have been profoundly disturbed by the rhetoric and  policies  [[Page H370]]  from this administration. I will use my time to tell you the truth  about the border, the opportunity she represents, and the need for  comprehensive immigration reform.   El Paso, like other border communities, is one of the safest  communities in the country, with a rich history made strong by our  bicultural, binational character. Our people are generous,  compassionate, and kind.   We share a border with our sister city, Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua,  Mexico. This border unites our families and our values, and it promotes  commerce and trade. The border has never been safer or more secure.   El Paso already has a wall, but we were safe long before it was  constructed. The truth is that additional border barriers will not  address the real challenges that we face. Instead, I hope to work with  my colleagues in this Congress to achieve comprehensive immigration  reform, address the root causes of migration, and value immigrants as  critical to building our economy and our country.   According to the Pew Research Center, there were an estimated 10.7  million undocumented immigrants living in the United States in 2016.  Some came when they were small children, seeking refuge in our country,  and, today, have limited protection under the Deferred Action for  Childhood Arrivals program. Others have been here for decades under  temporary protected status, establishing businesses and cultivating  deep roots in communities across the Nation.   It is unsafe for them to return home because of ongoing strife in  their home countries, but this administration decided to terminate  protections for them anyway. The majority of others live in the  shadows, afraid to avail themselves to assistance because of our  current immigration climate.   Life for immigrants and asylum-seeking families, unfortunately, has  gotten increasingly worse since January 20, 2017. This administration  has cruelly separated a reported 2,654 families at the border, and  these are only the families that we know of.   It has built tent prisons for children; teargassed immigrants near  ports of entry, including many women and children; criminalized  migration and prioritized detention; and attempted to drastically  curtail the number of immigrants coming into our country.   Further, this administration's unlawful asylum ban on migrants who do  not enter at ports of entry has strained our border crossings. Due to  metering at ports, a practice that limits the number of people who may  enter the U.S. each day, families are sometimes pushed out to more  dangerous and deadly crossings.   I hope we will investigate whether metering contributed to the tragic  deaths of two young Guatemalan children, Jakelin Caal Maquin and Felipe  Alonzo-Gomez. These policies and practices are inhumane and un- American.   Building walls and sowing hate divide us as a nation. Instead, we  must focus on reforming our immigration system to ensure a safe and  humane process.   For example, we must create a pathway to citizenship for DACA and TPS  recipients; make investments in additional personnel and infrastructure  at our ports of entry where most illegal drugs flow; hire more  immigration judges and grant them Article I independence in order to  address the backlog of cases and ensure due process; overhaul training  for CBP and ICE agents that will boost safety and increase oversight,  transparency, and accountability; and end the criminalization of  migration, especially that of asylum-seeking families.   Above all, families belong together and should not be detained,  especially when there are cost-effective, humane alternatives.   Finally, for any of my colleagues who think that the border is  unsafe, I invite you to my district to see it for yourself.                            ____________________
