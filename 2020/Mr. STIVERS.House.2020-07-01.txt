 Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Graves for yielding  me the time.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this en bloc amendment.   There is a lot of bipartisan support for an infrastructure bill, so  it is a shame that today we are considering a political messaging bill  that is dead on arrival in the Senate.   Part of the reason this legislation will fail is that it is a wish  list for progressive priorities, many of which are outside the scope of  what Americans consider to be addressing real and immediate  transportation needs.                                time  1130    The bill was drafted without any bipartisan input. As the ranking  member on the Housing, Community Development and Insurance  Subcommittee, I believe that housing and infrastructure are important  enough to merit their own debates.   While there are a few good ideas in this amendment, there are also a  few bad ones. The underlying bill spends about $100 billion on housing  programs. That is done without any debate in the House on the House  floor other than this 15-minute debate. In fact, we haven't done much  debate in the Financial Services Committee. Housing needs deserve their  own debate. They deserve their own time.   The majority would be wise to do hard work and bring truly bipartisan  housing-specific bills to the floor. Instead they have chosen to  package housing priorities with transportation priorities, which are  both important, but it makes it less likely that either one of these  will ultimately become law and be addressed.   Very quickly I will speak to one amendment that, in particular, I  think merits more discussion than it will receive today, and it would  eliminate the Faircloth Amendment. That was an amendment that passed  during the Clinton era that capped the number of housing projects. Bill  Clinton signed that into law. I think it is really telling that we are  going to undo it without any real debate. That was passed in 1998. That  was a consensus change that moved us away from constructing new public  housing units after decades of examples, including the infamous  Cabrini-Green Homes in Chicago showing the idea that concentrating low- income Americans in inner cities did not reduce poverty, and it did  increase crime.   Even more so, it was another Democrat President, Barack Obama, who  created an innovative and highly successful Rental Assistance  Demonstration project. We had a hearing in the Financial Services  Subcommittee on Housing, Community Development and Insurance earlier  this year on housing, and a lot of people from the public housing  sector talked about how successful the Rental Assistance Demonstration  project was at getting private capital to public housing units. It  converts them into new, modern, privately owned, project-based section  8 properties. In fact, thanks to RAD and other modernizations, notable  housing authorities like San Francisco and Atlanta no longer have any  units of public housing, and they have experienced remarkable  turnarounds in terms of crime rates and reduced poverty levels.   RAD is a truly bipartisan success story. It has raised $12.6 billion  in private funding to convert 100,000 units of public housing to  private-market housing, and it rehabilitated troubled properties  creating better outcomes for the residents.   All of this has been achieved without Congress' providing billions of  dollars of funding. It has been private money that has funded the RAD  program.   Instead of looking to RAD and other modernizations for our housing  infrastructure, this bill instead focuses on going backwards to a time  of failed housing policies at the very moment when, frankly, we need to  be looking at 21st century infrastructure.   It just doesn't make sense that the only way the majority can justify  doing it would be to slip an idea like this, with 25 en bloc Democratic  amendments, into a partisan 2,300-page bill. That just doesn't make  sense. We should have a separate debate about housing policy. I believe  there are a lot of things we could come together on.   Again, the RAD program was started under Secretary Donovan and  President Obama. It was a Democratic program that has been very, very  successful, and it has been lauded by Republicans and Democrats alike.   I don't think we should be setting unrelated policy in a 2,300-page  bill with an en bloc amendment like this. I wish that we had taken a  different road.   I, unfortunately, have to oppose this en bloc amendment. But I am  hopeful that we can come together and have a focused debate about the  future of Federal housing policy, and I believe that we can come  together as Republicans and Democrats to find a solution.
