 Madam Speaker, I rise today to pay respects to a hero  and a warrior. William Tully Brown, one of the last surviving Navajo  code talkers, passed away earlier this month at the age of 96.   The code talkers were a group of brave soldiers who used their native  tongue to create unbreakable codes in the battlefield and to transmit  messages during World War II. They participated in every major Marine  operation in the Pacific Theater, saving hundreds of thousands of  lives.   I was saddened to hear of the passing of another decorated hero from  this important group.   William was born in Black Mountain, Arizona, in 1922, and enlisted in  the Marine Corps in 1944. During his service, he received many military  honors, including the American Campaign Medal and the Asiatic-Pacific  Campaign Medal.   We must never forget William Tully Brown and all code talkers for  their service to our country and our veterans' service to their  country.                            ____________________
