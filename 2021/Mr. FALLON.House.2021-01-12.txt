 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak against this  resolution. I am at a loss.   I can't believe the very first time that I have the honor and  privilege to address this august Chamber is to talk about removing the  President of the United States because he held a permitted, legal, and  peaceful rally.   It is nothing but a wasteful political grandstand. Let's make no  mistake: January 6 was a dark day in our esteemed Nation's history. It  was a dark and sad day.   On the afternoon of January 6, a mob breached our sacred Capitol.  Donald Trump didn't. A mob destroyed property and vandalized historic  treasures and ran amuck on these grounds, but Donald Trump didn't.   A mob committed despicable, evil actions of violence against fellow  Americans, but Donald Trump didn't. In fact, Donald Trump urged and, in  fact, he demanded peaceful dissent and nothing more. Our colleagues on  the other side of the aisle want us to unnecessarily remove a President  when we are measuring the time he has left, not in years, months,  weeks, or days--he has got 182 hours left in office.   You don't achieve unity by simply saying it. You achieve unity  through actions. This resolution accomplishes not unity but, rather, is  a waste of time, and fosters further divisiveness. I am going to vote  ``no'' on this resolution.
