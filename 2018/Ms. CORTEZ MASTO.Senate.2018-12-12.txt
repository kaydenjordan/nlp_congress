 Mr. President, I come forward today to  recognize the service of Lori Sutliff who, after 10 years as a member  of the board of directors of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting,  will be ending her service at the end of this year.   Ms. Sutliff began her career in broadcasting in 1983. Working under  the broadcast name ``Lori Gilbert,'' she has specialized in providing  broadcast news to rural areas, serving most recently as the news  director for Elko Broadcasting Company's KELK-AM and KLKO-FM in the  rural community of Elko, NV. She also hosts a community news program,  Elko Live, which provides listeners throughout northeastern Nevada with  news about local, regional, and national issues.   In 2008, Ms. Gilbert was appointed to the CPB board of directors by  President George W. Bush. President Barack Obama reappointed her, and  she was confirmed by the Senate in 2013. She served as board chair from  September 2016 to October 2018 and vice chair from September 2014 to  September 2016.   She helped lead the Corporation through multiple challenges, such as  the FCC's Broadcast Spectrum Auction and repack process. Lori has also  been instrumental in helping develop new ways for public media stations  to collaborate, and, over the last 5 years, CPB has launched 13 new  regional journalism collaborations, creating 90 newsroom positions.   In addition to this work, Gilbert is member of the board of directors  of the Associated Press Television and Radio Association of California  and Nevada. She serves the rural Nevada community as a founding member  of the Elko Cancer Network and the Great Basin College Health Sciences  Advisory Board. She has also served on the boards of the Elko County  Family Resource Center, the Boys and Girls Club of Elko, and the Elko  County Juvenile Advisory Board.   Through all of this incredible work and service, she has gained an  intimate understanding of the issues of rural America and how vital it  is for rural residents to have a trusted source of information about  their community. Ms. Gilbert speaks in journalism schools across the  Nation and has consistently demonstrated her commitment to providing  meaningful public media offerings to all Americans, regardless of where  they live or their economic means.   Today I celebrate the many contributions of Lori Gilbert in all of  her service. We are fortunate to have had her leadership, knowledge,  and voice during her service to both Nevada and the Nation as a  whole.                            ____________________
