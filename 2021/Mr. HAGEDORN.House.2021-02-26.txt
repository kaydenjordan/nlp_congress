 Mr. Speaker, the CARES Act allowed farmers and ranchers  to apply for the Paycheck Protection Program by utilizing only net  income in their loan calculations. This has prevented many agricultural  partnerships from receiving the maximum loan amount possible.   My bipartisan bill that I have introduced today, the PPP Flexibility  for Farmers and Ranchers Act, allows the use of gross income to  calculate the loan and includes a retroactive provision to enable farm  partnerships that initially used net income to recalculate unforgiven  PPP loans.   Ag producers throughout the Nation have suffered greatly from  historic drops in demand during the pandemic. As we push to reopen our  economy, we must ensure that our farmers and ranchers have access to  the resources needed to maintain operations through the end of the  pandemic.   I am grateful to my colleagues and an array of national agricultural  groups who join me in this commonsense effort to boost our farmers,  ranchers, and agricultural economy.   I encourage Members to cosponsor my bill.                            ____________________
