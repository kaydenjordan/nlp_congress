 Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I  rise in support of this amendment to H.R. 1.   I speak today as someone who has spent my career in public service  identifying foreign threats to the safety and security of the American  people. As a former CIA officer, I worked to identify threats to our  country, our fellow Americans, and threats that would leave our Nation  vulnerable to attack, espionage, or foreign influence.   As Congress acts this week to restore transparency to our government  and regain trust from the people we serve, we must take steps to  prevent foreign influence in our democratic process. I support efforts  to push back against the very real threat of foreign financial  influence. I know nefarious actors are out there. I know they are  tireless in their commitment to target our foundational institutions,  including our voting process.   The American people shouldn't have to worry about the ability of  foreign governments or entities to influence our elections and our  citizens, but senseless loopholes in our campaign finance system have  left our electoral process vulnerable to spending by foreign  governments, corporations, and foreign nationals. These foreign  entities should not have the ability to exert influence over the issues  that impact Americans most, including the national defense, healthcare,  and our financial services sector. That is why I am proud to cosponsor  this much-needed, bipartisan amendment.   This amendment would strengthen the integrity of our elections by  encouraging our government to ensure  [[Page H2480]]  that our campaign finance system is not falling prey to signs of  foreign money in our politics. It would require the FEC to conduct an  audit to look for foreign money in our elections and then require the  FEC to report its findings.
