 Mr. Speaker, equal justice under the law  is a cornerstone of our American democracy. At home in Pennsylvania and  around our country, our communities are blessed with dedicated law  enforcement officers who work daily to protect and to serve. During  National Police Week, the American people honor and thank the law  enforcement officers who keep us safe each and every day.   While no organization is perfect, our local police work hard to  uphold the law and maintain peace in our communities. As Chambersburg  Police Chief Ron Camacho told me just this week, good police forces are  centered on protecting and learning how to protect better. He said that  good police forces are constantly evolving and improving.   I wholeheartedly agree with my friend, the chief of police in  Chambersburg, and Congress must do our part to support these heroes.  Instead of talking about defunding the police, we should be working to  better train and equip law enforcement officers to do the job that we  have entrusted them to do.   As we move forward, the American people know that Republicans are  leading commonsense, bipartisan solutions. For over a year, Senator Tim  Scott and Congressman Pete Stauber have led our efforts to improve  transparency, accountability, and training. Rather than defund or  dismantle the police, the Justice Act will enact bipartisan reforms to  better equip these brave Americans who serve our communities. I was  proud to cosponsor that legislation, and I encourage my colleagues on  all sides of the political spectrum to join us in this commonsense  approach.   Democrats say that they want to work together on police reform. Now  is the chance. Getting this right today is critical for the future of  policing in our Nation. We cannot allow the radical left to erode trust  in the justice system and degrade the good name of the public servants  for the sake of their own woke agenda. Right now, our law enforcement  community is facing unprecedented attacks. Every day, the left  threatens to abandon these heroes who protect us.   Chief Camacho leads an exemplary police force in Franklin County,  Pennsylvania. He and the vast majority of the law enforcement community  go above and beyond to protect our communities.   As a nation, we must never turn our backs on the police. We must  never defund the police. During National Police Week and throughout  this year, it is my privilege to stand with the thin blue line, and I  will always back the blue.
