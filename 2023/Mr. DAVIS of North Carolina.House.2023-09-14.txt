 Mr. Speaker, I rise today because I have  spoken to farmers in my district and I have heard from many across the  country. No matter where I go or who I speak with, there is a common  topic on everyone's mind and that is labor.   The changes coming down from the Department of Labor are causing a  scramble, and many are left scratching their heads, trying to figure  out what is going on and, above all, if they can afford to continue  operating their farms.   Mr. Speaker, it would be great to hear from someone, anyone, to share  their thoughts, to share the rationale and to explain the timing.   It is unacceptable for individuals with contracts to feel at their  wit's end. It is unacceptable for individuals with contracts to believe  they are being pushed to the brink and to hear nothing.   Many believe wage enforcement officers may target them if they ask  too many questions, ask what is going on, or speak up.   Mr. Speaker, this must be addressed. All people are asking for is  information. They want transparency. They want to know what is going  on. They want respect.                            ____________________
