 Mr. President, the Louisville Metro Police  Department fields some of the finest officers this Nation has to offer.  Nothing could be more true of Officers Noah Cole and Nick Greene. On  the evening of Monday, June 27, 2022, Officers Cole and Greene were  starting their evening shift like any other night.   They stopped at Shorty's Food Mart on 18th Street and Broadway in the  Russell neighborhood of West Louisville when they were alerted by an  alarmed father. The gentleman told the officers that his daughter  needed their help. The officers overcame a language barrier with the  father and responded immediately to his plea.   They exited Shorty's and ran to the infant, who was in her mother's  arms. Officer Greene quickly assessed the situation and determined that  the infant was unconscious from choking. He administered back blows to  the infant until the blockage was cleared. Simultaneously, Officer Cole  contacted fire and EMS support to aid in the care of the infant. EMS  personnel arrived on the scene and were able to further care for the  infant and calm the parents.   The actions of these two officers directly saved the life of our most  vulnerable citizen and stopped the worst-case scenario for any parent:  burying their child. Officer Cole and Greene are servant leaders, an  asset to the residents of Louisville, and a testament to the Louisville  Metro Police Department. I am proud to salute officers Noah Cole, Nick  Greene, and the entire Louisville Metro Police Department on a job well  done.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to honor the courageous  actions of a brave and heroic senior member of the Louisville Fire  Department. On February 3, 2022, Captain Kody Jones, a 17-year veteran  of the department, went above and beyond the call of duty to save the  lives of four people: three adults and one small child.   Around 2 pm, a fire was reported at a home in the 100 block of  Stevenson Avenue. Without hesitation, Captain Jones, who was on his way  to work, responded to the scene. Once at the residence, Captain Jones  safely rescued the four individuals without injury to them or to  himself.   Captain Jones then instructed emergency dispatchers on essential  details concerning the fire. Using his 17 years of experience, Captain  Jones was able to direct responding units to the best position and  angle of attack to fight the blaze. He also relayed the fire's size and  position and the building's material composition. These details were  instrumental in firefighters being able to stop the fire within 1 hour  of being on the scene. Following these heroic actions, Captain Jones  reported to the fire station to continue to serve on his assigned  shift.   Captain Jones' actions that day were critical in saving four lives,  minimizing structural damage, and containing the blaze. I salute  Captain  [[Page S3237]]  Jones for his actions that day and his selfless service to his  Louisville and the Commonwealth of Kentucky.                            ____________________
