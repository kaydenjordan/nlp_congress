 Madam President, in just a few minutes, we will vote on  whether to move forward on Senator Scott's policing reform bill.   We are at a turning point in our Nation's history--a moment when  Americans of every background and political persuasion are united in a  call for change. We have a chance to give it to them. Over the course  of the next couple of weeks, we will have a chance to pass legislation  that will permanently reform policing in this country--legislation that  will improve training, increase accountability, and give increased  security to families who worry that their sons or daughters could be  the next George Floyd or Breonna Taylor. Senator Scott's legislation,  the Just and Unifying Solutions to Invigorate Communities Everywhere  Act, or the JUSTICE Act, is a product of years of serious work. It is  an extensive bill that focuses on a number of areas that call for  reform.   Make no mistake about it. When the Democrats vote today, if they do-- and, I hope, there will be enough of them  [[Page S3166]]  who will not, so as to allow this legislation to move forward--they  will be voting to block police reform legislation, because that is what  this is. This is not Senator McConnell's bill. The Democratic leader  kept attacking Senator McConnell and the McConnell legislation. This is  a Tim Scott bill, crafted with input from other Senators, with input  from communities of color from across this country, and with input from  the law enforcement community--people who care deeply about not just  talking about this issue but about actually solving this issue, people  who care about action. The Democratic objection and vote to block this  legislation from moving forward will prevent an open debate in front of  the entire American public about an issue that has generated a  tremendous amount of controversy, not only currently but throughout our  Nation's history.   We cannot change our past--there are parts of it that we are not  proud of--but we can change our future, and that could start today with  this vote to get on this bill and then to have an open process.   The leader has promised that, if we can get on this bill, we will  have an amendment process. If there are things in the bill that people  on either side of the aisle think can be improved on, they will have an  opportunity to offer amendments to make those improvements. Yet, by not  even getting on the bill, they will be saying to the American people  that we don't care about your having a voice in this process or being  able to see what your elected leaders are actually doing to resolve  this problem in our country.   That is what this would do. It would open it up. It would allow a  piece of legislation to be brought to the floor; allow for a motion to  proceed to get on it; allow us to open up the amendment process and to  have a freewheeling, fulsome debate about each and every one of the  issues that is involved in this legislation.   They have said that this doesn't go far enough, that it doesn't do  this or that it doesn't do that. Sure, that is true. Perhaps, it  doesn't, but it gets about 75 percent of the way there. If you look at  the contents and the substance of this bill, it represents a lot of  what both sides have been talking about. There are a lot of  recommendations in it that have come forward from people across this  country who have been directly impacted, none more so than Senator  Scott. I can tell you Senator Scott doesn't view this as a messaging  exercise. He views this as something that is deeply personal to him.  Unfortunately, he has experienced the pain of racism, not only as a  young boy, growing up in the South, but as an adult and as a U.S.  Senator. He wants a solution, and we should all want a solution, but  that starts by getting on the bill and debating it in the open, in the  light of day.   The Democratic leader talks about: Why can't we go back behind closed  doors and negotiate this? Look, we have a piece of legislation that  represents 75 percent of what the Democrats say they want, and we can  finish the other 25 percent. Maybe we will not get to 100 percent.  Nobody ever, usually, gets 100 percent of what one wants around here.  Yet simply having a debate, allowing an open amendment process, and  allowing the will of the U.S. Senate to be heard is all this is about.  This isn't about the final bill. This isn't about the final contents.  This is about whether or not this body--100 U.S. Senators--has listened  enough to what is going on around this country to say: We want to have  this debate. We want to get on this bill, and we want to have it in  public, in the light of day, in front of the American people, not  behind closed doors--an open debate, a fulsome debate, in which  amendments can be offered and in which the American people can observe  and see it. That is what this vote today is about.   Now, the Democrats will say that, if you allow us to get on the bill,  then they will have no control over what will happen after that. Well,  actually, they will, because it is not just a 60-vote threshold to get  on the bill; it is a 60-vote threshold to get off the bill. So, if you  want to stop this somewhere--anywhere in the process--you will have the  opportunity to do that because it will take 60 votes to move it forward  and to ultimately pass it, not just to get on it.   It takes 60 votes--a supermajority here in the U.S. Senate. I think  it is fair to say that, historically, the way the Senate has worked on  major pieces of legislation is it ends up being bipartisan because of  the 60-vote threshold. There hasn't been a time since the popular  election of Senators, at least on the Republican side, when we have had  more than 55 votes in the U.S. Senate. The Democrats have had 60 a few  times throughout history, but the Republicans have never had more than  55. So we know it is going to take a bipartisan solution, and we know  that the Democrats' voice matters. We know that, in the end, if you are  going to have a bipartisan product, you are going to have to have input  from both sides   That is what this is about. It is about getting on the bill that has  been advanced and put forward by an individual, Tim Scott--it is a Tim  Scott bill--again, with input from others. It is not a McConnell bill.  It is a Tim Scott bill. He is someone who has personally experienced  and felt the very frustration and anger that is being voiced by the  American people across the country. He wants a solution. He doesn't  want a messaging bill. We want a solution.   Let me just tell you quickly about a few of the things that are in  this bill, which I think suggest that it would be really important to  get on it and to, at least, have a debate.   One of the most important sections of the bill is the George Floyd  and Walter Scott Notification Act, which would correct deficiencies in  law enforcement's reporting of use-of-force incidents. Right now, the  FBI's National Use-of-Force Data Collection only receives data on about  40 percent of law enforcement officers--40 percent. That needs to  change. The only way we can understand the scope of the problems we are  facing is to have full and accurate data--a complete data picture--that  will allow us to pinpoint problems, identify troubled police  departments, and develop best practices for use-of-force and  deescalation training.   There are many police departments across the Nation that are doing an  excellent job of policing and that are keenly interested in becoming  still better. I recently met with law enforcement leaders back in my  home State of South Dakota. Among other things, they have been  participating in listening sessions with the community since George  Floyd's death, and they are supportive of new measures that will help  to ensure that every officer does his or her job in the best possible  way. Yet, while there are a lot of excellent police departments out  there, there are also troubled departments--departments that fail to  train their officers properly and that overlook officer misbehavior. We  need to identify those departments and demand their reform. Collecting  full and accurate data on use-of-force incidents will help us to do  just that.   Another important section of the JUSTICE Act focuses on police  deescalation and duty-to-intervene training. Sometimes police end up  using force in situations in which force could have been avoided simply  because they lack the necessary training to deescalate a situation  without the use of force. It may be understandable that well-meaning  but overwhelmed police officers who are in dangerous circumstances will  sometimes resort to the use of force too quickly, but that is not a  situation that we can accept. Every police officer in this country  should be given the kind of training that will ensure that the use of  force is restricted only to those situations in which it is absolutely  needed.   Another key area of the bill--one that is absolutely essential to  getting bad cops off the streets--deals with law enforcement records  retention. Too often, law enforcement officers with problematic  records, like multiple excessive use-of-force complaints, manage to  transfer to new jurisdictions because the hiring police departments  never see their full records. That is a problem. Bad cops should not be  able to find new homes in other jurisdictions. We can prevent that from  happening by ensuring that every police department is able to access  the full disciplinary record of any officer it is looking to hire.   The JUSTICE Act would help to make sure these records are readily  available by requiring police departments to keep officers' records for  at  [[Page S3167]]  least 30 years. It would also require any police department that hires  a new officer to obtain a full employment and disciplinary record for  that officer from all of his previous departments.   There are a lot of other important measures in the JUSTICE Act, from  the funding of body cameras to expanding minority hiring, to developing  best policing practices. With this legislation, we have a real chance  of improving policing in this country and of ensuring that every  officer is held to the highest standards.   Our ability to do that is going to depend on one thing, and that is  the willingness of the Democrats to come to the table. It was  disheartening to see the Democrats dismiss Senator Scott's bill before  it had even been released, especially because, as I said, many of the  proposals in the bill have been taken directly from earlier bipartisan  bills. The word, of course, today, is that they are planning to block  the bill without even allowing it to be considered on the floor.   The Democrats have spent a lot of time talking about police reform,  but if they want to actually achieve reform and not just talk about it,  they are going to have to decide to move beyond politics. Senator  Scott's bill is a serious, wide-ranging bill. It is a commonsense bill.  It is a bill that all of us, whichever our party, should be willing to  agree on.   As I said, the Democrats have changes they would like to make, and  the leader has made it clear there will be an opportunity for  amendments. But to refuse even to allow debate on this bill suggests  the Democrats are more interested in attempting to score political  points on this issue rather than to actually do anything about reform.  I hope that what we are hearing about the Democrats' plans to block  this bill is wrong. I hope--I really, sincerely, hope--that we are  going to see the Democrats--some courageous ones--come to the table and  vote to move forward with debate on this legislation.   We have a chance to do something important here--a historic chance.  With the JUSTICE Act, we can permanently improve policing in this  country and bring real hope to those who have lost faith in law  enforcement, but we are going to have to stand together to get this  done. I urge my colleagues to vote, in a few minutes, to move forward  on the JUSTICE Act and start the process of reform.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.
