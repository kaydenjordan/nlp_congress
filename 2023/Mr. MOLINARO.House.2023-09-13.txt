 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize September as  National Suicide Prevention Month.   The mental health of our Nation and mental health crisis remains the  greatest public health crisis of our lifetime. In 2022 alone, we lost  50,000 Americans to death by suicide.   Among younger populations, that statistic is even more alarming.  Suicide is the second leading cause of death among people aged 10 to  14, and the third leading cause of death among people aged 15 to 24.   No community, no family, no neighborhood is immune, and addressing  this crisis requires bold and persistent bipartisan efforts from  Congress, State, and local leaders.   We have made great strides in increasing access by rolling out the  988 National Suicide Prevention Lifeline and making other investments  in mental health programs. However, there is significantly more to be  done.   We have to continue to raise awareness, reduce the stigma, address  and ensure anyone who needs help is able to get the treatment and the  care they deserve, regardless of neighborhood, ZIP Code, or community.   Mr. Speaker, this is the public health crisis of our lifetime, and we  must rise to the challenge.                            ____________________
