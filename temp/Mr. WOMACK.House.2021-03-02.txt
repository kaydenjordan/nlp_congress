 Madam Speaker, I thank the ranking member for the  opportunity to speak.   Madam Speaker, you don't need to identify as a Republican or a  Democrat to want free and fair elections. Frankly, ask any American and  I am pretty sure they will agree that the cornerstone to any legitimate  democracy is the ability to freely choose their leaders.   I am also pretty sure that they will agree that money has a way of  corrupting just about anything--including elections; which is why I  shake my head at the language in this bill that provides a 6-to-1 match  for donations up to $200. Last Congress, they tried to do it with  taxpayer money. That didn't go over so well, so now they try again;  this time, with some crazy shell game to accomplish the same result.   I also believe that most Americans will agree that the right to vote  is among the most precious we have. It is more important than getting  on an airline. It is more important than buying an adult beverage. It  is more important than cashing a paycheck at your local bank.   Why we would weaken our ability to prove certain the identities of  people voting in our elections is a mystery to me.   Trying to convince us that H.R. 1 is for the people is like saying,  You are with the Federal Government and you are here to help us.   No, thank you.
