 Mr. Speaker, the Democrats refuse to open the  government. They won't provide more than a dollar. The Speaker said she  would give a dollar for a border barrier. That is outrageous.   How many people in this body have walls around their homes and live  in gated communities. How many people in this body at night check to  make sure their door is locked, not because a burglar can't get around  it, but because they love the people in their home and they don't want  burglars having it too easy getting in, even though they could, but it  slows people down. That is what a border barrier does.   And for the little girl that was killed by an illegal alien in my  district and thrown in a well, this is not a charade. This is life or  death for many people.   Let's put a barrier where we need it, and then we can have everybody  getting paid.                            ____________________
