 Mr. Speaker, the William Hughes Technical Center in  south Jersey is the FAA's national scientific test base for R&D, and  the evaluation of transportation systems. It is the Nation's premier  air transportation system laboratory.   I was disappointed to see that the FAA, earlier this year, proposed  funding cuts for critical research programs at the tech center that  ultimately improve the safety of all Americans. That is why I am  grateful to Chairman Price of the Transportation Subcommittee for  working with me to restore funding for the tech center.   I have also heard troubling rumors about a potential realignment at  the tech center. For those who seek to eliminate, shift jobs, or  reporting duties away from the tech center, I say this: You will have a  fight on your hands, like a fight you have never seen before.   I am proud to have this incredible facility in south Jersey, and I  thank all of the hardworking men and women of the tech center for  continuing to keep our skies safe.                            ____________________
