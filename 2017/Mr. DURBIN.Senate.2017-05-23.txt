 Mr. President, I would like to take a few moments to  acknowledge my friend, Mayor Daniel J. McLaughlin of the Village of  Orland Park, in my home State of Illinois. There is no stronger  advocate for the people of Orland Park than Dan McLaughlin. For more  than three decades, he has served his community with distinction.   Dan began his service to Orland Park in 1983 as a village trustee. A  decade later, he was elected mayor and would go on to serve for six  terms. In 1995, Mayor McLaughlin created the Orland Park Open Lands  program, which preserved nearly 300 acres of open space, two family  farms, and created the village's nature center. In the same year, he  completed the Orland Park Veterans Memorial. Each Memorial and Veterans  Day, the village gathers at the memorial, Ara Pace--Place of Peace, at  the Orland Park Village Center--and adds the names of veterans to the  granite wall surrounding the memorial. It is a wonderful tribute that  allows residents of Orland Park to thank those who bravely served our  country.   During his tenure, Mayor McLaughlin also brought the community  together through an increase in village sponsored events and outdoor  concerts. He believed in fitness for fun, and his leadership helped  save the Orland Park Health and Fitness Center, created Centennial Park  West, and expanded the aquatic center, which now includes ice skating,  sledding, a dog park, and bicycle paths.   His governing philosophy was simple, ``plan for people not cars.''  That vision led to a pedestrian-friendly center in the heart of  downtown Orland Park in the historic 143rd train station, where people  can come together to play and work. Throughout his career, Mayor  McLaughlin grew Orland Park's economy by marketing the I-80 corridor,  helping to bring in new businesses while retaining the ones already  thriving in the village.   Mayor McLaughlin has been honored by numerous organizations,  including the American Institute of Architects; Chaddick Institute;  Chicago Magazine; Chicago Southland Convention & Visitors' Bureau;  Congress of New Urbanism; Government Finance Officers Association; Home  Builders Association of Greater Chicago; Illinois Arts Council;  Illinois Association of Chiefs of Police; Metropolitan Mayors Caucus;  Moraine Valley Community College; the Chicago Building Congress; the  United States Conference of Mayors; and the United States Green  Building Council--just to name a few.   I want to thank Mayor McLaughlin for his commitment to the people of  Orland Park. I especially want to thank Dan's wife, Patricia  McLaughlin, and four children--Bridget, Mary Kate, Dan, and Matt--for  sharing so much of their husband and father with the Village of Orland  Park. Now as he moves to the next chapter in his life, I wish him and  his family all the best.                            ____________________     Mr. President, let me say at the outset that I offer my  condolences to the families and friends of those who were killed or  injured in last night's despicable attack at a concert in Manchester,  England. Details are still coming in, but this looks like an act of  terror in the heart of one of our key European allies. America is  joining with the people of Great Britain in expressing our sorrow and  sadness over the loss of these lives and the injuries that were  sustained.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on a separate note, it has been more than  5 months since the intelligence agencies in the United States reached a  solid consensus on a critical issue. The agencies presented to the  American people 5 months ago their damning assessment that Russia  actively tried to interfere in our last Presidential election to help  elect someone they thought would be a better friend to the Russian  interests.   I think it is important to recall some of the key findings by our own  intelligence agencies on a virtually unanimous basis. They said:         Russian efforts to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential       election represent the most recent expression of Moscow's       longstanding desire to undermine the U.S.-led liberal       democratic order, but these activities demonstrate a       significant escalation in directness, level of activity, and       scope of effort compared to previous operations.  [[Page S3101]]         We assess Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an       influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the U.S. presidential       election.    Our intelligence agencies went on to say:         Russia's goals were to undermine public faith in the U.S.       democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her       electability and potential presidency. We further assess that       Putin and the Russian government developed a clear preference       for President-elect Trump.        Moscow will apply lessons learned from its Putin-ordered       campaign aimed at the U.S. presidential election to future       influence efforts worldwide, including against U.S. allies       and their election processes.    We have never seen anything like this in our history--nothing. What  Vladimir Putin did--or tried to do--is staggering, momentous, and  something we should not ignore. A foreign adversary intentionally  manipulating America's democracy and election to try to get a result  friendly to Russia but not consistent with American public opinion-- that was his goal.   The dictionary defines an act of war as ``an act of aggression by a  country against another with which it is nominally at peace.''   Was the Russia attack on our election an act of war? Is sure seems  close to the definition. At a minimum, it was an act of cyber war  against America and an attack on our democracy. It should not go  unanswered. Troublingly, there have been few answers forthcoming from  this President and this Congress.   What did the White House and the majority party in Congress do to  respond to this act of cyber war to protect against any future attacks?  Virtually nothing. As more and more questions have emerged about  possible collusion between the Trump campaign and these Russian actions  against our election, possible Russian money, and the President's  business interests, and troubling ties between those close to Trump and  the Russians, this President has instead been trying to endear himself  to the Russians, incredibly.   That is right. On May 10, he had a closed meeting with the Russian  Foreign Minister and Ambassador in which the President reportedly  boasted about sensitive intelligence and--this is truly incredible-- also boasted about firing our Nation's FBI Director to relieve the  ``great pressure'' on him over the Russia investigation.   In fact, he reportedly told the Russians:         I just fired the head of the FBI. He was crazy, a real nut       job . . . I faced great pressure because of Russia. That's       taken off . . . I'm not under investigation.    That is the end of the attributed quote to the President of the  United States.   Let that sink in for a moment. The President of the United States was  bragging to the same people who attacked our election and democracy  that he had fired the top law enforcement officer investigating that  attack. That is incredible, both for its obvious appearance of  obstruction of justice but also for what should have so obviously been  said in that meeting instead.   President Trump, instead of a frivolous exchange with a dictatorial  regime that attacked our Nation, should have had as his first message  to the Russians the obvious: Do not ever interfere in our elections or  those of our allies again or you will face serious consequences--end of  meeting.   Then the President should have come out and related this conversation  to the American press and to the American people.   Instead, the President let the Russians bring their own official  photographer from the TASS Soviet news agency into the Oval Office  and--get this--excluded all of the American press--just the friendly  Russian cameras. Then, the Russians gleefully sent out victory tweets  of the President's warm and friendly greeting.   This is totally upside down. Yet it only gets worse. Stunningly, it  was just revealed Monday night that President Trump asked two of the  Nation's top intelligence officials in March to help him push back  against the FBI investigation into possible collusion between his  campaign and the Russian Government.   The Washington Post reported that President Trump made separate  appeals to the Director of National Intelligence, Dan Coats, and the  Director of the National Security Agency, Admiral Mike Rogers. Coats  and Rogers both rightly refused to comply with President Trump's  request, properly deemed as an inappropriate request from the President  of the United States to leaders of our intelligence-gathering  community. I applaud the respect of these two men for our democratic  norms and system of government and the rejection of the President's  reckless, selfish request.   This is breathtaking--an American President running from the Russians  to our Nation's top law enforcement agency to our intelligence  community, bizarrely pleading innocence on a matter of grave national  security and trying to undermine ongoing investigations.   Former CIA General Counsel Jeffrey Smith said Trump's deeply  troubling effort is an echo of President Nixon's ``unsuccessful effort  to use the CIA to shut down the FBI's investigation of the Watergate  break-in on national security grounds'' and, in his words, these  actions were ``an appalling abuse of power.''    I had argued that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein should  either appoint a special counsel to look at the allegations of  collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians or tender his  resignation. I said this after he was set up by the Trump  administration to write a memo explaining the firing of James Comey as  Director of the FBI and giving as his reason to protect the honor and  integrity of Hillary Clinton during the campaign.   That was a laughable assertion.   Rosenstein wrote it. For at least 24 hours, that was the official  line from the Trump White House. Then, there was the Lester Holt  interview on NBC, and the President came out and said: I wanted to get  rid of him months ago; I wanted to put an end to this Russian thing.   I am pleased that Mr. Rosenstein made the right decision when he  appointed former FBI Director Robert Mueller to fill the special  counsel role.   Back in the year 2001, that ominous year of 9/11, I first met Robert  Mueller. He was the Director of the FBI. We worked together on some  important issues relative to the FBI. I came to respect him very much.  He is a decorated veteran of the Vietnam war, where he served as an  officer in the Marine Corps, a former Federal judge, a man of the  opposite political faith, but a man who clearly loves his country above  party, whenever he is asked. He is a man who has not only risen to the  challenge of public service but who has excelled to the point where his  term as Director of the FBI was extended--a rarity around Washington  and, certainly, on a bipartisan basis almost unthinkable these days.  But it happened with Robert Mueller. It happened because he is smart,  he is principled, and he loves his country, and we know it. I don't  think Rod Rosenstein could have chosen a better person.   I don't know if I will ultimately agree with his investigation of  this critical issue, but I will respect his findings, whatever they may  be, because I know that they are heartfelt, sincere, and principled.   While this special counsel investigation will be critical, it is not  a substitute, however, for continued congressional action, as well, as  some have suggested or perhaps hoped. I know the Senate Intelligence  Committee is actively pursuing this matter, and I salute them for that  effort, but I think we need to think about more. We need to think about  an independent commission--a bipartisan, transparent commission--to  deal with policy questions. For instance, what are we going to face  from the Russians in the next election? What did we learn in the last  election to protect ourselves?   The special counsel is going to focus on whether crimes were  committed, but I am deeply concerned that there may be matters related  to Russia's attack that may not involve crimes themselves but should be  made public to the American people. It is Congress's responsibility,  just as it was after the September 11 tragedy, to make sure the  American people know as much as possible in a democracy. That is how it  works.   Former Watergate investigator Scott Armstrong made this point in an  op-ed in Sunday's New York Times. He pointed out how a select  congressional committee and a special prosecutor overcame partisan and  jurisdictional conflicts to get to the truth during Watergate. He  noted:   [[Page S3102]]              A mature special prosecutor and a well-led congressional       inquiry can coordinate over issues like witness immunity.       Congress can creatively expand its witness list beyond       prosecution targets and fill in critical details from       satellite witnesses . . . If the committee is aggressive and       truly bipartisan, it can not only educate and reassure the       public, but also legislate solutions to prevent future       abuses.    There are a lot of parallels between the Watergate era and what we  face today, but, sadly, one major difference from the Nixon era to the  Trump era is the willingness of members of the President's own party to  stand up and speak out.   Back in Nixon's day, there came a moment when a handful of Senators  from this Chamber changed history, and one of them was Barry Goldwater.  He met with President Nixon and he said: There are only so many lies  you can take, and now there has been one too many.   Hugh Scott of Pennsylvania joined him, as well as another  Republican--John Rhodes, a Republican leader in the House. They made it  clear to President Nixon that what he had done was unacceptable by any  standard and they would no longer stand by him. It took courage for  them to do that. The President saw the writing on the wall, and he  resigned.   We are looking for similar leadership today from both sides of the  aisle--not just Democrats but Republicans as well--to stand up and  defend our democracy from Putin's interference.   There have been months of relative inaction. It is clear that the  President is not going to stand up to Russia. It is time for all of  us--Democrats and Republicans in Congress--to act for the good of this  Nation and get to the truth of what happened and make sure Russia can  never do this to our democracy again.                            ____________________     Mr. President, the Trump administration released its  fiscal year 2018 budget this morning. For all the talk on the campaign  trail of standing up for the forgotten Americans in this country, the  President's budget takes aim at the exact programs that many rely on.  From healthcare and food stamps to student loans and disability,  President Trump's budget is nothing less than an assault on seniors,  low-income Americans, children, and the disabled.   The President's budget calls for more than $3.6 trillion in cuts to  Federal spending over the next 10 years, with more than $1 trillion of  these cuts coming from some of the most vital programs in our Nation's  social safety net. Nothing is more essential to our Nation's low- income, disabled, and elderly Americans than Medicaid and the  Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP. But the  President's budget slashes more than $600 billion from Medicaid,  despite the President's repeated promises on the campaign trail to  protect the program. More than 3 million people in my State--20 percent  of the people who live there--currently depend on the Medicaid Program  for healthcare, including 1.5 million children and more than 300,000  seniors and disabled people.   The budget cuts $193 billion from SNAP by making it harder for people  to qualify for this assistance in putting food on the table. Forty-four  million children, disabled, and low-income people around the country  accessed food through the SNAP program last year.   Also weakened in the President's budget is the Temporary Assistance  for Needy Families block grant that helps States provide financial  assistance to families who are literally struggling to survive. And the  budget cuts about 20 percent of funding for the Children's Health  Insurance Program, providing health insurance for poor children. Isn't  that incredible? The President doesn't believe that is a priority-- health insurance for poor children.   It is often said that the President's budget reflects our values, and  this budget shows that President Trump clearly values tax cuts for the  upper income individuals in America over the lives of poor and middle- class Americans.   The President's budget also includes historic cuts in nondefense  discretionary spending. Over the next 10 years, President Trump  proposes to cut domestic spending so significantly that spending on  defense would exceed spending on domestic priorities by almost $300  billion. To pay for an increase in defense spending and to build his  big, beautiful wall, the President would slash funding from programs  essential to hard-working Americans--programs that support affordable  housing, home heating bills, Meals on Wheels, student loans, clean  drinking water, preserving the Great Lakes, early childhood education,  and infrastructure.   Even medical research is on the Trump chopping block. President Trump  has proposed cutting one-fifth of the budget for the National  Institutes of Health, including $1 billion from the National Cancer  Institute. President Obama, with Vice President Biden, with strong  bipartisan support, put together a moonshot--a Cancer Moonshot--to do  something significant in cancer research. President Trump's budget  virtually eliminates it.   NIH has helped cut U.S. cancer death rates by 11 percent in women and  19 percent in men. It has helped ensure HIV/AIDS is no longer a death  sentence. It contributed to the near eradication of polio and smallpox,  but make no mistake, these changes didn't just happen. They occurred  because of sustained Federal investment in medical research.   I salute my colleague on the other side of the aisle, Roy Blunt, the  Appropriations subcommittee chair when it comes to NIH. For 2 straight  years now, 2 fiscal years, he has given more than 5 percent real growth  in NIH spending. I have praised him on the floor and back home and  publicly over and over again. That Republican Senator, and many  Democratic Senators, stood together because we believe in medical  research. The Trump budget does not.   We cannot afford these devastating cuts, and we can't afford to sit  on our hands and face the millions of families across America who count  on us to have the right priorities. Clearly, the President's budget is  far from a new foundation for American greatness. This budget would  have a devastating impact on Americans most in need of a helping hand,  on everything from healthcare to food access, to quality education and  affordable housing.   They always say the President's budget is dead on arrival. This  budget, I hope, will be dead on arrival. It doesn't deserve the light  of day or a breath of life.   We need to come together, as we did in this year's budget, on a  bipartisan basis, order the priorities that America sent us to  prioritize, and then work together to pass it. I hope it is done on a  bipartisan basis. That is what America wants, both parties to work  together. We can do it. We did it for this fiscal year. We can do it  for the next, but our first step in reaching an agreement is to make  sure there is a sound rejection of President Trump's budget. His budget  will not make America great again.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
