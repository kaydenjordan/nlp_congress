 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and thank Sergeant  Thomas Reid, Jr., for his 45 years of service with the Cincinnati  Police Department.   A lot has changed since he joined the department back in 1972, after  serving in Vietnam, but one thing has remained the same. For 4\1/2\  decades, Sergeant Reid continued to dedicate himself to keeping our  community safe.   During his time on the force, Sergeant Reid led by example and passed  his knowledge and experience on to his fellow officers, often advising  them to ``treat others as you want to be treated.''   Sergeant Reid retired at the end of December as the Cincinnati Police  Department's longest-serving member, and his leadership and guidance  will be missed. The city of Cincinnati is a better place because of his  service, and his legacy and impact will be felt in our community for  years to come. For that, Mr. Speaker, we Cincinnatians are deeply  grateful and indebted to him.   Thank you, Sergeant Reid.                            ____________________
