 Madam Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Speaker, last week, I stood before this body as we  voted on the first spending package, which, like this package, was  enormous and brought before this House without enough time to learn  where the American people's tax dollars are actually going.   Today, we are considering 6 of the 12 traditional appropriation bills  in one package.   We must get back to regular order and a process where we can  carefully consider and examine each bill and one that works for the  American people. The bills in this package would spend $1.3 trillion in  total discretionary spending, a 13.9 percent increase from the budget  that was agreed to.   I would once again like to state for the record that the Democratic  majority can't even stick to the bipartisan budget that was agreed to  last year.   The first appropriations package that was passed last week contains  $37 billion in emergency measures, and this package adds another $207  billion of such spending. With that addition, according to the  Congressional Budget  [[Page H4170]]  Office estimate, this level of spending is 23.5 percent higher than the  President's request.   No business or family in this country would ever dream of spending  money like this that they don't have and have no idea where they are  going to get it. So why does this body think we are an exception?   Unfortunately, that is business as usual for the 116th Congress.   My amendment today is simple. It would reduce the total amount of  funding for the Labor, HHS, and Education division by 5 percent for  fiscal year 2021.   HHS alone is a $1.2 trillion agency. It employs hundreds of lawyers.  Without my amendment, the division provides a net total of $222.4  billion in fiscal year 2021 discretionary budget authority.   If you do the math, my amendment would cut about $9.8 billion. I urge  my Democratic colleagues to support my amendment since they will still  be overspending, but just a little bit less than they initially  intended.   I just want to note that I wanted to offer a 5 percent cut to  multiple divisions throughout this bill, but continuing the Democrats'  shadowy process, only this one amendment to this bill was ruled in  order.   We can no longer neglect our national debt crisis, which is at  unsustainable heights. It is morally wrong to burden our children and  grandchildren with excessive debt because we can't seem to get our act  together and exercise fiscal constraint.   Let me explain myself like this: How in the world can we create a  standard of healthcare and a standard of living in this country on the  backs of our children and grandchildren? We can't pay for it. So what  do we do? We send it to our children and grandchildren and I don't know  how many generations.   I urge my colleagues in this body to support my amendment today, and  let's start having a serious discussion about how we can once again  unleash economic growth in this country by restraining spending.   I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1430     Madam Speaker, in response, I understand that we are in  unprecedented times, but H.R. 7617 moves our Nation in the wrong  direction.   We talk about values. Those same children who are in Head Start  programs 20 years from now are going to be trying to find a job. Five  months ago, we had the best economy in the world. We had more jobs than  we had people looking for jobs.   Isn't that what America is all about: living the American Dream?   Yet what we are doing is those same children--and we say we care  about the children--where are you going to get the money? Where are you  going to get it? Off their backs?   Madam Speaker, we can't continue this, and I yield back the balance  of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
