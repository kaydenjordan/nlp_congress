 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize those who  participated in the National Day of Silence.   This day allows students and allies to take a vow of silence as a way  to speak out against any harassment and discrimination experienced by  LGBTQ people in our schools.   In my district on the Central Coast of California, Luka Chavez, who  attends Watsonville School of Arts, took his vow last week. Luka told  me that he wanted to take the vow so that he can make all the  difference for all of those who don't have a voice in our own  community.   Luka felt that his silence for 1 day was the least that he could do  to speak up for those who feel isolated and excluded every day.   Luka, you may have taken your vow last week, but this week, on this  day, on this floor, your voice is not only heard but, more importantly,  your message is received by teachers, counselors, administrators,  parents, and all who support you but also, most importantly, those who  don't.   Luka, your vow of silence allows me to speak for you and inspires  Congress to continue its fight for LGBTQ students in our community and  equal rights for our democracy.
