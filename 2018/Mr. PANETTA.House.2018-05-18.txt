 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Dr. Kerstin  Wasson, the research coordinator to the Elkhorn Slough National  Estuarine Research Reserve, one of the many environmental crown jewels  in my district on the central coast of California.   This week, Dr. Wasson received the 2018 National Wetlands Award for  Science Research. This prestigious award recognizes Dr. Wasson's  extraordinary commitment to the conservation and restoration of our  Nation's wetlands. For more than 18 years, Dr. Wasson has distinguished  herself as a researcher, conservationist, and mentor at the Elkhorn  Slough. It is a great fit for her as it is one of California's few  remaining coastal wetlands and a valuable, ecological asset to our  community and, I believe, our country.   The Elkhorn Slough reserve manager, Dave Feliz, said Dr. Wasson is a  secret weapon to protect our Nation's estuaries. She has been  instrumental in informing coastal decisionmakers and implementing  initiatives that protect the Elkhorn Slough.   I thank Dr. Wasson, a wetland hero, for her work and congratulate her  for this honor.                            ____________________
