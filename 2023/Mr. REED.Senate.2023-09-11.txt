 Mr. President, it is my privilege to honor a request from  the former chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Senator Sam  Nunn.   I request unanimous consent that the following statement by former  Senator Sam Nunn regarding the passing of Mr. Frank Sullivan, who was  staff director of the Senate Armed Services Committee and the Senate  Committee on Appropriations, be printed in the Record. I also ask  unanimous consent that Mr. Sullivan's obituary be printed following  Senator Nunn's statement.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                    Statement by Former Senator Sam Nunn                         IN MEMORY OF FRANK SULLIVAN         I have lost a close friend and a wonderful colleague who       made major contributions to the effectiveness of the U.S.       Senate and its key committees and to our nation's security       for many years. Frank Sullivan loved his wonderful wife,       Patricia, and their family, and he loved his country.        Frank, who passed away on August 16, was a champion of the       role of the United States Senate under our constitution. He       was the trusted Staff Director of the Senate Armed Services       beginning in the mid-70's, until he joined Senator John       Stennis at the Senate Appropriations Committee, where he       served as either Minority Staff Director or Majority Staff       Director from 1980-1989. Frank made an indelible imprint on       U.S. national security--beginning with his service in the       United States Army and continuing through his time in the       Senate and his work on behalf of the John Stennis Center for       Public Service.        I met Frank when I joined the Senate Armed Services       Committee shortly after my election in 1972. We were both new       to the Committee, and my lucky break came when Senator       Stennis designated Frank to work with me on issues related to       the NATO alliance and the wind-down of the American presence       in Vietnam. This was the beginning of a long and productive       partnership and a close friendship.        In early 1973, Senator Stennis was tragically shot in a       robbery attempt in front of his home. While he was undergoing       a long recovery, his ability to travel was limited, and he       asked me to lead a fact-finding mission to visit our NATO       bases in Europe and report back to the Committee with our       findings and recommendations. Senator Stennis asked that       Frank and I pay particular attention to our troop levels in       Europe and the morale of our men and women in uniform as we       were withdrawing from Vietnam. He also asked us to pay close       attention to the level of contributions to our joint defense       efforts by our European allies.        Frank helped me undertake the necessary homework for this       important trip. I recall that we spent at least 100 hours       preparing for it, including meetings with military and       national security experts.        After we returned from our European trip, Frank and I were       partners in writing the resulting report: ``Policy, Troops,       and the NATO Alliance.'' The report ``startled specialists       with its freshness and command,'' wrote Steve Rosenfeld in a       column for The Washington Post. This was during the final       stages of U.S. withdrawal from Vietnam. Soon after our trip,       the Senate was set to debate a legislative effort to bring       our troops home from around the world, including a very       significant portion of our Army, Navy and Air Force personnel       stationed in Europe. During an intense debate on the Senate       floor, Frank's wisdom and advice played a pivotal role in the       Committee's success in providing a constructive alternative       to withdrawing our troops from Europe--an alternative that       would not damage the NATO alliance, but pressure our allies       to increase their contributions. The report also pointed out       the need to pay increased attention to the risk and the       required security of U.S. tactical nuclear weapons stored in       Europe.        As historian Dr. James H. Wilbanks wrote later, ``Although       it would not happen overnight, the subsequent buildup of U.S.       forces and its NATO partners no doubt contributed greatly to       the fall of the Berlin Wall, the demise of the Warsaw Pact       and the shortening of the Cold War.'' When Senator Stennis       gave me the responsibility of chairing the Subcommittee on       Manpower and Personnel, Frank was assigned as my lead       professional staff member. He cared deeply about the morale       and well-being of our men and women in uniform and worked       tirelessly to understand and improve their lives throughout       his entire career.        Frank was a key player in all of the Senate Armed Services       Committee's legislative activities and was instrumental in a       range of important work conducted by the Committee,       including:        --The report ``Vietnam Aid: The Painful Options'' (1975)       about the hard choices in continuing U.S. aid to Vietnam;        --The report that I co-authored with Senator Dewey Bartlett       on ``NATO and the New Soviet Threat'' (1977);        --The Nunn-Warner legislation in 1980 which restructured       military pay, benefits and incentives to move the All-      Volunteer Force to a sound footing;        --The shaping legislation that modernized the Defense       Department's officer personnel management policies--a four-      year effort.        These are the ones where Frank and I worked together       directly. He made many more contributions to a sound and       effective national security policy.        In the Senate, Frank was known for his intellectual       curiosity, his analytical thought process, his unquestioned       integrity, and his profound knowledge of the Senate process.       He never sought the spotlight, but he usually deserved it.        Above all, he was an outstanding public servant who served       his country with great effectiveness. We will always cherish       Frank Sullivan's memory and his indelible contributions to       our nation's security.        We thank Frank's wife Patricia and their five children,       eight grandchildren and two great-grandchildren for sharing       him with us and with our nation over so many years.                      FRANCIS ``Frank'' JOSEPH SULLIVAN         Francis ``Frank'' Joseph Sullivan, a dedicated family man       and public servant, died on August 16, 2023 in Alexandria,       Virginia.        Frank was born on October 8, 1932 in Boston to Otilly and       Francis Joseph Sullivan. Frank is survived by the love of his       life, Patricia Hogan Sullivan, his wife of 68 years, as well       as his five children: David Sullivan, Kathy (Lee) Terry,       Martha (Robert) Jones, Patrick (Teresa) Sullivan, and Peter       (Sheila Herriott) Sullivan. He was also the beloved ``Papa''       to eight grandchildren: Syd (Larkin Parker) Terry, Elizabeth       (Ryan) Dolan, Sarah Terry, Christopher Jones, Carolyn       (Jonathan) Rhea, Cathryn Jones, Nicholas Sullivan and       Kathleen (Travis) Jones and two great-grandchildren Patch       Dolan and Audrey Rhea. Besides his wife and family, Frank       loved fishing, the Boston Red Sox (his first employer) and       everything Irish. Frank was a lifelong Catholic with great       faith in the hope of eternal life.        Frank attended Boston Latin School and received a Bachelor       of Arts in Mathematics from Boston College. His lifelong       service to his country started with the U.S. Army, followed       by work on the first use of military digital computers at       Western Electric. Frank continued his public service with the       U.S. Army Management Logistics Center, the Department of       Defense and the United States Senate. He retired from Capitol       Hill in 1989 after having served as Staff Director of the       U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee and then the U.S. Senate       Appropriations Committee. He then served as a member of the       Executive Panel for the Chief of Naval Operations, The       Defense Science Board, the Defense Practices Board, the Board       of Directors of the Stennis Center for Public Service and was       a Senior Fellow with the Center for Naval Analysis.
