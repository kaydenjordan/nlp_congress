 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding, and I  join  [[Page H4905]]  my colleagues in thanking her for her leadership.   Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to speak against the cruel and  unconstitutional leaked Supreme Court decision overturning settled law  of the land, Roe v. Wade. To be clear, controlling decisions about our  bodies is a basic human right. The government has no right to regulate  what we can do with our bodies.   Overturning Roe v. Wade is about control. It is about religious  supremacy. It is about harming women. It would fly in the face of  decades of precedent and the overwhelming majority of public opinion if  this decision is to hold.   We know this decision will fall hardest on the most vulnerable in  this country: women who have been abused, women who are the victims of  incest, and those who have been raped. But its consequences will be  even more far-reaching than we can imagine. This will be a blow to  everyone who believes in the 14th Amendment, to anyone who believes  there is a limit to how much the government can control the decisions  we make in our private lives.   We will be leaving our children and the next generation in a world  with less freedom than we have enjoyed ourselves.   It is shocking to me that all of this is being championed by and is  coming from a party that believes in small government, a party that  talks about freedom, liberty. This is the party now that wants to do  everything that they can to tell women what decisions they can make  about their reproductive rights.   They want somebody like Senator Ted Cruz regulating your uterus.   They want Senator Chuck Grassley having authority over your body.   We have to say no. We have to stand up, and we have to fight back.   If you care about women's rights, you should be outraged by this  decision.   If you care about a woman's right to choose, you should be outraged.   If you care about women having access to healthcare, you should be  outraged by this decision.   If you care about economic justice, you should be outraged by this  decision.   If you care about our basic freedoms, you should be outraged by this  decision.   It is heartbreaking to hear some of the stories shared by my  colleagues, to hear about some of the stories shared by my  constituents. But it will be even more heartbreaking to hear about the  stories that will be shared if we do not protect a woman's right to  choose.   I think about many countries that I visited where women are locked  up, serving 20 years in jail for having an abortion, where we hear  about stories of women who die in back alleys because their families  forced them to have that baby.                                time  1700    We hear about the stories where rape victims are forced to carry  their babies to full term.   This is shocking, and it is shocking because those stories are about  to become the stories of young women in the United States of America, a  country that is supposed to be a symbol of freedom, a country that  believes and exports what it means for women to be celebrated as an  equal, a country that talks about how glorious its Constitution is in  guaranteeing the rights of its citizens.   Now, this is about to become a country where women are crying out in  pain because their freedoms are being impeded by Republicans, who only  say they believe in freedom but do not want to guarantee freedoms to  women in this country.   As an immigrant, I am proud to be an American. I am proud to be a  woman living in this country. I am proud to be a mother of four  children and to have given birth to three of them. I am proud to have  been given the ability to make choices for myself that I might not have  been allowed in the country that I was born in.   But it pains me today to know that those who believe in religious  superiority, those who don't believe in the fundamental rights for  people to choose as they please in this country, might have the last  laugh, and we might not be able to do anything about it.   Not only do we have a narrow window of enshrining and codifying Roe  v. Wade into law, but we also have only a couple of more months to make  sure that this body and the Senate are not lost to religious extremists  and that our country will be in their hands as they govern us to the  gutter.
