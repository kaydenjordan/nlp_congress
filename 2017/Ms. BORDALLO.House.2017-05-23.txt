 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to urge my colleagues to  support H.R. 2052, the Protecting the Rights of IndiViduals Against  Technological Exploitation Act, also known as the PRIVATE Act. This act  will amend the Uniform Code of Military Justice to prohibit the  wrongful broadcast or distribution of intimate visual images.   As technology evolves, so, too, must our judicial systems; and it is  clear, especially after the Marines United scandal, that there is a gap  in the UCMJ. This bill addresses that gap and gives commanders the  tools they need to address this horrific crime of posting or sharing  intimate images that were previously privately shared.   The bill clearly states that distributing or broadcasting intimate  visual images without consent would result in punishment. This change  in the UCMJ will send a strong message to any bad actors in our  military and remind them that honor, trust, and respect are paramount  whether you are deployed or back home. Servicemembers will know that  sharing, broadcasting, or posting intimate images are illegal and will  be punished under the UCMJ.   I thank the gentlewoman from Arizona, Representative McSally, for  introducing this important legislation and diligently working it  through the legislative process. I am also pleased to see such  bipartisan support. Although the circumstances that led this bill to be  written are appalling, it is heartening to see so many colleagues  coming together today to make the necessary changes.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2052. This  amendment to the UCMJ is very necessary and very timely.
