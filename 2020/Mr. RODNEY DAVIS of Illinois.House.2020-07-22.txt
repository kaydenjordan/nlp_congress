 Mr. Speaker, at this time, it looks  like I am going to be here on the floor with many of our colleagues who  are going to offer remarks on this legislation, so I will give my  opening remarks after I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. McClintock).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to follow Whip Clyburn and the historical  context of being a history teacher, and also the historical context of  serving this institution and what it means. So I thank Whip Clyburn for  his leadership.   I thank my good friend, Mr. Butterfield, for his leadership on this  issue. We are going to work together today to make sure that we are  sending a message to the American people that it is Republicans and  Democrats standing together.   Now, I have a unique district in central Illinois. I am from the Land  of Lincoln. As a matter of fact, Abe, himself, lived in my district. I  represent Lincoln's Tomb, Lincoln's Home. The old State Capitol where  Abraham Lincoln delivered his ``House Divided'' speech in 1858 is in my  Congressional District. It was there when Lincoln not only spoke out  against slavery and, specifically, the Dred Scott decision, but stood  unequivocally in support of a free country, famously saying: ``A house  divided against itself cannot stand. I believe this government cannot  endure, permanently half slave and half free. I do not expect the Union  to be dissolved--I do not expect the house to fall--but I do expect it  will cease to be divided. It will become all one thing or all the  other.''   While Lincoln and many others who stood for freedom are represented  throughout this Capitol, there are others that symbolize the opposite.  While we cannot erase our past and should do everything we can--as Whip  Clyburn just stated--we should do everything we can to learn from it  instead.    The statues in the U.S. Capitol represent to visitors throughout the  world what we stand for as a Nation. I support this important  discussion about which statues belong in the U.S. Capitol and, also,  the goal of this legislation.   Before we began debating this piece of legislation, my friend, Mr.  Butterfield, and I had a discussion, a discussion about the 13th  Amendment. And I invite all Members of this institution to come to my  district, to come to the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Museum and  Library, where I can show you an original copy of the 13th Amendment;  also, one of the first copies of the Emancipation Proclamation.   This institution is not just an extended classroom. Where Lincoln  lived, where Lincoln is honored, the 13th District of Illinois, that I  am truly blessed to represent, is also a living classroom of the good  things in our Nation's history.   Now, we also have to remember that the National Statuary Hall  Collection was created in 1864 to commemorate States and their  contributions to this country. And many statues being discussed today  were donated by States to the collection nearly 100 years ago. And as  my colleagues earlier said, many States are already working to remove  them.   While I support their removal, I believe the better route would have  been to have some more hearings in the Committee on House  Administration. But today, today, is not about politics. Today is about  coming together as an institution. And today is a day that I can say I  proudly am blessed to be a Member of Congress.   Our country, right now, is facing a very difficult time, and Abraham  Lincoln's spirit of unity is desperately needed. ``A house divided  against itself cannot stand.'' As leaders, we need to come together to  show there is much more that unites us Americans than divides us, and  lead this country, together, Republicans and Democrats, through this  difficult time.   I hope this legislation today, the bipartisanship that we will see,  is a shining example to the rest of the country of what we can build  together.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from the State of Michigan (Mr. Mitchell), my friend.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance  of my time, and I will close.   Mr. Speaker, it is great to follow our new colleague, Mr. Mfume.   Because of COVID and the restrictions we have in getting together and  getting to know each other like we did before this pandemic, I have not  had a chance to meet you yet. Welcome to this institution. Thank you  for your service here. Thank you for your service leading the NAACP.   I don't know if Mr. Mfume is aware, but many say that the birthplace  of the NAACP is also in Springfield, Illinois, because of the 1908 race  riots that took place in my district.   We are trying to honor those who suffered during that instance in our  Nation's history, still centuries after we saw the scourge of slavery  come to our shores.   We still have a lot of work to do. But I welcome Mr. Mfume. Come to  my district and see the artifacts from those race riots that have been  dug up and displayed for all to see, to be honored. That is what  education and history is.   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Maryland (Mr. Mfume).    Mr. Speaker, I will reclaim my time.   That is exactly why we still, as a Nation, have so much to learn  about each other. We have so much to learn as to why we live, and we  are blessed to live in what I consider the greatest country on God's  green Earth.   The opportunity for every American to do what we do, to serve in this  great institution, is something that should be cherished.   Those issues that seemingly divide us more in a Nation of prosperity,  we need to educate the youth, we need to educate America, and how we  can come together, not just correcting some of the awful, evil parts of  our Nation's history, but let's continue to correct the division that  exists today, not just on this floor, but in this country.   And if we can stand together in this instance, we can surely stand  together and make this country, at a time and place of civil unrest, a  better place for every single American in this country.   With that, Mr. Speaker, I thank again all of my colleagues. I respect  their opinions, their ideas. But today is a day of history. Today is a  day that we are going to band together in a bipartisan way.   And I commend my good friend and look forward to hosting him in  Springfield, Illinois.    Mr. Speaker, I urge support, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of  our friend and colleague, John Lewis.   John will be remembered as one of the pioneers of the civil rights  movement, and his example of courage will be talked about for  generations to come.   John Lewis was loved on both sides of the aisle. Even when we  disagreed, John never failed to be kind and professional.   John loved this country and never stopped his pursuit of a perfect  union for all Americans. Even in the last few weeks of his battle with  cancer, John was still partaking in nonviolent activism and advocating  for equal justice.   When I was a freshman here in Congress, I was touring the Smithsonian  with my sons and daughter. One of my sons asked who the bleeding man in  the picture was. I told him it was a photo of John Lewis during the  civil rights movement and that I now have the privilege of serving with  him in Congress. I am lucky to have been able to call John Lewis a  colleague and a friend.   His passing is a loss for American democracy and advocacy. My wife,  Shannon, and I send our deepest condolences to John's family, friends,  and staff. He will truly be missed. The House will miss John Lewis  greatly.                            ____________________
