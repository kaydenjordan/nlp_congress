 Madam Speaker, after more than 2 years of instability  during the pandemic, Congress must ensure that all Americans--all  Americans--have resources to access the job market, especially those  who are typically left behind.   Each year, 600,000 individuals are released from incarceration, and  nearly half of them have repeat contact with the criminal justice  system within a year. There is a critical need to invest in reentry  programs. The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act of 2022 does  just that by guaranteeing the Department of Labor's Reentry Employment  Opportunities program is authorized at $500 billion by 2028.   This investment will not only expand reentry employment assistance  for adults, but also prevent in-school youth from dropping out of  school, increase the employment rate of out-of-school youth, and reduce  the involvement of youth in crime and violence.   Programs carried out through the reentry employment grant program  recognize that youth can and will lead healthy and constructive lives.  These resources can mean the difference between a revolving door of  prison time or a life full of economic opportunities.   For those reasons, Madam Speaker, and all the other significant  provisions in this bill, such as building community college capacity  and strengthening industry and sector partnership, I urge all of my  colleagues to support the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act of  2022.
