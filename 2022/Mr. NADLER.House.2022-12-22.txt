 Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 4240) to amend section 2441 of title 18, United States Code,  to broaden the scope of individuals subject to prosecution for war  crimes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 4240         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Justice for Victims of War       Crimes Act''.       SEC. 2. WAR CRIMES.         Section 2441 of title 18, United States Code, is amended--        (1) by striking subsection (b) and inserting the following:        ``(b) Jurisdiction.--There is jurisdiction over an offense       described in subsection (a) if--        ``(1) the offense occurs in whole or in part within the       United States; or        ``(2) regardless of where the offense occurs--        ``(A) the victim or offender is--        ``(i) a national of the United States or an alien lawfully       admitted for permanent residence; or        ``(ii) a member of the Armed Forces of the United States,       regardless of nationality; or        ``(B) the offender is present in the United States,       regardless of the nationality of the victim or offender.'';       and        (2) by adding at the end the following:        ``(e) Nonapplicability of Certain Limitations.--In the case       of an offense described in subsection (a) and further       described in subsections (c)(1) and (c)(3), an indictment may       be found or an information may be instituted at any time       without limitation.        ``(f) Certification Requirement.--        ``(1) In general.--No prosecution for an offense described       in subsection (a) shall be undertaken by the United States       except on written certification of the Attorney General, the       Deputy Attorney General, or an Assistant Attorney General,       which function of approving prosecutions may not be       delegated, that a prosecution by the United States is in the       public interest and necessary to secure substantial justice.        ``(2) Offender present in united states.--For an offense       for which jurisdiction exists under subsection (b)(2)(B) (and       does not exist under any other provision of subsection (b)),       the written certification required under paragraph (1) of       this subsection that a prosecution by the United States is in       the public interest and necessary to secure substantial       justice shall be made by the Attorney General or the Deputy       Attorney General, which function may not be delegated. In       issuing such certification, the same official shall weigh and       consider, among other relevant factors--        ``(A) whether the alleged offender can be removed from the       United States for purposes of prosecution in another       jurisdiction; and        ``(B) potential adverse consequences for nationals,       servicemembers, or employees of the United States.        ``(g) Input From Other Agency Heads.--The Secretary of       Defense and Secretary of State may submit to the Attorney       General for consideration their views generally regarding       potential benefits, or potential adverse consequences for       nationals, servicemembers, or employees of the United States,       of prosecutions of offenses for which jurisdiction exists       under subsection (b)(2)(B).        ``(h) No Judicial Review.--Certifications under subsection       (f) and input from other agency heads under subsection (g)       are not subject to judicial review.        ``(i) Rules of Construction.--Nothing in this section shall       be construed as--        ``(1) support for ratification of or accession to the Rome       Statute of the International Criminal Court, which entered       into force on July 1, 2002; or        ``(2) consent by the United States to any assertion or       exercise of jurisdiction by any international, hybrid, or       foreign court.''.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on S. 4240.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, in the shadow of the Second World War, we joined with  other nations to sign the four Geneva Conventions, fulfilling the  promise of the Nuremberg trials to ensure that war criminals and  perpetrators of crimes against humanity could and would be held  accountable for their actions.   Today, with passage of the Justice for Victims of War Crimes Act, we  will close a dangerous loophole that has allowed this promise to ring  hollow for some.   Unfortunately, under current law, the United States can only  prosecute people who have engaged in violations of international  humanitarian law in cases where the alleged perpetrator or victim is a  U.S. national or a member of the U.S. Armed Forces.   As a result, even if a foreign national war criminal is located in  the U.S., they cannot be prosecuted for their war crimes committed  against other foreign nationals.   Americans pride themselves on belonging to a country that presents  itself to the world as a beacon of justice, a home for the persecuted,  and an enforcer of peace, but because of this gap in our laws, the  United States has become a safe haven for perpetrators of war crimes in  international conflicts.   This missing piece in our criminal laws constricts our ability to  hold individuals accountable in conflicts arising around the world. For  example, Russian oligarchs have found refuge in the United States and  will continue to do so until the Justice for Victims of War Crimes Act  becomes law.   This legislation fixes a loophole in the 1996 War Crimes Act by  permitting  [[Page H10013]]  U.S. authorities to prosecute foreign nationals who commit war crimes  and who are then found in the United States.   It also expands the statute of limitations in some cases since war  criminals are often not discovered hiding in the United States until  many years--sometimes decades--after their crimes.   Passage of the Justice for Victims of War Crimes Act will demonstrate  to the people of Ukraine, to our allies abroad, and to war criminals  around the world that the United States will not allow those who commit  atrocities to evade justice on our shores.   I thank my colleagues, Senator Grassley, Senator Durbin, Congressman  Cicilline, and Congresswoman Spartz, for their hard work in bringing  this legislation to the floor.   Madam Speaker, I urge all Members to support it, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I urge support for the bill for the  reasons I stated in my opening statement, and I urge support for the  bill. I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 3949) to reauthorize the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of  2000, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 3949         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

(a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:        (1) Human trafficking is inimical to every Federal agency's       core values and inherently harmful and dehumanizing.

TITLE III--SEVERABILITY       SEC. 301. SEVERABILITY.         If any provision of this Act or amendment made by this Act,       or the application of such provision or amendment to any       person or circumstance, is held to be unconstitutional, the       remainder of this Act and the amendments made by this Act,       and the application of the provision or amendment to any       other person or circumstance, shall not be affected.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on S. 3949.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of S. 3949, the Trafficking Victims  Prevention and Protection Reauthorization Act of 2022, which would  reauthorize the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000, which  expired in September of last year.   This legislation would also extend and update programs for human  trafficking survivors while increasing the funding authorization to  reflect current spending levels through 2027.   Human trafficking continues to be one of the most important  challenges of our time. More than 20 years after we first passed the  Trafficking Victims Protection Act, traffickers continued to find new  ways to exploit 25 million people around the world while generating  more than $150 billion annually.   The TVPA serves as the foundation for the United States'  countertrafficking efforts and contains a multitude of authorizations  for the programs that support this crucial work. It is, therefore,  critical that we reauthorize this legislation.   S. 3949 would help prevent human trafficking, promote services to  trafficking victims and survivors, encourage Federal coordination on  data collection and crime reporting, and promote justice for  trafficking survivors.   The bill would improve training of Federal law enforcement personnel  by ensuring anti-trafficking trainings are included in all staff  trainings for Federal departments and executive agencies. It would also  establish a pilot program to which underserved communities in the  United States may apply for funding to develop and implement treatment  models and support services for youth at high risk of being trafficked.   The bill would also facilitate investigations into potential human  trafficking cases by strengthening statutes and penalties for  trafficking offenses. In addition, it would include the Survivors' Bill  of Rights, which encourages States to adopt the same protections for  survivors of State sex crimes that already exist at the Federal level.   Lastly, we know that trafficking victims are of all ages, genders,  ethnicities, nationalities, and sexual orientations. However, some  vulnerable individuals, including minors in foster care or involved in  the juvenile justice system, are more likely to be targeted and  victimized.   To encourage State agencies to work together to keep these at-risk  youth safe and off the streets, S. 3949 would make grants to State  child welfare and juvenile justice agencies to collaborate in the  collection of data on youth who are involved in both systems or dual- status youth, and encourage better cooperation between State agencies  that oversee juvenile justice and child welfare programs.   The United States has built one of the strongest anti-trafficking  responses in the world, yet the fight is not over. We can and must  continue to improve and strengthen our anti-trafficking response.   That is why I thank Senators Feinstein and Grassley for introducing  S. 3949, legislation necessary to end all forms of human trafficking  and modern-day slavery.   Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this bill, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, for the reasons I stated in my opening  statement, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 3946) to reauthorize the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of  2017, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 3946         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on S. 3946.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of S. 3946, the Abolish Human  Trafficking Reauthorization Act, which reauthorizes crucial programs  that help combat human trafficking.   Human trafficking is a multibillion-dollar criminal industry that  exists in cities, suburbs, and rural towns, and denies freedom to  nearly 25 million people around the world. Our inability to see the  harms of human trafficking allows it to persist and leaves victims  vulnerable, sometimes even as they think they have found those who will  help them escape.   S. 3946 would reauthorize and extend many critical programs through  2027 that are vital to the fight to end this form of modern-day  slavery.   The Trafficking Victims Protection Act, or TVPA, is a crucial law  that provides the legal framework for the United States to combat,  monitor, and prosecute human trafficking crimes, while also providing  key services to victims of trafficking.   S. 3946 would reauthorize key TVPA programs through 2027 that fund  restorative services for victim and law enforcement antitrafficking  operations and training.   This legislation would also establish confidentiality protections for  victims; prioritize cybersecurity enforcement; provide funding to  States that identify, respond to, and prevent trafficking within their  foster care systems; assist victims who have had their documentation  stolen; improve data collection; support forced labor investigations;  and authorize funding for the Department of Health and Human Services  and the Department of Homeland Security.   Lastly, this reauthorization would extend the life of the National  Sexual Assault Hotline and provide permanent authorization of the  Department of Justice's Domestic Trafficking Victims' Fund, which is  financed through fines paid by convicted traffickers and sexual  predators.   Too often we think that human trafficking is something that happens  elsewhere in other cities and other countries, but human trafficking  touches every community, every city, and every suburb. That is why we  must continue to do all that we can to raise awareness, provide hope,  provide support to victims and survivors, and to ensure that there is  accountability for those who commit this terrible crime. This  legislation does just that.   This bipartisan legislation is supported by a broad coalition of  advocates for victims and survivors of trafficking and sexual abuse,  law enforcement, and prosecutors.   Madam Speaker, I thank Senators Cornyn and Klobuchar for introducing  this important legislation. I urge all my colleagues to support it, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, S. 3946 provides vital resources to  identify and protect victims and survivors of human trafficking,  prevent human trafficking, and further victimization of survivors, and  seek out and hold accountable those who dare to commit this heinous  offense.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
