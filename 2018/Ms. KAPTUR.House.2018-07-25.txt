 Mr. Speaker, John Quincy Adams once said:         If your actions inspire others to dream more, learn more,       do more, and become more, you are a leader.    Special Forces Sergeant Dana Bowman is the epitome of that leader,  continuously inspiring those around him. Indeed, he is a retired  sergeant first class with the U.S. Army Special Forces and a member of  the elite parachute team, the Golden Knights.   On February 6, 1994, while training and descending at 300 miles per  hour from the plane that dropped him, he collided midair with his  teammate, Sergeant Jose Aguillon. The result of that horrendous  collision was the unfortunate death of Sergeant Aguillon and the  severing of both of Sergeant Bowman's legs, one above the knee and the  other below.   Nine months following this deeply tragic event, he became the first  double amputee to reenlist in the United States Army.   I witnessed his fortitude firsthand this past week at the 2018  opening of the national Civilian Marksmanship Program in Port Clinton,  Ohio. On July 9, at Camp Perry, during the beginning of the shooting  matches for this year, Sergeant Bowman began the program by parachuting  from very high with a gigantic American flag that he helped unfurl as  he landed on Earth. After a few short minutes, Sergeant Bowman landed  perfectly right behind the podium. What a sight to behold.   I say to my fellow countrymen, truly, this man embraces the words,  ``Land of the free, home of the brave,'' and teaches us all how to rise  above adversity and reach beyond whatever limitations life may deliver  to any of us.   Godspeed, Sergeant Bowman. You make us proud to be Americans.                            ____________________
