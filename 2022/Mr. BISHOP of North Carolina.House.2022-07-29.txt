 Mr. Speaker, today the Democrats give  new meaning to the term progressive. This is the first time in American  history, I believe, that a Chamber of the Congress will pass a bill  openly defying the Supreme Court's explicit declaration of the  constitutional rights of the American people.   It represents the farthest-ever reach of the Democrats' long-pursued  massive resistance doctrine.   In markup I asked if any Democrat disputed that this bill bans guns  and magazines in common use. Chairman Nadler candidly responded:  ``That's the point of the bill.''   In other words, the essence of the bill is to stop commerce in  weapons as alternatively described by the Court in Heller in 2008 as  those ``typically possessed by law-abiding citizens for lawful  purposes.''   Heller explained the origins of the right to keep and bear arms in  militia service. Ordinarily, when called for militia service, able- bodied men were expected to appear bearing arms supplied by themselves  and of the kind in common use at the time.   The Supreme Court further explained we also recognize another  important limitation on the right to keep and bear and carry arms. In  Miller it said, as we have explained, that the sort of weapons  protected were those ``in common use at the time.''   This was explained and recapitulated in Bruen just a month ago on  June 23, and we see repeatedly that this is being  [[Page H7518]]  defied. In fact, 1 week after Bruen, the Supreme Court granted  petitions for certiorari, vacated, and remanded one State ban on MSRs  and a State ban on magazines in common use to be reconsidered.   This is in defiance of the Supreme Court.
