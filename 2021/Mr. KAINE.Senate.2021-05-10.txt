 Mr. President, today I am introducing the Jobs and  Childcare for Military Families Act, with my colleagues Senators  Boozman and Tillis. By incentivizing private businesses to hire  military spouses and allowing military families to use pre-tax dollars  to pay for childcare, we can alleviate some of the unique hardships  military families face and put them on firmer financial footing. This  effort has only become more critical as the nation recovers from the  coronavirus pandemic that has increased the number of unemployed and  emphasized some longstanding issues in securing childcare for young  families.   The families of America's servicemembers make sacrifices that are not  as recognized in the public eye. Military spouses face routine moves  every few years that require packing up a stable home in order to move  to a new area and start over. This is compounded by the complex system  of state licensing and certification requirements, which can limit  these spouses from taking jobs that utilize their expertise and  experience. Because of this, military spouses have unemployment rates  substantially higher than the national average, and are often  underemployed when they do have jobs. Adding to the financial struggle  that frequent periods of unemployment and underemployment cause, the  rising cost of childcare puts a substantial burden on many military  families.   The Jobs and Childcare for Military Families Act would help these  families in two ways. First, the bill makes military spouses an  eligible population for the Work Opportunity Tax Credit. This tax  credit has been proven effective in improving the employment prospects  for other groups, and extending it to military spouses would help them  find employment easier after moving a new area. Second, the bill  instructs the administration to implement dependent care flexible  spending accounts for all servicemembers. These accounts which are  widely available in the private sector would allow military families to  contribute pre-tax dollars to accounts  [[Page S2417]]  that they can then use to pay for childcare services, helping ease the  financial burden of childcare.   I hope my colleagues will support this bill to help families who have  made an incredible sacrifice for our nation.                                  ______                                         By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Blumenthal, Mr. Booker, Mr.          Leahy, Mr. Merkley, Mrs. Murray, and Mr. Menendez):   S. 1535. A bill to designate as wilderness certain Federal portions  of the red rock canyons of the Colorado Plateau and the Great Basin  Deserts in the State of Utah for the benefit of present and future  generations of people in the United States; to the Committee on Energy  and Natural Resources.
