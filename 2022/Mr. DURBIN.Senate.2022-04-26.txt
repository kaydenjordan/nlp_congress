 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, if I were to ask you ``How did you start  your day?'' I would imagine you would have your own answer.   Most people would say: Oh, I made a cup of coffee. I took the dog out  for a walk. I went for a run.   Another answer might come to mind: Oh, I took my vitamin tablet, my  dietary supplement.   In fact, 77 percent of people in America take a dietary supplement,  including me. I take a multivitamin tablet. I don't know if it does me  any good. I figure it won't do me any harm. I believe in it. I believe  Americans ought to be able to make that choice.    I also believe that Americans who take vitamins, minerals, and herbs  for their health and well-being have a right to know what is in them-- pretty basic.   Many people assume if that product is sold in the United States of  America, somebody has inspected it, and it must be safe. Unfortunately,  that is not always true.   The Food and Drug Administration has the authority to regulate  dietary supplements and take dangerous products off the market, but it  lacks information that it needs to use this authority effectively.   The Food and Drug Administration can't even tell us how many dietary  supplements are sold in America. They give us a range: somewhere  between 50,000 different dietary supplements and 80,000--50,000 and  80,000--a gap of 30,000 products? What is going on here? They don't  even know how many products are being sold, let alone what they are or  what is in them.   Let's go back to 1994. That was the year Congress passed a law and  gave the FDA the authority to regulate supplements. Now, we all know  that the Food and Drug Administration has the most important  responsibility when it comes to the drugs that we take to make sure  they are two things: safe and effective--safe and effective.   But what about dietary supplements? Well, we passed something called  DSHEA, the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act. The law made  some progress, but there was a problem with it. Manufacturers of  dietary supplements--get this now--manufacturers of those vitamins and  minerals that are for sale in all those shops and all those drugstores  are not required to tell the Food and Drug Administration what products  they are selling in the United States, under what names. They are not  required to disclose to the FDA what is in those products or where they  are manufactured. And believe me, a lot of them are manufactured  outside the United States. So when it comes to dietary supplements, the  Food and Drug Administration and American consumers are pretty much  flying blind.   Making matters worse, since 1994, this dietary supplement industry  has grown dramatically. Listen to these figures. In 1994, there were  4,000 dietary supplements sold in the United States. Today, as I said  earlier, the number is as high as 80,000. So in 27, 30 years, we have  seen the number of dietary supplements for sale go from 4,000 to  80,000.   Now, in 1994, dietary supplements were a $4 billion industry--today,  over $50 billion in annual revenue.   Let me give you an example of one ingredient sold in dietary  supplements today in the United States. It is called tianeptine. It can  produce opioid-like effects. It is a prescription anti-depressant in  some countries, but it is not approved for any use in the United States  of America. Yet it is inexpensive and easy to produce. Some have  nicknamed it ``gas station heroin'' because you can buy it easily at  gas stations across America. You can buy it online--one click,  delivered to your door.   It is marketed as a safe supplement that can improve users' moods and  enhance concentration. How many ads do you see on television--maybe I  am paying closer attention to them these days--that say: Take this  supplement, and your memory is better. You can concentrate more.   You are smiling, Mr. President, because we have all seen them. They  are on television all the time.   It is marketed also as a way to fight substance use disorders, this  tianeptine. So last year, Consumer Reports--and I respect this magazine  very much--published the results of an investigation it conducted into  this supplement. It told the story of a Michigan woman who had used  heroin for 10 years and survived countless overdoses and arrests. After  her sister overdosed and died, she decided it was time to get clean.  She was frightened. She was desperate enough to try anything. She  [[Page S2138]]  heard about tianeptine--maybe that could help her--so she tried it. She  became hooked and dangerously ill, ending up in the hospital with a  dangerous infection called sepsis.   One doctor said to her: ``I don't know if I can save your limbs, but  I'll try.'' Another doctor told her she came within a day or two of  dying.   She was lucky. She survived. She now speaks publicly about the  dangers of the product that nearly killed her. In her words, ``This is  heroin times 1,000, and it's very devastating. It's life-destroying. I  don't really know how to put into words how horrible this substance  is.''   In the midst of a deadly opioid epidemic and a COVID pandemic, some  unscrupulous characters are hustling to make a buck off of people's  pain by selling them an unregulated product that might make them sick  or even kill them. And the Food and Drug Administration lacks the basic  knowledge, the basic information it needs to go after the people who  are peddling these dangerous, life-threatening products.    When asked about the situation, a Food and Drug Administration  spokesman said the Agency has ``no systematic way of knowing what  dietary supplement products are on the market.''   Think of that. The No. 1 Agency in the Federal Government, which you  assume is taking a look at these products that you are buying at the  vitamins and minerals store, has no way of knowing what is even for  sale. As a result, the FDA, she said, is ``left trying to play catch- up'' after the bad results occur.   This week, Senator Braun of Indiana and I are introducing a  bipartisan bill to protect Americans by requiring supplement  manufacturers to register their products with the Food and Drug  Administration. Our bill would require dietary supplement manufacturers  to provide the FDA--listen to the information we are asking--the names  of their products, the ingredients they contain, an electronic copy of  the label, a list of any health claims that they have made, and more.  All of this information would be available to consumers--so Americans  have the right to know.   If there is a problem with a supplement, the FDA could quickly check  the database to see what other products might contain the same  ingredients and warn innocent consumers.   Dietary supplement makers who refuse to register with the FDA would  see their products misbranded, and FDA should be given the appropriate  authority to take action against them.   Now, I have been down this road before. I wanted to make sure that  the dietary supplement manufacturers, when we had a report of an  adverse event--somebody took their pill, thinking it was a harmless  vitamin or mineral that might help them; it turned out to be dangerous;  they got really sick or died--they had to report it.   I worked on the floor for years to get that passed into law. My  nemesis, my challenger on the whole issue, was the late Senator from  Utah, Orrin Hatch. Eventually, we worked out an agreement. Adverse  event reporting was required.   Now, I might argue that it never worked quite as we expected it to,  but at least it was an effort to alert people that sometimes what looks  like an innocent vitamin or mineral can be dangerous. And the notion  that the government has already checked it out is just plain wrong, as  I have said here. But that was then.   I will tell you what happened. I went into vitamin stores in the  State of Illinois and saw my picture on every cash register. I was  enemy No. 1 because I asked that dangerous supplements be reported to  the government if somebody got sick when they took them. But having  said that, I want to make something very clear about the difference the  legislation Senator Braun and I have introduced will face. I have been  through this, as I said. I proposed a change about 10 years ago, and  the dietary supplement industry hated me. They fought me tooth and  nail. They hated my idea like the devil hates holy water.   In the year since Senator Braun and I started talking to them about  this new bill, there has been a significant change, and I want to  salute the industry for this change. A strong majority of the dietary  supplement industry now supports responsible reporting requirements and  stronger protections. Hats off to them.   The industry's largest trade association, the Council for Responsible  Nutrition, has endorsed our bill. Other trade associations support  enhanced reporting requirements, generally. We hope these groups will  join us in the effort.   Responsible dietary supplement manufacturers should welcome this  because the people who are abusing the market and endangering consumers  are giving them a bad name. We are also glad for the support of Pew  Charitable Trusts, which has worked diligently for years to protect  consumers.   Our bill will give the FDA what they must have: the information to  protect Americans from dangerous products being sold as health  supplements. Our bill will give them the information and the power.   We urge our colleagues to join us in passing it as soon as possible.  It is a commonsense, bipartisan compromise that will protect consumers'  health and save lives.   The bottom line is, I am willing to fight to protect every Americans'  right to buy safe dietary supplements. It may help them; it may not.  That is not my judgment. Each individual consumer should make that  choice. As long as that dietary supplement is not dangerous to you or  to Americans, as long as we know that it is for sale, who made it, what  is in it, I think that basic information is what the government should  gather.   The vast majority of these supplements will not harm people, and the  dietary supplement manufacturers know that, and that is why they are  supporting our effort. I hope that more of my colleagues will join this  bipartisan undertaking.
