 Mr. President.    Mr. President, I join my colleagues today to  make a simple request: Let the people see the bill.   Too often, this body acts without due time given to hear from all of  the ones we represent: the American people. That has absolutely been  the case this year as Congress has rushed through massive, 1,000- or  2,000-plus-page bills, spending billions or trillions of tax dollars  without valuable input.   Now you ask us to vote on a massive bill compiled just this evening.  That is wrong, and the American public know it is wrong. We haven't had  the time to read this. No one has, in fact. This entire bill as it sits  here before us has only been under consideration for a little over 2  weeks, with thousands of pages, and it has been amended numerous times,  including many times today. It spends hundreds of billions of tax  dollars.   As my colleagues know well, I am as vocal an opponent of Communist  China as anyone. America must take decisive action to protect our  interests and combat the threats posed by China's Communist regime. If  the purpose of this legislation is to address that urgent issue, it  should do that with input and feedback from the public.   We should table this vote, let the Members return to our States, hear  from constituents, and then move forward in a timely manner with the  legislation after we have heard from our constituents. This is a simple  and reasonable request. Therefore, I ask the Senator to modify her  request to delay further consideration of S. 1260 until the week of  June 7.    Mr. President, I want to thank my colleagues  for their concerns about this bill.   You know, I have been up here a little over 2 years. I originally ran  for office because I had the same concerns about where the State of  Florida was going as I have concerns about where our Federal Government  is going.   I ran for Governor in 2010, and in the 4 years ending at the end of  2010, the State of Florida had lost 832,000 jobs. Home prices dropped  in half. We had I think close to a million people on unemployment, and  we had I think a little over 1.1 million homes in foreclosure.   If you looked at all the articles, they said that opportunity for the  Sunshine State was over. And I didn't believe it. I believe that if you  run government in a responsible manner, you have unbelievable  opportunities for individuals. The reason I believe this is, it is the  life that I have had the opportunity to live in this country.   I grew up in the--I was born in the great State of Illinois. We lived  in public housing. I had a single mom, and she told me that I could be  anything. She said: If you will study hard, if you will go to church  all the time, if you are an Eagle Scout and you go figure out how to  work, there is no limitation. You can build a company. You can do  anything you want.   I actually believed her, and I had the opportunity to do that. I  built companies, employed a lot of people, and had a lot of  opportunity.   So I ran for Governor in 2010 with the belief that you could turn  around the State of Florida. At the time, I believe there was--you  know, the way the country and the State of Florida were going, it was  not a great place for families like mine growing up. So I ran a  campaign of 7 steps to 700,000 jobs over 7 years. You know, all the  economists said, well, we couldn't get 700,000 jobs in 7 years. It was  not doable. Most of them said we couldn't even get single-digit  unemployment in 7 or 8 years. People wouldn't move to the State.   So I shocked everybody, and I won a primary and I won a general  election, and I set about to do exactly what I said we could do.   We reduced taxes. Every year, we watched how we spent the money. We  allocated our dollars where we could get more jobs. We added 1.7  million jobs--not 700,000 jobs; we added 1.7 million jobs. When we did  that, what happened was, our revenues grew, and we were able to have  record funding for education, for the environment, and for  transportation. We ended up becoming No. 1 in higher education; I guess  generally about the top five in K-12 education; 47-year low in our  crime rate; and record funding for things like the Everglades.   So I believed you could do the same thing up here, and that is why I  came up here. I came up here with the belief that if you start looking  at how you spend the money--and the way we did it in Florida was, we  had--there are about 4,000 lines to the budget, and we went through  every line in the budget every year, and we said: Do we get a  return? What do we get for that? If we didn't get a return, then we  didn't do it the next year. So my goal is to do the exact same thing up  here.    Now let's look at where our country is right now. We have almost $30  trillion of debt. We are running multitrillion-dollar deficits. That is  not sustainable.   And, by the way, who are we going to hurt long term? It is not going  to be the rich. It is going to be the poor. It is going to be the  people on fixed income. You can look at the numbers.   Look at inflation numbers right now. Inflation is caused by reckless  spending. That is what it is caused by. The spending we have done this  year is unbelievable--$1.9 trillion. It was supposedly for COVID, but  it has very little to do with COVID--less than 10 percent--and 1  percent for vaccines.   Let's look at what has happened to inflation. In the 12 months that  ended in April, the Consumer Price Index was up 4.2 percent. It is  pretty surprising that we are up over 6 percent. Milk in 12 months, up  over 5 percent; bread over 7 percent, and gas over 51 percent.   Now, if you have a lot of money, that is not going to change your  life. But if you are struggling for food or you are struggling to put  food on the table, a 5-percent or 7-percent increase has a pretty big  impact. When you see that when the cost to fill up your gas tank to go  to work dramatically increases, it has a pretty big impact. All this is  caused by government spending--reckless government spending--excessive  government spending.   You can't run trillion-dollar deficits. You can't have a Federal  Reserve that continues to buy treasuries every month without ending up  with inflation. And that is exactly where we are.   The only way out of this is to start watching how we spend our money.  In this bill, there might be some good things in this bill, but we are  spending money recklessly.   So, I have a real concern. Why are we rushing through this? Why don't  we take the time--take the time so all  [[Page S3870]]  Americans have a chance to read it, know what is in it, tell us what  they like, what they don't like? Why rush through it, where nobody in  this Chamber knows everything that is in this bill? It is impossible.  It has gone way too fast with all these amendments. There is no way  this could even happen.                                    China    Mr. President, the other thing I want to talk about is China.  Communist China is an adversary. They are not a competitor. They have  become an adversary, and we have got to learn how to stand up.   Just putting more money in a government program is not how we are  going to compete with China. How we are going to compete with China is  to build up American companies. Government doesn't do that.   I have run a company. It is not what government does.   This year marks the 75th anniversary of Winston Churchill's speech to  Westminster College, where he famously declared: ``From Stettin in the  Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic an ``iron curtain'' has descended  across the continent.'' For many, these words were seen as some of the  first announcing the start of the Cold War.   Today, the threat of communism is once again spreading across Eastern  Europe. The malicious and oppressive government of Communist China has  shown it is eager to assert its power across the globe, undermine  democracy and human rights, violate U.S. sanctions, and prop up  dictators.   We have to do something to figure out how to compete better against  Communist China. The United States has to recognize that a new Cold War  is upon us and, with our allies, confront this threat and defeat this  spread of tyranny using every diplomatic and military option at our  disposal.   Communist China's intentions for world domination are clear in its  recent $400 billion, 25-year deal with Iran to provide the Ayatollah  with a steady military partner, investment source, and oil customer.  Communist China has now secured a pathway to further extend the reach  of its Belt and Road Initiative into the Middle East, while  strengthening its relationship with the world's greatest state sponsor  of terror. This dangerous development comes as Communist China  continues its assault to destroy the democracy in Hong Kong, shows  increased military aggression toward Taiwan, and furthers its embrace  of Cuba's abhorrent and oppressive Communist regime--not to speak of  what they are doing down in Venezuela.   The position we find ourselves in today is due to decades of  appeasement by Washington politicians and corporate America, an  attitude that is carried on by many of President Biden's Cabinet  members. Throughout the confirmation process, nominee after nominee  failed to show a true comprehensive comprehension of Communist China's  threat to American security. Meanwhile, we continue to see American  corporations put profits over people, ignoring Communist China's  horrible human rights abuses and the genocide it is committing to  preserve their forced labor-driven supply chains.   While I have no faith that Biden will be tough on China, I have  welcomed and my colleagues have acknowledged the need to  comprehensively combat the influence and power of Communist China  through legislation.   Sadly, we are squandering this opportunity. I want to be very clear.  Any plan that tries to broker a compromise on issues over and above the  needs of American national security, American jobs, or human rights  will do nothing more than perpetuate the status quo.   Since being elected to the U.S. Senate, I have sponsored and  supported more than 40 pieces of legislation focused on addressing the  security of our supply chain, holding communist China fully responsible  for disgusting human rights abuses and genocide against Uighur Muslims,  enhancing our ability to innovate and develop new technology, and  countering Beijing's unfair trade practices.   This is where our legislative efforts must begin. We need to cut  Communist China off from the American economy that it relies so heavily  upon to feed its Communist oppression machine. There is no point in  sacrificing our interests for the hope of compromise with a country  that will never live up to its end of any agreement, is openly  committing genocide against millions of Uighur Muslims, and  continuously threatens not only America's security but that of our  allies in the Asia-Pacific region.   Communist China is focused on one thing--world domination through  oppression and Communist rule. We must not be naive in thinking that  Communist China wants to operate in the modern world order and  cooperate with other world powers. General Secretary Xi wants to  reshape the world order into his image and is willing to strong-arm  anyone who refuses to give in to his interests and those of the Chinese  Communist Party.   If Communist China wants to enact a plan of world domination, the  United States must respond appropriately. The United States must  demonstrate America's strength and resolve, and our commitment to our  allies. In this new Cold War, we have the chance to prove once again  that the American style of government, free enterprise, and civil  society remain the best system in the world   As the world's greatest beacon of freedom and democracy, the United  States must do everything we can, in conjunction with our allies, to  curb Communist China's reach, counter their policies, and punish those  who are guilty of the ongoing genocide against the Uighurs. Whether we  like it or not, we are in a new Cold War with Communist China.   I urge my colleagues to join me in actions that display the true  resolve of the United States in addressing Communist China's  destabilizing actions.   Here is what I am talking about. For too long, the United States has  foolishly enabled Communist China's oppressive dictatorship, which is  now the greatest national and economic security threat. Today,  Communist China's Belt and Road Initiative actively undermines  America's standing around the world with a strategy to dominate  militarily, economically, and technologically. It has become clear that  strategic decoupling from Communist China is the most effective way to  limit General Secretary Xi Jinping's power and protect American jobs  and security. However, our politicians in Washington and business  groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce still argue that decoupling  from Communist China hurts American businesses. They are wrong, blind  to the plans of General Secretary Xi and the pain of his citizens, and  are more concerned with short-term profits than the future of our  country.   As we chart a new course to advance American trade and interests, I  believe we must adopt a bipartisan ``freedom-first'' strategy which  protects freedom around the world from Communist China's growing power  and aggression, restores our country to global leadership, and keeps  American interests first.   What I am proposing is straightforward and achievable. First, we must  acknowledge what has worked in our efforts to ensure free trade and  keep policies in place that will hold Communist China accountable.   Next, the United States has to take decisive steps to strategically  to remove Communist China from our supply chain while supporting the  return of critical industries to American shores and promoting ``buy  American'' policies.   Third, we must engage the international community and secure the full  support of our allies to create a maximum pressure campaign with  Communist China until it comes into compliance with all U.S. and  international trade laws.   Finally, the United States must lead the world and take bold action  to shine a light on and demand an end to Communist China's horrible  human rights abuses and the horrific genocide it is committing on its  own people.   The Trump administration took unprecedented action to thoroughly  investigate Communist China's trade practices and found it had long  been committing forced technology transfers, intellectual property  theft, and espionage. The United States took action over the past 4  years to prohibit Americans from investing in Chinese companies that  support Communist China's military, added those companies to a trade  blacklist, banned imports of cotton from China's Xinjiang region over  forced labor and protected American universities and research  [[Page S3871]]  labs from Chinese government spying and IP theft.   In Congress, I have fought for more than a year to prevent the U.S.  Government from purchasing technology like drones with American tax  dollars from Chinese companies backed by their government. We must keep  these and other proven policies in place. It is time we acknowledge the  fact that when American families buy products made in China, they are  supporting this Communist regime.   We must get Communist China out of our supply chain. We can do this  through simultaneously separating ties from companies backed by the  Chinese Communist Party and rebuilding American-made products. By  properly labeling products with country-of-origin information and  encouraging businesses to return home, we can end our trade inequity  with Communist China and create countless American jobs that support  families and communities across the Nation.   While decoupling must begin now, we know it is not a process that  will be completed overnight, and supply chains must readjust to remove  themselves from the grasp of the Chinese Communist Party. Knowing that  Communist China needs to live up to its agreements, the United States  must lead the world in demanding the full enforcement of all U.S. and  international trade laws.   Organizations like the World Trade Organization can no longer sit in  the pocket of Communist China, and the Biden administration must insist  that the WTO enforce trade practices fairly. This will require a  coalition-style approach and the United States is well positioned to  lead this important work to create increased accountability and real  consequences for the abusive trade practices that Communist China has  relied on for too long.   Finally, the freedom-loving nations of the world must ban together to  say that Communist China's egregious human rights violations won't be  accepted. General Secretary Xi is taking away the basic human rights of  the people of Hong Kong and leading a brutal genocide of Uighurs,  imprisoning more than a million in concentration camps. The State  Department cannot back down from officially designating this as  genocide, and other countries must follow this example.   That is why I led a bipartisan effort to demand that the  International Olympic Committee move its 2022 Winter Games out of  Beijing unless Communist China addresses these human rights abuses. The  world is counting on the United States to stand firm against the use of  slave labor in manufacturing and trade.   With regard to the Olympics, there are 180 human rights organizations  around the world that have asked for the Olympics to be moved. The  Parliament in Canada has asked for the Olympics to be moved. The  International Olympic Committee has done nothing. It is despicable that  international Olympics hasn't already asked the Olympics to be moved or  has not moved the Olympics, and I have asked for all the sponsors of  international Olympics to work to try to make sure the Olympics gets  moved. But American companies have to do their part to rid their supply  chains of such abuses.   The United States and so many countries around the globe stand for  freedom of democracy for all people. Now we must unify and lead the  important effort to accomplish this common goal, put American jobs and  workers first, and counter the harm and unfair trade practices of  Communist China that have been ignored for decades.   But surrendering America's strategic position to Communist China  isn't the only failure of the legislation we are considering today. The  other equally significant dangerous issue is the additional deficit  spending this bill includes, driving America even deeper into debt.   Since first being elected to represent Florida, I have fought hard to  call out wasteful spending and offer solutions to make our government  accountable to the taxpayers. This should be the foundation of our work  and service to our constituents. We can't forget that every dollar the  Federal Government spends is borrowed from the American people.   Sadly, over the past 2 years that I have been in Washington, I  realized that while many politicians make promises to uphold these  values, few put their words into practice. It is no wonder, then, that  our national debt continues to grow and grow and grow. In 2020 alone,  the United States increased its debt by more than $4 trillion. Today,  as we know, it is headed to $30 trillion.   America is clearly in a debt crisis, and we need to start talking  about it and take decisive action to reverse course. That is why every  time I am faced with the question of spending taxpayer dollars on  government programs, I ask myself some simple, yet important,  questions: What is the plan to pay for it? What is the return on  investment for American families? Are there other programs already  doing the same thing? When was the last time this program was reviewed  for its effectiveness? Does the proposal include measures to prevent  waste and fraud and ensure accountability? Are there unnecessary  regulations making this more expensive than it needs to be?   Asking these questions isn't a novel idea. It is the same process I  went through every day when I was Governor of Florida. That is what  most Americans go through when making financial decisions at home or  for their businesses. Families do it every night at their kitchen  table. No family would needlessly spend money without a plan. No  business can afford to not get a return on their investments. But here,  there is no focus on return on investments. The bill we are talking  about, we have no idea how much money we are going to spend.   Spending without consequence isn't how things work in the real world.  It is not how things should work in government. Congress's decades of  failure to think and act responsibly has led to enormous deficits,  insurmountable debt, and out-of-control spending.   Right now, our country is spending out of control. And even before  the pandemic, when the economy was booming, the Federal Government was  running trillion-dollar annual deficits. This has got to stop. We need  real reforms. That is why I proposed amendments to the U.S.  Constitution requiring a supermajority vote in each House of Congress  to impose or raise any tax or fee and provide line-item veto authority  for the President of the United States.   I have also led the charge to set a ``No Budget, No Pay'' policy in  Federal law so that if Congress doesn't pass a budget on time--its most  important constitutional responsibility--Members don't get paid. It is  simple. You don't do your job; you don't get paid. During our vote- arama, we voted on this, and unfortunately my colleagues on the other  side of the aisle all voted against it.   With America in such desperate need of leadership to fix our spending  and debt problem, you would think that the first thing President Biden  would do is to set a plan and work hard to make things right. Well,  think again.   Four weeks after Congress spent $900 billion to address the economic  impacts of COVID, Biden began his Presidency with a call for Congress  to spend another $1.9 trillion. Then the Democrats passed it by  themselves, despite the fact that we didn't know how much of the $4.9  trillion stimulus funding already allocated had been spent.   Today, President Biden is--soon President Biden is going to propose  it sounds like a $7 trillion budget. It will take the United States to  its highest sustained levels of Federal spending since World War II.  This is on top of the $7.1 trillion in new spending Biden has proposed  in his first 4 months in office--$7.1 trillion. You can't make this  stuff up.   I think we are only going to collect about $3.5 trillion or so in  revenues. How can we keep spending money like this? No family can do  it. No person can do it.   I have been warning about the danger of reckless spending for years,  and now we are seeing it play out in real life. President Biden's  liberal dreams of big government, big debt, and high taxes are no  longer speculation.   Now he is rolling out his plans for systemic socialism plainly for  all to see. He has already proposed $7.1 trillion in spending in just 4  months, and now another $6 or $7 trillion of American taxpayer dollars  on top of that, all while holding back needed funding for our military.   By the way, as we added those 1.7 million jobs when I was Governor of  [[Page S3872]]  Florida, we paid off a third of the State debt--over $10 billion--and  cut over $10 billion in taxes. Everything we should be doing up here,  we did in Florida, and we can do it here if we will start looking at  how we spend our money.   Biden wants to redistribute wealth, making everyone dependent on  government while asking our brave men and women in uniform to go  without. It is systemic socialism, and it is already hurting American  families.   America is in a nearly $30 trillion debt crisis, but that won't stop  Biden's tone-deaf march toward socialism. As the President plans to  spend our Nation into oblivion, 83 percent of Americans are already  tightening their budget due to inflation pressures, and 87 percent of  Americans already believe that we have significantly overspent money,  and they know that the Federal Government's spending is causing their  inflation   I grew up poor, and I know what it is like to watch my family  struggle with inflation because of failed government policies and  reckless spending. I watched my mom struggle to put food on the table  and watch her as food prices went up. She struggled to put food on the  table, and that is what we are doing to families right now all across  this country.   Washington can't spend like this anymore. Debt has consequences.  Massive spending has consequences. Tax increases have consequences. It  all hurts America's poorest families the most.   And something else to think about: This summer, Congress and  President Biden will face a critical choice of raising or suspending  the debt ceiling. Congress has made a habit of maxing out America's  credit card with no plan to pay for it for decades. Failure to rein in  deficit spending will inevitably cause--and it is already happening-- high inflation, devastating the purchasing power of all Americans, and  disproportionately impacting low- and fixed-income families.   Since the Biden administration doesn't have a plan to address this  crisis, I hope they will join me in fighting for fiscal restraint and  the adoption of sustainable and responsible debt reduction measures  like we did in Florida and passage of reforms that produce concrete,  enforceable limitations of deficit spending.   Americans understand they can't spend without consequences. It is  time for government to embrace this same mentality. We did a poll  earlier this year--I saw a poll earlier this year--80 percent of  Americans are worried about the Federal debt, and they are concerned it  is going to lead to financial problems for our country.   We have to scrutinize every bill we have, including this bill. Are we  spending this money well? No one has had time to read this bill. Too  often, lawmakers in Washington pass bills without having time to read  them before they vote. These are new laws that impact American families  and businesses and sometimes even authorize billions or trillions in  tax dollar spending, and we don't have time to read these things. It is  complete Washington dysfunction. It needs to end.   This bill is thousands of pages. It spends hundreds of billions of  dollars. Growing up, my family lived paycheck to paycheck. My mom and  my adopted dad struggled, but my mom instilled in me the value of  counting pennies--a value I utilized as a businessman for four decades  before I thought about running for office. I had to make payroll. I had  to make sure there was money in the bank to make sure everybody got  paid. I had to make sure we never ran out of money. First 10 rules of  business: Don't run out of money.   My employees counted on me every time to make sure we never ran out  of money. And if you look at what the Federal Government is doing,  people are scared to death of what is going to happen to their Social  Security, what is going to happen to their Medicare as this country  racks up unbelievable deficits and unbelievable debt   When I ran for Governor, I just said: We are not going to do this. We  are going to figure out how we can live within our means, and we did  it. You know, we watched the pennies. As Governor, I had a line-item  veto, and we went through every line every year, and, again, if we  didn't get a return, we didn't do it.   When I took over Florida, it was like a failing business. I was  worried about what it was going to be like for my children and my  grandchildren in the State that I enjoyed living in. I wanted to make  sure everybody had the same opportunity I had. We did it in Florida. We  turned around the State, and we can do the same thing here.   You know, I was the first Governor in 20 years who actually paid down  debt. Actually, for 20 straight years, the State of Florida increased  its debt over $1 billion a year, and we paid off over $10 billion in 8  years.   So we can do it here, but we have got to start, with this bill,  taking our time and looking at it line by line. Do we need to spend  this money? Do we get a return for this money? Is this good for our  taxpayers? Is this good for the families of our country? And if it is  not, we have got to stop doing this.   I want the next generation to have the same opportunities I had to  live their dreams in this country. If we continue down this path, that  opportunity is going to be lost. At some point, the bill is going to  come due.   You know, Robert Baden-Powell's famous plea to ``try and leave this  world a little better than you found it'' has actually fallen on deaf  ears here. We are not clearly leaving this country in a better shape.  You would never do this to your kids and grandkids, leave the debt that  we are leaving our kids and our grandkids.   The Federal Government takes in a little over $3 trillion. I think  this year it is $3.5 trillion and it is spending trillions more. You  just can't keep doing that. Right now, the interest alone on our nearly  $30 trillion national debt is over half a trillion dollars a year. That  is just interest. What are we getting for that? We get nothing for  that.   It doesn't do anything to help with our families. It doesn't help us  build our military. It doesn't pay for Social Security. It doesn't pay  for Medicare. We know Medicare is running out of money. What happens  when Medicare runs out of money? Doctors and hospitals are going to  have to be paid significantly less or Medicare recipients are going to  have to get less care. I don't want any Medicare recipient to get less  care.   Social Security is running out of its cash reserves by 2034. There is  an automatic cut in Social Security. That is not fair. People who are  paying into their Social Security plan, they are not being told that  there is not going to be enough money there.   In this country, Medicaid costs are increasing by about 5 percent a  year--5 percent. I mean, our revenues are not growing 5 percent a year.  And these programs are called mandatory programs, so we don't have any  control over them. I was shocked when I came up here that we don't even  look at the cost of those programs. We don't even pass a budget with  regard to those programs. I mean, it makes it convenient that we don't  have to vote on it, but it is not fair to the American taxpayer.   We see what is happening when debt rises. I mean, if you look at what  happens with a company--when a company, when its debt rises and they  can't pay their debt, what happens? They go bankrupt. And who gets  hurt? All the employees who work there, they get hurt. Their customers  get hurt; suppliers gets hurt; and everybody gets hurt. It is just a  fact that is what happens. We have to think the same way here. We have  to think how do we reduce the debt, not how do we increase the debt.   Just this week, I held a press conference showing how the Democrats'  reckless spending has increased the cost of groceries and gasoline.  Inflation also raises rent; not to mention it makes it hard to get a  student loan or loan to start a business when the interest rate goes  up.   It is just like I mentioned, 83 percent of Americans already tighten  their belt. They are worried, and they know that it is caused by what  we are doing up here.   I have been shocked that President Biden has been completely silent  about inflation. He has not said a word about it. And if you listen to  Secretary Yellen, all she says is we need to spend more money. I mean,  they are not looking at what is happening with inflation.   Next week, we get the CPI numbers and PPI numbers, and we will see  what they are. But you watch what is happening to families. The poor  families and those on fixed incomes are getting hurt while all these  prices go up.  [[Page S3873]]    We have got to stop this. The April consumer price index rose by  eight-tenths of 1 percent. That is almost 10 percent on an annualized  basis. Annualized basis inflation rate for the past 3 months has been  7.2 percent and 6.2 percent for the first 4 months   The core inflation rate, excluding food and energy, on an annual  basis, grows in April by 11 percent--a rate not exceeded since June of  1982. While these price increases are significant, broad, and  accelerating, are they temporary effects? We don't know. We don't know  if it is temporary. Some people say they are temporary, but who knows.  But are they going to go back down?   As traditionally understood, inflation is too much money chasing too  few goods, and where does that money come from? It comes from reckless  Federal spending. While it may seem old-fashioned to ask in this brave  new world of monetary theory, where Joe Biden declared last year that  ``Milton Friedman isn't running the show anymore,'' is there reason to  be concerned that the broad money supply, M2, grew by 24 percent over  the last year, a postwar year high? Never, in the history of this  country have you seen money supply grow like that without having  significant inflation.   And if you go back to what happened, the only way they stopped the  significant inflation in the past is significantly higher interest  rates, which hurts every family but especially the family on a fixed  income and the poor families because their wages are not going to go up  like that.   So 24.6 percent, that is more than twice the rate it grew--on  inflation, it is more than twice the rate it grew before inflation  reached 13.4 percent in 1979 and almost three times the rate it grew  amid the guns-and-butter spending surge during the Vietnam war.   And what about the extraordinary stimulus spending of the past year?  Larry Summers, the highly respected former Treasury Secretary and  economic adviser to Presidents Obama and Clinton, warned that the Biden  stimulus would create purchasing power ``at least three times the size  of the output shortfall'' and would be ``the least responsible  macroeconomic policies we've had in the past 40 years.''   We need only look at the Bureau of Economic Analysis comparison of  the first quarter of 2021 to a year earlier to confirm Mr. Summers'  concerns. Wages and salaries are already significantly larger in the  first quarter of 2021 than they were before the pandemic. Transfer of  payments have almost doubled, and personal savings have surged an  extraordinary $4.1 trillion from $1.6 trillion a year ago.   The end of the pandemic isn't only unleashing the pent-up demand of  the tremendous shutdown economy. It is opening the floodgate to a  torrent of spending fueled by fiscal and monetary stimulus not seen  since the Civil War. When inflation happens, first off, you end up with  a mindset of inflation. Somebody stopped me the other day and said: I  know car prices are up. Should I buy now because car prices are going  to be up even higher in a year?   With that mentality, that is what causes inflation to continue to go  up--when Americans start believing it is going to go up, it is going to  keep going up even as a result of reckless spending. But once they get  in that mindset, it is very difficult to stop it.   The U.S. economy clearly has the power to iron out the natural  problems of restarting production, but the very nature of the subsidies  in the $6 trillion Biden administration stimulus relief and the  infrastructure bills constrain production.   You know, you look at what is happening with trying to get jobs.  There are about 8 million job openings in the State. A year ago, I was  here speaking on the Senate floor saying that you can't pay people more  not to work than to work. I mean, people are going to make a logical  economic decision, and they are going to do the right things for their  families.   So now what we are seeing is we have job openings all across the  country. In my State, we have restaurants--we have a lot of small  businesses that can't find workers. I talked to an individual who has a  cement company today. He couldn't get truckdrivers. What we have done  to ourselves makes no sense.   In its modern incarnation, socialism denies that government  incentives and constraints have anything to do with people's decisions  to work, save, and invest, but we all know that is not true.   These Federal supplemental payments to unemployment have just  caused--it has caused a catastrophe for our small businesses.   The Congressional Budget Office found that the Affordable Care Act  would cut the number of hours worked by as much as 2 percent. So how  can expanding ObamaCare in the recent stimulus not affect employment?  It does. The same applies to expansions of COBRA, the monthly child  credit, and other income supports.   Historically in America, the best housing, healthcare,  transportation, nutrition, and childcare program was always a job--that  is what our parents always told us--not some government program. If you  give people things they typically get from a job, don't be surprised  when they don't take the job.   The Biden administration claims that it hasn't seen evidence that its  unemployment bonus is keeping people from work, but we know that is not  true. I have talked to people who work in the Biden administration.  While Joe Biden will say that, they acknowledge it is not true. With  the Labor Department reporting record job openings and the National  Federation of Independent Business detailing a record number of small  businesses offering jobs but finding no takers, that claim is not  credible.   Since the War on Poverty began, government transfer payments have  risen to provide more than 90 percent of the income of the bottom 20  percent of income-earning households, and the labor force participation  rate among work-age households has collapsed to 36 percent from 68  percent. How is that good for those families?   You get a lot of satisfaction out of having a job. We need to have  safety nets, but we don't want to put ourselves in the position that  people become dependent on government payments.   The Biden administration also asks Americans to believe that they can  raise income, corporate, and death taxes, smother the private sector  with regulations, kill the fossil fuel industry, and fill the  regulatory Agencies with activists fundamentally hostile to the  Nation's economic system, and it is not going to have any effect on  economic performance. We know that is not true.   Back in the real world, much of what the President is doing will  impede the recovery, reduce economic capacity, and fuel inflation. And  who does it hurt? It always hurts the poorest families, always hurts  the person who is struggling to find work, always hurts the person on a  fixed income. That is who gets hurt.   If Congress sees inflation as a real threat, it should stop spending.  Unfortunately, right now, Congress doesn't think that way. We can see  what is happening in the real world. Any unobligated balances in the  Biden stimulus or previous stimulus bills can no longer be justified  using current economic circumstances and should be rescinded, or if we  are going to spend new money with, hopefully, a way to get a return on  it, we should still spend it with unspent stimulus money.   Rescinding the stimulus authority in the Biden stimulus at the end of  the fiscal year on September 30 would save over $700 billion--$700  billion--according to the CBO. Rescinding authority sooner and  including all previous stimulus bills would save us $1 trillion.   Congress should repeal the enhanced unemployment benefits and  reinstate the Clinton-era work requirements for welfare. Work  requirements should be applied to all unearned benefits to anyone  except the elderly, the disabled, and students.   Congress should adopt a real, enforceable budget that funds  infrastructure and the other functions of the government without  further expanding the deficit and debt.   The debt ceiling, which expires on August 1, should be used to set  into place a long-term, binding program to stop the Federal debt from  growing beyond 100 percent of gross domestic product. If the inflation  of the 1970s and 1980s has returned, it is the ``Gods of the Copybook  Headings'' that have returned once again to teach us that  [[Page S3874]]  water will wet us, fire will burn, and the government can't give us  something for nothing.    Debt also has an impact on interest rates. As interest rates go up,  the interest on the national debt will increase faster and faster. It  is going to be a debt spiral, and it is going to be very hard to deal  with.   We have low interest rates now. If you look at the 50-year average of  the 10-year Treasury, it is significantly higher than it is now. If  that happens, it will be very difficult to fund any program we care  about, whether it is Medicare, Social Security, or fund the military.  When interest rates go up--and interest rates historically have always  gone up when you have significant deficit spending, when you have  significant inflation--then we are going to have a very difficult time  funding the programs we care about.   I hope we don't end up having a sovereign debt crisis, but we are  staring right at it right now.   None of this is to say I don't have hope for our future. I have clear  hope for it. We can do it. We did it in Florida. Every time our country  is faced with a challenge, we have shown our ability to rise above it,  but if we don't acknowledge it, it doesn't happen.   So as long as I am a Member of the Senate, I am going to fight to  rein in the out-of-control spending that is putting our country's  future at risk. I have to. I have seven grandkids. I am going to do my  best to leave this country in a better position than when I started.   But if you just look at the last 20 years, at the unbelievable  increase in debt--I think when Ronald Reagan got elected, the national  debt was under $1 trillion, and now it is close to $30 trillion. So we  have to get focused on this. We can't just do something like this--rush  through a bill that nobody has had the opportunity to really understand  and spend hundreds of billions of dollars, not knowing whether we are  going to get a return.   So, look, I want to figure out how to do good things. When I was  Governor, we invested $85 billion in roads, bridges, airports, and  seaports. I believe in investing. We invested in our universities. But  we can't just keep spending money like this.   With that, I think I will yield to my colleague.
