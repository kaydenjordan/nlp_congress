 Madam President, I rise, as colleagues of mine have  earlier today, to talk about the President's emergency declaration.  Before I do, I will just say that this declaration deals with budgetary  matters at the end of the day, whether the President should be able to  take $6.1 billion this year and possibly more in future years from the  Pentagon's budget to deal with a nonbudgetary emergency.   I want to acknowledge that today is the last day of my budget  staffer, my right hand on all Federal budget matters for the last 6\1/ 2\ years, Ron Storhaug. I am going to miss him. I will start there. I  will miss Ron. He has done such a good job. My only good feeling is  that he is staying right here in the Senate and moving to work with the  senior Senator from Maryland.   I want to talk about the declaration and urge my colleagues to vote  to reject what I believe is the President's unwise use of his power to  raid the Pentagon's budget.   Is there an emergency at the border? There is a serious issue at the  border--a whole series of serious issues, negative but also positive.  Trade happens across all the borders of the country. But all the  testimony before the Armed Services Committee, where I sit, says there  is no military emergency at the border. We heard testimony from General  O'Shaughnessy, who is the commander of what we call NORTHCOM-- everything in the Americas north of Mexico's southern border. General  O'Shaughnessy said there is no military emergency at the border between  the United States and Mexico. We heard the same testimony this morning  from Defense Secretary Shanahan and the head of the Joint Chiefs of  Staff, General Dunford. So there is no military emergency at the  border.   Compared to other significant challenges we deal with--70,000 drug  overdose deaths a year, climate change, 40,000 deaths a year from gun  violence, including both homicides and suicides, homelessness, lack of  medical care, military housing--it is hard to see why the border issue  would be an emergency that would rise to the top of any list. I can  certainly assert this: There are much higher priorities for Virginians.   While we could argue about whether it is an emergency, one thing I  think is pretty clear--it is inarguably a Presidential power grab. The  President is unhappy with congressional appropriations for the border,  so he is declaring an emergency to take $6.1 billion this year and  possibly more in future years from the Pentagon's budget. This will  establish a very dangerous precedent.   First, let's focus on the President's being unhappy. For all of this  President's tenure up until January 3, he had two Republican Houses.  There were two Republican Houses and a Republican President. Why should  he be unhappy with the budget? He would have had the ability to  convince Republican majorities to do what he wanted, but he could not.  So he is unhappy with what Congress, the appropriating branch, has put  on the table. We put billions of dollars on the table for the border,  but he is unhappy with it, and so now he is going to declare an  emergency.   It raises two important questions. Can a President just declare an  emergency every time he is unhappy that Congress doesn't accept his  budgetary proposals? Second, can the President use the declaration of a  nonmilitary emergency to just tap a spigot into the Pentagon's budget?  That is exactly what President Trump is trying to do in this case.   The President has declared an emergency that all agree is a  nonmilitary emergency. The President said: I want to take $6.1 billion  from the Pentagon's budget to deal with this emergency.   He wants to take $3.6 billion from military construction. Military  construction are the funds we use to build facilities on our military  bases across the United States and across the world or to rebuild  facilities, like the airbase at Tyndall or the big sections of Camp  Lejeune that were hit in hurricanes last year. That is what the MILCON  budget is supposed to do.   This morning, I toured Fort Belvoir to visit with Army families  living at Fort Belvoir in Fairfax County, VA. They shared with me  atrocious stories about the condition of the housing they are living  in. These are atrocious stories of rodent infestation, black mold,  lead, and asbestos. I drove by one military house at Fort Belvoir that  had a big warning sign on the door: ``Poison.'' You could not enter it  because of efforts at asbestos and lead remediation.   The families told me about the poor physical conditions of their  properties. They told me about the fact that they couldn't get a  response when they were trying to get help. Then they told me,  tragically, about the illnesses of their children, hospitalizations,  and having to move out of their homes and apartments. One mother of a  10-year-old talked about the fact that her 10-year-old daughter,  because of mold in her military housing unit, missed 45 days of school  in the last school year. Her daughter had to be absent for a quarter of  the school year because of the poor physical conditions of military  housing.   The MILCON budget is there to deal with issues like these. Yet the  President wants to take $3.6 billion out of the MILCON budget. The  President wants to take $2.5 billion out of the drug-interdiction  budget within the Department of Defense. Press reports suggest that  account only has about $85 million available, so what they would need  to do is cannibalize other accounts to fill up that account to $2.5  billion to then take out. Those are the important funds--military  construction and drug interdiction--the President is proposing to raid.   I think it is important to notice this: The President's emergency  declaration is not just about tapping the budget this year for $6.1  billion. Earlier today, in an Armed Services hearing, I asked Secretary  Shanahan: Doesn't this emergency declaration last until the President  declares it is over? If we don't rebut the emergency, it will not just  be fiscal year 2019; it will be fiscal year 2020 or 2021 and beyond. It  will enable the President to tap a spigot into the MILCON budget and  draw out moneys this year, next year, and in future years. So it is  $6.1 billion that he is asking for this year, but unless Congress  asserts its article I power to say, no, we are the appropriators, we  will basically be allowing the President to tap into this fund in  perpetuity, thereby affecting important military construction  priorities that would be good for the military families and our  Nation's defense.    Which military construction projects might be compromised by the  President's use of this $6.1 billion?   When the President declared the emergency, I wrote a letter to  Secretary Shanahan on February 15 and asked: Can you give us a list of  the projects that will be compromised by this $6.1 billion raid on the  Pentagon's budget? I have not received a response. That was 27 days  ago.   This morning, before the committee, Secretary Shanahan was asked: Why  haven't we received a list? If the President wants to take $6.1 billion  out of the Pentagon's budget, give us a list of the potential projects  that could be affected.   I wrote a letter on the 15th, and staffers have been reaching out to  the Pentagon. If you do not know precisely the projects, give us the  universe--all unobligated MILCON projects on your priority list that  could possibly be affected. Today, after not responding to the  requests, Secretary Shanahan said that he will send us a list at the  end of the day: I will send you a list, basically, after you vote this  afternoon.   The vote that we will be casting this afternoon is about whether the  President should be able to raid the Pentagon's budget for $6.1  billion. For a month, we have been asking what projects might be  affected, and they are now proposing to give us an answer to the  question after the vote. They have had the list since the very day we  asked them. They keep a list every day about unobligated MILCON  projects, but the service secretaries are not allowed to share those  lists with Congress until the Secretary of Defense allows them to, and  he is going to allow us to see it today.   Everybody is voting to cannibalize the Pentagon's budget to the tune  of $6.1 billion. All of the Senators should  [[Page S1872]]  be interested in what projects might be affected in their own States  that are necessary to the Nation's defense before they vote to give the  President this power.   In conclusion, I hope, today, we will stand up against the  President's power grab. We shouldn't let the President tap a spigot  into the Pentagon's budget to deal with an emergency that all have  agreed is a nonmilitary emergency. We shouldn't let him tap a spigot  that is not just for this budgetary year but for future fiscal years,  as well, which is the effect of the vote today.   We are the article I branch, and under that section of the  Constitution, we set the spending priorities. Because he is unhappy  with our work product, the President should not be able to overturn the  spending priorities that we have established in our appropriations  bills and raid the Pentagon's budget without telling us where the  moneys will come from.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President. In today's economy, approximately 80  percent of jobs require some form of postsecondary education or  training beyond the high school level. The National Skills Coalition  estimates that nearly half of all job openings between now and 2022  will be middle skill jobs that require post high school training, but  not a four-year degree. While the number of students pursing  postsecondary education is growing, the supply of skilled workers still  falls short of industry demand. According to the Bureau of Labor and  Statistics 7.3 million U.S. jobs are currently vacant in part because  of a shortage of qualified workers.   Our Federal higher education policy must be modernized to meet the  needs of students and employers. Under current law, Pell Grants--needs- based grants for low-income and working students--can only be awarded  to students attending programs that are over 600 clock hours or at  least 15 weeks in length. These grants cannot be used to offset the  cost of targeted, short-term training programs offered at community and  technical colleges that help students obtain employer-recognized  credentials. When it comes to higher education, Federal policies need  to support the demands of the changing labor market by increasing  access to career pathways that align with industry demand. According to  the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce,  shorter-term educational investments pay off--the average postsecondary  certificate holder has 30 percent higher lifetime earnings than  individuals with only a high school diploma.   Today, I am pleased to introduce with my colleague, Senator Portman,  the Jumpstart Our Businesses by Supporting Students or JOBS Act. The  JOBS Act would close the skills gap by extending Pell Grant eligibility  to high-quality, short-term job training programs offered at community  colleges and other public institutions, so workers can afford the  instruction they need to be successful in today's job market. Under the  legislation, Pell-eligible job training programs are defined as those  providing at least 150 clock hours of instruction time over a minimum  of 8 weeks. Eligible job training programs must also provide students  with licenses, certifications, or credentials that meet the hiring  requirements of multiple employers in the field for which the job  training is offered.   The JOBS Act also ensures that students enrolling in Pell-eligible  short-term programs are earning high-quality postsecondary credentials  by requiring that the credentials meet the standards of the Workforce  Innovation and Opportunity Act, are recognized by industry or sector  partnerships, and align with the skill needs of industries in States or  local economies. Job training programs under this Act must also be  evaluated by an accreditor and the State workforce board for quality  and outcomes. The Virginia Community College System has identified  approximately 50 programs that would benefit from the JOBS Act  including in the fields of manufacturing, architecture/construction,  energy, health care, information technology, transportation, and  business management and administration.   The JOBS Act is a commonsense, bipartisan bill that would help  workers and employers succeed in today's economy. As Congress works to  reauthorize the Higher Education Act, I am hopeful that my colleagues  will join me in advocating for Pell Grants to be made available to  individuals enrolling in high-quality, short-term training programs  that lead to industry-recognized credentials and good paying jobs.                            ____________________     Mr. President.
