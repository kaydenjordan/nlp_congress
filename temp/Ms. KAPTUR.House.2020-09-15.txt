 Mr. Speaker, this is a back-to-school September like we  have never seen before. Over the last few weeks, students, parents,  teachers, and administrators have faced great uncertainty as students  return to the classroom.   In many parts of our country, schools are struggling to reopen safely  because of the Trump administration's failed response to the ongoing  pandemic. Our States are in dire need of more Federal funding for  education, and Republicans must come to the table to help provide the  support and protection our students and workers need to learn and teach  safely.   Secretary DeVos and the Trump administration must embrace virtual  learning opportunities, including remote learning, and encourage  limited in-person options rather than threatening students' safety and  school funding, especially in the areas of science and public health  guidance.   It is self-evident that COVID-19 is still a serious health and safety  concern for our Nation and neither children nor teachers are immune  from this deadly disease.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the public to double down on precautions to  prevent infection, and I urge Congress to strike a bipartisan agreement  on a COVID-19 relief package that ensures all schools have the  resources they need to carry out their duties and to protect the lives  of teachers and students as well.                            ____________________
