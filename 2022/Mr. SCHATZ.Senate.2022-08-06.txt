 Mr. President, this leasing requirement would be in  addition to the leasing that is already required by this bill, with 75  percent of offshore leased acres not yet being used to produce oil and  gas. Opening up more acres to leasing is unnecessary. The main thing is  that the passage of this amendment would jeopardize the whole package.   Therefore, I urge a ``no'' vote.    Madam President, I raise a point of order that the  pending amendment violates section 4106 of the concurrent resolution on  the budget for fiscal year 2018, H. Con. Res. 71, of the 115th  Congress, the Senate pay-as-you-go point of order.                           Vote on Motion to Waive     I ask for the yeas and nays.
