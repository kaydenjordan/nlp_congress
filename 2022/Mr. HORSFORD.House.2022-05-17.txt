 Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding.   Today, I rise in support of my amendment to the Workforce Innovation  and Opportunity Act, which will ensure performance measures and  accountability indicators for recognized postsecondary credentials are  made publicly available.   Now is the time for us to invest in our constituents and the  workforce. As we do so, I cannot stress enough how important it is for  Congress to mandate collecting and publicly reporting data on our job  training programs. That includes publicly reporting on performance  measures and economic outcomes, such as the types of jobs, wages, and  long-term career progression.   Having performance measures and accountability indicators publicly  available will allow us to direct Federal resources in an equitable way  so that we are getting support to individuals and programs that have  been historically underfunded.   I encourage my colleagues to support my amendment, and I look forward  to voting for this critical investment in our workers for Nevada and  for all Americans.
