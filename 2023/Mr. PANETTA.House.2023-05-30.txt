 Mr. Speaker, I unfortunately was unable to be present  for the votes today due to commitments in my Congressional District.  Had I been present, I would have voted ``yea'' on rollcall No. 238,  ``yea'' on rollcall No. 239, and ``yea'' on rollcall No. 240.                             PERSONAL EXPLANATION
