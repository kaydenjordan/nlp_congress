 Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, before we discuss the bill before us today, I want to  address the horrible school shooting in Florida yesterday.   We mourn the deaths of those shot and killed, and we support those  who were injured and the families of the victims. But we must also do  more to prevent future shootings in our schools and on our streets.   There have been 18 school shootings in this country so far this year,  and it is only February. According to a Washington Post analysis, over  the last 19 years, more than 150,000 students attending at least 170  primary and secondary schools have experienced a shooting on campus.  That does not include violence outside of the classroom.   We cannot allow this to continue. It is long past due for the House  to consider legislation on this floor to help prevent gun violence. Our  calls for hearings and for action on gun violence prevention  legislation have been met  [[Page H1184]]  with silence. Congress did nothing after Columbine 20 years ago, and  nothing after Sandy Hook 5 years ago. Inaction is unacceptable. Moments  of silence are completely inadequate. Our citizens demand that we act  without delay.   Mr. Chairman, H.R. 620, the so-called ADA Education and Reform Act of  2017, would undermine the civil rights of Americans with disabilities  by significantly weakening the key enforcement tool of the ADA Act of  1990, which is the filing of private lawsuits by discrimination  victims.   Congress passed the ADA 28 years ago with the goals of fully  integrating persons with disabilities into the mainstream of American  life and counteracting discriminatory social attitudes toward the  disabled. By making it harder for persons facing such discrimination to  vindicate their rights in court, this bill ultimately undermines those  goals.   H.R. 620 would, among other things, institute a pre-suit notice and  cure regime under the title III of the ADA, which prohibits  discrimination on the basis of disability in public accommodations,  like hotels, restaurants, private schools, and healthcare providers.   Specifically, the bill would prohibit a disability discrimination  victim from filing a lawsuit to enforce his or her rights under title  III unless the victim first notifies a business of a title III  violation. The victim must then wait up to 180 days to allow the  business either to comply with the law or simply to make some undefined  level of substantial progress--whatever that means--toward complying  with the law.    No Federal civil rights statute imposes such onerous requirements on  discrimination victims before they can have the opportunity to enforce  their rights in court. Both individually and cumulatively, this bill's  notice and cure provisions will have the effect of inappropriately  shifting the burden of compliance with the Federal civil rights statute  from the alleged wrongdoer onto the discrimination victim and  perversely incentivizing businesses not to comply voluntarily with the  ADA.   Moreover, because H.R. 620 does not define the term ``substantial  progress,'' the bill leaves it entirely to a businessowner's discretion  as to whether he has made such progress.   At a minimum, this raises the prospect of expensive and protracted  litigation over the question of whether the business has made  sufficiently substantial progress should a lawsuit be filed. Such a  prospect, along with the need to wait 180 days before filing a lawsuit,  may be enough to deter discrimination victims with meritorious claims  from even sending a notice of violation, much less filing suit to  enforce their rights.   In addition, the bill's notice requirement is overly burdensome and  excessive. Rather than simply requiring an aggrieved person to notify a  business of the existence of an access barrier, H.R. 620 essentially  requires the person to plead a legal case in his or her initial notice.   For instance, a victim must cite the specific provision of the ADA  that has been violated, describe whether the victim made a request to  the business about removing an access barrier, and explain whether an  access barrier was temporary or permanent. Such specific information  may be very difficult or impossible for a discrimination victim to  provide at the notice stage, particularly without legal counsel.   Finally, H.R. 620 does not even address the purported problem  identified by his proponents who claim that a pre-suit notification is  needed to stop lawyers from filing numerous similar lawsuits alleging  both Federal ADA claims and State law claims against numerous  businesses in order to force quick settlements.   That is because many States allow for damages under their State  disability rights laws. But this ignores the fact that title III of the  Federal ADA only permits recovery of reasonable attorneys' fees and  costs, no recovery of money damages. In other words, it is State law,  not the Federal ADA, which provides the financial incentive for  pursuing numerous lawsuits.   Additionally, the filing of multiple suits alleging violations of the  ADA or State disability laws says nothing about the underlying merits  of those suits or the intent of the parties involved.   To the extent that lawyers actually engage in misconduct, courts  already have the tools to address such misconduct, including imposing  sanctions, refusing to award attorneys' fees, or dismissing cases that  have no legal or factual basis.   A pre-suit notification requirement, together with a lack of any  requirement to actually comply with the law, is a virtual get-out-of- jail-free card for every public accommodation in America.   H.R. 620 substantially diminishes the primary incentive for voluntary  compliance with title III, which is the credible risk of being sued and  having to pay reasonable attorneys' fees and costs.   H.R. 620's notice and cure requirements, by starkly diminishing the  risk of litigation, would send a clear and devastating message to every  public accommodation in America that there is no need to comply  voluntarily with the ADA. Instead, the bill tells businesses that they  should simply wait and see if they ever receive a notice of a violation  and to forget about the rights and needs of people with disabilities  until then.   As the former Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge wrote recently in  The Hill in opposing H.R. 620: ``. . . it is unacceptable to roll back  the civil rights of people with disabilities. We should ensure access,  not progress. We should expect businesses to know and comply with their  obligations, not require our neighbors and colleagues with disabilities  to shoulder the burden of informing and educating businesses about  those obligations. We should not turn the business of everyday life  into a complex and legal ordeal for people with disabilities.''   For the foregoing reasons, I oppose H.R. 620 and I urge the House to  reject this deeply flawed bill.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Lewis).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Lewis).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Lewis).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Lewis).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Lewis).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Lewis).    Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Scott).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from New York  for yielding.   Mr. Chairman, because we are talking about need this morning, having  seen Mr. Deutch in Florida, let me offer my deepest sympathy for the  tragic loss of our children.   Mr. Chairman, I rise today to be able to speak for many of those who  cannot be on the floor today, and that is the millions of disabled  Americans; and to be able to say that with all of the consternation and  the uncomfortableness of some of the very important people in America:  small businesses, the engine of our economy.   I have to stand and speak for the value of civil rights and the civil  rights of Americans with disabilities who waited for centuries to not  be looked upon in distaste and disgust.   I remember preceding the passage of the American with Disabilities  Act. George H.W. Bush is a Texan, and I see often his passion for  passing that bill.   There are 57 million Americans with disabilities. That translates to  1 in 5 Americans. There are 31 million Americans with physical  disabilities.   I heard some of their comments: ``As an older woman with  disabilities, I feel invisible.'' Or ``I am not living; I am just  existing.''   The ``notice and cure'' framework included in this bill would  fundamentally change the structure of the ADA's public accommodations  title and remove any reasons for business to comply proactively with  the law.   The same as the Voting Rights Act of 1965 that we now suffer because  we gutted section 4 and section 5, and we have voter suppression, and  people are not having their civil rights in terms of voting.   You touch this in a way that you undermine the very existence of  people living with disabilities. I am outraged, even though I am  empathetic.   But if it is a problem of lawyers, State bars can regulate them and  State courts can regulate them. You can punish or sanction lawyers who  do not have the proper protocols.   Mr. Chairman, this is wrongheaded. I ask my colleagues to stand for  civil rights for Americans with disabilities. This is not just an  amendment. It is undermining the civil rights of those  [[Page H1187]]  who are living with disabilities. They have a right to live.   Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to H.R. 620, the ``ADA Education and  Reform Act,'' legislation that would infringe on important civil rights  of Americans who live with physical disabilities.   I am deeply troubled that the House of Representatives is taking up  H.R. 620, legislation that would remove any incentive businesses  currently have to comply with this longstanding civil rights law and  undermining protections that allow millions to live independently and  in the dignified manner they deserve.   There are about 57 million Americans with disabilities; that number  translates to 1 in 5 Americans.   There are 31 million Americans with physical disabilities who use a  wheelchair, cane, crutches, or a walker.   And for that I commend former President George H. W. Bush, along with  many members of Congress, for their leadership in passing the Americans  with Disabilities Act of 1990, legislation that made our country's  public spaces more accessible to those with disabilities.   H.R. 620 would require disabled persons to notify businesses of a  violation of the ADA's public accommodation provisions contained in  title III of the act, and wait up to 180 days to remedy that alleged  violation before a lawsuit could be filed, presenting a direct  undermining of the civil rights of Americans with disabilities.   The ``notice and cure'' framework included in this bill would  fundamentally change the structure of the ADA's public accommodations  title and remove any reasons for business to comply proactively with  the law.   H.R. 620's notice and cure provisions will have the effect of  inappropriately shifting the burden of enforcing compliance with a  federal civil rights statute from the alleged wrongdoer onto the  discrimination victim.   Moreover, it would undermine the carefully calibrated voluntary  compliance regime that is one of the hallmarks of the ADA, a regime  formed through negotiations between the disability rights community and  the business community when the ADA was being drafted 28 years ago.   H.R. 620 would, instead, perversely incentivize a public  accommodation to not comply with the ADA unless and until it receives a  notice of a violation pursuant to H.R. 620's notice provision.   Finally, the bill does nothing to address the problem that its  proponents seek to address, which is the purported concern with the  filing of meritless lawsuits by certain plaintiffs' attorneys, a  problem (to the extent that it is actually a problem) that is one of  state law, not the federal ADA.   This is not the first time in this Congress, or even this year, that  I witness the Republicans, allegedly a party for state's rights,  completely undermine the established idea that tort law should be left  for states to legislate without interference from federal mandates.   H.R. 620's proponents have never adequately articulated why federal  law must be amended to address a problem driven by state law.   Also, the bill makes no attempt to distinguish between meritorious  and non-meritorious lawsuits and would, instead, impose its harmful and  unnecessary requirements on all ADA claims, regardless of potential  merit.   I remain adamantly opposed to any effort to weaken the ability of  individuals to enforce their rights under federal civil rights laws and  I am concerned that H.R. 620 would undermine the key enforcement  mechanism of the ADA and other civil rights laws, namely, the ability  to file private lawsuits to enforce rights.   Joining me and my colleagues in opposition is a broad coalition of  236 disability rights groups, including:   American Foundation for the Blind,   the Bazelon Center for Mental Health,   the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation,   the National Council on Independent Living,   the National Disability Rights Network,   the Paralyzed Veterans of America,   Vietnam Veterans of America,   the AFL-CIO,   the Anti-Defamation League,   Human Rights Campaign,   the NAACP, and   the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund.   Additionally, the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights  opposes the bill because it would ``remove incentives for businesses to  comply with the law unless and until people with disabilities are  denied access'' which ``would lead to the continued exclusion of people  with disabilities from the mainstream of society and would turn back  the clock on disability rights in America.''   Likewise, the American Civil Liberties Union opposes H.R. 620 because  it would ``fundamentally alter [the] way in which a person with a  disability enforces their civil rights and would severely limit access  to places of public accommodations.''   For the foregoing reasons and those discussed below, we strongly  oppose H.R. 620 and respectfully dissent from the Committee report.   While it is very important to protect small and growing businesses,  we can do so without jeopardizing the rights of disabled individuals to  have a day in court.   I do not believe that we have crossed the T's and dotted the I's with  all the information that we should have in trying to improve our  situation and address the concerns of many small businesses.   Small businesses are the heartbeat of America and the backbone of  successful communities, which is why I have served as one of their  strongest advocates during my tenure in Congress.   But the reality is that H.R. 620 does not help small businesses, it  only hurts the disabled.   I do, however, hope that we can achieve this balanced goal through a  different avenue.   So today I stand with Ranking Member Nadler, Congressman Langevin and  all those who stand for civil rights and for the rights of Americans  with disabilities.   For these reasons I oppose H.R. 620.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Raskin).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Raskin).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Delaware (Ms. Blunt Rochester).   Ms. BLUNT ROCHESTER. Mr. Chairman, I thank my friend, Mr. Nadler, for  yielding and for his leadership on this issue.   Mr. Chairman, as a former Delaware Secretary of Labor, I rise today  to strongly oppose H.R. 620, the ADA Education and Reform Act of 2017.  This bill on the floor today would roll back the clock on civil rights  for people with disabilities.   Twenty-seven years ago, Congress passed the transformative Americans  with Disabilities Act, which prohibited discrimination against people  with disabilities and mandated that they have an equal opportunity to  participate in society. Before the ADA, a person with a disability  could be barred from a meaningful career, education, and, really, to  live a fulfilling life.   Mr. Chairman, some claim that the ADA exposes businesses to  exorbitant costs or damage awards, but this is not the norm. It is one  of the myths that has perpetuated. According to the Department of  Labor, 57 percent of accommodations cost nothing at all, while the rest  typically cost only $500.   So once you peel back the myths surrounding the ADA, we are left with  one simple question: Why not comply?   The monetary cost is typically minimal in comparison to the value of  providing qualified Americans with a job or a shot at the American  Dream; or giving an individual with a disability the means to go to the  grocery store, pick up their children from childcare, or travel, or  work.   That is why these standards are so essential. They ensure real, fair,  and equal access for everyone.   People with disabilities simply want to live an independent life,  free from discrimination. This bill rolls back that progress.   I will be voting against this bill, and I urge my colleagues to do  the same.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky).                                time  1000     Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the minority whip and one of the  original authors of the ADA in 1990.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 1 minute.   Mr. Chairman, 28 years after the ADA's passage, too many businesses  remain inaccessible to persons with disabilities. The last thing  Congress should be doing is undermining the civil rights of a discrete  and insular minority group by making it virtually impossible to enforce  their rights in court.   That is why more than 230 disability rights groups, civil rights  groups, labor unions, and veterans organizations strongly oppose H.R.  620, including the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, the  AARP, the NAACP, Human Rights Campaign, the AFL-CIO, AFSCME, the  Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law, the Paralyzed Veterans of  America, the United Spinal Association, the National Federation of the  Blind, and the National Disability Rights Network. I urge the House to  abide by these groups' concerns with H.R. 620 and reject this deeply  problematic legislation.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield the balance of my time to the  gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Langevin).    Mr. Chairman, I yield the balance of my time to the  gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Langevin).    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Chairman, I strongly support the Langevin-Harper amendment. This  bipartisan amendment removes from the bill its onerous and unjustified  notice and cure provisions while leaving in place its potentially  helpful educational and mediation-related provisions.   As I discussed extensively during general debate, the notice and cure  provisions would have the effect of drastically weakening the ability  of discrimination victims enforcing their rights in court.   Any law, including the ADA, is only effective to the extent that it  is enforceable, and civil rights statutes, particularly, depend  primarily on private rights of action for their enforcement. By  weakening enforcement, H.R. 620's notice and cure provisions ultimately  undermine the ADA's goal of integrating people with disabilities into  the mainstream of American life.   For these reasons, I urge the House to adopt the Langevin-Harper  amendment which cures most of the problems with this bill.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.   The CHAIR. The gentleman from New York is recognized for 5 minutes.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment does not appear to make any  substantive change to H.R. 620. Whether or not the amendment is  adopted, it still would be the case under the bill that a businessowner  who fails to make substantial progress in removing an access barrier  would be subject to a lawsuit.   The amendment, however, does not address the fundamental concerns  with H.R. 620's notice and cure provisions that I expressed in general  debate, including the fact that the bill does not require a business to  comply with the ADA, only to make ``substantial progress'' toward  compliance within the bill's 180-day cure period.   While the amendment does not make the bill worse, it also does not  make the bill better. Regrettably, therefore, I must oppose the  amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Womack). The question is on the amendment  offered by the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Speier).   The amendment was agreed to.                     Amendment No. 5 Offered by Mr. Bera    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 5  printed in part A of House Report 115-559.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from New York is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chair, I appreciate the intent behind this amendment  to make the notice provision of H.R. 620 slightly less onerous, and I  acknowledge that it does so by eliminating the requirement that an  aggrieved person cite in his or her initial notice to a business the  specific ADA provision being violated.   The amendment, however, still leaves in place the basic problem with  the  [[Page H1198]]  bill, the basic problem with the notice and cure provision, and that is  the notice and cure provision. Therefore, it does not alleviate any of  the real concerns with the underlying bill.   Again, the basic notice and cure provisions of the bill turn on its  head the normal practice of any civil rights statute in which the  burden of compliance is on the actor, not on the victim. Here, we put  the burden of compliance on the victim.   The debate has been as if people have not had 28 years to come into  compliance, only to find out they are not in compliance when someone  complains about it, some victim is victimized. That is just wrong. This  goes in exactly the wrong direction.   Although this amendment would slightly alleviate the provision, it is  putting lipstick on a pig. For this reason and in deference to the  disability rights community, which opposes this amendment and the pre- suit notice and cure requirements, I must oppose the amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, this 5- minute vote on passage of the bill will be followed by a 5-minute vote  on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the Journal, if ordered.
