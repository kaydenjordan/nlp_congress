 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of a notable  Hoosier milestone, the bicentennial of the city of Petersburg, Indiana.  Located in Pike County, this southern Indiana community was settled on  land donated by Peter Brenton in 1817, and was established just 1 year  later after Indiana had become a State.   From its earliest days as a pioneer settlement near the Buffalo Trace  and the White River, Petersburg is today a vibrant commercial and  residential community and the seat of the county government. Blessed  with an abundance of natural resources, it is a leader in Indiana's  power generation industry.   While rightfully proud of its favorite son, baseball great Gil  Hodges, Petersburg is squarely focused on a promising future. It boasts  wonderful, new downtown housing, a new county public library, and just  dedicated its new fire department. It looks forward to exciting  development opportunities along I-69.   I proudly salute the city of Petersburg; its mayor, R.C. Klipsch; and  its loyal citizens on this historic occasion.                            ____________________
