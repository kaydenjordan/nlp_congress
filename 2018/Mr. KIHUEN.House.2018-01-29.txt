 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak about the Expanding Access to Capital  for Rural Job Creators Act.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman and ranking member for their  leadership in including this important and bipartisan piece of  legislation in the package the House is considering today.   Nevadans and all Americans deserve the opportunity to have a good job  that will help them provide for their families. Unfortunately, rural  communities across the country have been hit particularly hard by  shifts in population as people move to bigger cities in search of  employment opportunities.   The changing demographics have made it harder for small businesses in  these areas to get started and to survive. Far too many Nevadans,  especially in our rural areas, have been left out and left behind from  the economic growth we have seen in other areas of the country.    I am proud to sponsor the Expanding Access to Capital for Rural Job  Creators Act, which will help expand economic opportunities for  entrepreneurs  [[Page H650]]  and small businesses in Nevada's rural areas. This bill will help  identify and examine the unique challenges that these businesses face  when trying to secure access to capital.   By supporting job creators in our rural communities, we can create a  path to good-paying jobs for all Nevadans and help make sure that they  have the tools to work towards a better life for themselves and their  families.   Mr. Speaker, I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this  piece of legislation.    Mr. Speaker, today I rise to remember the life of Sandy  Casey.   Sandy had a great impact on the students and family she worked with  as a special education teacher at Manhattan Beach Middle School. She  was passionate about her work and was committed to continuing her own  learning. Sandy would take on new projects that came her way, and she  was devoted to all of her students.   Sandy attended Route 91 Harvest Music Festival in Las Vegas with her  fiance, Chris, and her friend. She is remembered by her community as a  fun-loving, free spirit who was a compassionate and loyal friend.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to extend my condolences to Sandy Casey's  family and friends. Please know that the city of Las Vegas, the State  of Nevada, and the whole country grieve with you.                            ____________________
