 Madam Speaker, in a few days, our Nation will  celebrate Veterans Day, a time to pause, give thanks, and honor the  brave men and women who have served our country.   Those men and women who have worn the uniform of our Nation, who have  sacrificed so much for us, deserve more than just words in return. We  owe them action. That means keeping the promises we have made to our  veterans to provide skills and offer opportunities as these men and  women transition to civilian life; to provide a lifetime of healthcare  that they have earned and were guaranteed; to support access to mental  health services, including to those with other than honorable  discharges who may have been improperly dismissed from the service due  to undiagnosed brain injuries or PTSD; and to end the scourge of  veteran homelessness, as we have done in Lake County, in my district in  Illinois.   To that end, I am proud of the bipartisan legislation I introduced to  reauthorize the Boots to Business entrepreneurship training program for  veterans, previously passed in the House, and I urge my colleagues in  the Senate to similarly support this and other important programs.   This Veterans Day, and every day, I hope we will all do more to  remember the privileges we enjoy as Americans and honor those who  served us as a small token of our thanks.                            ____________________
