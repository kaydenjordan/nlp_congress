 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I join my colleagues in supporting this bipartisan  legislation and urge its adoption by the House.   H.R. 4465 extends the authorization through 2023 of the Upper  Colorado River Endangered Fish Recovery Program and the San Juan River  Basin Recovery Implementation Program.   These two multiagency partnerships bring together local, State, and  Federal agencies; water users; utilities; and environmental  organizations to help restore four endangered fish species, while also  maintaining water delivery, hydropower generation, and protecting  economic development along the Colorado and San Juan Rivers.   This legislation will allow for the continued funding of projects  that improve habitat, support crucial research and monitoring, and  remove non-native species, which will both benefit endangered fish  species and protect the many other uses of the rivers.   Healthy rivers are vital to a region's overall environmental and  economic well-being. When our rivers are healthy, our communities are  healthy. We all share a responsibility to sustain and preserve the  integrity of these resources for future generations.   Mr. Speaker, I applaud the bipartisan cosponsors of this legislation  for this leadership.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I support this legislation and its adoption by the  House.   H.R. 1800 authorizes the transfer of 80 acres of Forest Service land  to the Utah State University Research Foundation. The land will support  ongoing research efforts that support national defense and space  programs.   The idea that there should be national public lands that belong to  and are managed on behalf of the American people is a value that dates  back to the founding of our country and is embedded in our  Constitution.   Generation after generation of Americans have endorsed the idea that  our public lands should be managed for the benefit of all Americans to  support a wide range of activities. As stewards of this land, we must  work to find a balance between compelling yet sometimes competing  interests and make sure that the Federal Government is a good neighbor  to local communities.   Whenever we decide that it is appropriate to sell or convey these  shared resources, we must make sure there is adequate compensation to  Federal taxpayers or safeguards in place to guarantee that the land is  used for public purposes.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Bishop for working across the aisle to  ensure that we met these goals in this legislation. I support H.R. 1800  and its adoption, and I yield back the balance of my time.  [[Page H1517]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   As we have heard from my colleague, Dean Stone was a fierce champion  of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park.   Mr. Stone spent much of his life promoting the long-term preservation  of the park and encouraging others to visit this place that he loved so  dearly.   Today, the Great Smoky Mountains are one of our Nation's most visited  national parks. In fact, the park set a new record of 11.4 million  visitors in 2017 and became a destination for tourists from around the  world who wanted to witness last summer's total solar eclipse.   I am sure that many of these visitors directly benefited from the  decades of work by Dean Stone on behalf of the park and the entire  Smoky Mountains region.   Mr. Stone passed away in 2016 at the age of 92. It is a fitting  tribute to rename a bridge section of the Foothills Parkway in his  honor.   Mr. Speaker, I support this legislation, and I yield back the balance  of my time.  [[Page H1518]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Maine (Ms. Pingree), who is one of the sponsors of H.R. 4266.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank both Mr. Poliquin and Ms. Pingree for  introducing this legislation to protect a true New England treasure,  Acadia National Park.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yea'' vote on this bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Nolan), the bill's sponsor. I thank  him for his excellent work on this issue.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1350 is a commonsense, good governance measure, and  I want to congratulate Mr. Nolan for his hard work in getting this bill  through the legislative process.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
