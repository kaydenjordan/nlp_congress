 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor an Illinois hero who  passed away this last week.   Martin Twenhafel of Gorham, Illinois, passed at the age of 92. He  joins his wife, Katherine, who passed in March. Martin was a U.S. Army  veteran and served in Europe during World War II. He was a life member  of the American Legion Paul Stout Post 127 and VFW Post 7190 in  Murphysboro for over 70 years.   Martin, a farmer, was a lifelong resident of southern Illinois, where  he farmed corn, soybeans, and wheat with his sons on the Twenhafel  Farms. He was so moved by his time in the war that he wrote and  published a book titled ``Far from the Farm'' to save and share those  experiences with his grandchildren and children.   Martin, it is with a heavy heart that we thank you for your service  to southern Illinois and our Nation.                            ____________________
