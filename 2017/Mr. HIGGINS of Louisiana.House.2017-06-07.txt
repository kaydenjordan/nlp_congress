 Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of  H.R. 2213, the Anti-Border Corruption Reauthorization Act of 2017.   Mr. Speaker, this bill is about standing up for Border Patrol cops.  Border Patrol is woefully undermanned. This bill addresses this serious  issue. In order to stand strong against jihadist terror and cartel  organized crime, we  [[Page H4681]]  must have an adequate number of boots on the ground.   Mr. Speaker, I served my community for many, many years as a street  cop. I know exactly what it is to work patrol under dangerous,  exhausting conditions. My Border Patrol brothers and sisters of the  thin blue line are stretched too thin.   Hear my words: These are high caliber law enforcement professionals,  but they are well below the staffing levels mandated by Congress.   This bill is not about lowering standards, as some critics claim. To  the contrary, this bill allows for a commonsense approach to hire  experienced, highly qualified patriots to fill the ranks of our front  lines. This bill allows reasonable degrees of discretion that  streamline the vetting and hiring process at Customs and Border Patrol.   I would like to thank Chairwoman McSally for introducing this bill,  and I urge my colleagues to support the law enforcement community and  vote in favor of this important legislation.
