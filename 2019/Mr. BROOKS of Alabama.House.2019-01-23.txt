 Madam Speaker, while CNN has had a rotten, no- good, horrible week, the American people have had a great week because  last week exposed the CNN vitriol, prejudice, bias, and deception that  crowned CNN the fake news king. First, CNN fake news story number 1:   For 2 days, CNN drooled over President Trump's impeachment propaganda  in a BuzzFeed report that was so bad it prompted a rare public rebuke  and ``not true'' proclamation by Special Counsel Robert Mueller.   CNN, strike one.   Second, CNN fake news story number two:   CNN viciously and wrongly attacked, ridiculed, slandered, and  maligned Covington Catholic High School students by portraying them as  racists. By and large, these teenagers at a pro-life march were White  males, Catholic, and, heaven forbid, President Trump supporters with  Make America Great Again hats.   CNN's prejudice against this profile blinded CNN to reality. Had CNN  done its homework, CNN would have reported from the very beginning that  the students were the victims of African American racists who hurled  insults at and sought to intimidate White teenage students and were the  victims of Native American political activists who rudely accosted the  students, beat a drum in their faces, and yelled that White people  should leave America.   Did fake news CNN report from the very beginning this racism against  White people and how remarkably well these Catholic high school  students handled this situation and maintained their composure? No.  Sadly, CNN's bias and prejudice did not allow that.   CNN, strike two.   Third, CNN fake news story number three:   CNN did a poorly researched fact check on illegal alien and border  security crime data comments by various Republicans, including me. The  segment opened with ``New Day'' host Alisyn Camerota deriding ``fact- free fear-mongering'' from ``Trump supporters.''   Really? If you support border security and protecting American lives,  you are a fact-free, fear-mongering Trump supporter who must be  attacked at all costs? Is that really CNN's viewpoint?   CNN's John Avlon then falsely claimed that I said a border wall is  the way to keep death-dealing drugs out of America, when I clearly  stated a border wall is a necessary subpart of a broader border  security strategy required to slow down drugs crossing over our  southern border and save American lives.    That truth didn't fit CNN's blind fealty to open-border, socialist  Democrats, so CNN deceived rather than tell the truth.   CNN next showed me stating that Federal officers apprehended roughly  2,000 illegal aliens per year for homicides on American soil. That is  fine. That is true.   Federal Government's Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Removal  Operations reports state Federal officers apprehended 1,886 illegal  aliens in FY 2017 and 2,028 illegal aliens in FY 2018 for homicides  committed on American soil.   But CNN's John Avlon attacked this Federal crime data by citing an  unrelated PolitiFact analysis and making an apples and oranges  comparison that misunderstands the difference between the words  ``homicide'' and ``murder.''   Well, all murders are homicides. Not all homicides are murders.  Murders are a subpart of the word ``homicides.''   In any event, the PolitiFact analysis involved another person, not  any of us, and was about murders not homicides and disagreed with  nothing that I said.   CNN strike three. You are out.   Madam Speaker, is CNN the most trusted name in news as it claims? No.  Not when its reporters, fact-checkers, and newscasters are so blinded  by vitriol, prejudice, bias, and hatred for President Trump that they  cannot think or see straight; not so long as CNN is nothing more than  an apparatchik for radical, open-border, socialist Democrats, not the  truth and not the American people.   Madam Speaker, CNN has earned its fake news crown, and based on last  week, is not at risk of losing its crown anytime soon.                            ____________________
