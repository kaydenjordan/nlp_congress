 BOYLE of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission  to address the House for 1 minute.)    BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, Democrats are  working for safer communities by investing in safety and justice. We  believe that every American deserves to live in a safe community where  they and their families can thrive.   That is why we are fighting for strong, commonsense action to give  our law enforcement the tools they need to prevent crime. Just this  month, Democrats passed the:   Invest to Protect Act, which funds the police with grants to help  small, local law enforcement agencies retain and recruit officers.  [[Page H8227]]    The Mental Health Justice Act, which helps send unarmed mental health  professionals to respond to mental health crises and save lives from  potentially fatal encounters with armed police officers.   The Break the Cycle of Violence Act, which invests in effective,  evidence-based community violence intervention initiatives.   And fourth, and finally, the VICTIM Act, which bolsters the ability  of police to solve homicides, sexual assaults, and other violent  crimes.   Mr. Speaker, we do not have to choose between safe communities and  justice for all. We are delivering on that promise with these bills and  more.                            ____________________
