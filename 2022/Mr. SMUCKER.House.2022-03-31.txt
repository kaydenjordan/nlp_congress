 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate APR Supply  Company on the occasion of their company's 100th year in business,  which is a milestone that not many companies achieve.   APR Supply Company is a third-generation-owned-and-operated full- service distributor of plumbing, HVAC, and hydronic supplies,  supporting countless companies through their 38 locations in my  district and in other areas of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware.   In America, the entrepreneurial spirit has led many to pursue  founding a business. Over the years some may succeed, some may fail,  but to celebrate 100 years is a milestone that few achieve, as I  mentioned. This achievement signals that an organization is  relentlessly pursuing their values and supporting their customers.   I recently enjoyed visiting one of their facilities with third- generation president and CEO Scott Weaver to learn about their  innovative inventory management system and their operations.   Again, congratulations to the team at APR Supply and to Scott on  celebrating 100 years in business. Best wishes on their continued  success.
