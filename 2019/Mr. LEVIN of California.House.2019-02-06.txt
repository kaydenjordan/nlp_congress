 Madam Speaker, last night we heard from a  President who is clearly out of touch with the true state of our union.  His rhetoric of compromise failed to meet the reality of the highly  divisive policies he offered.   The President failed to acknowledge that his tax scam has unfairly  benefited big corporations, CEOs, and the wealthiest Americans at the  expense of working people.   He failed to acknowledge the severe shortcomings of his own  administration when it comes to middle class families.   He failed to acknowledge that his administration has ripped away  protections for those with preexisting conditions.   The President continued to use harmful rhetoric toward immigrants and  declined to acknowledge that his anti-immigrant agenda has torn  families apart, put kids in cages, and turned away those seeking asylum  and safety.   The President also failed to address one of the biggest crises we  face, and that is the impact of climate change on our planet. We are  witnessing more intense storms and stronger wildfires as a result of  climate change, but instead of acknowledging those facts, the President  denied climate science, nominated fossil fuel lobbyists to run the EPA  and Department of Interior, and has undone critical environmental  protection.   We need a comprehensive agenda to combat climate change and a  monumental shift to renewable energy, electric vehicles, and more  energy-efficient buildings.   While the President continues to deny science and common sense, I  will continue to work with my colleagues on a Green New Deal to protect  our planet for future generations.   While the President's State of the Union address was out of touch, I  welcome him to join Democrats in working For The People to lower health  care costs, end the culture of corruption in Washington, effectively  combat climate change, and serve the middle class.                            ____________________
