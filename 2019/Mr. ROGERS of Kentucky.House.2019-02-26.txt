 Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Bishop  for yielding me this time and mainly for his support of the Mill  Springs Battlefield National Monument Act, which is included in this  great package before us today. And he did it the right way, Mr.  Speaker.   The nonprofit Mill Springs Battlefield Association has worked  tirelessly for nearly three decades to preserve and maintain more than  900 acres to honor and commemorate the first major Union victory in the  Civil War, even constructing a 10,000-square-foot visitor center and  museum at the site where the national cemetery is located.   I was proud to introduce legislation that would add this historic  battlefield in Kentucky's Wayne and Pulaski Counties to the national  park system. Enactment of S. 27 today will ensure that this national  treasure is protected, preserved, and promoted well into the future.   I, therefore, urge your support.   And especially to Mr. Bishop, who, over the years, as chairman of the  committee, worked with us in great detail on this project, I want to  especially say my thanks to Ranking Member Bishop and the committee.
