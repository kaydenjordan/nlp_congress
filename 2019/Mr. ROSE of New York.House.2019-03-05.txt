 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues  to support the Lobbyist Loophole Closure Act.   This bill will close a loophole that lobbyists on both sides of the  aisle--and they are lobbyists--have been taking advantage of for far  too long. They have been using it to skirt disclosure under the guise  of just providing strategic guidance for billion-dollar corporations.   You know, when I go back to Staten Island and south Brooklyn, they  see right through this. They see it for what it is, people getting over  on the system on the backs of hardworking Americans. And they are tired  of it.   It is time that we do our job here in the Halls of Congress to end  this. This is the way our jobs should work, because for far too long we  have been allowing lobbyists on both sides of the aisle to undermine  this process and keep our constituents in the dark.   Just look at this--both sides of the aisle. We have seen this in my  own party with former Senate majority leader Tom Daschle:         He laid the blueprint for the shadow lobbying industry. He       did work that looks, smells, and tastes a lot like lobbying,       but the public was in the dark. He earned millions advising       healthcare clients and others about how to navigate Congress       without registering as a lobbyist.    And on the Republican side, the President's former lawyer, the  infamous Michael Cohen, getting paid hundreds of thousands of dollars  for providing strategic guidance to corporations when, in truth, it was  providing access to the President without ever registering as a  lobbyist. Again:         Used his ties to the President to land consulting       agreements; secretly hired to work on the same issues their       lobbyists were already registered to work on; was paid       millions of dollars to help influence administration policy       without once registering as a lobbyist.    Folks, this is corruption. Mr. Speaker, make no mistake, this is  corruption.   And no matter if you are a Democrat, if you are a Republican, or if  you are an independent, we all see it for what it is.   Now, this is why H.R. 1 is such an essential step. I applaud my  Democratic colleagues for putting a bold anticorruption bill on the  floor of the House this week, of which the Lobbyist Loophole Closure  Act will be a part.   We have got to take this opportunity and push the ball forward  because, for the last 4 years, the American people have been voting for  change. The Republicans called it draining the swamp. The Democrats  called it anticorruption.   The American people are united against the American political class.  They are united against the D.C. political class.   We have got to do something about it, because, if it looks like a  lobbyist, if it talks like a lobbyist, if it acts like a lobbyist,  then, Mr. Speaker, let's call it a lobbyist. Let's disclose it and  regulate it as such.                            ____________________
