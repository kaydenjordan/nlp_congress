 Mr. President, along with my colleagues Senator Jim  Risch and Representative Mike Simpson, I congratulate Frank A. La  Marca, who is retiring from leading employee training for Idaho  Environmental Coalition LLC, IEC, which supports the environmental  cleanup mission at the Idaho National Laboratory, INL, Site.   Effective training of employees is a fundamental part of the success  of any workforce. It is especially critical in the nuclear sector where  employees cannot falter in meeting safety requirements to ensure not  only their personal safety, but also the safety of the public and  surrounding natural resources. As senior manager of site training for  Fluor and IEC for the past 7 years and in this position for CH2M- Washington Group Idaho, CH2M-WG, the 7 years prior, Frank La Marca has  been responsible for ensuring compliance with U.S. Department of  Energy, DOE, Nuclear Facility Training requirements at all Idaho  Cleanup Project INL Site projects. This is certainly an enormous and  essential responsibility. Before serving in this position, he was  responsible for hiring and providing human resource services for more  than 700 employees in three organizations for CH2M-WG. His list of  completed courses, certifications, and program proficiencies is  extensive.   Frank's career objective has been to ``lead a team of professionals  that will strive for new challenges in order to make a company  successful in fulfilling their goals while providing opportunities for  personal growth,'' and he can retire knowing he has more than met this  respectable goal. Frank's years of instruction and mentorship has, no  doubt, played a key part in helping employees at the INL Site safely  meet strategic milestones, such as the completion of the transfer of  all spent nuclear fuel from wet to dry storage more than 9 months ahead  of the 1995 Idaho Settlement Agreement milestone.   The connections Frank has made with people and the objectives he has  advanced while carrying out crucial work will leave a lasting legacy.  We would like to thank Frank for his commitment to enabling so many  Idahoans to do indispensable work that has accelerated the cleanup at  the INL and, in the process, protected Idaho's citizens.  Congratulations on your remarkable career. We wish you all the best in  your well-earned retirement.                            ____________________
