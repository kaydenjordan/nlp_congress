 Mr. President, I rise today to remember a Montanan  that made an indelible impact on Washington, DC, and on Montana.   Chuck Lewis was a native Montanan, born in Bozeman, a journalist, and  a father. As a young man, Chuck served his country proudly as a Marine  Corps Reservist, but he made his career in the news business, which is  how many of my colleagues herein the Senate knew him best.   Chuck served as bureau chief here in Washington, DC, for both the  Associated Press and Hearst Newspapers, where he spent a lifetime  holding the powerful to account and shining a light on the inner  workings of our government.   He covered many explosive stories over his career, including the  Iran-Contra scandal and the civil rights movement, and won acclaim for  his work revealing the truth about friendly fire during the Gulf war.  And his legacy is still visible in Washington today, through the scores  of young journalists he helped train and mentor throughout the years.   I served in the Senate for the last few years before Chuck retired-- in 2013, he invited me to speak at the Gridiron Club for his  inauguration as club president, an honor and a privilege I will never  forget.   Chuck was a consummate newsman, a reporters' reporter, and a friend  to democracy. He made Montana and his country proud, and I can think of  no better way to honor his memory than by enshrining it in the  Congressional Record here today.                            ____________________
