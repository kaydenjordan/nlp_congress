 Mr. President, I send a question to the desk.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Louisiana, Mr. Cassidy,  has a question for both counsel for the former President and counsel  for the House.   The clerk will read it, and counsel for the former President will go  first, for 2\1/2\ minutes, and then the House of Representatives will  have 2\1/2\ minutes.   The legislative clerk read as follows:         Senator Tuberville reports that he spoke to President Trump       at 2:15 p.m. He told the President that the Vice President       had just evacuated. I presume it was understood at this time       that rioters had entered the Capitol and threatened the       safety of Senators and the Vice President. Even after hearing       of this, at 2:24 p.m. President Trump tweeted that Mike Pence       ``lacked courage,'' and he did not call for law enforcement       backup until then.        This tweet and lack of response suggests President Trump       did not care that Vice President Pence was endangered, or       that law enforcement was overwhelmed. Does this show that       President Trump was tolerant of the intimidation of Vice       President Pence?    The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Counsel has 2\1/2\ minutes.   Mr. Counsel VAN DER VEEN. Directly, no. But I dispute the premise of  your facts. I dispute the facts that are laid out in that question and,  unfortunately, we are not going to know the answer to the facts in this  proceeding because the House did nothing to investigate what went on.   We are trying to get hearsay from Mr. Tuberville. There was hearsay  from Mr. Lee--I think it was two nights ago--and we ended where Mr. Lee  was accused of making a statement that he never made. But it was a  report from a reporter from a friend of somebody who had some hearsay  that they heard the night before at a bar somewhere. I mean, that is  really the kind of evidence that the House has brought before us. And  so I have a problem with the facts in the question because I have no  idea, and nobody from the House has given us any opportunity to have  any idea.   But Mr. Trump and Mr. Pence have had a very good relationship for a  long time, and I am sure Mr. Trump very much is concerned and was  concerned for the safety and well-being of Mr. Pence and everybody else  who was over here.   Thank you.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The manager on the part of the House of  Representatives has 2\1/2\ minutes.   Mr. Manager RASKIN. Thank you, Mr. President.   Counsel said before: This has been my worst experience in Washington.  For that, I guess we are sorry, but, man, you should have been here on  January 6.   The counsel for the President keeps blaming the House for not having  the evidence that is within the sole possession of their client, who we  invited to come and testify last week.   We sent a letter on February 4. I sent it directly to President  Trump, inviting him to come and to explain and fill in the gaps of what  we know about what happened there. And they sent back a contemptuous  response just a few hours later. I think they, maybe, even responded  more quickly to my letter than President Trump did as Commander in  Chief to the invasion and storming of the Capitol of the United States.   But in that letter I said: You know, if you decline this invitation,  we reserve all rights, including the right to establish at trial that  your refusal to testify supports a strong adverse inference.   What's that? Well, Justice Scalia was the great champion of it. If  you don't testify in a criminal case, it can't be used against you.  Everybody knows that. That is the Fifth Amendment privilege against  self-incrimination.   But if it is a civil case and you plead the Fifth or you don't show  up, then, according to Justice Scalia and the rest of the Supreme  Court, you can interpret every disputed fact against the defendant.  That is totally available to us.   So, for example, if we say the President was missing in action for  several hours and he was derelict in his duty and he deserted his duty  as Commander in Chief, and we say that, as inciter-in-chief, he didn't  call this off and they say: Oh, no, he was really doing whatever he  can. If you are puzzled about that, you can resolve that dispute--that  factual dispute--against the defendant who refuses to come to a civil  proceeding. He will not spend one day in jail if you convict him. This  is not a criminal proceeding. This is about preserving the Republic,  dear Senate. That is what this is about--setting standards of conduct  for the President of the United States so this never happens to us  again.   So rather than yelling at us and screaming about how ``we didn't have  time'' to get all of the facts about what your client did, bring your  client up here and have him testify under oath about why he was sending  out tweets denouncing the Vice President of the United States while the  Vice President was being hunted down by a mob that wanted to hang him  and was chanting in this building: ``Hang Mike Pence. Hang Mike  Pence.'' ``Traitor. Traitor. Traitor.''   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time for the answer is up.   Next question?   The Senator from West Virginia.
