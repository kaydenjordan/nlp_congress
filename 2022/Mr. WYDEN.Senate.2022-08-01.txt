 Madam President, Oregonians will soon gather to honor an  American hero, Ethyle O'Neal. Ethyle will be posthumously awarded the  Congressional Gold Medal next month in McMinnville, OR. When the Senate  voted to award the medal to Ethyle and her fellow Civil Air Patrol  volunteers from WWII, it was with the heroism and devotion to service  she embodied in mind. Since I won't be able to attend the ceremony, I  want to spend a few minutes today to honor her outstanding legacy, her  service, the communities she bettered, and the family she has left  behind.   Born and raised in my hometown, Portland, 14-year-old Ethyle E.  Kremers was the first from her high school to volunteer for the Civil  Air Patrol, or CAP. With the U.S. military tied up in WWII, the CAP was  tasked with patrolling America's borders to detect threats, deter  submarine attacks, and protect vital shipping lanes. Ethyle trained as  a radio-communicator and support person, as well as taking on the  responsibilities of cadet training at dozens of CAP camps across the  country. Six years after joining the CAP, Ethyle used her training to  single-handedly save the life of a young child and assist in the rescue  of four more during the Vanport Flood disaster. For the rescues, she  became the first CAP cadet to receive the program's highest honor, the  Distinguished Service Award. Soon after, Ethyle joined the U.S. Air  Force and trained as a medical laboratory assistant at Edwards Air  Force Base, where she met her future husband Theodore O'Neal. The two  went on to have four wonderful children: Timothy, Ken, Kathy, and  Susie.   After years traveling with her family to Air Force bases around the  world, Ethyle returned to Portland. She shortly resumed work with the  CAP as commander of the Milwaukie and then Beaverton Cadet Squadrons.  Tasked with training new recruits, Ethyle's dedication to the role was  matched only by the compassion she showed to her cadets. Her family  still remembers Ethyle inviting cadets over to her house to study and  practice maneuvers around the dining room. For her service, Ethyle was  awarded the CAP's highest award for adult officers, the Gill Robb  Wilson Award, and the grade of lieutenant colonel. In addition to  training new cadets, Ethyle began flying search and rescue sorties as a  mission observer, took the role of director of cadet programs, earning  numerous commendations for her work.   Ethyle was also an active member of her community outside of the CAP.  For 13 years, she worked as a bus driver for children with special  needs, ensuring education remained accessible for the most vulnerable  in society. She also loved teaching local children to fly model  rockets.   A model of selflessness, Ethyle's accomplishments survive her,  reminding us that the efforts of a determined few can raise, or even  save, the lives of many. Ethyle's success as a woman in the Armed  Forces and work with children with special needs inspire me to continue  my own work for these underrepresented groups. It is an honor to  remember her achievements, and I can think of nobody more deserving of  the Congressional Gold Medal. It is my sincere hope that her story  continues to inspire the best in all who hear it, in Oregon and across  the Nation.  [[Page S3804]]                                ____________________
