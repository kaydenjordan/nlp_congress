 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1730) to amend title 18, United States Code, to provide for  the protection of community centers with religious affiliation, and for  other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1730         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,  [[Page H9774]]            SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Protecting Religiously       Affiliated Institutions Act of 2017''.       SEC. 2. PROTECTION OF COMMUNITY CENTERS WITH RELIGIOUS                     AFFILIATION.         Section 247 of title 18, United States Code, is amended--        (1) in subsection (a)(2), by inserting after ``threat of       force,'' the following: ``including by threat of force       against religious real property,'';        (2) in subsection (d)--        (A) in paragraph (3), by striking ``and'' at the end;        (B) by redesignating paragraph (4) as paragraph (5); and        (C) by inserting after paragraph (3) the following:        ``(4) if damage to or destruction of property results from       the acts committed in violation of this section, which damage       to or destruction of such property is in an amount that       exceeds $5,000, a fine in accordance with this title and       imprisonment for not more than 3 years, or both; and''; and        (3) in subsection (f), by inserting before the period at       the end the following: ``, or real property owned or leased       by a nonprofit, religiously affiliated organization''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and to include extraneous material on H.R. 1730, currently  under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, the Protecting Religiously Affiliated Institutions Act  of 2017 is a bill designed to address recent attacks on religious  institutions. It amends the Church Arson Prevention Act to clarify that  the act covers religious real property, such as religious community  centers. It also increases the penalty for destruction of property  offenses on religious property where the conduct results in more than  $5,000 in damages to the property.   This legislation is a direct response to the recent onslaught of bomb  threats to various synagogues, mosques, churches, and religious  community centers. In 2017, there have been more than 100 reported bomb  threats against Jewish community centers, Jewish day schools, and other  Jewish organizations and institutions in more than 38 States. Islamic  centers and mosques have been burned in the States of Texas,  Washington, and Florida. We must send the message that any attempt to  instill fear in a religious community will not be tolerated.   From its inception, our country has recognized that freedom of  religion is a fundamental right. It is just as important to protect  this right today, if not more so. We must continue to ensure that the  American people can continue to practice their faith without  obstruction.   I commend Representative David Kustoff and Representative Derek  Kilmer for introducing this bill, and I urge my colleagues to support  this important legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Kustoff), the chief sponsor of this  legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Poe), a member of the Judiciary  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I have no more speakers, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, this is good, bipartisan legislation to protect the  religious freedom of people of all faiths. It is particularly important  that we stand up at a time when some religious faiths are under  particular pressure from those who would attempt to smother their  ability to freely exercise their religious beliefs by intimidation.  This legislation speaks strongly to that.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Members on both sides of the aisle. I thank Mr.  Kustoff, Mr. Kilmer, and others for their good work.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this important  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
