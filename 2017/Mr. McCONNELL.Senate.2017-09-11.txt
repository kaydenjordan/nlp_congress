 Mr. President, today we opened the Senate with a  moment of silence. We remember all those lost 16 years ago on September  11, 2001, the day that changed our Nation in profound ways.   It wrenched our hearts with grief. It opened our eyes to cruel  threats from afar. But it could neither extinguish the basic decency  that unites us as a people nor the common humanity that defines us as a  nation.   It could not stop first responders from rushing toward danger to save  others. It could not stop Americans from donating to strangers in need  or volunteering their time to help. It could not stop the people of our  country from being who they are: kind, caring, compassionate.   It is the same spirit we see again in response to Hurricane Harvey.  It is the same spirit that is giving hope to those in the path of  Hurricane Irma. Although the full extent of Irma's impact will not be  known for some time, it is clear that this intense storm is causing  widespread damage, and it is clear that the recovery will require a  massive undertaking. Our thoughts are with those in the areas affected  by Irma.   We are again prepared to play our role in the recovery. Congress  passed a critical downpayment on disaster relief last week. If more  assistance is required due to Irma, we are ready to do what is needed.   What is most important, I think, is the knowledge that the American  people and our first responders will again be there to reach out to do  whatever is needed to help. That is especially true on a day like  today.   We will never forget the thousands of innocent lives taken from us 16  years ago. We will never forget the heroism of our first responders and  the compassion of our neighbors, nor will we forget the thousands of  men and women who have stood guard to protect us every day since.                            ____________________     Mr. President, our servicemembers voluntarily put  their lives on the line to protect us, and, in return, we must keep our  commitments to them. Today we will begin debate on the National Defense  Authorization Act, the bill that allows Congress to authorize  resources, capabilities, and the pay and benefits our men and women  need to perform their missions.   For more than five decades, Congress has acted every year to fulfill  this responsibility by passing the Defense authorization bill. We will  have our opportunity to do so again this week. This legislation, which  was reported out of committee unanimously, will signal support for our  servicemembers with more of the capabilities they need to be successful  against an array of threats all across the globe.   After years of failed defense policy under the previous  administration, this year's NDAA will make significant and necessary  strides toward keeping America safer. It will do so by authorizing the  beginning steps to rebuild our military, to invest in modernization,  and to restore readiness; by reforming the Pentagon and reducing waste;  by restoring missile defense and responding to cyber threats; and by  reviving troop morale with a pay increase they deserve and continued  reform of the benefits that they and their families rely on.   I think it is fair to say that no Senator understands the importance  of this legislation quite like Senator  [[Page S5086]]  McCain, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee. His commitment to  our Nation's heroes is unfailing, which is why, amidst his own battles,  Chairman McCain has returned to the Senate to manage this bill and see  it through passage. We are all proud to have him with us now.   As we begin considering this bipartisan defense authorization,  Members from both sides will have opportunities to work with Senator  McCain and to offer amendments. Ultimately, we will keep working to  find consensus so that we can pass this critical defense legislation  without further delay.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.
