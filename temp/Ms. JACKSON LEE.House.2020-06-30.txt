 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pass on the floor of  the House H. Res. 1001.   If we can recall our history, we will know that 155 years ago, on  June 19, General Gordon Granger rode into Galveston, Texas, and  announced the freedom of the last American slaves, belatedly freeing  250,000 slaves in Texas, nearly 2.5 years after Abraham Lincoln signed  the Emancipation Proclamation.   Mr. Speaker, I am very proud of the 200-plus Members of Congress who  signed H. Res. 1001 that deals with recognizing June 19 as this year's  observance of the historical significance of Juneteenth Independence  Day.   The reading of this order ended shadow slavery, a form of perpetual  servitude, and, as well, the 13th Amendment that then forever banned  slavery in this Nation. That servitude held generations of Africans in  bondage in the United States for 248 years and opened a new chapter in  American history.   Mr. Speaker, it is America's original sin. I hope this legislation  and the legislation to come will allow us to have a unified, dignified,  peaceful discussion of race and systemic racism in this Nation, and  Juneteenth will become a living symbol of freedom for people, including  the proposed Juneteenth official Federal holiday.   Juneteenth remains the oldest known celebration or commemoration of  slavery's demise.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on Oversight and Reform be discharged from further  consideration of H. Res. 1001 and ask for its immediate consideration  in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I think it is important for the American people to know that it has  been 5 years since we have been able to put pen to paper and develop a  massive infrastructure bill going out to desperate Americans who can't  find good roads, who need mass transit, who need housing, need better  schools, and, yes, even in urban areas like the one I represent that is  a combination of urban and rural broadband.   When we went into COVID-19, our children in our school districts did  not have access to be able to have online classes. Yes, we need the  Moving Forward Act and I rise to support it. As well as I rise to  support and thank the Rules Committee for my amendment dealing with  asking the Federal Aviation Administration to deal with all of those  satellite aspects of aviation that have not been helped by COVID-19  funding.   In particular, I know for a fact that the parking companies at the  airports have not received any COVID-19-related funding and that  requires prioritizing of funding to those areas. My amendment would ask  them to report on those areas that have not gotten funding, like the  parking areas where there are a lot of employees, but then to be able  to prioritize those areas.   We are going to continue working, however, on some very vital issues  that I believe are important. And those are, in particular, large  highways that destroy minority and African American neighborhoods. For  example, the I-45 extension in my community is about to destroy 158  houses, 433 apartments or condos, 486 public housing, 340 businesses, 5  churches, and 2 schools.   There must be the implementation of the requirements under the  environmental aspects, and that is why I also support the climate  change aspects in this bill. But the environmental aspects must be  looked at as well as the historic aspects to ensure that when you  build, you build with the involvement of the community. I will ensure  that that is going to happen.    My amendment creates a national program to reduce  pedestrian-motor vehicle accidents by identifying locations where  deaths have occurred and supports local efforts to address those  conditions. It is very important to the Nation, very important to the  State.   I look forward in going forward to be able to continue to work on  these vital issues that were supported by any number of safety entities  called under the umbrella of the road advocates. And I know that they  will encourage us to work diligently on this.   To my constituents in Houston, we will work together on making sure  that I-45 is not intrusive.   I support the Moving Forward Act.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record this particular Houston  Chronicle article of June 9.                 [From the Houston Chronicle, June 9, 2020]       Interstate 45 Realignment Would Cut Through a Historic Black                          Neighborhood in Houston                            (By James Brasuell)         The construction of America's downtown highways destroyed       thousands of black neighborhoods during the height of the       urban renewal era in the 1940s and '50s--and a new impact       study of a controversial highway project in Houston serves as       a reminder that the racist policy never ended.        The latest estimates of the human cost of the Interstate 45       project reveal that the highway expansion would require the       destruction of 158 houses, 433 apartments or condos, 486       public housing units, 340 businesses, five churches and two       schools; the Houston Chronicle reported. The buildings that       the Texas Department of Transportation seeks to demolish are       disproportionately located in low-income communities of       color, including many within the borders of Texas's first       black-formed municipality, Independence Heights, a region of       major historic significance.        BIPOC activists have long cited displacement and the       destruction of black communities in their fight against the       $7 billion megaproject, which would functionally rebuild most       of the downtown freeway system in the process of expanding       and rerouting the interstate. But the scale of the estimated       destruction hits particularly hard after a week of civil       unrest and consequent police brutality in response to the       killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police. The Black       Lives Matter movement is demanding that cities across the       country defund their bloated law enforcement budgets and make       reparative investments in black communities--precisely the       opposite of projects like the I-45, which would raze black       neighborhoods and destroy black wealth.        The relationship between highways and racial injustice       exemplifies the kinds of systemic issues that many protesters       are now seeking to challenge, Linda Poon wrote at Citylab       last week. Policies that on their face may have appeared to       be about easing transportation barriers and revitalizing       cities were--and still are--often rooted in longstanding       racial prejudice, and carried with them cascading effects       that worsened pre-existing inequalities.        The highway would almost certainly result in an increase in       traffic violence, too--a phenomenon that disproportionately       impacts black communities. Black drivers are at serious risk,       as well; three of Houston's highways already ranked among the       most dangerous roads in the nation in 2018. The state of       Texas itself warned that the I-45 project would cause       disproportionate high and adverse impacts to minority or low-      income populations; and that the project's [d]isplacement of       bus stops could affect people who do not have access to       automobiles or that are dependent on public transportation.        And that's not even to mention how the project will       increase air pollution in black communities--a direct       contributor to fatal COVID-19 outcomes that are contributing       to the disproportionate death toll among black Americans--      exacerbate flooding, and reinforce segregation, which       Streetsblog has explored in depth in the past.        If the destructive potential of the I-45 project is all too       clear, the benefits of it are dubious at best. Decades of       studies of the effect of induced demand show that highway       expansions do not relieve congestion or stimulate meaningful       economic development--facts of which Houston advocates have       been reminding officials since the earliest days of the       project.        The I-45 project has always been a massive boondoggle that       perpetuates structural racism--and our national conversation       over the last week (and the much longer-standing conversation       among BIPOC activists over the past decades) only underscores       how deeply misguided it has always been. But as activists       push to defund all the institutions that kill, harm, and       destroy black communities and black lives, there is perhaps       no better moment to stop it, once and for all.    Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of this body and an  original cosponsor of the legislation, I rise in strong and  enthusiastic support of the rule governing debate of H.R. 2, the Moving  Forward Act, and the underlying bill.   H.R. 2, the Moving Forward Act, is a more than $1.5 trillion plan to  rebuild American infrastructure--not only our roads, bridges, and  transit systems, but also our schools, housing, broadband access, and  so much more.   The bill makes a bold down payment on sound investments that address  resiliency and climate change to address the impact of extreme weather  events on a wide range of critical infrastructure.   By investing in families, workers, and communities across the  country, we can support American manufacturing and ingenuity and create  millions of jobs that cannot be exported, all while putting our country  on a path toward zero carbon emissions, making communities and roads  safer, and addressing long-standing disparities.   Mr. Speaker, this transformational legislation makes robust  investments in the infrastructure necessary to support the well-being  of all Americans and connect them with the services and opportunities  needed to succeed in the global economy, which will create millions of  American jobs rebuilding our country, so desperately needed in light of  its wreckage by the COVID-19 pandemic.   It is way past time to act on a major effort to improve our nation's  infrastructure.   The World Economic Forum ranked the United States is ranked  thirteenth among nations with a score of 87.9 percent.   The infrastructure score is calculated based on the following  factors: road connectivity index, quality of roads, railroad density,  efficiency of train services, airport connectivity, efficiency of air  transport services, linear shipping connectivity index, efficiency of  seaport services, electrification rate, electric power transmission and  distribution losses, and exposure to unsafe drinking water, reliability  of water supply.  [[Page H2688]]    It is essential that our nation make investments in infrastructure  because it enables trade, powers businesses, connects workers to  employment, creates opportunities for struggling communities, protects  the nation from an increasingly unpredictable natural environment, and  allows the country to respond to the COVID-19 Pandemic.   Mr. Speaker, our nation's airports experienced a significant economic  impact due to COVID-19 and the level of support to airports and  airlines has been generous, but not enough, especially regarding what I  have learned about airport parking service areas.   I thank the Rules Committee and the Committee on Transportation and  Infrastructure for allowing the Jackson Lee amendment that requests a  report on all areas at airports that have not received funding and asks  that funding be prioritized for these areas, which include airport  parking.   There are two Jackson Lee Amendments H.R. 2 that are important to the  constituents I serve, so I will continue to work with the Committee and  leadership as the bill moves through Congress to have these concerns  addressed.   The Jackson Lee resolutions were intended to protect documented and  locally recognized historic places in the areas planned for development  in anticipation of the designation of a National Historic Trail that  would travers the area of Houston where planned I-45 construction will  occur.   Earlier this year, H.R. 434, the Emancipation National Historic Trail  Report Act became law and it paves the way for the establishment of  only the second nationally, recognized historic trail that chronicles  the experience of African Americans in their struggle for equality and  justice.   The law directs the National Parks Service to conduct a study of 51  miles starting at the historic Osterman Building and Reedy Chapel in  Galveston, Texas, the location where news spread of the Emancipation  Proclamation finally freeing the last slaves in the United States.   The historic trail will follow a path along Highway 3 and Interstate  45, north to Freedmen's Town, which will include Independence Heights,  and Emancipation Park in Houston, Texas where freed slaves settled.   Local preservationists have labored for generations to secure  historic sites in and around the planned route of the proposed new  national historic trail and have lost significant buildings to past  highway projects, specifically to those projects related to past I-45  construction, which cuts through Independence Heights the first black  town to receive a charter from the state of Texas.   The project, which has not begun yet is scheduled to begin in 2021  and is expected to cost at least $7 billion and will rebuild most of  the downtown freeway system along I-45, Interstate 10, Interstate 69  and Texas 288 and assorted ramps.   These plans for I-45 construction should trigger National Historic  Preservation Act obligations because the National Parks Service has a  Study to conduct regarding the history of the area.   Unfortunately, some may consider that once a historic place is  removed, the ability of researchers, historians or preservationists to  tell a complete history is limited-and in some essential ways they are  correct.   History is best experienced and not just heard or read, which is why  we must preserve and protect the places that are left for future  generations.   I will continue to work with the Committee of Jurisdiction an the  Jackson Lee Amendment that compliments the programs described in  section 1619 Nationwide Road Safety Assessment of H.R. 2.   Section 1619 establishes a program for states to focus on the issue  of pedestrian and bicycle safety.   The Jackson Lee Amendment seeks to include in this program a role for  local governments who are foremost at the head of efforts to reduce  pedestrian and bicycle deaths and injuries.   On a national basis, about 25 percent of pedestrian fatalities in  2018 occurred at intersections or were intersection-related.   Most pedestrian fatalities occurred at non-intersection locations.   The total number of pedestrian fatalities for the 10 largest cities  increased by about 7 percent from 2017, with 613 fatalities to 2018  with 655 fatalities.   During the 10-year period 2009-2018 the number of pedestrian  fatalities increased by 53 percent, while the number of all other  traffic deaths increased by 2 percent.   On average, about 17 pedestrians and two cyclists were killed each  day in crashes. Together they accounted for one-fifth of traffic  deaths. (NYT)   The Jackson Lee Amendment broadens the section to address safety and  the emerging popularity of other forms of personal transportation such  as electric scooters.   The Jackson Lee Amendment supports local efforts to address the  conditions that may contribute to deaths to improve pedestrian and  bicycle safety.   A rough count by The Associated Press of media reports turned up at  least 11 electric scooter rider deaths in the U.S. since the beginning  of 2018.   In Austin, Texas, public health officials working with the Centers  for Disease Control counted 192 scooter-related injuries in three  months in 2018. Nearly half were head injuries, including 15 percent  that were traumatic brain injuries like concussions and bleeding of the  brain. Less than 1 percent of the injured riders wore a helmet.   According to a Consumer Reports survey conducted in March 2019, 22  percent of people who have spent time in an area where they saw e- scooters available for rent said they had used one at least once.   They found that many scooter riders (27 percent) are uncertain of the  traffic laws they should follow.   Among people who have ridden an e-scooter, 51 percent ride on the  sidewalk, 26 percent in a bike lane, and 18 percent in the street but  not in a bike lane.   The role of local government is essential to addressing the problem  of pedestrian and bicycle injuries and deaths.   This Jackson Lee Amendment is supported by: Advocates for Highway and  Auto Safety, Transport Workers Union, Consumer Federation of America,  Center for Auto Safety, Consumers for Auto Reliability and Safety,  Truck Safety Coalition, Citizens for Reliable and Safe Highways,  Parents Against Tired Truckers, and the Trauma Foundation.   More generally, I support the Moving Forward Act because it provides:   1. $100 billion for affordable housing to create or preserve 1.8  million affordable homes;   2. $10 billion for child care facilities, designed to generate  additional state and private investments;   3. $130 billion for school infrastructure targeted at high-poverty  schools; and   4. $30 billion for health care facilities, including hospitals,  community health centers, and laboratories.   Mr. Speaker, the Moving Forward Act connects all Americans to  essential services and economic opportunity by providing:   1. $500 billion to rebuild and reimagine the nation's transportation  infrastructure;   2. $100 billion for affordable high-speed broadband internet for all  Americans;   3. $25 billion for the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund and other  programs to provide clean drinking water; and   4. $25 billion for the United States Postal Service to modernize  postal infrastructure and operations.   All of this infrastructure funding I have fought for. Also, there are  additional provisions in the bill that will help put us on the path to  becoming a stronger, safer, better and more prosperous America,  including:   1. Ameliorating hazardous living conditions and building a more  environmentally sustainable housing stock;   2. Removing contaminants like PFAS from drinking water; and   3. Modernizing our energy infrastructure with an emphasis on  renewable energy.   While this legislation would be necessary under any circumstances,  the coronavirus crisis has magnified and accentuated the need for  federal investments to put Americans back to work building a long- lasting foundation for a stronger and more equitable America.   I urge all Members to vote for the rule governing debate on H.R. 2 as  well as the underlying bill.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Oregon, the  chairman of this committee, and I rise enthusiastically for H.R. 2  because we need to move forward.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman (Mr. DeFazio). For 20 years I have  been on this floor fighting for mass transit and the expansion of such  and to allow cities like Houston that were delayed 20 years because of  opposition by my friends on the other side of the aisle, and we are  finally getting a robust commitment to not only fixing roads and  schools and housing, but also to dealing with mass transit. We worked  on it for a long time.   I want to thank the committee for accepting my amendment dealing with  COVID-19. Right now, in Houston, as I rush back to my city, we have the  largest number of cases. We have people dying. We have people walking  into emergency rooms because they are sick themselves just coming in.   This amendment deals with the aviation area and the airports where  money has been given, but, in fact, money has been left out for  different businesses, like parking. This amendment requires FAA to  assess all of the businesses that have been left out and to prioritize  them in our next funding, and I thank the gentleman for that.   But let me, as well, speak about what I know is important in the bill  and impacts a project called I-45 in Houston, Texas. This project would  erase 158 houses, 433 apartments, 486 condos.   I include in the Record an article from the Houston Chronicle about  the I-45 project, dated June 7, 2020.                 [From the Houston Chronicle, June 7, 2020]    I-45 Project Leaves Neighbors in Limbo: Critics Fearful for Record                       Number Who Could be Displaced                              (By Dug Begley)         Wherever Armando Litchenberger looks around Urbana       Recording Studio, there are memories. The stool Jose       Feliciano sat on to record a couple tracks. Goldie Hawn used       the studio to mix the soundtrack for a TV movie she directed.       Duran Duran recut a guitar track that didn't test well while       on a world tour.        ``There are memories here that are not replaceable,''       Litchenberger said as he showed off the Near Northside       performance room where the neighborhood's de facto house       band, La Mafia, recorded the songs that won four Grammys,       which now sit a glass trophy case a few feet from the       soundboard.        Beatles memorabilia and signed posters from hundreds of       musicians and celebrities line the walls, but it is a pin in       the parking lot that draws Litchenberger's attention these       days. Driven in by a surveyor, the pin marks the property       line for a wider Interstate 45.        ``If I stay, I'll be right on the freeway,'' Litchenberger       said. ``I would have to close this off and make it a double       cinder block wall to close off the sound.''        The I-45 project's toll on local property owners would be       unprecedented for TxDOT in Houston, potentially relocating       hundreds of families and businesses. Estimated to cost at       least $7 billion, the project will rebuild I-45 from downtown       Houston north to Beltway 8, and change how it connects with       other downtown freeways.        That means rebuilding--by removing--pieces of Fifth Ward,       the Northside, Acres Homes and Aldine. Spots south of North       Main where third-generation Latino residents help neighbors       work on cars in their driveway. Or Tidwell, which bustles       with activity as the commercial center and is the only place       within walking distance of her apartment where Shondrae       McBride, 26, can get her nails done, pick up marinated carne       asada and drop off her husband's cellphone for repair across       from a Pho restaurant.        ``Not everybody has a car to get around,'' McBride said.        Removing some of those businesses, she said, would ``add       hours'' to her typical errands.        The latest estimates show the rebuild would impact--the       catchword for any structure or dwelling directly touched by       the changing road boundary--158 houses, 433 apartments or       condos, 486 public housing units, 340 businesses, five       churches and two schools. The Houston Police Department would       need to relocate its south central police station and the       Mexican Consulate in the Museum District, adjacent to I-69,       will move to a Westchasearea location.        Mayor Sylvester Turner has called the project       ``transformative'' but also called on TxDOT to revise the       designs north of downtown to impact fewer homes and       businesses while remaining on track to start construction       downtown in a matter of months. Work is slated to begin north       of Interstate 10 by 2024.        When the work actually begins will depend on decisions made       this year and next that some, including Harris County Judge       Lina Hidalgo, worry will displace a historic number of people       before getting a full public review despite more than 15       years of planning. Hidalgo and others have called on TxDOT to       delay final decisions, which could push back the start of       construction for months as more public meetings are planned.        ``Given the impacts of the COVID-19 disaster, this delay       would give the county and its residents more time to engage       with and offer feedback,'' Hidalgo wrote in May.        TxDOT officials have said they welcome the city and       county's input, with state Transportation Commissioner Laura       Ryan, of Houston, saying the goal is a project that ``will       work, for the most part, for as many people as possible.''        That still leaves the question of how many people will have       to get out of the way.                             Benefits, at a cost         For those entirely displaced by TxDOT's freeway plans,       whether a renter, homeowner or business owner, the outcome of       discussions between TxDOT and the city could determine       whether they stay or go. Some of the changes under       consideration will mean the difference between their home or       apartment being adjacent to the freeway--or demolished and a       part of it.        Other questions remain, such as how much owners and renters       will be compensated and where that money will allow them to       go. Renters will scramble to find nearby housing they can       afford. Those receiving assistance with housing will wade       back into a crowded system.        ``There are some properties some residents could go to, but       there is not enough room,'' said Arveyiel Fortilla, a       resident of the Houston Housing Authority public complex       Kelly Village, who has followed the process closely.        Housing advocates, such as Amy Dinn with Lone Star Legal       Aid, said the potential displacements--some all but       inevitable--could strand public housing residents between       agencies as TxDOT works with local housing officials and city       leaders to come to agreement. The most likely outcome is       TxDOT provides local agencies funding and, perhaps, property       to relocate residents.  [[Page H2949]]         At a December meeting about the project, Dinn said many       fear the city will not be a good custodian of those housing       dollars if TxDOT decides to simply cut a check. The Houston       Housing Authority, she said, faces a housing crunch       throughout the city, not just along I-45.        ``The concern is they are going to take that money and not       help those communities,'' Dinn said.        The payoff, supporters argue, is a much-needed rebuild of       the region's freeway spine and downtown system.        ``We are building this project for the next 50 to 75       years,'' said Eliza Paul, district director for TxDOT in the       Houston region.        Beneficiaries of an improved freeway include tens of       thousands of people from Conroe southward who rely on I-45       for daily commutes or trips south to Houston and beyond.        A new freeway and new intersections built to modern       standards, proponents note, will mean major bottlenecks are       relieved and traffic can flow more efficiently--and more       safely--in and around downtown. Preliminary estimates project       traffic speeds will increase by 24 miles per hour, an       unheard-of leap for a freeway project within Loop 610.        Pulling off those improvements, however, means a much       larger freeway, with TxDOT buying an additional 450 acres of       Houston property to go with the 1,207 acres the freeway       already occupies. At the northwest and southeast corners of       the I-45 and Loop 610 interchange, easing the tight curves of       the existing ramps means remaking them right through nearby       single family homes.        ``You work and save for years to buy a house, and somebody       comes by and tells you they're taking it. It's just not       right,'' said Colleen Wirth, whose house southeast of the       crossing is spared, but will have a sound wall running along       the back yard.                              Differing visions         To find anything comparable in terms of homes affected by       the I-45 project, one has to go back more than 50 years when       freeways barged through some of the city's poorest       neighborhoods. When TxDOT remade the I-10 and U.S. 59       interchange in 1959, the new configuration claimed more than       500 flood-prone homes along Buffalo Bayou in Fifth Ward. The       I-45 interchange with Loop 610 cut Independence Heights       practically in half in the late 1950s.        It is a legacy of freeway building over the oppressed,       community groups argue, that continues to today. As anger       over the killing of George Floyd spilled into the streets,       some argued the systematic issues extend to public       infrastructure.        ``The cries demanding action emanating from the protests       taking place throughout the country have been fueled by the       stark reality that racism permeates our lives,'' wrote       Bakeyah Nelson, executive director of Air Alliance Houston,       in a letter to supporters. ``This shapes how people perceive       us and how they choose to interact or don't interact with us       . . . It allows for thoughtless decisions to be made about       our communities, such as where to put the next concrete batch       plant or whether to expand a highway that will cause the       displacement of entire neighborhoods.''        City officials, who in the past year have increased their       focus on the enormous toll the project will have on       neighborhoods bordering the freeway between Tidwell and White       Oak Bayou, are trying to avoid a repeat of that kind of       upheaval.        ``I think part of the city's goals are to honor the       neighborhoods around the freeway, and the wishes of the       people,'' said Margaret Wallace Brown, the city's planning       director.        Many of the people are worried.        In Independence Heights, the project will scrape away more       of the history of Texas' first black-formed municipality. It       is more than just the small wooden row houses built on block       foundations or the triangle of churches that form the core of       the community, said Tanya Debose, executive director of the       Independence Heights Redevelopment Council.        ``It's the people that make a place,'' she said, noting as       residences are removed the inhabitants move to other       neighborhoods. ``We're going to get squeezed, until there is       nothing left.''        Following two rounds of community meetings by planning       officials, Mayor Turner encouraged TxDOT to reconsider many       features of the freeway redesign, including staying entirely       within the existing right of way north of downtown ``as much       as possible.''        For example, the city is asking TxDOT to remove planned       frontage roads northwest of the Loop 610 interchange and add       two bus-only lanes to the center rather than four express       lanes similar to the Katy Managed Lanes along I-10.        While building two bus lanes instead of four managed lanes       would limit the need for property along the freeway's edges,       it also would reduce some of the benefits to automobile       travelers--who will continue to far outnumber transit uses       for the foreseeable future.        For that reason, the changes proposed by the city already       have been met with some concern.        ``Are we really improving mobility in this area,'' asked       Galveston County Precinct 4 Commissioner Ken Clark, chairman       of the region's Transportation Policy Council. ``With the       type of money we are spending on this project and the loss of       the HOV lanes, are we really getting improvement?''                                 Left behind         As the decision to redesign segments proceeds, property       owners remain in limbo--likely affected, but not certain how.       In Litchenberger's case, the neighborhood molded him, and       seeing it change comes with some worry.        The Northside is where members of La Mafia--Litchenberger       is the accordionist and producer of the four-time Grammy-      winning Tejano group--formed and where the friends started a       musical journey entering its fourth decade. When they went on       a national tour in 1993, the North Street bridge in view of       the studio is where the trucks and buses lined up.        ``All that will be gone,'' Litchenberger said, noting the       bridge will be demolished to make way for the wider freeway       and frontage roads. ``There is a lot of history here, around       here, that will just be gone.''        The studio is just a part of that, a gem in the community       that because of the bayou and freeway barriers has felt       segregated and on its own. The neighborhood will lose homes,       with those owners and renters likely heading elsewhere.       Businesses will decide whether to wait out slow sales years       during construction, or pack up.        ``They're coming for us,'' Miguel Castaneda said as he left       a convenience store near Fulton and Cavalcade. ``They're       cleaning it up and then everybody here can go somewhere else       so the developers can move in.''        Businesses and residents of downtown, East Downtown and       Third Ward face a brighter picture. Turner and others concede       some of the downtown changes are necessary to fix some of the       bottlenecks that bedevil commuting. That will leave some       people most in need the least protected at Clayton Homes and       Kelly Village, two city-run public housing developments.        ``If they do this without giving us someplace to go, they       are contributing to the homeless population,'' Fortilla said.        At Clayton Homes, along Buffalo Bayou at the junction of I-      69 and I-10, the project is taking all 296 units, many of       which were never rebuilt after Tropical Storm Harvey sent the       bayou into at least six apartment buildings. TxDOT has       offered $90 million for Clayton Homes with the understanding       it would pay the money up front and give Houston Housing       Authority time to build new affordable apartments somewhere       close by and give housing vouchers to residents who want       them.        The effect on Kelly Village is less substantial, but could       leave residents in even more uncertainty. Fifty of the 270       units at Kelly Village will be destroyed by the freeway       expansion, while the rest will remain closer to a larger       freeway. Those losing their homes will have the option of       taking a voucher or get priority to move into available       housing.        Many in the complex, Fortilla said, are resigned to being       scattered and given scarce options.        ``They have just given up already to what happens,'' she       said. ``When a person is used to being beaten up, they don't       know any other way.''     Mr. Speaker, let me, just for a moment, say that I  would like to enter into a colloquy with Mr. DeFazio about this part of  the project.   It would cause the loss of 486 public housing units, 340 businesses,  5 churches, 2 schools. There are additional concerns that the community  is raising and, yes, the oldest Black city in the State of Texas--maybe  even in the Nation--called Independence Heights. Even a historic trail  that is now law called the Emancipation Trail may be impacted. These  vulnerable people are not being listened to.   There is a lot going on.   I ask the chairman to respond to the good elements in this bill that  would be a litmus test for this project.    Will the gentleman yield?  [[Page H2950]]         Let me thank the gentleman, and I will continue to  work on this with the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.   I want this bill to be passed in the Senate. I want this bill to  become law because there are millions of Americans waiting for this  bill, H.R. 2, to save them and help them, particularly those in Houston  regarding I-45.    Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in support of the  Amendment to H.R. 2 designated as En Bloc C and specifically to the  inclusion of the Jackson Lee Amendment that directs the FAA to report  on areas of the airport system that have not received COVID-19 related  funding.   H.R. 2, the Moving Forward Act, is a more than $1.5 trillion plan to  rebuild American infrastructure--not only our roads, airports, bridges,  and transit systems, but also our schools, housing, broadband access,  and so much more.   It has come to my attention that certain support functions essential  to airport operations have not received COVID-19 funding.   Mr. Speaker, this transformational legislation makes robust  investments in the infrastructure necessary to support the wellbeing of  all Americans and connect them with the services and opportunities  needed to succeed in the global economy, which will create millions of  American jobs rebuilding our country, so desperately needed in light of  its wreckage by the COVID-19 pandemic.   Mr. Speaker, our nation's airports experienced a significant economic  impact due to COVID-19 and the level of support to airports and  airlines has been generous, but not enough, especially regarding what I  have learned about airport parking service areas.   It has come to my attention that certain support functions essential  to the smooth operation of our nation's busiest airports.   One area of concern is airport parking, which is vital to the smooth  operation of our nation's busiest airports.   Airports serving our nation's largest metropolitan areas that serve  hundreds of millions of passengers collectively include:   Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL) that receives  103 Million Passengers,   Los Angeles International Airport (LAX)--84.5 Million Passengers,   O'Hare International Airport (ORD)--79.8 Million Passengers, and  Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport (DFW)--75 Million Passengers.   Workers and support services for parking and other essential services  need and deserve support from COVID-19 funding.   This Jackson Lee Amendment seeks a report from the FAA and directs  that the next opportunity for funding for COVID-19 should prioritize  areas that have not yet received funding.   I ask my Colleagues to support this En Bloc and the underlying bill.
