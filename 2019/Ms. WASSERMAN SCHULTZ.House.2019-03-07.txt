 Mr. Speaker, one thing we are all reminded of  this week is that words have power, and divisive words cause pain.  Every Jewish person in America, no matter where they are from, could  share a story of deeply painful anti-Semitism that they have personally  experienced. For me, at its worst, Nazi-obsessed internet trolls  mercilessly taunted my children with Holocaust threats too vile for me  to describe on this floor.   This pain is frequently felt by all too many Americans. How you look  or speak, whom you love, or where you live and pray can still invite  unwanted and potentially dangerous words of hostility.   The conversation today about anti-Semitism, allegiance, and loyalty  is necessary because remaining silent against hatred and bigotry is not  an option.   I am a second-generation American on both sides of my family. Two  generations later, it was possible for me to become a Member of the  U.S. Congress--only in America. So, questioning my allegiance is  painful and personal.   Unfortunately, this dual loyalty question is not isolated to Jews.  Words have power. We must carefully choose our words and make sure that  we use them to unite us and not to divide us.
