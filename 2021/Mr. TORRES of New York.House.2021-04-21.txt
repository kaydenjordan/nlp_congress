 Madam Speaker, according to The Washington  Post, the administration plans to propose only a temporary rather than  a permanent expansion of the child tax credit.   Allowing the child tax credit to expire in 2025 is a colossal  misjudgment whose consequences we could live to regret.   We cannot and should not be the party that cuts child poverty in half  only until 2025. We should and must be the party that champions a  permanent breakthrough against child poverty.   Instead of making the most of our FDR and LBJ moment, we are in  danger of inexplicably putting an expiration date on our own legacy.  Did President Roosevelt put an expiration date on Social Security? Did  President Johnson put an expiration date on Medicare? Why should we put  an expiration date on the Social Security and Medicare of our own time?   I urge President Biden to make his greatest achievement a permanent  legacy.                            ____________________
