 Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation  with my colleague from Wisconsin, Senator Baldwin, that would require  the Secretary of Health and Human Services to convene a panel to  develop a national strategy to recognize and support the more than  forty million family caregivers in the United States. I am pleased that  Senators Murkowski and Bennet have joined us as cosponsors.   The United States' population is aging. Every day, 10,000 baby  boomers turn 65 years old. Americans 85 and older--our oldest old--are  the fastest growing segment of our population. This is the population  that is most at risk of multiple and interacting health problems that  can lead to disability and the need for round-the-clock care.   At the very time that our population is aging, birth rates are  declining. While the need for care and support is increasing, the  numbers of professional and informal caregivers is shrinking. In the  future, more people will have to rely on fewer caregivers.   Families will likely continue to be the most important source of  support for people with long-term care needs. We must do more to  support the more than 43 million family caregivers in the United States  who make remarkable sacrifices to care for their loved ones. While it  is impossible to put a dollar amount to the value of the devotion,  time, and services that these caregivers provide, it is estimated that  in 2013 family caregivers provided $470 billion in uncompensated long- term care. This figure nearly equals the annual sales of the four  largest United States tech companies combined.   Family caregivers provide tremendous value, and they also face many  challenges. Caregivers experience high levels of stress and have a  greater incidence of chronic conditions like heart disease, diabetes,  and depression. Caregiving can be an isolating experience. Last week,  the Aging Committee held a hearing highlighting that social isolation  is a serious risk factor for depression, anxiety, dementia, functional  decline, and even death.   The average caregiver is a 49-year-old woman. She is caring for a 69- year-old relative living with a long-term physical condition. That  relative is often a parent. She has been providing care for four years  on average, spending 24.4 hours a week. She may be raising her own  children and working full time.   Other caregivers are seniors. One third of family caregivers are age  65 or older, and even more susceptible to putting their own health at  risk.   I am, therefore, introducing legislation with my colleague from  Wisconsin that would lead to the development of a national strategy to  recognize and support family caregivers. Titled the Recognize, Assist,  Include, Support, and Engage, or RAISE Family Caregivers Act, the  legislation is based on a recommendation of the bipartisan Commission  on Long Term Care. It is modeled after a law that I co-authored in 2010  with then-Senator Evan Bayh that created a coordinated strategic  national plan to combat Alzheimer's disease.   The RAISE Family Caregivers Act directs the Secretary of Health and  Human Services to establish a National Family Caregiving Project to  develop and sustain a national strategy to support family caregivers.  The bill would create a Family Caregiving Advisory Council comprised of  relevant Federal agencies and non-federal members. It would include  representatives of family caregivers, older adults with long-term care  needs, individuals with disabilities, employers, health and social  service providers, advocates for family caregivers, state and local  officials, and others with expertise in family caregiving.   The Advisory Council would be charged with making recommendations to  the Secretary. The strategy and plan would be updated to reflect new  developments. The plan would include an initial inventory and  assessment of federally funded caregiver efforts. It would then  identify specific actions that government and communities could take to  support family caregivers.   The Project would be funded from existing funding appropriated for  the Department of Health and Human Services. No new funding is  authorized and it would sunset in five years.   Family caregivers are an invaluable resource to our aging society.  Chances are that, sooner or later, we will all either be family  caregivers or someone who needs one. The RAISE Family Caregivers Act  will launch a coordinated, national strategic plan that will help us to  leverage our resources, promote innovation and promising practices, and  provide our nation's family caregivers with much-needed recognition and  support. Our bipartisan legislation is widely endorsed by aging and  disability organizations. I urge all of our colleagues to join as  cosponsors.                                  ______                                         By Mr. DAINES:   S. 1031. A bill to amend provisions in the securities laws relating  to regulation crowdfunding to raise the dollar amount limit and to  clarify certain requirements and exclusions for funding portals  established by such an Act; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and  Urban Affairs.
