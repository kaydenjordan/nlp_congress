 Mr. Speaker, I congratulate a constituent, a resident  of the 13th District of Michigan, Candice Jackson, for winning the  Teacher of the Year award.   As we observe Teacher Appreciation Week, I also want to draw  attention to over 36,000 teaching posts left vacant this year. The  newest figures show that the top income a teacher might earn in 17  percent of the school districts, even with 30 years of service and a  Ph.D., is only $60,000. This is intolerable.   As a cosponsor of the American Teacher Act, I am proud to advocate  for our teachers. We must ensure that our educators earn at least  $60,000, not at most. Our teachers deserve our gratitude, respect, and  just compensation. Together, we will make this a reality for them.                            ____________________
