 Mr. Speaker, I am proud to stand here today in favor  of the Conference Report on the Fiscal Year 24 NDAA. This conference  report is the result of bipartisan efforts to strengthen our national  defense while supporting our military members, families, and  communities. I would like to thank Senator Reed, Senator Wicker,  Chairman Rogers, and Ranking Member Smith for their leadership  throughout the entire process to produce this bipartisan bill.   I would also like to thank Chairman Waltz of the Readiness  Subcommittee for his partnership, Jeanine Womble the readiness PSM, my  MLA Rob Hurd, and my Defense Fellow Taylor Brunstad. I am proud of the  work we have done to protect the Readiness of our Armed forces. This  bill continues our work, along with our Senate colleagues, to support  military families by providing more childcare centers, protect basic  healthcare rights for women service member, support energy resiliency  on our bases, increase base pay to retain and recruit top talent, and  demand DoD accountability and transparency on spending to prevent  wasteful use of taxpayer dollars.   It is of vital importance to me to support our servicemembers and  their families at bases like Travis Air force Base and ensure they have  the housing, training, equipment, and quality of life they need and  deserve. I am proud to continue my work to serve the men and women in  my district, and to serve the brave men and women volunteering to  protect our freedom. While this bill is a strong bipartisan effort to  support the military, there is still more to be done and I look forward  to building on these efforts in the years ahead.
