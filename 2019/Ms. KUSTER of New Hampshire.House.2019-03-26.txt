 Madam Speaker, the truth is I believe  there is common ground within our Caucus and within the Congress as a  whole on how to improve access to healthcare for every single American.   We can all agree that we must reduce the cost of health insurance and  prescription drugs and we must protect millions of Americans with  preexisting conditions. That is why I am so excited this week to work  with my colleagues on the Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Health  and the New Democratic Coalition to put forward proposals that will  make a real difference in the lives of families in New Hampshire and  all across this great country.   Earlier this month, I joined my new Democratic colleagues in pushing  for efforts to strengthen the Affordable Care Act and continue the path  toward affordable, accessible universal healthcare coverage. Today, I  am excited that we are putting our ideas into action by introducing  this pivotal healthcare bill.   Access to affordable healthcare has long been a top priority of mine.  I was proud to unveil solutions over politics in the last Congress.   We cannot turn back the clock on the progress we have made. The time  to improve healthcare for all is now.                            ____________________
