 Madam Speaker, today, I rise to honor an august leader  within my hometown community in western North Carolina, a proven  entrepreneur and a great business leader who is about to open a second  quick-service restaurant in my district, which will employ over 100  people.   Not only will this restaurant employ 100 people, this restaurant will  also feed 100 families. This restaurant will help house 100 families.   Not only will these employees get to have the honor of being able to  earn a living to provide for their families, but they will also be  under the careful tutelage of their new employer, Joel Benson, who  everyone in my community will recognize is one of the most influential  people in my district. Joel is excellent at maximizing the potential in  everyone in his care and in his sphere of influence.   Today, I rise to honor a great mentor of mine and a great business  leader who is providing jobs and a strong economy to North Carolina,  Joel Benson.   Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Benson for his service to our community.                            ____________________
