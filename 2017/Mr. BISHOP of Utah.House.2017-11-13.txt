 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the  gentleman from Utah (Mr. Curtis) be permitted to take the oath of  office today.   His certificate of election has not arrived, but there is no contest  and no question has been raised with regard to his election.    Mr. Speaker, I hope you realize you just swore in  another vote for sage grouse.   Utah, for too long, has been at 75 percent. We are now united at a  full 100 percent, which means, Mr. Amodei, be  [[Page H9157]]  careful: we are going to reannex eastern Nevada.   Mr. Curtis comes here with a background of being mayor of Provo City,  so he understands local government. He is going to be a fine addition  to our body. I look forward to it.   As he has taken the place of Jason Chaffetz, he is going to be in Mr.  Chaffetz's office.   I just want you to know, as you are getting settled in and before you  find your proper bed, I think I can get you a good deal on a used cot.   I am pleased to yield to the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Curtis), our  new Representative.
