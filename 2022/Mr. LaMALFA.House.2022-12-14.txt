 Madam Speaker, I have had a chance on several occasions  to visit our southern border between the U.S. and Mexico. Of course, I  wish our people in the White House would take the time. It is a very  important thing. There are not more important things for the President  and the Vice President to do than to see firsthand the mess we have  among our four border States, but truly the effect it has, as every  State is a border State because they flow so far into our country.   What are we looking at here? Four million encounters with illegal  immigrants crossing our southern border in the last 2 years; an amazing  amount.   Under President Trump, we had the most secure border we had in years.  It wasn't perfect, but strides were being made with the many, many  miles of fence that had been put up.  [[Page H9743]]    Since the Biden administration kicked in, the effort to continue to  build the fence was frozen. We have stacks and stacks of materials  lying there, many millions of dollars' worth of materials just laying  there in the various spots across the border staged to be completed.   When I visited the Arizona portion, you could see where there were  maybe 50 or 100 feet of fence, and there would be an area that would be  contained where it would be much, much easier for the Border Patrol to  do their jobs and keep whatever problems there are funneled in fewer  areas, making their task much simpler to keep track.   Instead, with the deluge of immigrants, really an invasion that is  happening, their job is much, much more difficult and less about  patrolling the border and more about processing.   Indeed, when I was there, they have vans to go pick people up and  bring them even faster to the processing center and then turn them  loose in our country.                                time  1145    This is a really backwards policy, and it makes me really wonder  whose side is this administration on.   The needs of the American people, or some kind of political gain by  having a wide-open border?   I do not understand it. The numbers are huge.   Of course, it is the numbers of people coming across as well as the  illegal drugs; the fentanyl. You have heard time and time and time  again the stories. I guess the press doesn't really want to report a  lot of that; we hear it here and there. But the amount of people being  harmed by the fentanyl getting to everything is amazing. Yet, the  border remains porous.   The only State doing something about it is Texas. All those States  don't really have the rights to do Federal border patrol or closure.  They are at least making an effort down there to stem the tide.   We are in a state of crisis along the border. Millions cross every  year with no consequence. We expect them maybe to come back for a  hearing, if indeed they are eligible for an asylum hearing, but that is  really naive.   So there are plenty of tools already in the law to stop it. We don't  really need reform on immigration. We need to enforce the rules we  have.   Yet, what is the direction we are going?   We are going to see title 42, which is able to make limitations due  to the healthcare crisis because of COVID. They want to let that go to  the sidelines now, getting rid of title 42.   We already have a crisis. We already have a giant wave coming in.  This is just going to exacerbate it. We already have gigantic problems  that will be added to by letting title 42 expire.   Every country that is a country has borders and laws on that. Why is  the U.S. different now under the Biden administration and under  Democrat rule that we are not allowed to enforce our borders?   And indeed, the issue, as you squish the balloon, now we are seeing  an effect on the Canadian border, something that hasn't been talked  about a lot.   Mexican nationals are finding that it is easier with the backlog we  have on the southern border to be able to take a flight up into Canada,  because they have lifted most of their restrictions on entry and exit,  and come through from Canada into the United States. Those numbers are  increasing dramatically.   The data reflects a 91 percent increase from the prior fiscal year,  and going higher. So if it is easier to come as a Mexican national  through Canada, then that is just going to continue to be a larger  problem. But we already have enough to deal with on the southern  border; if we would just do the job.   As President Biden said last spring, let's fill the gaps that we  have. At least fill just the gaps, if you don't want to make miles and  miles of fence. It will make the Border Patrol job much easier. But  truly, we need to do the whole job because we are not a sovereign  nation if we don't have a border, if we don't enforce it.   Now, we will get called racist. We will get called hateful. Because  those are just the standard arguments these days for just about  anything.   It is not that. We have a right and an obligation to enforce that and  bring people over that want to come legally, with visas. That is the  way to do things, not just a wide-open, porous border.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, nuclear power, hydropower, biofuels, solar,  and wind are all positive sources of energy. They take advantage of  available resources and bring high-paying technical jobs to rural  areas, especially.   However, forcing people into renewable sources of energy only will  not help families immediately heat their homes this winter or next.   Right now, in California, renewable energy accounts for roughly one- third of our power grid, depending on whether or not you count  hydroelectric power, which large power plants aren't counted, for some  arbitrary reason in our State.   Each summer, we face rolling blackouts throughout the State. Each  winter, mountain towns face power shortages due to snowstorms knocking  down power lines.   At this moment, natural gas and oil remain by far the most efficient  and affordable sources of energy, a fact that the Biden administration  must accept.   Renewable energy won't do the whole job. Yet, what are they doing?  They are attacking oil and gas, which is based on some idea of  CO2. I remind you that CO2 is only 0.04 percent  of our atmosphere. It is dwarfed by all the others. Even trace gases  are about equal.    Yet, we are hell-bent on getting rid of CO2 and making  people unable to use the energy they need, do their jobs, heat their  homes, et cetera.                            ____________________
