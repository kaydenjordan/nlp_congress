 Mr. President, I am here on the floor to talk about the  economy, what is going on, on the jobs front, and where we go from  here.   Last week, the Department of Labor issued its most recent jobs  report. It showed that we added 266,000 jobs in April. That was about  one quarter of what was predicted. It was disappointing. It shows that  the job growth coming out of the pandemic has now slowed. There is a  question as to why, since there are so many jobs out there. How is it  that there can be so many jobs available, and yet we have such a  disappointing April jobs report? The demand for workers is certainly  high.   The other thing going on out there is that we have creeping  inflation. We learned this past week that the Consumer Price Index rose  4.2 percent between April 2020 and April 2021. So the year, April to  April, is the highest 12-month increase going back to the summer of  2008.   There is this whole debate going on about whether there is inflation  or not. Well, I would ask you to talk to your constituents because they  will tell you there is inflation. There is inflation at the gas pump;  there is inflation at the grocery store; there is inflation if you are  trying to build something. There is inflation throughout the economy  right now, and that should concern every American. It is because of  policy choices, but it doesn't have to be this way.   What this argument boils down to with regard to jobs and with regard  to inflation are really two very different approaches and philosophies  of government and how to create jobs, how to increase wages, and how to  help working families.   The Biden administration believes the government needs to spend more  to prime the pump. This is despite our being told by every economic  analysis, including our own nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office,  that without any new stimulus at the beginning of this year, we were  going to see the economy come back strongly. In fact, all of the  studies showed that the rate of growth this year was going to be 4  percent or more without any stimulus, without any new spending, and  that, by  [[Page S2505]]  midyear, according to the Congressional Budget Office, we would be back  to the prepandemic economy and economic growth. Yet the Biden  administration is insisting on priming the pump, putting more money out  there. The $1.9 trillion spending package was all about that.   Some of us raised concerns about it and warned people about this. By  the way, one of us who did this was Larry Summers, who was the  Secretary of the Treasury under a Democratic administration and who is  a prominent economist on the other side of the aisle. He said this--and  he was right--that this risked overheating an economy that was already  growing and would result in inflation. Unfortunately, the massive  stimulus seems to have exactly done that.   Unfortunately, now there is another wave of spending that is being  projected. Over $4 trillion is being proposed in new spending in  addition to the $1.9 trillion, two new packages the President talked  about in his address to Congress last month. It is interesting because,  even though inflation is going up and even though the jobs market is  disappointing, it seems like the administration isn't changing course.   One thing the administration is not changing course on is that it  wants to continue to pay people a substantial amount not to work. Now,  in my view, during the COVID-19 crisis--at the heat of it--we needed to  do something to help people who had lost their jobs through no fault of  their own, and the States' unemployment systems were the places to do  that. So we added a Federal supplement on top of the State unemployment  benefit.   In Ohio, the State pays about $360 a week, on average, which is about  half of whatever your salary was or your income was, and we added $300  on top of that. Think about that. Instead of $360, it is $660 per week,  on average. That means that, for 42 percent of the people who are on  unemployment insurance--this is a national figure--they are making more  on unemployment than they were at work. So a lot of people have made  the logical decision and say: Why should I be going back to work?   Unfortunately, when the President has been asked about this, he has  said:         I know there's been a lot of discussion . . . that people       are being paid to stay home rather than going to work. Well,       we don't see much evidence of that.    With all due respect, I hope the President will talk to some of the  business owners who I am talking to, particularly small businesses. The  numbers tell a different story.   According to the most recent Labor Department data released just this  week, at the end of March, we had 8.1 million job openings in America.  That was 8.1 million jobs open. We all know that because we are back in  our States, as we will be later today or tomorrow, and we will see the  ``help wanted'' signs. By the way, that is the highest number in  history. We have never had 8 million jobs open in America.    Based on this Labor Department study, the job increases were broadly  distributed, 185,000 new job openings in restaurants and hospitality-- as they are getting going, many of these restaurants are saying: This  is great. We have the people coming back, but we can't find workers.  There are 155,000 in State and local education and 81,000 in  entertainment.   With that demand for workers and the coronavirus pandemic  substantially improving, the employment numbers should be skyrocketing.  We should be seeing so many people going back to work. This is an  opportunity for people to go back, to get into their careers, and get  back to the dignity and self-respect that comes from work and the  fulfillment that comes from work, but it is not happening. If you ask  business owners in my home State of Ohio and across the country, they  will all tell you the same story: Business is booming, but we can't  find workers.   One Ohio restaurant manager said in an interview, ``It's crazy.  Honestly, we are busier than we were before COVID,'' but they can't  find staff to keep up with the demand. The Dayton, OH, area chamber of  commerce did a study very recently, and 78 percent of its members said  they can't find the workers they need to fill the job openings they  have--78 percent.   So why is this happening? I think there are a few reasons.   One is that it is true that we still have a skills gap in our  country, and that is something I have been working on, along with my  colleagues on both sides of the aisle. It is the reason I authored what  is called the JOBS Act. It was to make sure that we have this  connection--not have a skills gap but, instead, have the right skills  being taught to match the work needs that we have.   Honestly, with regard to those numbers that I just talked about with  regard to entertainment jobs and restaurant jobs and State and local  education jobs, most of those jobs do not require a specialized skill.  So the skills gap needs to be addressed, particularly in manufacturing,  where I was told today, by the National Association of Manufacturers,  that there are 700,000 manufacturing jobs open right now. Again, many  of the jobs that are open do not require advanced skills. They just  require you to show up and to be willing to do the work.   It is also understandable to me that some people may be hesitant to  go back to work because of COVID, but we now have these three effective  vaccines that are doing the hard work to try to get us back to a more  normal lifestyle, where we can get back to school and back to church  and back to synagogue and back to work. Our Nation's researchers and  scientists have helped us to get to this point, and as we saw from the  CDC recommendation today regarding masks, we are turning the corner.   I also realize, for some people, childcare is an issue--there is no  question about that--the cost of childcare. If you look at the numbers  in terms of people going back to work, it is true that it is  disproportionately women. I agree that this is an issue, but I will  tell you that one of the issues we hear about, as you dig deeper into  this, is that it is because, in many places, the kids are not back to  school. So that is a solvable problem. It is time for our children to  go back to school again. Follow the CDC. Follow the science. There were  54 percent of K-8 public schools that were offering full-time classroom  teaching in March. The rest were not.   I have to tell you that none of these are the main causes of the  current problem from everything I am hearing. There are jobs, and there  are folks qualified to do them. They just aren't looking for work, and  it is because of the way the government has chosen to pay people not to  work.   Wages are up, by the way. So, for those who say, ``Well, employers  need to raise wages,'' they are up. By the way, that is one reason we  have inflation. It is because wages are going up. Wages going up, I  think, is not a bad thing even though it will count for some of this  inflation that we have, but the wages going up is not going to make the  difference here. Even though wages have gone up on an average of 4, 5  percent, people are still not coming to work the way you would expect.   Jimmy John's is offering hiring bonuses. The McDonald's locally,  where I live in Cincinnati, is offering a $500 signing bonus. Chipotle  is offering free college tuition after 4 months on the job. One  wholesale distributor in Ohio is offering a $9,000 sign-on bonus for  certified truck drivers.   By the way, with regard to truck drivers, you know about the Colonial  Pipeline and cutting off the gas supply to the east coast of the United  States and people who are concerned about going to the gas station and  getting gas in many gas stations and not having any fuel available,  including in States all over the East and the Southeast.   The answer that some people came up with--and it makes sense--is to  have trucks actually deliver that fuel to those gas stations. The  trucks could go to the places where the fuel is and where the pipeline  would normally take it and move that fuel to the gas stations. The  problem? No truck drivers. They literally cannot find truck drivers to  move this fuel from the depots to the gas stations. This is a real  problem.   I have a constituent back home who contacted me yesterday. She is  offering a $1,000 signing bonus, and she can get nobody to step  forward. She has 60 jobs in Ohio, and she has 30 jobs in New York--a  small business with only about 250 jobs total. She can't find anybody.  When she talks to her people, they tell her: Well, as soon as the UI  [[Page S2506]]  ends, I will be back. As soon as the unemployment insurance ends--the  Federal supplement, the $300 supplement--I will be back. Businesses  simply can't compete in an environment where more than 40 percent of  the workers are making more on the unemployment supplement than they  would be at their jobs.   It is a problem, by the way, that States themselves are now starting  to deal with because they realize this is a huge problem for their  economies, for their small businesses, and for their workforces. As of  this afternoon, just in the last week, 15 States have said: Do you know  what? I am not going to accept the $300 supplement because I want to  get people back to work.   It is already making a difference. Someone just told me from the  State of Montana--one of our colleagues from there--and Montana was the  first State to do this--that, about a week ago, a hotel owner told him  that he was in desperate need of people, and when he would put the  ``help wanted'' sign out and ask people to come, he could get one  person to show up per week. This week, 60 people showed up. Why?  Because the unemployment insurance is running out, and people are now  looking for work. So these States I think are going to continue to do  this. I think it will be more than 15 by the time we are finished  speaking here this afternoon. It is because the States realize, well,  this is a competitive advantage. If New York doesn't do it and Ohio  does--and by the way, Ohio is one of the States that just made the  decision to do it this afternoon. If New York doesn't do it, that  businessperson I talked about is going to do more manufacturing in Ohio  because that is where she has the workforce. That will help Ohio  relative to States that wouldn't choose to move on beyond the $300  supplement.    Unemployment insurance is important, and it is still going to be  there, but it will be the State benefit that it has always been.   The other thing is the work requirement. In unemployment insurance,  again, in Ohio, it is about 50 percent of whatever your wages are. And  then there is a requirement that you look for work, and if you get an  offer, you can't stay on unemployment insurance. That has always been  the tradition.   Under COVID, States accepted waivers not to have to require people to  look for work. About 30 States now just in the last few weeks have  decided to get rid of that waiver, including Ohio. Why? Because again,  it is not helping anybody. It is not helping the workers; it is not  helping the small businesses, certainly; and it is really not helping  the taxpayers who are paying tens of billions of dollars for these  supplements.   I will say, when I debated this on the Senate floor, when we had an  amendment that actually passed during the COVID-19 legislation--later,  that amendment was amended, but we tried to end the unemployment  insurance sooner given the economic numbers that were out there.   One of the Democratic colleagues on the other side said that--do I  think the Ohio workers somehow don't have a work ethic, that they are  lazy? That is not what I think at all. I don't think they are lazy at  all. I think they are logical. Common sense dictates that when you are  offering to pay somebody more not to work than to work, you are likely  to get a bad result. Again, it was needed when people were losing their  jobs through no fault of their own. COVID-19 devastated--ravaged--so  many sectors of our economy.   A lot of those sectors are coming back and are coming back strong,  but they need workers, and they need them desperately. The stakes  couldn't be higher.   Let me illustrate why. If workers don't go back to work, some  businesses will actually close, and these jobs will go away  permanently. That, to me, is a reality.   Take Geordie's Restaurant in Columbus, OH. Geordie's shut down a  couple of weeks ago because they couldn't find enough job applicants to  keep the lights on, period. They shut down. This is a restaurant that  made it through the worst of the pandemic, when our restaurant and  hospitality industry was in really tough shape. But as owner Geordie  Hull-Jones said himself, ``We fought hard to get through COVID, but  COVID didn't kill us, the stimulus did.''   ``[B]ut COVID didn't kill us, the stimulus did.'' That is a quote  from a business owner.   That is the difference, again, between the philosophy that the Biden  administration seems to be taking and, frankly, the reality and the  philosophy that we are encouraging, which is let's get people back to  work; let's get this economy moving again.   The President is committed to spending an unprecedented amount of tax  dollars to try and get what it takes to get the economy back on track.  But spending more tax dollars isn't a prescription for what ails our  economy today. Getting people back to work certainly is. If we don't,  again, businesses will close; careers cannot be continued. People won't  get the fulfillment that they get from going to work, and many of these  jobs will not return.   Instead of following this path, let's change course. Let's follow  common sense and get our country back to work so we can all enjoy the  goods and services we work to provide for each other. Let's help our  Nation's small businesses, which are the lifeblood of so many in our  economy. Let's help people currently on unemployment get started  building lasting careers that they enjoy, make a living, find long-term  stability, so they can realize their American dream. That is what this  country is all about.   So, today, I am urging the Biden administration to take two simple  steps to encourage people to move past the pandemic and to get back to  work. First, we need to reimplement the Federal requirement that people  must be actively searching for work if they are going to receive  unemployment. Again, Ohio has made that decision, as have about 30  other States, but let's make this the national standard that it was  prior to the pandemic. Long-term unemployment doesn't benefit anyone,  and it will ensure that people are able to get off unemployment  insurance more quickly. Second, we need to draw down the Federal  unemployment supplement funded by COVID-19 that passed in March. It is  time to look at ending this not on September 6, as it is currently  slated to end, but now, while the economy is strong and growing and we  are trying to get people back to work. As I said, it is a rational  economic decision for many people right now who collect an unemployment  check that effectively pays upward of $15 an hour to stay at home and  not work, but it makes no sense to keep the supplement in place as we  are reopening, and the focus is on shifting toward getting the economy  back up and running.   My own preference is that some of this might be used to pay people a  bonus to go back to work. I know that is controversial on my side of  the aisle, but, I tell you, I think it works. Montana is doing it, and  it is working for them. How about 100 bucks a week? Instead of the $300  supplement, 100 bucks a week for 6 weeks as a return-to-work bonus? To  me, that makes a lot of sense. That would be something I think we could  get some bipartisan support for around here, and that would help the  workers, the small businesses, and our economy.   Through these two steps, we can create the disincentive to work that  was a byproduct of our response to an unprecedented pandemic--we can  stop that disincentive to work. Now that we are beating COVID-19, we  should focus on getting back to normal. I urge the Biden administration  to focus on getting the economy back up and running and getting folks  off the sidelines and back to work   I yield the floor.
