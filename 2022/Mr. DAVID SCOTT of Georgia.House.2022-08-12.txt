 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding. This is an important bill, and, yes, it will bring down  inflation.   Mr. Speaker, we are dealing here with basic economics, and unless we  have multiple forces working simultaneously, we will not be able to  bring down the costs of food particularly.   I raise this point because, as Chairwoman Waters pointed out, it does  help in terms of prescription drugs. It brings down the cost of  healthcare. Those reflect some of our basic needs. It helps our  veterans with their healthcare.   Just as I stepped up and helped to deal with the step-up, we are  having a problem with the front end of our food supply chain. We have  17,000 of our ranchers and small farmers going out of business every  year.    Mr. Speaker, let me just say that this is  very important, and it sets the stage for this bill working with our  lower food and fuel costs to continue the process.   Finally, we will have a bill in September that addresses the front  line of our supply chain that will also bring down costs and inflation.
