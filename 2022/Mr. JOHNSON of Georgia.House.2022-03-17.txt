 Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for the  time today to speak on the FAIR Act, and I ask my fellow colleagues to  vote ``yes'' on this bill.   My colleagues and I on the other side of the aisle will disagree on  much, but on one thing we can all agree, and that is the Constitution  of the United States of America is a great document.   At the beginning of that document is the preamble, and the first 17  words of the preamble read as follows: ``We the people of the United  States, in order to form a more perfect Union, establish justice,'' and  then it goes on. But you can see at the very top, the ideal of the  Founders was to establish justice in this country.                                time  1245    So they went about the Constitution by giving power to the  legislative branch in Article I, to the executive branch in Article  Number II, and to the judicial branch, the Court system, to establish  justice in Article III.   And then, in the Bill of Rights, the first 10 amendments to the  Constitution where the Bill of Rights for we, the people, gave us our  individual rights, with the exception of Amendment 10, which gives the  States all powers not reserved to the Federal Government.   So the Bill of Rights, in the Seventh Amendment to the Constitution,  it guarantees the right to a jury trial, a trial by a jury of one's  peers for any civil case where the amount in controversy exceeds $20 or  more. That is still the law in this country. That is our Constitution.   But the Supreme Court has seen fit to erode our freedoms insofar as a  right to a jury trial by allowing corporations, employers, to take away  that right from people. That is forced arbitration.   Gretchen Carlson, with FOX News, when she came forward with her  claims that she was fired because she resisted the demands of Roger  Ailes to have sex with him, and she filed a civil rights action, she  was met with the bar of a forced arbitration clause in the employment  agreement that she signed.   I was so happy, Madam Speaker, to attend a bill signing ceremony a  couple of weeks ago at the White House where my colleague, Cheri  Bustos' legislation, the Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault  and Sexual Harassment Act was signed into law.   We need to go further. We just heard, within the last couple of  weeks, of former coach Brian Flores of the Miami Dolphins, who filed a  lawsuit against the Miami Dolphins and a couple of other clubs, as well  as the NFL, alleging that he had been discriminated against racially.  He had been denied hiring opportunities and retention and compensation.  He filed a complaint.   He is met by the NFL with an arbitration clause. If it is good enough  for sexual assault and sexual harassment cases, constitutional rights,  those rights, that same ability needs to enure to those who have been  aggrieved by racial discrimination and other types of discrimination.  And consumers need to be allowed to assert their Seventh Amendment  right when it comes to a dispute with a shop owner or shopkeeper.    And so, what we have seen with the U.S.  Supreme Court is they have allowed corporations to have rights under  our Constitution. Nowhere in it is there a section for corporations.   Let's restore freedom to the people of this country as guaranteed by  the Bill of Rights under the Constitution that we all live under. It is  a constitutional right that, when there is a dispute, a party should be  able to take that dispute to court and have a jury trial, and no forced  contract should deprive that person of that constitutional right.   That is what the FAIR Act will do. It will render unenforceable,  after the act is signed into law, unenforceable, any pre-dispute forced  arbitration clauses in consumer agreements and in employment  agreements, and also in civil rights cases, causes of action and also  antitrust actions.
