 Mr. Speaker, I have spoken out against racism from this  floor before, but under the present regrettable circumstances, I feel  compelled to do so again.   All of us are created in the image of God and are of equal and  inestimable moral worth--all of us. There are no exceptions. Both St.  Peter and St. Paul spoke out against prejudice. Our Declaration of  Independence states plainly that we are all created equal. Our laws  require equality of treatment and opportunity.   It is a fact that we betrayed this ideal when our country was founded  when we tolerated slavery, an immoral human practice, which in this  country was carried out by Whites against Blacks. It took nearly 90  years after our founding to erase this blot when we passed the 13th  Amendment. It also took a civil war, which cost 600,000 lives.   Even then, we didn't grant Black people true equality. For the next  100 years, they endured Jim Crow laws in the South, de facto  segregation in the rest of the country, violence, and inequality in  everything from schools to jobs.   They had to win equality for themselves by bravely marching,  protesting, and using every peaceful method they could find in the  civil rights movement. They gradually won key court cases. And,  finally, this House and the Senate passed the 1964 Civil Rights Act  and, in 1965, the Voting Rights Act.   But laws don't change hearts, and we are still walking the path  toward ridding this Nation of the scourge of racism. As I have watched  COVID work its will in my district, I have been distraught to see the  disproportionate effect on the health and lives of the one-third of my  constituents who are Black--on Black workers and business owners who  suddenly, and through no fault of their own, lost their jobs and their  businesses, and on Black children who lost months of their education,  which they badly need.   The chief of police in Mobile, the urban center of my district, is  Lawrence Battiste, a 27-year veteran of law enforcement and, yes, a  Black man. We had a Sunday afternoon of protests a few weeks ago, and I  watched as he and the officers under his direction carried out their  duties with professionalism and character.   ``Character.'' I use that word because it is so important right now  and because I have long admired Dr. King's statement that we shouldn't  be judged by the color of our skin but by the content of our character.   I am proud of Chief Battiste and his officers, but they aren't the  only professionals performing their duties under extraordinarily  difficult circumstances and with character. There are many, many law  enforcement officers around this country who are truly public servants,  and they deserve our respect and our support.   We, in this House, can disagree on the appropriate policies to pursue  to achieve justice and right the wrong of continuing inequality. But  there is no disagreement that racism is wrong, is morally repugnant.  There is also no disagreement that doing nothing in the face of  continuing racism isn't acceptable.   We, in this House, need to work together, not in parallel partisan  efforts. This House came together to pass the CARES Act earlier this  year. Surely, we can come together to pass meaningful and bipartisan  law enforcement reform legislation that will actually go to the  President and become law.   I wish we would address more funding for community health centers so  poor people, and especially people of color, would have better access  to primary care, which would help equalize health outcomes. I also wish  we would take up education choice legislation, like Education Freedom  Scholarships so that minority children have the same opportunities for  a quality education as their peers from families with the means to pay  for better schools.   We are capable of so much more in this country, but only if we  remember the one stated purpose of our Constitution is to create a more  perfect union. That is not a one-and-done thing; it is a generation- after-generation thing.   It is time to unite in this body and do the hard work of this  generation. Let's do it for the Lawrence Battistes out there. Let's do  it for our children and grandchildren. And let's do it because that  will reveal the content of our national character, which is far more  important than the color of our skin.                            ____________________
