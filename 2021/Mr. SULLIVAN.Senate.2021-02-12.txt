 Mr. President.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alaska.    Mr. President, I send a question to the desk for the  former President's counsel.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alaska, Senator Sullivan,  has a question for the House counsel.   The clerk will read the question.   The legislative clerk read as follows:    Mr. President.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. For the former President's counsel. Sorry  about that.    Thank you, sir.   The legislative clerk read as follows:         The House manager said yesterday that due process is       discretionary, meaning the House is not required to provide       and, indeed, did not provide in this snap impeachment any       constitutional protection to a defendant in the House       impeachment proceedings. What are the implications for our       constitutional order of this new House precedent combined       with the Senate's power to disqualify from public office a       private citizen in an impeachment trial?    The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Counsel has 5 minutes.   Mr. Counsel VAN DER VEEN. Mr. President, that is a complicated  question. Could I have that read again?   The legislative clerk read as follows:         The House managers said yesterday that due process is       ``discretionary,'' meaning the House is not required to       provide, and indeed did not provide in this snap impeachment,       any constitutional protections to a defendant in House       impeachment proceedings. What are the implications for our       constitutional order of this new House precedent combined       with the Senate's power to disqualify from public office a       private citizen in an impeachment trial?    Mr. Counsel VAN DER VEEN. Mr. President, well, first of all, due  process is never discretionary. Good Lord, the Constitution requires  that the accused have the right to due process because the power that a  prosecutor has to take somebody's liberty when they are prosecuting  them is the ultimate thing that we try to save.   In this case, just now, in the last 2 hours, we have had  prosecutorial misconduct. What they just tried to do was say that it is  our burden to bring them evidence to prove their case, and it is not.  It is not our burden to bring any evidence forward at all.   What is the danger? Well, the danger is pretty obvious. If the  majority party doesn't like somebody in the minority party and they are  afraid they may lose the election or if it is somebody in the majority  party and there is a private citizen who wants to run against somebody  in the majority party, well, they can simply bring impeachment  proceedings. And, of course, without due process, they are not going to  be entitled to a lawyer. They are not going to be entitled to have  notice of the charges against them.   It puts us into a position where we are the kind of judicial system  and governing body that we are all very, very afraid of. From what we  left hundreds of years ago, and when regimes all around this world that  endanger us--that is how they act; that is how they conduct themselves:  without giving the accused due process, taking their liberty, without  giving them just a basic fundamental right, under the 5th to the 14th  applied to the States, due process. If you take away due process in  this country from the accused, if you take that away, there will be no  justice and nobody, nobody will be safe.   But it is patently unfair for the House managers to bring an  impeachment proceeding without any--again, without any investigation at  all and then stand up here and say: One, they had a chance to bring us  evidence; and, two, let's, let's, let's see what we can do about  flipping around somebody's other constitutional rights to having a  lawyer or to having a--to see the evidence at all. It just gets brought  in without anybody, as it was here, without anybody having an  opportunity to review it beforehand. They actually sent it to us on the  9th, the day after we started this.   So it is a really big problem. The due process clause applies to this  impeachment hearing, and it has been severely and extremely violated.  This process is so unconstitutional because it violates due process. I  am not even going to get into the jurisdiction part.   The due process part should be enough to give anybody who loves our  Constitution and loves our country great pause to do anything but  acquit Donald Trump.   Thank you.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut.
