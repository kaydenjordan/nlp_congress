 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge all of my colleagues  to join me in supporting the balanced budget amendment. This much- needed constitutional amendment would finally hold Washington  accountable to the same standards that every American family faces, and  that is a balanced budget.   I stand here in awe today listening to my colleagues from the other  side of the aisle stand here and lecture about fiscal responsibility.  The gentleman from Maryland, the minority leader, stood in the well and  said, if you want to balance a budget, just do it.   Well, the House Budget Committee did it, and do you know what? The  number of Democrats who voted for it could stand on this desk in a  thimble. There weren't any.   When it comes to the time for fiscal responsibility and having an  honest conversation about the meaningful safety net programs that our  Nation depends on and values, we don't need the harsh rhetoric down  there. Every single Republican and Democrat should have an honest  conversation about the future of those programs and where we are, and  shame on the other side for using it as a scare tactic.   Without a balanced budget amendment, this body has proven, since  1974, that only four times has it had the foresight and the political  courage to put forth a budget and pass appropriations bills, and it has  only balanced in just a few of those.   Enough of the rhetoric. It is time to come to the table and have the  discussions. If you want to balance the budget, join with us. Don't  accuse us of not doing it. Your vote shows that you didn't do it.   Enough is enough. It is time to have an honest conversation. If those  programs are so important, then we as a nation need to decide how we  are going to pay for those, and we do know that they are.                                time  1530    We can no longer stand here and have the kind of rhetoric and the  kind of misinformation that is being spewed out by the other side. It  is time to take our fiscal responsibilities serious, pass a balanced  budget amendment, because without it, this Nation has been able to hide  behind debt, and we have hidden the real cost and the real pain from  the American people, and enough is enough.
