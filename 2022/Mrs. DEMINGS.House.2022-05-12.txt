 Mr. Speaker, in 1962, President Kennedy proclaimed May  15 as National Peace Officers Memorial Day, and the week of May 15 as  National Police Week. Established in 1962 by a joint resolution of this  body, National Police Week pays special recognition to law enforcement  officers who lost their lives in the line of duty.   Last year, in my home State of Florida, we lost 51 law enforcement  officers. I pause to honor them today. I was sworn in as a police  officer in 1984. I shall never forget my oath or the indescribable  feeling of being a police officer. Police officers do it all: they  coach little league baseball, football, basketball, they deliver meals  to seniors, mentor teens, and buy teddy bears for abused and neglected  children. We also know they run to murders, rapes, robberies,  burglaries, and other vicious assaults, including domestic violence  calls. They respond, without hesitation, hoping and praying for a  peaceful resolution, but never really knowing what the outcome will be.   This year, 617 new names will be added to the memorial wall, fallen  officers who lost their lives through violence, crashes, assaults.  There were 439 officers that lost their lives to COVID-19 while doing  everything they could to protect and serve their communities.   Representing central Florida, I will take a moment, Mr. Speaker, to  remember my brother, Orange County Deputy First Class Craig Seijos.  Every day Deputy Seijos went to work, ``Making a Difference'', serving  the Orange County Sheriff's Office and the citizens of Orange County,  Florida, for 30 years. He is gone but will never be forgotten.   The 62 law enforcement officers added to the memorial wall this year  lost their lives through gunfire. As the 36th chief of police of the  Orlando Police Department, I would like to tell you about one of them,  Officer Kevin Valencia.   On June 11 of 2018, Officer Valencia responded to a domestic violence  call involving a convicted felon holding a woman and four children at  gunpoint. While attempting to rescue those children, the gunman shot  through the door critically injuring Kevin.   Kevin fought hard but succumbed to his injuries last year. Kevin  Valencia, only 29 years of age, was a good police officer, one full of  courage, full of pride, and commitment. Officer Valencia is gone, but  he will never be forgotten.   Mr. Speaker, as we honor these men and women for their service, we  here in this body--the same one in 1962 who passed the joint  resolution--have an obligation to continue to support legislation that  will help keep our law enforcement officers safe and will give them the  tools needed to perform the tough job, the dangerous job that they do  every day.   Protectors, guardians--when they need to be--warriors--when they need  to be--public servants, America law enforcement officers, my brothers  and sisters in blue, many have given much. These officers whose names  appear on the memorial wall have given all. Let's honor their memories,  their service, their sacrifice.                            ____________________
