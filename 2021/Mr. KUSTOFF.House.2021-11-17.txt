 Madam Speaker, I thank my friend from Louisiana for  arranging the time to talk to the Nation today about these very  important issues.   Madam Speaker, I rise today to talk about the reckless spending plans  put forward by Democrats, which I think, without a doubt, have put our  country in a real economic crisis.   Let me take you back to March when, along purely partisan lines,  Democrats pushed through a $1.9 trillion spending plan. Just 2 weeks  ago, Democrats pushed through another $1.2 trillion in spending. This  week, we may likely vote on the Democrats' social spending plan, which  would drive the total spending to almost $5 trillion when you add  together all three of these spending bills.   Now, if you will focus for a moment on the runaway inflation that has  really been exacerbated and inflamed by this massive spending, it was  reported just last week that the Consumer Price Index, which measures  this data, rose over 6 percent. That is the highest level in 30 years.   This means that the price of everyday goods has skyrocketed. I am  talking about everything: cars, appliances, food, gas. Estimates are  that the price to heat your home this winter could be 54 percent higher  this year compared to last winter. Americans--our constituents--are  getting hit really hard financially, and there is no end to it in  sight.   Without a doubt, the huge social spending bill that we may vote on  this week will leave severe and long-lasting consequences.   Madam Speaker, I want to point you to a story that ran yesterday in  The Washington Times. Here is the headline: ``Biden's social welfare  bill breaks pledge to not raise taxes on people making less than  $400,000.'' The newspaper cites the Joint Committee on Taxation.                                time  1730    Now, here is the deal: with the social spending bill beginning in  2023, taxpayers making between $50,000 and $75,000 annually would see a  tax increase. For people earning between $75,000 and $100,000 a year,  the tax increase is 2.9 percent. Folks making between $100,000 and  $200,000 per year would see a tax increase of 7.4 percent in 2023.   Madam Speaker, let's listen to our constituents. Let's focus on the  real-world problems that they are dealing with every day and that they  talk to us about. Let's work on the supply chain. Let's focus on the  threat from China. Let's stop this massive spending.
