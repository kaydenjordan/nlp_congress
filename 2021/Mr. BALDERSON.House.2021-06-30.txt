 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 3684, the  majority's ``my-way-or-the-highway bill.''   Rather than working with Republicans to deliver a commonsense,  bipartisan bill that puts America's real infrastructure needs center  stage, the majority has decided to fast track its Green New Deal  agenda. In fact, half of the funding in this bill is tied up meeting  Green New Deal mandates.   The majority refused to work with Republicans on policies to  streamline the permitting process for construction projects. These  policies will save taxpayers billions of dollars and move projects  forward faster, while still ensuring world-class environmental  standards.   Unfortunately, Republicans were shut out of the process, and the  impact is clear. This bill places costly restrictions on local  construction projects, includes catastrophic provisions that would put  small trucking companies and independent truckers out of business, and  relies on deficit spending, which will further fuel the problem of  inflation.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly encourage my colleagues to reject this  partisan process and vote ``no'' on H.R. 3684.
