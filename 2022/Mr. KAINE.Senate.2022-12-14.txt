 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I do rise for multiple purposes. The first  is to acknowledge that earlier this week, on Monday, December 12, we  marked the historic bicentennial of diplomatic relations between the  United States and Mexico.   Our two countries share a 2,000-mile border, an extensive trade,  security, economic, cultural, and familial ties.   Our cultural ties are particularly deep. Forty million Americans have  Mexican heritage, many of whom are proud residents of Virginia. People  of Mexican origin represent nearly 60 percent of our Nation's Hispanic  population, and 2 million Americans live in Mexico. These people-to- people ties are invaluable.   The two countries share an important tradition of democracy, and  those traditions require consistent work and maintenance to ensure  strong and independent institutions, rule of law, and democratic  freedoms.   We know that upholding democracy in both our nations isn't always  easy, but it is a vital endeavor, and it is the bedrock of our  partnership. As we celebrate the bicentennial, it is crucial that the  Senate and the U.S. Government as a whole continue all efforts to  advance this relationship.   I want to commend the Biden administration for working side by side  with Mexican leaders and taking on the many challenges we face  together. This is exactly what we should be doing with such a close  neighboring partner, and I am committing to continue to support these  efforts through my role on the Foreign Relations Subcommittee over the  Americas, which I chair.   Through the high-level economic dialogue, the high-level security  dialogue, the North American Leaders' Summit, and innumerable local and  national engagements, the United States and Mexico have worked more  closely in addressing our shared priorities.   We have got to ensure that the future of the U.S.-Mexico relationship  continues to be grounded in shared prosperity and the protection of  fundamental freedoms that are so important to both of our people.   I will have a more formal and detailed statement on the bicentennial  that I will have submitted for the Record.    Madam President, in just a second, I will make a motion  for unanimous consent. Before I do, I just want to say, this Nation has  a bipartisan track record of fielding fantastic women diplomats:  Secretary Clinton, Secretary Rice, Secretary Albright. So this is  something that we do well and we have done well in a bipartisan way.   My colleague from New Hampshire talked about what this important  position does and what it doesn't do. I just want to say a few words  about Dr. Gupta.   She is a nationally recognized leader and expert on women's  contributions to economic prosperity and stability. She has over three  decades of experience in research, policy formulation, advocacy, and  the implementations of policies and programs to empower women and  girls; that includes 5 years at UNICEF and a decade as the president  and CEO of a U.S.-based research institute.   She has taken, throughout her career, an evidence-based approach to  demonstrate again and again one irrefutable fact: Investing in women is  one of the best tools to promote economic development and stability.   Because of her strong reputation, because of the importance of the  role, because of the fact that this is not a position that deals with  some of the issues that often cause controversy on the floor-- reproductive rights--I now move to the following:   I ask unanimous consent that the Senate Foreign Relations Committee  be discharged, and the Senate proceed to the following nomination:  PN1578, Dr. Geeta Rao Gupta, to be U.S. Ambassador at Large For Global  Women's Issues; that the Senate vote on the nomination with no  intervening action or debate; that the motion to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table; that no further motions be  made in order to the nomination; and that any related statements be  printed in the Record.    Madam President, in response to my colleague, might I  modify my request because, certainly, someone should have the right to  vote no if they want to vote no. So let me modify my request.   I would ask unanimous consent that the Senate Committee on Foreign  Relations be discharged and that the Senate proceed to the following  nomination: PN1578, Geeta Rao Gupta, of Virginia, to be Ambassador at  Large for Global Women's Issues; and that the Senate vote on the  nomination at a time to be determined by the Senate leadership.    Madam President, I said I was rising for multiple  purposes. It is now my third purpose, but I would seek consent to  speak--I know we have a vote call at 5--for about 5 minutes on  legislation being contemplated tomorrow.    Madam President, we are currently in consideration of the  National Defense Authorization Act, and the leadership is working out a  timing agreement for a vote possibly on one or more amendments and then  a vote on the NDAA.   The Defense bill is the most important thing I work on every year as  a member of the Armed Services Committee, and I think the Defense bill  that our Armed Services Committee did with strong bipartisan support is  a very strong one. The timing isn't to my liking, that it took so long  to reach an agreement with the House. But it is what it is. The Defense  bill is strong.   We are likely to have a vote on an amendment tomorrow offered by my  friend and colleague Joe Manchin dealing with permitting reform, and I  wanted to stand on the floor to express my objection not to the topic  and even not to much of the substance but to one particular provision  that I think is horrible policy and I think will cause me to oppose the  amendment.   Do we need to do permitting reform to accelerate infrastructure in  this country? We do. We do. Many of the permitting reform rules--FERC,  for example--are decades old, and they haven't kept up with new  technologies or new needs of our population. I am strongly of the  belief that we should do permitting reform, and I have introduced my  own bills going back years to make at least that permitting process  work better.   The amendment that we are going to be voting on tomorrow, at least as  I have been told--I haven't seen the language, but I have been told it  is very similar to an amendment that was offered in September. It is an  88-page permitting reform bill. Eighty-five pages are permitting  reform; the last three pages are the opposite of permitting reform.    What do I mean by that? Eighty-five pages of the bill go deeply into  permitting for infrastructure, especially energy infrastructure, and  propose a whole series of reforms, many of which I strongly support.   Although I had no hand in the drafting of that bill and I think I  could improve it if I was involved, I would give that bill a good solid  B or B-plus, and I would have no trouble voting for it as an amendment  to the Defense bill or a stand-alone bill.   However, the last three pages of the bill take a particular single  project--100 miles of which is in Virginia--called the Mountain Valley  Pipeline and exempts it from permitting reform. It, essentially, says  this 85-page reform that sets up how a project should be considered and  approved by administrative agencies and then reviewed by the judiciary  if there are complaints about it--that is what the 85 pages does, but  then the last three pages says the Mountain Valley Pipeline should be  exempt from all of that, should get an administrative green light. And,  in a provision that I find to be both unprecedented and really  troubling, it suggests that if individuals want to seek judicial review  of Mountain Valley Pipeline, the current jurisdiction in the Federal  code which would suggest that that suit would be heard in the Fourth  Judicial Circuit, which includes Virginia, the case about one project,  the Mountain Valley Pipeline, will be stripped away from the court  where it is currently being litigated and all future litigation must  happen in the DC circuit.   Now, never in the history of this body has Congress gone into the  middle of a case and, because a corporation was not happy with the  rulings of the court, stripped the case away from that court and given  it to another court. And I have verified that through my own staff in  research since this provision came up in September: stripping a case  away from a court.   Now, this is my hometown court. It is headquartered in Richmond. The  [[Page S7180]]  chief judge is somebody that I used to try cases against when I was a  civil rights lawyer before I got into politics. He is an esteemed  jurist.   Yes, the Fourth Circuit has rendered some rulings in this case that  the pipeline operator doesn't like. I used to lose cases in the Fourth  Circuit. I wasn't always happy with them. But the people that I  represented--if you lose a case, you appeal; you don't rewrite the  Federal jurisdictional code to say this court can no longer hear the  case, in the middle of the case.   If we go down this path on this project, I can see it opening a door  we will not want to open, a door that could even lead to corruption: I  am a wealthy, powerful corporation; I don't like the way the Second  Circuit is ruling on derivative shareholder suits. Maybe I can strip  jurisdiction away from them. I don't like the way the Ninth Circuit is  ruling on employment discrimination cases. Maybe I could strip  jurisdiction away from them.   I get it that a big company is not happy because they have lost a  case. Fifty percent of our litigants are unhappy. Someone wins and  somebody loses, but the solution is not to take jurisdiction away from  the court that is hearing the case and give it to another court. That  is not the solution. The solution is to improve the permitting process.   There are two elements of the first 85 pages of the bill that  actually help Mountain Valley Pipeline. One element would be, in the  first 85 pages, that President Biden--the President, in the bill, is  allowed to designate 15 projects of national significance and then  expedite them. That is in the first 85 pages. And if President Biden  decided the Mountain Valley Pipeline was so important to make that top  15 list, that permitting reform could help the Mountain Valley  Pipeline.   And, second, there is a provision in the first 85 pages that would  require that on matters that come up again and again and again, the  panels on circuit courts have to rotate and randomly assign and not  keep the same panel. That would solve one of Mountain Valley Pipeline's  professed concerns.   So because I haven't seen the language yet, it may not still be  final, and I would urge those pushing it: Do permitting reform, but  don't exempt a project in my State from the permits, don't exempt it  from judicial review, don't strip jurisdiction away from my hometown  court and give it to another court.   I was never consulted about this. My constituents feel very, very  passionately. Their land is being taken for this. The only way you  build pipelines is to take people's land, and this is 100 miles in  Virginia of people's land being taken, and this body should not green- light a project and exempt it from permitting rules in a bill that we  are saying is designed to improve permitting.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, on December 12, 1822, Jose Manuel Zozaya y  Bermudez presented his credentials as Mexico's Envoy Extraordinary and  Minister Plenipotentiary to U.S. President James Monroe, which  established formal relations between our two countries.   On December 12, 2022, the United States and Mexico celebrated the  200th anniversary of our bilateral relations. Our relations with Mexico  remain strong and vital, based on mutual respect as sovereign states.  Mexico remains one of the United States' closest and most valued  partners. Our bilateral relationship directly benefits the lives and  livelihoods of millions of Americans and Mexicans, whether the issue is  trade and economic development, educational and cultural exchange,  citizen security, control of illicit drugs, migration, human  trafficking, entrepreneurship, innovation, environmental protection,  climate change, or public health.   The scope of relations between the United States and Mexico extends  beyond diplomacy. It encompasses extensive commercial, cultural,  educational, and familial ties. Our countries share a 2,000-mile border  with 47 active land ports of entry. Hundreds of thousands of people  cross the border legally each day, strengthening people-to-people ties  and deepening our integration. In addition, an estimated 1.6 million  U.S. citizens live in Mexico, and nearly 40 million persons of Mexican  descent reside in the United States. The U.S.-Mexico Interparliamentary  Group has been held regularly since 1961 to bring together legislators  from both countries to discuss priority issues and identify ways to  strengthen bilateral cooperation. Although our countries share a great  number of ties, without a doubt, our peoples represent our strongest,  deepest and most lasting bond, which will unite us forever. The  bicentennial celebration serves as an opportunity to honor our personal  ties and our shared history, while affirming our commitment to build a  brighter future for our two nations.   As the United States and Mexico reflect on 200 years of bilateral  relations, we must celebrate the greatness of our peoples and commit to  seize the opportunities ahead of us. The bicentennial allows us to  reflect on our historical ties and grants us an opportunity to build on  our shared priorities: economic prosperity, clean energy, security,  migration, and our mutual understanding of one another.   The United States and Mexico have enduring connections encompassing  all aspects of life. As we address our shared challenges and work  together for a prosperous future, we celebrate this era of cooperation  and respect. This anniversary allows us to reflect on the past and more  importantly, to chart a course for the future.                            ____________________
