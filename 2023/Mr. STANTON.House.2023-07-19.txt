 Mr. Chairman, Chairman Graves and Ranking Member Larsen  are a great model of bipartisanship that we can learn a lot from in  this institution. I thank them for their  [[Page H3713]]  leadership in crafting a strong, bipartisan FAA bill.   Air travel can be stressful, but for those with disabilities, it can  be a nightmare. It is the only mode of public transportation that  requires one to surrender their mobility devices before boarding and to  place their trust in others to get safely to their seats.   This bill takes meaningful steps--many I was proud to help lead on-- to improve the flying experience for passengers with disabilities,  including our disabled veterans.   It directs the Department of Transportation to gather data on  disability-related complaints and make meaningful improvements based on  that data.   It improves training for employees that assist passengers with  boarding and deplaning, as well as those who handle mobility devices.   It requires airlines to issue refunds to those who are unable to  travel when their wheelchair cannot be physically accommodated.   Finally, it includes my amendment to make sure passengers traveling  with a personal care attendant are not charged extra for seating  accommodations.   Mr. Chair, we still have a long way to go before air travel is fully  accessible, but the steps we have taken in this bill are commonsense,  necessary fixes that make significant progress.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
