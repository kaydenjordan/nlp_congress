 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and  legacy of a distinguished community member of the Massachusetts  Seventh, Ms. Eva Williams.   Born and raised in Boston, Ms. Williams learned the value of hard  work and determination at an early age. She embodied resilience and a  love for her family and community, and she never let the challenges of  life prevent her from following her own dreams.   Ms. Williams worked over 20 years as a bus operator for the MBTA.  After retiring, she enjoyed spending more time with her children and  grandchildren.  [[Page H966]]    With a heart for traveling and love for interior decorating, Ms.  Williams was the kind of person anyone would want to spend time with.  She was a caring mother and loving grandmother, and her transition is a  deep and profound loss for her family and our community.   Ms. Williams will be truly missed. May she rest in peace and power.                            ____________________
