 Mr. Chairman, the Appropriations Act before you today  includes, in division C, appropriations for Military Construction,  Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies for Fiscal Year 2018. Division C  is exactly the same as the MILCON-VA bill reported favorably out of the  full committee on June 15.   Thanks to the leadership of Chairman Rodney Frelinghuysen from New  Jersey, Ranking Member Nita Lowey from New York, and the partnership of  Ranking Member Debbie Wasserman Schultz from Florida, this will provide  necessary funding for the Department of Veterans Affairs and military  construction projects. We were able to include the vast majority of the  subcommittee's over 1,000 Member requests.   This division demonstrates our firm commitment to fully supporting  our Nation's veterans and servicemembers. The total investment is $89  billion for Military Construction, VA, and Related Agencies, which is  $6 billion above last year's level.   This division provides comprehensive support for servicemembers,  military families, and veterans. We must make infrastructure  investments if we value readiness. This bill increases military  construction by 25 percent over last year's level, delivering on our  promise to the troops in line with the President's focus on national  defense.   It supports our troops with the facilities and services necessary to  maintain readiness and morale at bases here in the States and overseas.  It provides for Defense Department schools and health clinics that take  care of our military families.   This division funds our veteran healthcare systems to ensure that our  promise to care for those who have sacrificed in defense of this great  Nation continues as those men and women return home. We owe this to our  veterans, and we are committed to sustained oversight so that programs  deliver what they promise and taxpayers are well-served by the  investments we make.   The staff deserves credit for the sustained work and very long hours.  I would like to recognize Sue Quantius, Sarah Young, Tracey Russell,  Maureen Holohan, and Matt Washington on the committee staff, and Sean  Snyder on my personal staff.   On the military construction piece, this division provides a total of  $10.2 billion for military construction projects and family housing,  including base and overseas contingency operations funding, an  increase over last year's level and $197 million below the President's  request.    This funding meets DOD's most critical needs, including priority  projects for the combatant commanders and funding new mission  requirements.   It provide $737 million for military medical facilities. It provides  $249 million for Department of Defense education facilities for  construction of renovation of four schools. It supports our Guard and  Reserves through $575 million for facilities in 22 States.   It also funds military family housing at $1.4 billion. It provides  $178 million for the NATO Security Investment Program, which is $24  million over the President's request, to deal with increasing threats  and necessary investments overseas. Given all that is happening by  Russia's very bad behavior in Eastern Europe and elsewhere, this  investment is absolutely essential.   We were able to also include an additional $439 million in the  services' unfunded priorities, which are priority projects that were  not included in the budget request. It is very important to many  Members of this body.   On Veterans Affairs, the legislation includes a total of $78.3  billion in discretionary funding for the Department of Veterans  Affairs. That is a $3.9 billion increase, or 5 percent, above fiscal  year 2017 level. It is the highest level of VA funding ever provided.   On VA medical care, the bill funds it at $69 billion, the full  request, including an additional $2.6 billion beyond the advanced  appropriations to cover unanticipated needs. Many Members expressed  concerns about medical care issues, and were able to fully fund the  budget request for mental health services at $8.4 billion; suicide  prevention outreach at $186 million; homeless veterans treatment,  services, housing, and job training at $7.3 billion; opioid abuse  prevention at $50 million--we began that in the omnibus last year-- rural health initiatives at $250 million; and caregiver stipends at  $604 million.  [[Page H6364]]                                     time  1600    We repeat last year's bill language regarding improved standards for  the suicide prevention hotline. For disability claims processing, again  another issue very important to so many Members in this body, but  particularly to our veterans who are seeking services from the VA, or  benefits, we provide $2.9 billion, which is $50 million over the  request. As the number of disability applications increases, we need to  be vigilant to be sure that the claims backlog doesn't reappear.    Mr. Chair, this legislation also contains $65 million, as  requested, as VA switches gears and moves from modernizing its own  aging electronic health record to acquiring the record DOD is using.  The bill continues to include language restricting most of the funding  until the VA meets milestones and certifies interoperability to meet  statutory requirements.   Our bill increases the request for VA research funding by $58  million, to a total of $698 million, recognizing strong congressional  interest in the VA's research to combat devastating conditions like  PTSD and traumatic brain injury.   In major construction, we continue oversight of those projects,  holding back funding until it has contracted for outside management.   In closing, I ask Members to support this important piece of  legislation. It is very important to our servicemembers, our veterans,  and their families.    Mr. Chair, as the designee of the gentleman from New Jersey  (Mr. Frelinghuysen), I move to strike the last word.    Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr.  Pocan).    Mr. Chair, the gentleman from Wisconsin is correct. It is  our intention to urge the VA to offer all of the approved methods of  screening.    I yield back the balance of my time.         Amendments En Bloc No. 1 Offered by Mr. Dent of Pennsylvania     Mr. Chairman, pursuant to section 3 of House Resolution  473, as the designee of the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.  Frelinghuysen), I offer amendments en bloc.    Mr. Chair, these amendments have been made in order by the  rule allowing consideration of H.R. 3219, and their inclusion in the en  bloc has been agreed to by both sides.   I support the adoption of the en bloc package, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have no further speakers on the amendments en  bloc, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for his genuine concern  and thoughtfulness with respect to veterans' homelessness. It is indeed  a very severe problem. I do look forward to working with him on this  issue, but I also want to mention that I think our bill does respond  quite admirably in many ways to the homelessness challenge.   We support more than $7.3 billion in medical care, housing, social  service, and job training assistance for homeless veterans, and that is  about $197 million more this year than in fiscal year 2017 and almost  $450 million more than 2 years ago. But Congressman Green is correct  that we can always do more and that this challenge continues to plague  us. We have made great progress in this country, but I pledge to work  with Mr. Green on this issue.    Will the gentleman yield?    I just want to say for the Record that I appreciate the  gentleman's concern for his district. I am not going to oppose the  amendment, but I did want to say that, at some point, there will need  to be a BRAC. There is a lot of excess capacity in the Army and the Air  Force. But for fiscal year `18, I can accept this amendment, but down  the road I see the need.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment, but I  do not plan to oppose it.    Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms.  Wasserman Schultz), the ranking member.    I yield back the balance of my time.
