 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my profound support  for life.   Unfortunately, life is under attack in America right now. With the  introduction of a Democrat budget that does not feature the Hyde  amendment protections, taxpayers could soon be funding abortions-- something that has been outlawed for many years.   Ending these safeguards is both unpopular and unrepresentative of the  will of the American people. Taxpayers should not be forced to  subsidize abortions that destroy the dignity of life and millions of  unborn babies in America.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committees on Energy  and Commerce, Ways and Means, and the Judiciary be discharged from  further consideration of H.R. 18, and ask for its immediate  consideration in the House.
