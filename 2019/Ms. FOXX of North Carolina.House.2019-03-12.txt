 Mr. Speaker, I rise to salute Mr. Tom  Dorsett of Yadkin County in North Carolina's Fifth District. Mr.  Dorsett is about to retire from his very successful business, Dorsett  Technologies, which, since 1977, he has grown into the innovative and  thriving business it is today.   Mr. Dorsett, his wife, Jo, and their excellent employees have built  the business from a small heating and air-conditioning supply and  service business to one of the most innovative businesses in the area.  Today, the company specializes in automation for buildings and  municipal water and wastewater systems.   Municipalities across the country use Dorsett Technologies' InfoScan  software to control systems for energy, security, and water. The  company has even supplied the U.S. Army, Air Force, and NASA with its  cutting-edge technology.  [[Page H2653]]    Along the way, the company and the Dorsetts personally have been  outstanding philanthropists for virtually every good cause and  nonprofit in Yadkin County. Their support ranges from the Yadkin County  Arts Council to the Yadkin County Rotary Club, the United Methodist  Church, United Way, Chamber of Commerce, Yadkin Christian Ministries,  and the Yadkin County Community Foundation.   Mr. Dorsett is a visionary. Understanding the need to develop young  people for the jobs of the future, Mr. Dorsett has led the effort to  promote robotics education in the school system, giving and raising  money for the program, which has become one of the most popular in the  area. The Dorsetts were also lead gift givers for the Yadkin Arts  Council, which renovated an area of the downtown into a very successful  arts center a few years ago. He is a renaissance man, but he and his  family seek no recognition for the positive things that they do;  although, recognition is much deserved.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the Dorsetts for being such positive role models  and for their generous support of the Yadkinville community. We wish  them well in their retirement.                            ____________________
