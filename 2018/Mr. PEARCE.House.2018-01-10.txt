 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California for  yielding and for his work on this bill.   As he mentioned in the opening statements, there is a provision in  the bill that allows the Santa Clara Ohkay Owingeh 99-year leasing  program to move forward. That is in resolution to the long-standing  problems that we face there. So just a significant provision that  affects these two units but also the underlying concept that we are  going to recognize the sovereignty of our Tribes.   As many people know, some of the Tribes are faced with just very  difficult poverty conditions throughout the history of their Tribes  since they have been on the reservations, and I work with close friends  of mine who are trying to solve these problems and to find resolution  to long-term prosperity on the Indian reservations.   So when the National Labor Relations Board reversed its long-standing  status of recognizing the sovereignty of our nations--70 years they had  recognized that. In 2004, they simply reversed it without much  explanation, without any warning, and certainly without precedent.                                time  1700    It has caused things to be much more difficult, especially in States  like New Mexico. So the Tribal leaders are saying: We should be  sovereign. We should be allowed to make these sorts of decisions  ourself without the Federal Government coming in and putting the  bureaucracy there.   The underlying concept of the bill is one that simply says we want  prosperity on Native American lands, we want their sovereign actions to  take care of themselves, to move themselves forward. That is what the  entire Nation says is the American Dream. Let's let that occur for the  Native Americans in this country. I think the provisions of the bill  are very important.   We have been working for 6 years now in Native American housing,  another way to help move prosperity into Native American lands. Again,  I support the concept of the bill.
