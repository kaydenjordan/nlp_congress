 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of  S. 140 and its inclusion of H.R. 986, the Tribal Labor Sovereignty Act.   There are more than 560 federally recognized Native American Tribes  across the United States, and each of these Tribes has a unique history  and distinct culture that have helped shape who we are today as a  nation. Each Tribe has an inherent right to self-govern, just like any  other sovereign government does.   That right to self-governance is rooted in the Constitution and has  been reaffirmed by courts for almost 200 years. Because of it, Tribal  leaders are able to make decisions that affect their people in a way  that makes the most sense for their Tribe and best protects the  interests of their members--or, rather, they should be able to make  those decisions.   We are here today because, for the past 14 years, the National Labor  Relations Board has ignored longstanding labor policy and involved  itself in Tribal activities. Since its 2004 San Manuel Indian Bingo and  Casino decision, the Board has used a subjective test to decide on a  case-by-case basis whether a Tribal business or Tribal land is for  commercial purposes, and, if it is, the Board has asserted its  jurisdiction over that business.                                time  1730    Among its other provisions, the bill under consideration would amend  the National Labor Relations Act to reaffirm that the NLRB cannot  assert its authority over enterprises or institutions owned or operated  by a Tribe on Tribal land. It very simply reasserts a legal standard  that was in place for decades and returns to Tribes the ability to  manage their own labor relations as a sovereign right has.   I want to thank my friend and fellow member of the Education and the  Workforce Committee from Indiana (Mr. Rokita) for his leadership on  this issue and for continuing to work on those in Congress who have  helped lead the fight to protect Tribal sovereignty over the years.   It is time for all of us to join that fight and stand with the Native  American community and restore to Indian Tribes the ability to govern  their own labor relations.   Mr. Speaker, I am not sure how you support Tribal sovereignty, which,  by definition, is a sovereign state, but not allow Tribes to self- govern. I don't understand that, and I also don't understand, Mr.  Speaker, if our friends on the other side of the aisle today are so  worried about getting our work done, why I had to leave committee  hearings to come over here three times today to vote not adjourning  this body. I would like to know that.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.
