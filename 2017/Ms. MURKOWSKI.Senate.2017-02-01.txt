 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak on the  upcoming motion to proceed to the DeVos nomination for a period of 5  minutes.    Mr. President, I would like to share my thoughts with  my colleagues today about the President's nominee to be Secretary of  Education. I shared many of these thoughts yesterday with my colleagues  on the Senate HELP Committee.   Like my colleague from Maine, this nomination has been a very  difficult one for me. It has been very personal. As I mentioned in  committee, I take very personally the education of the children in my  State. I take very personally the contributions that our educators, our  administrators in the schools--all that they provide and the importance  that we should all place on the education of America's children.   I don't think it is an overstatement to say that I have struggled  with how I will cast my vote on the nomination of Mrs. DeVos. Again, I  take very personally the success of Alaska's schools and the success of  Alaska's schoolchildren. We have a lot of schools in Alaska, as we all  do around the country. My schools, I would challenge you all, are a  little bit more diverse than perhaps in other parts of America just  because of our geography. We are isolated. Eighty-two percent of the  communities are not attached by a road. The communities are small. The  schools are smaller.   In our urban centers, what some find unusual is we have more  diversity in our populations than most people could understand or even  imagine. One of the neighborhoods in my hometown of Anchorage hosts the  most ethnically diverse schools in the United States of America. So I  have urban schools that have rich diversity, and I have very rural,  very remote, extremely remote schools that face challenges when it  comes to how we deliver education. So knowing that we have the  strongest public school system is a priority for me.   I have spent considerable time one-on-one with Mrs. DeVos before and  after the committee hearing. I spent the entirety of the Senate HELP  Committee listening carefully to the questions that colleagues put to  her. Afterward, I reviewed not only her written responses to me but  those that she had responded to other colleagues. I requested further  that she provide certain commitments in writing. After speaking with  her at length and considering everything that I have learned, I have  the following comments to share:   First, I must state that I absolutely believe Betsy DeVos cares  deeply for all children. I think we all acknowledge that she could have  spent her time, her energy, and her considerable resources on almost  anything else that she chose to do. I admire her for choosing to help  children to access a better education because she could have chosen to  do many other things, but she chose to work for children, and I  appreciate that.   Now, as Senators, we are in the position to provide advice and  consent on the President's nominee. My view has been--and has been  since I came to the U.S. Senate--that under almost all circumstances, a  President has the right to have their nominees considered and to  receive a full vote by the entire Senate.   So I have gone back, and I have looked at how I, as a Senator, have  handled confirmations under President Bush and President Obama. When  cloture votes have been called on Cabinet nominees, my practice has  been to vote aye. I voted aye twice for Secretary of Defense Hagel. I  voted aye for Secretary of Labor Perez, even though I voted against his  confirmation in the final vote.   So, Mrs. DeVos.   She has answered thousands of questions that have been put to her.  Neither the Office of Government Ethics, the Senate HELP Committee, nor  I have found any substantive reason to question Mrs. DeVos's name or  reputation, but yet I have heard from thousands--truly thousands of  Alaskans who share their concerns about Mrs. DeVos as Secretary of  Education. They  [[Page S551]]  have contacted me by phone, by email, in person, and their concerns  center--as mine do--on Mrs. DeVos's lack of experience with public  education and the lack of knowledge she portrayed in her confirmation  hearing.   Alaskans are not satisfied that she would uphold Federal civil rights  laws in schools that receive Federal funds. They question her  commitment to students with disabilities' rights under IDEA. They fear  that the voucher programs that are intended to serve them may actually  rob them of the opportunity to benefit from an education in an  inclusive environment with their nondisabled peers.   After 8 years of the micromanagement that we have seen from this  previous administration, quite honestly, they are very concerned that  Mrs. DeVos will force vouchers on Alaska. Now, she has said that she  has not. She has committed publicly and to me personally that she will  not seek to impose vouchers on our States. She has committed to  implementing Federal education laws as they are written and intended,  and this is a welcome departure from what we had seen with the two  previous Secretaries of Education.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an  additional 1\1/2\ minutes.    Thank you, Mr. President.   She has committed that the focus she will give, not only to Alaska  but to all States will not undermine, erode, or ignore public schools  and that she will, in fact, work to support our public schools. She has  committed to me that she will come to Alaska in order to learn from  Alaska's educators, our parents, school board members, and our tribal  representatives to see for herself the challenges we face.   I still continue to have concerns. I think Mrs. DeVos has much to  learn about our Nation's public schools, how they work and the  challenges they face.   I have serious concerns about a nominee to be Secretary of Education  who has been so involved in one side of the equation--so immersed in  the push for vouchers--that she may be unaware of what actually is  successful within the public schools and also what is broken and how to  fix them.   Betsy DeVos must show us that she truly understands the children of  Alaska and across America, both urban and rural, who are not able to  access an alternative choice in education, as in so many of my  communities. She must show us that she will work to help the struggling  public schools that strive to educate children whose parents are unable  to drive them across town to get to a better school. That she will not  ignore the homeless students whose main worry is finding somewhere safe  to sleep and for whom their public school is truly a refuge. And that  she will fight for the children whose parents don't even know how to  navigate these educational options.   I believe that my colleagues here in the Senate and the many, many  they represent have the right to debate these questions, to air their  thoughts and concerns and perspectives about this nomination, and again  I believe that any President has the right to expect that we do so.   I conclude my remarks to make clear that my colleagues know firmly  that I do not intend to vote, on final passage, to support Mrs. DeVos  to be Secretary of Education. I thank the chairman of the committee for  working with me and with my colleagues on this matter, but I cannot  support this nominee.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on Energy and Natural Resources' subcommittee assignments for  the 115th Congress be printed in the Record.
