 Madam Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from  Louisiana not only for his leadership to our conference but also  speaking up and taking time out of his schedule to speak directly to  America and Americans about important issues that face our country  today.   Madam Speaker, we hear time after time our colleagues from the  Democratic Party talk about all the violence that is taking place in  large cities. Murders are up 30 percent last year according to the FBI  who talked about this rise. And then we turn around and see where they  are the activists who are leading the defunding of police, the  destabilization of our cities. The bringing together of illegals into  this country with record drug deals and amounts of drugs on our  streets, record numbers of death from fentanyl, opioids--misery.   But what does our President do?   He goes off on an aggressive agenda, one which is fueled by the  radicals in  [[Page H5709]]  his party, one which he fully believes in, one that he is proud of, and  one that they sustain and are still pushing. It is not enough just to  push and push big spending and Big Government. It is actually an agenda  that is in chaos. A chaotic agenda is apparent to the American people.   For a second I would like to have us think back about what we have  had previously with Republicans not only in charge in the House and the  Senate but in the Presidency leading this great Nation. Our goal as  Republicans is to have America to be a land of hope, to have America to  be a land of opportunity, to have America to be a land of freedom, for  America to be a land of achievement, and for America to be a land of  heroes.   For this to happen, Madam Speaker, it means that America needs its  ability to go back to work and to have the dignity of work. Madam  Speaker, it means that we need to have Americans who go to work not  because a government or a political party wants to keep people away  from work and is using trillions of dollars of government funds to keep  them there.    Madam Speaker, we have an administration and a President who wants to  take people's freedom away by requiring them to wear not just masks but  to have vaccinations or lose their job.   But, Madam Speaker, the thing that is harming America that is  apparent to everyone right now is the cost of items just to live.  Inflation and monetary policy are what the Fed is responsible for, the  Fed bank. And they are prepared to give hundreds of billions of dollars  and trillions of dollars, some $5,000 trillion is what they will be  asked to go take loans out on again. That devalues not just the  American dollar, but it actually causes a price increase directly at  the grocery store where people buy their food and basic elements.   Inflation is at a 40-year high, but we keep hearing about how much  money the government is going to put in people's pockets. But it is  robbed when they net it out, Madam Speaker.   It is robbed when they net it out because inflation robs not just  people who have families, but it robs those who live on a fixed income.  It robs the vitality and the ability that we have to be ingenious and  to move our country forward.   So, Madam Speaker, please know this, that the Republican Party and  our Members who are here tonight are not just speaking about things  because we disagree, it is because we love our country. We believe that  what was built and available for America and Americans is the greatest  country in the history of this world. We believe in Americanism. We  believe in American exceptionalism. We believe in the Constitution. We  believe in freedom and a right to make our own decisions in our own  homes and in our own communities.                                time  1645    Increasingly, we are finding that this new administration, the House  and the Senate under Democratic control, are taking away the basic  rights and freedoms that would have been enjoyed by free people, but  they are not because this administration intends to extend the long arm  of the Federal Government into all transportation, to all members of  the military, and to free people who want to live their own life.   Madam Speaker, Republicans are on the floor today to offer better  ideas, to offer hope and solutions, but perhaps more importantly to say  this, that we believe that it is time that this administration get off  its radical agenda, radical agenda that is leading America into chaos.   If the President would listen, if the Speaker of the House would  listen, and if the Senate majority leader would listen, they would hear  even members in their own party saying that a radical agenda will  greatly change America to where we would become a socialist Nation.   Madam Speaker, we are here offering the example that we have known  that made America great, and it is called capitalism and freedom.   I want to thank Mr. Johnson for taking the time to gather Republicans  together on the floor to offer not just our vision but also to  highlight to the American people that elections have consequences, and  we look forward to next year. I want to thank the gentleman for  allowing me this time.
