 Mr. President, I thank the leader for his comments. I  want to just say that the Democrats on the Judiciary Committee agree  with him, and on their behalf, I would like to make the following  comments.   Last week, the Judiciary Committee voted on the nomination of William  Barr to be Attorney General of the United States. All Democrats voted  against the nomination. There are reasons.   There is no question that Mr. Barr is qualified. He previously served  as Attorney General from 1991 to 1993, and he has had a long legal  career, but the question before us is whether Mr. Barr is the right  choice to lead the Justice Department, at this time, with this  President, when there are currently several active investigations that  implicate this President, his campaign, his advisers, and/or his inner  circle.   The answer for me and the Judiciary Committee Democrats is no. Let me  explain why. Five months before being named for the Attorney General  position, Mr. Barr wrote an extensive 19-page, single-spaced memo in  which he provided great detail and legal arguments for his view of the  President's absolute authority. Mr. Barr then shared and discussed that  memo with the White House Counsel and the President's defense lawyers.   In this memo, Mr. Barr outlined his views on Special Counsel  Mueller's investigation into possible obstruction of justice, the  unitary executive, and whether a President can, in fact, be indicted.   One example, Mr. Barr argued that Special Counsel Mueller should not  be allowed to question the President about obstruction of justice-- point 1.   He concluded that the law does not apply to the President if it  conflicts with a broad view of Executive authority, and that view is  often referred to as the unitary executive.   Under this belief, conflict of interest laws cannot and do not apply  to the President of the United States because, as Mr. Barr writes in  his memo, ``to apply them would impermissibly `disempower' the  President from supervising a class of cases that the Constitution  grants him the authority to supervise. Under the Constitution, the  President's authority over law enforcement matters is necessarily all- encompassing.''   Read the memo. This is on page 11.   Further, Mr. Barr asserted that ``the Constitution, itself, places no  limit on the President's authority to act on matters which concern him  or his own conduct.''   Mr. Barr went on to explain that, in his view, President Trump would  have virtually unlimited authority over the Executive branch. As he  said in his memo, the President ``alone is the Executive branch. As  such, he is the sole repository of all Executive powers conferred by  the Constitution. Thus, the full measure of law enforcement authority  is placed in the President's hands, and no limit is placed on the kinds  of cases subject to his control and supervision.''   That is page 11 of the memo.   Importantly, based on these conclusions, Mr. Barr asserts that  certain Presidential actions--including firing FBI Director James Comey  or telling the FBI to go easy on Michael Flynn--is never obstruction of  justice.   In fact, Mr. Barr even said that ``the President's discretion in  these areas has long been considered `absolute,' and his decisions  exercising this discretion are presumed to be regular and are generally  deemed nonreviewable.''   That is page 10 in the memo.   This is a stunning legal argument. Taken to its natural conclusion,  Mr. Barr's analysis squarely places this President above the law. To  argue that the President has no check on his authority flies in the  face of our constitutional principles of checks and balances and should  be concerning to Democrats and Republicans.   Mr. Barr's views about the power of the President are especially  troubling in light of his refusal to commit to making the special  counsel's findings and the report publicly available, and his refusal  to agree to protect the other investigations into President Trump.   When I asked Mr. Barr about this at the hearing, he said, in his own  words, that he would ``make as much information available as I can  consistent with the rules and regulations that are part of the special  counsel regulations.''   When others pressed him, he changed his answer to suggest that he may  instead release a summary of the special counsel's findings. This is  not acceptable. There is nothing in existing law or regulations that  prevents the Attorney General from sharing the special counsel's report  and underlying factual findings with the American public. Many of us  believe this report is seminal to the Presidency, and the public must  be able to read it.   In addition, as part of our oversight responsibilities, Congress  routinely requests and receives confidential information related to  closed investigations. In fact, recently Congress asked for and  received investigative information, including transcripts of FBI  interviews of witnesses involved in the examination of Secretary  Clinton's emails. This matter should be treated no differently.   After Mr. Barr's hearing, I sent him two letters. First, I asked him  to provide Congress and the American public with the full accounting of  the Mueller investigation, including any report prepared by the special  counsel himself.   Secondly, I asked him in writing to commit to protecting all  investigations into matters surrounding President Trump and the 2016  election.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that these two letters be  printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                    U.S. Senate,                                   Washington, DC, January 17, 2019.        Mr. Barr: I very much appreciated your responses to       questions before the Committee and hearing directly from you       on many important issues. As I noted during the hearing,       ensuring access to Mueller's findings and recommendations--      unchanged--is of utmost importance. To this end, I and others       asked you about releasing the report as drafted from the       Special Counsel. When I first asked you, you clearly stated       you would provide the report. Specifically, I asked,        ``Will you commit to making any report Mueller produces at       the conclusion of his investigation available to Congress and       to the public? And you responded, ``As I said in my       statement, I am going to make as much information available       as I can consistent with the rules and regulations that are       part of the special counsel regulations.''        I then asked, ``Will you commit to making any report on the       obstruction of justice public?'' You responded, ``That is the       same answer. Yes.''        Later as others pressed you on these answers you expanded       by saying:        ``As the rules stand now, people should be aware that the       rules I think say that the Special Counsel will prepare a       summary report on any prosecutive or declination decisions,       and that that shall be confidential and shall be treated as       any other declination or prosecutive material within the       Department.''        In fact the regulations state, ``At the conclusion of the       Special Counsel's work, he or she shall provide the Attorney       General with a confidential report explaining the prosecution       or declination decisions reached by the Special Counsel.''        As you may be aware, there is nothing in the regulations       saying the report should be ``treated as any other''       Department material, nor is there anything defining       confidential. Finally, there is no language in the       regulations indicating that Congress cannot have access--      especially when the materials in question relate to a       completed investigation.        It is also worth noting that in the most recent past       practice, the Department has provided Congress with       investigative reports and other materials, including notes       and summaries of witness interviews. Specifically, with       regard to the investigation into Secretary Clinton the       Department provided investigative reports, as well as notes       and summaries of witness interviews. As you testified ``the       country needs a credible resolution of these issues'' which       argues in favor of complete transparency and public       disclosure of as much information as possible, consistent       with national security and active law enforcement needs.        I would appreciate your response on this as quickly as       possible, and prior to the Committee's consideration of your       nomination in our Executive Business meetings.            Sincerely,                                                  Dianne Feinstein,                                                      U.S. Senator.  [[Page S1289]]                                          ____                                                   U.S. Senate,                                   Washington, DC, February 7, 2019.      William P. Barr,      Kirkland & Ellis LLP,      Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Barr: I am writing to follow up on my January 17       letter about Special Counsel Mueller's investigation, and       regarding other investigations that implicate the President's       interests. As you know, you were asked numerous questions       about both the Mueller investigation as well as       investigations in the Southern District of New York, Eastern       District of Virginia, and District of Columbia.        As raised at your hearing, it is imperative that all of       these investigations be free from any interference and       allowed to continue. In your June 2018 memo, you took the       position that ``no limit is placed on the kinds of cases       subject to [the President's] control and supervision,''       including ``matters in which he has an interest.'' While you       testified that you would not stop these investigations, you       qualified your answer by saying ``if I thought it was a       lawful investigation.'' When asked if the President could       fire prosecutors on these cases, you responded that ``the       President is free to fire his, you know, officials that he       has appointed.''        This gives you, and the President, considerable discretion       and power over these investigations. I therefore ask for your       commitment that these investigations will be allowed to       proceed without interference, and for an explanation of how       you will safeguard their independence and integrity, if       confirmed.        Thank you for your attention to these important matters.            Sincerely,                                                  Dianne Feinstein,                                                      U.S. Senator.    I did not receive the courtesy of a response to  either letter.   Here is a man seeking approval of his appointment. The ranking member  of the Judiciary Committee sends him a letter asking two very valid  questions, and there is no response. That told me something very loud  and clear.   Over the past year, we have seen several other investigations arising  out of the Southern District of New York, the Eastern District of  Virginia, and the District of Columbia, where prosecutors are looking  into crimes involving foreign donations into the Trump inauguration  committee, money laundering, campaign finance violations, as well as  possible efforts by Russian agents to assist the Trump campaign during  the election. When asked about these investigations at his hearing, Mr.  Barr refused to pledge they would be protected from interference. He  refused to pledge that these valid investigations would be protected  from interference.   For example, Senator Coons asked, ``If the President ordered you to  stop the [Southern District of New York] investigation in which someone  identified as individual one is implicated, would you do that?''   Mr. Barr responded that ``every decision within the department has to  be made based on the attorney general's independent conclusion and  assessment that it's in accordance with the law, so I would not stop a  bona fide lawful investigation.''   However, this qualification of ``a bona fide, lawful investigation''  is all important. In his 19-page memo, Mr. Barr clearly wrote this:  ``The full measure of law enforcement authority is placed in the  President's hands, and no limit is placed on the kinds of cases subject  to his control and supervision,'' including ``matters in which he has  an interest.'' I really see why he was nominated. This is the offering  of complete protection from the law by the Attorney General--future  Attorney General, if he should become one.   Mr. Barr went on to argue that if the President determined ``an  investigation was bogus, the President ultimately had legitimate  grounds for exercising his supervisory powers to stop the matter.''  This would mean that the President could stop the Mueller  investigation, which the President has repeatedly described as a  ``witch hunt'' and ``hoax.''   It also means that if Donald Trump decided the Southern District of  New York's investigation was, in Mr. Barr's words, ``bogus,'' the  President would have the right to stop the investigation. Think about  that. Think about the ramifications of that.   When Senator Blumenthal asked Mr. Barr during his hearing, ``If the  President fired a United States attorney, would you support continuing  that investigation, even under the civil servants, the career  prosecutors, who would remain?''   Mr. Barr replied, ``Yeah . . . I believe, regardless of who or what  outside the department is trying to influence what is going on, every  decision within the department relating to enforcement, the attorney  general has to determine independently that--that it is a lawful  action.''   Think about that. The Attorney General becomes the arbiter,  independently, of what a lawful action comprises. But, again, according  to this memo, firing a U.S. attorney, even if it implicates the  President's own personal interests, is a lawful action by the  President.   During this hearing, Mr. Barr stated that ``the President can fire a  U.S. attorney. They are a presidential appointment.''   The meaning of this is clear: Prosecutors in these cases can be fired  arbitrarily by the President of the United States under his plenary  authority.   As I said at the outset, the question is whether Mr. Barr is the  right person for the job at this time. The memo that I am quoting from  I spent a full day reading and thinking about, and it was the most  extreme case for Presidential power that I have ever read. In and of  itself, it gives me cause to believe this is why--I could be wrong, but  this is why he received that nomination.   Given the broad implications of Presidential power and unlimited  control Mr. Barr believes this President has over law enforcement  matters, I cannot support this nominee to serve as Attorney General. At  this critical time in our Nation's history, we must have an Attorney  General who is objective and who is clearly committed to protecting the  interests of the people, the country, and the Constitution.--not the  President.   I yield the floor.
