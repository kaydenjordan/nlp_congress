 Mr. Speaker, I am honored to stand here today as the  Representative for Texas' Third Congressional District. This district  was first represented by William Thomas Clark, a general in the Union  Army in 1870. Since then, 19 people have represented the district,  including myself. Most recently, a true American hero, Congressman Sam  Johnson, represented the Third District in the Congress for 28 years.   Prior to that, Congressman Johnson was in the U.S. Air Force. As I  like to say, he shot down his first MiG in Korea. He served a ground  tour in Vietnam, and in his second tour of Vietnam, on his 46th  mission, he was flying his jet over an enemy gun position when his gun  jammed. He did a circle around. He flew a second time, and that time,  he was shot down. He then went to the Hanoi Hilton. There, he survived  pernicious beatings and torture.   But, Mr. Speaker, do you know what? Despite the tremendous pressure  that he was under, Sam Johnson was unique among the prisoners of the  Hanoi Hilton in that he never broke; he never gave in; and he never  wavered in his patriotism, his faith in God, his courage, his  sacrifices, and his commitment to this country.   America is eternally grateful for his service.   After he got back from the Hanoi Hilton, he came back to his beloved  Shirley and his children back in Texas. He was in the Air Force for a  while, and then he went into business.   But he wanted to continue to serve. In 1984, he ran for the Texas  House of Representatives, and he was elected in the Third District in a  special election in 1991.   Here in the United States Congress, he served for 28 years. He served  on the Ways and Means Committee and continued to be an icon of virtue,  a paragon of service, and a man whose shoes I can never truly fill but  in whose footsteps I resolve to try to walk in.                            ____________________
