 Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 6, the SUPPORT for Patients  and Communities Act. This bill makes incremental changes to support  those affected by the opioid crisis, but it is far from perfect.   H.R. 6 does not adequately deal with the magnitude of the crisis that  this country is facing, and there are provisions that I did not support  at the subcommittee or full committee markup, including provisions that  most Democrats voted against. Nonetheless, I am pleased that Democrats  were able to secure positive provisions in the final package that we  are considering today.   Most notably, H.R. 6 includes provisions from a bill introduced by  Representative Tonko and Representative Lujan that would extend access  to evidence-based, medication-assisted treatment. Specifically, this  section of the bill will allow advanced practice registered nurses,  including midwives, to treat patients with buprenorphine for opiate use  disorder for 5 years. The bill will also allow nurse practitioners and  physician assistants to treat patients with buprenorphine permanently,  and allow qualified providers to treat up to 100 patients instead of 30  patients in their first year.   This is a critical step forward in the expansion of treatment, one of  the major challenges that we continue to face in the fight against this  epidemic.   Mr. Chair, I commend Representative Tonko and Representative Lujan  for their ongoing leadership in this area.   This bill also expands coverage through Medicare by adding methadone  clinics to the Medicare program. Right now, methadone clinics are not  Medicare providers. Seniors who want to get treatment from methadone  clinics have to pay out of pocket. Adding methadone clinics will  address an important coverage gap in the Medicare program and  meaningfully expand access to treatment for opiate use disorders.   The bill also improves coverage for vulnerable populations in  Medicaid, ensures coverage for former foster youth up to the age of 26  nationwide, and supports State efforts to ensure continuity of coverage  for people with substance use disorders as they leave incarceration.   The bill will also provide funding to Medicaid substance use disorder  health homes, give States money to expand the treatment capacity of  Medicaid providers, and raise reimbursement rates. It also mandates  coverage of Medicaid for all forms of medication-assisted treatment for  5 years.    The legislation also mandates comprehensive substance use disorder  benefits in the Children's Health Insurance Program, better known as  CHIP. I am also pleased that H.R. 3528, the Every Prescription Conveyed  Securely Act, authored by Representative Clark of Massachusetts, is  included in the bill. E-prescribing is an important tool that will  reduce opiate diversion and prescription fraud.   Further, the bill gives the Secretary of HHS the authority to expand  the use of telehealth services in Medicare for substance use disorder  treatment to help reach more people across the country.   These were all important Democratic provisions and priorities that we  worked hard to have included in the final package. I think these will  all make a real difference in our fight against the opioid epidemic.   Having said that, Mr. Chairman, I still have concerns with some of  the provisions included in this final negotiated bill and the process  by which we arrived here. For instance, there are two Medicare bills  that I opposed through the committee process that I am concerned may  not have a meaningful impact on the opioid crisis.   H.R. 5804 would increase reimbursement for certain interventional  pain injections in the ambulatory surgery setting under Medicare. I  have seen no evidence that increasing reimbursement for these  injections would have a meaningful impact on opioid prescribing. While  it is important that Congress finds ways to promote nonopioid therapies  that will reduce opioid prescribing, this legislation endorses and  incentivizes interventions that may not be effective for a majority of  the patients receiving them.   I also have some concerns about H.R. 5809, which would extend a  temporary pass-through payment for nonopioid analgesics for  postsurgical pain management from 3 to 5 years in Medicare. I do  question if this bill will have a meaningful impact on the opioid  crisis.   I am also disappointed that partisan legislation that would direct  the FDA to issue guidance on how the agency will apply the criteria for  accelerated approval and breakthrough therapy designation to  nonaddictive pain and addiction treatment was included in this package.  This legislation would set the precedent of having the FDA opine on how  expedited programs may apply differently for therapeutic areas.   It requires the agency to host a public meeting to discuss this and  other topics, but provides no resources for the agency to complete  these tasks. This is not legislation that FDA asked for or highlighted  as a priority in fighting the opioid crisis.   While they may now be comfortable with the changes that have been  made to the bill, I am not comfortable with the policy.   Finally, Mr. Chairman, I think it is essential that we keep this  opioid package in the context of a larger healthcare debate in  Congress. As I have stated before, my Republican colleagues are  interested in taking credit today for some policies that helped those  affected by the crisis while at the same time actively threatening and  sabotaging the very healthcare coverage that many of the same people  rely on in the first place. The ongoing efforts by House Republicans  and the Trump administration to repeal or sabotage the Affordable Care  Act have only harmed those affected by this crisis.   Earlier this month, Republicans directly threatened the healthcare of  people with opioid use disorder when the Trump administration asked a  Federal court to strike down key patient protections in the Affordable  Care Act. If successful, the Trump administration's action would  eliminate protections that ensure more than 130 million Americans with  preexisting conditions cannot be denied coverage. And guess what is  considered to be a preexisting condition? Opioid use disorders and  people with it.   Republicans also continue with their attempts to gut the Medicaid  program, which is our most important weapon in the fight against this  epidemic. Both the consumer protections of the ACA and Medicaid have  saved countless lives that would have otherwise been destroyed by the  opioid crisis. So it is nice that we are passing this bipartisan  package today, but we should not forget the tremendous harm Republican  policies would inflict elsewhere on the same people we seek to help  with this opioid package.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Eshoo).    Mr. Chairman, I yield the gentlewoman from California an  additional 30 seconds.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Peters).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Massachusetts (Ms. Clark).  [[Page H5514]]         Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Tonko).    Mr. Chairman, may I ask how much time I have remaining.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Bass).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Cardenas).    Mr. Chairman, I want to enter into the Record my  extended remarks regarding a provision included in H.R. 6 that does not  enjoy bipartisan support.   Section 301 was passed out of the Energy and Commerce Committee on a  party-line vote. Had a committee report been filed, I would have filed  the dissenting views that I am now seeking to have added to the Record.   Mr. Chair, H.R. 5806, the 21st Century Tools for Pain and Addiction  Treatment Act, would require the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to  hold a public meeting regarding the challenges and barriers of  developing non-addictive pain and addiction treatments and to issue  guidance regarding the eligibility of such treatments for either the  Accelerated Approval Program or Breakthrough Therapy Designation. This  legislation could undermine FDA's implementation of the Accelerated  Approval and Breakthrough Therapy Designation programs and divert  critical financial and personnel resources away from activities related  to addressing the opioid crisis for purposes of incentivizing an  industry that is already taking advantage of these programs. This  legislation is a solution in search of a problem.   Opioid overdose death rates are now the leading cause of  unintentional, non-traumatic deaths in the United States. According to  the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), overdose deaths  from opioids have quadrupled in the last 20 years. Approximately 116  deaths per day occur from an opioid overdose resulting in over 42,000  deaths per year.  [[Page H5517]]  Of those deaths, 40 percent are due to a prescription opioid. Every  day, over 1,000 individuals are treated in emergency departments for  complications due to the misuse of opioids, and hospitalizations have  increased by over 60 percent since 2005. It is within this context that  there has been increasing interest in developing non-addictive  treatments for pain and substance use disorders.   FDA, led by Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, has acknowledged that the  agency has a role to play in addressing the opioid crisis, including  ensuring that fewer individuals become addicted through medical use of  these products. According to Commissioner Gottlieb, this includes  ``helping support the development of new, safe and effective treatments  for pain that don't carry all the same risks of addiction as opioid  medicines.'' One of his first actions was the creation of the Opioid  Policy Steering Committee (OPSC) that has been tasked with fostering  the development of novel pain treatment therapies, and the advancement  of non-addictive drugs and devices to treat pain was also included as  one of the agency's priorities in FDA's 2018 Strategic Policy Roadmap.   Despite this, concerns have been raised from some pharmaceutical  manufacturers that more could be done to help incentivize manufacturers  to develop non-addictive treatments for pain and addiction. This  included legislation that would direct FDA to issue guidance clarifying  how and when the agency would provide accelerated approval and  breakthrough therapy designation for medicines to treat pain or  addiction. In addition, the proposal includes requiring a detailed  annual report in which the agency would account for the number of  requests received, granted, or denied for consideration under the  expedited programs, the common reasons for granting or denying an  application for expedited programs, timelines for drug development,  timelines for product review, comparison of metrics among review  divisions, common reasons for longer timelines for drug development and  product review, as well as recommendations as to how the expedited  programs could be better utilized. This legislation was subsequently  released by Representative Burgess (R-TX) and was one of the bills  noticed for a hearing on March 21, 2018. At this hearing, a  representative from BIO testified that the legislation is needed to  ``serve as a powerful signal to stakeholders and investors that  treatment and therapies that improve and protect the lives of patients  suffering from pain and addiction is a top public health priority.''   H.R. 5806, the 21st Century Tools for Pain and Addiction Treatment  Act, was formally introduced on May 15, 2018, with Reps. Bucshon and  Griffith joining as co-authors. As introduced, the legislation would  direct FDA to hold at least one public meeting within one year of  enactment to discuss the challenges and barriers of developing non- addictive medical products intended to treat pain or addiction,  including the application of novel clinical trial designs and the use  of real world evidence and patient experience, as well as the  application of eligibility criteria for the Accelerated Approval  program and the Breakthrough Therapy designation. In addition, the bill  would also direct FDA to issue final guidance or update existing  guidance regarding how the agency would apply eligibility criteria for  the Accelerated Approval program and the Breakthrough Therapy  designation to non-addictive medical products for pain or addiction,  including considering the risk of addiction to controlled substances  for pain when establishing unmet medical need, and considering whether  pain, pain control, or pain management in assessing whether a disease  or condition is a serious or life-threatening disease or condition. The  guidance must also cover the methods by which sponsors may evaluate  acute and chronic pain, endpoints for non-addictive medical products  intended to treat pain and how the endpoints would be evaluated for  efficacy.   FDA has repeatedly noted that it is actively working with industry  and other government partners to encourage the development of non- opioid treatments for pain and addiction. Both former FDA Commissioner  Robert Califf and current FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb have stated  that FDA will use all of the tools at the agency's disposal to move  alternatives to opioids as expeditiously as possible. This is a  commitment that Commissioner Gottlieb has continued to echo in  testimony before the Energy and Commerce Committee (the Committee),  specifically noting that ``This includes programs such as Fast Track  and Breakthrough Therapy Designations that are intended to facilitate  development and to expedite review of products that, for example, are  intended to treat a serious condition for which there is an unmet  medical need. As a part of these efforts, FDA is meeting with  innovators who are pursuing non-opioid alternatives for the treatment  of pain to provide guidance on their individual products.''   However, FDA's commitment to this development has not been limited to  testimony before Congress or through meetings with industry. In the  last five years, FDA has taken a number of actions to help with  development of alternative pain and addiction treatments, including  convening the Science Board to discuss issues related to challenges  facing FDA in supporting the development of pain medications; issuing  final guidance and hosting two public meetings regarding the  development of opioids with abuse deterrent properties; and as  mentioned previously, the advancement of non-addictive drugs and  devices to treat pain was also included in FDA's 2018 Strategic Policy  Roadmap. Further, the agency also participated in a public-private- partnership under the Critical Path initiative, the Analgesic Clinical  Trial Translation, Innovations, Opportunities, and Networks (ACTTION).  ACTTION is a collaboration among a broad range of national and  international groups working to advance the science in non-opioid and  non-addictive pain medications, and includes participation from  academia, government agencies, pharmaceutical and device companies,  professional organizations, and patient advocacy groups. The agency has  also approved non-opioid medications for treatment of chronic pain,  including gabapentin, pregabalin, milnacipran, and duloxetine, among  others.   These actions are all in addition to the consultation and meetings  offered by FDA to sponsors in this space in a one-on-one setting. FDA  has committed, to discussion with individual sponsors related to  questions about the development of non-opioid and non-addictive medical  products for pain or addiction. No evidence has been provided by  supporters of this legislation, or by the Majority, that has shown  otherwise.   FDA has in place four pathways by which review and consideration of a  drug can be expedited--Priority Review, Breakthrough Therapy,  Accelerated Approval, and Fast Track. These pathways provide the  sponsor of certain drugs with access to assistance and streamlined  review from the agency. At issue in H.R. 5806 is the application of  Accelerated Approval and Breakthrough Therapy Designation.   Accelerated Approval, first established in 1992 and codified in 2012,  allows drugs for serious conditions that meet an unmet medical need to  be approved based on a surrogate endpoint. The use of a surrogate  endpoint may predict the clinical benefit of a drug earlier, and FDA is  able to require the manufacturers to conduct post-market confirmatory  studies to verify the clinical benefit. The Breakthrough Therapy  Designation, established in 2012, provides sponsors of drugs to treat a  serious condition with preliminary evidence that they demonstrate  substantial improvement over other available treatments with access to  intensive guidance regarding their drug development program, more  frequent meetings and communication with FDA, and rolling review. Both  pathways are desirable from a manufacturer's perspective as it can  allow products to come to market sooner. A recent study conducted by  Friends of Cancer Research found that cancer drugs that received  Breakthrough Therapy Designation received FDA approval nearly three  months sooner than drugs that did not, and their development time was  reduced by nearly two years.   The additional guidance, communication, and expedited review provided  by these two programs does have an impact on both the financial and  personnel resources of FDA. In fact, the Breakthrough Therapy  Designation program received far more interest than originally  projected, and given the access to FDA staff throughout the development  and review process and has been described by the agency as posing a  ``strain'' because the creation of the designation did not come with  any additional resources. According to testimony from Dr. Janet  Woodcock, Director of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, over  the first four years of the program the agency had received 492  requests for designation, and of those, granted 165 requests. As a  result, industry and FDA negotiated to increase the number of staff  dedicated to the Breakthrough Therapy Designation program by 36 full- time employees as part of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act  reauthorization signed into law as a part of the Food and Drug  Administration Reauthorization Act. While user fee resources may help  to address the issues associated with the implementation of the  Breakthrough Therapy Designation program, the Office of New  Drugs within the Center for Drug Evaluation and Review (CDER) continues  to be short-staffed with one estimate noting that the Office is 10  percent under the authorized staffing ceiling.    As previously mentioned, proponents of the legislation have argued it  is necessary in order to help ``enable the utilization of Accelerated  Approval and Breakthrough Therapy pathways'' for non-addictive pain and  addiction treatments. ``Enactment and implementation of this  legislation would provide FDA and the biopharmaceutical industry with a  greater understanding of what is required to meet criteria for these  expedited approval pathways and ensure processes intended to expedite  development and approval meet the unique needs of  [[Page H5518]]  pain and addiction medicines,'' noted Ms. Cartier Esham, Executive Vice  President, Emerging Companies Section and Senior Vice President,  Science & Regulatory Affairs at BIO, in testimony before the Committee.  Despite the claims of lack of clarity, there is evidence that industry  has been taking advantage of both of these pathways currently.   Accordingly, in technical assistance provided by FDA the agency  stated, ``We believe, however, that sponsors and potential sponsors of  [non-opioid and non-addictive medical] products are already aware of  these programs, and have been taking advantage of them. We also believe  that to the extent there is a need for additional outreach on  application of the expedited programs to these products, FDA has, and  is committed to using, other means to accomplish this, such as public  meetings . . . and discussion with individual sponsors.'' More than 60  percent of new molecular entities and biologics license applications  approved in 2017 were eligible for one of the expedited programs--Fast  Track, Breakthrough Therapy, Priority Review, or Accelerated Approval.  This includes products in the pain and addiction space. On Breakthrough  Therapy Designation, there have been 19 requests for designation from  drugs with pain indications since the program was created, three of  those were granted, 14 were denied, and two were withdrawn. According  to FDA, ``In general, if a drug meets the statutory criteria it will  get the designation.'' In regard to Accelerated Approval, there has  been one drug with an indication for pain; another product has received  Fast Track designation. All evidence indicates that sponsors of non- opioid and non-addictive medical products for pain and addiction are  receiving access to FDA and have been able to take advantage of the  expedited programs if they meet the statutory criteria.   The opioid crisis has made everyone rethink how we treat pain and  addiction in this country and there is broad agreement that this  conversation should include examining alternatives to opioids that are  non-addictive. Patients and providers deserve to have options other  than opioids for pain and addiction. It is clear that FDA has  prioritized this effort and has been assisting sponsors in their  development. No evidence has been provided that demonstrates otherwise.  H.R. 5806 is legislation in search of a problem.   A key provision of H.R. 5806 is directing FDA to issue, or update,  guidance regarding how the agency will apply the Accelerated Approval  and Breakthrough Therapy Designation program to non-addictive medical  products for pain or addiction. This would include the circumstances  under which FDA may apply eligibility criteria to these products, how  FDA will consider the risk of addiction of controlled substances  approved to treat pain when establishing unmet medical need, and how  FDA will consider pain, pain control, or pain management in assessing  whether a disease or condition is a serious or life-threatening  condition. Such an effort would be precedent-setting for the agency as  it would be the first time the agency would do such a regulatory  guidance for a product specific area.   In order to help drug sponsors make determinations about whether or  not their products would be eligible for expedited programs pathways,  as well as Fast Track and Priority Review, the agency issued  comprehensive guidance outlining the requirements and features of each  of the pathways in May 2014. As noted in the guidance, ``The purpose of  this guidance for industry is to provide a single resource for  information on FDA's policies and procedures for these four programs as  well as threshold criteria generally applicable to concluding that a  drug is a candidate for these expedited development and review  programs.'' H.R. 5806 would move to change this by requiring the agency  to issue new guidance for non-addictive pain or addiction treatments.  According to technical assistance received from FDA:       Typically, FDA refrains from issuing product area-specific       guidance documents unless there is a need to address       scientific or clinical issues specific to those products. It       is not clear what scientific or clinical issues specific to       application of our expedited programs to non-opioid or non-      addictive medical products to treat pain or substance use       disorder would benefit from FDA guidance. To the extent       sponsors have questions about how FDA's expedited programs       apply to their specific products, such questions are better       addressed in our existing guidance on the use of expedited       programs in general and in meetings or other communications       between FDA and individual sponsors. These latter       interactions with FDA permit targeted, product-specific       discussion of a type that is typically not possible in       guidance--even product area-specific guidance.  By requiring the agency to issue such guidance, despite FDA's concerns,  H.R. 5806 is now raising questions regarding whether or not the  criteria for the expedited programs applies differently for each  product area, and could expose the agency to a multitude of additional  requests from other therapeutic areas for product area-specific  guidance about the eligibility for these pathways.   In addition, H.R. 5806 would also require the agency to host at least  one public meeting to examine challenges and barriers facing non- addictive medical products for pain and addiction, including  application of novel clinical trial designs, use of real world evidence  and patient experience data, as well as the eligibility criteria for  Accelerated Approval and Breakthrough Therapy Designation. Public  meetings and guidance require considerable staff time and financial  resources, diverting time away from other activities such as meeting  one-on-one with sponsors or responding to questions regarding  submissions. This legislation does not provide any new resources for  these activities, and would have been more appropriately discussed  during consideration of the user fee reauthorization that could have  accounted for the need for additional resources to implement these  activities.   As FDA has noted, the agency grants access to the expedited programs  if products meet the statutory requirements of such programs.  Proponents have argued that legislation is necessary to incentivize  industry to develop non-addictive pain and addiction treatments as well  as to make sure that the expedited programs and processes ``meet the  unique needs of pain and addiction medicines.'' This makes clear the  legislation is not about greater clarity as supporters have argued, but  is instead about re-interpreting the requirements of the expedited  programs to ensure that non-addictive pain or addiction treatments will  be eligible. H.R. 5806 as such could be used in the future for  stakeholder to request the eligibility for the expedited programs be  changed to guarantee that their products can receive Accelerated  Approval and Breakthrough Therapy Designation should the guidance  provided under this legislation not be suffice. This could have the  effect of unintentionally weakening the benefits of Accelerated  Approval and Breakthrough Therapy Designation pathway by expanding it  to even more products, and put strain on FDA's resources by expanding  such programs to products that were not planned for under the user fee  reauthorizations. While we all want to bring alternatives to opioids to  market sooner, we must seriously consider the implications of expanding  FDA's expedited programs.   Finally, this is not legislation that FDA has asked for or  highlighted as a priority in fighting the opioid crisis. While the  agency has indicated that they are not opposing the legislation and  believe the changes that have been made are helpful, this legislation  can have real and serious implications for the drug approval process.   It is for all these reasons that Democrats unanimously opposed H.R.  5806.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have no additional speakers, and I reserve  the balance of my time.  [[Page H5519]]         Mr. Chair, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the staff who worked so  hard on H.R. 6 and the opioid bills, in general. Democrats worked to  make H.R. 6 a better bill, even though we have concerns about the  overall impact of the opioid package.   Mr. Chair, I ask my colleagues to support the legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I would like to request time to speak in  favor of the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in order to speak on the amendment  offered by Representatives Barton, Meadows and Kuster.   FDA Commissioner Gottlieb testified before the Energy and Commerce  Committee about the work the agency is doing currently to analyze and  assess opioid analgesic use in situations of acute pain, such as  following surgical procedures. The goal of this analysis is to provide  evidence-based recommendations for appropriate opioid doses by  indicators ensuring that prescribing more closely aligns with clinical  need.   I believe this is a goal that we all support, which is why I support  giving FDA the authority to conduct such work so as to inform policies  that will better protect public health, and help to reduce the unneeded  opioids from reaching individuals that are at risk for addiction.    Since this amendment has been filed, we have heard some concerns from  stakeholders about the amendment possibly impeding the use of the FDA's  evidence-based guidelines in making decisions related to dispensing or  coverage of opioid prescriptions. I believe that such decisions should  be informed by evidence-based guidelines such as those developed by the  FDA, and I hope that we can work with the amendment's sponsors and the  chairman to address these concerns moving forward.
