 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, let me join the Senator from Maryland in  expressing my frustration. Many of us worked long and hard to be  elected to the U.S. Senate, not just to represent our States but to  respond to the challenges that face us in the United States. The  challenge of gun safety faces everyone. Thank you to the Senator from  Maryland for making that point on the floor of the Senate.   Many people come to the Senate Galleries, sit in the chairs, and wait  for the Senate to act. It is a long waiting game because,  unfortunately, the Senate does little or nothing under the  [[Page S5590]]  leadership of Senator McConnell. I don't know why this Senator has not  accepted the fact that the U.S. Senate has an important role to play.  We speak for people not only in Illinois and in Maryland but for those  all across the United States, and they are very concerned.   In the recent trip home over the recess, I visited some of the areas  around Chicago and in the city, and there were many conversations about  the gun violence that we see across America. That gun violence has been  punctuated by the horrible events in El Paso and Odessa, TX, and in  other communities that have been affected by these mass killings. We  have become numb, I am afraid, to the reality of gun violence in  America. We have decided, I am afraid, that the Second Amendment to the  Constitution is somehow holding us back--binding us and restraining  us--from even doing the most basic things.   Overwhelmingly, the people of America, by a factor of over 90  percent--Democrats and Republicans--believe that we should have  background checks. We believe that the people who have been convicted  of violent felonies shouldn't own guns--period. We believe, as well,  that when it comes to those who have serious mental instability, they  should also be precluded from gun ownership. The laws do not allow us  to adequately ask the question or to test whether the buyer has been  convicted of a felony or has such a background.   In the city of Chicago, hardly a weekend goes by without there being  dozens shot and 9 or 10 or more losing their lives. Most of them are  young people, but not exclusively. Older people, as well, are caught in  the crossfire.   People say: Well, I thought Chicago had these tough gun laws. What is  going on there? Why do you have so many gun deaths?   The answer is obvious for those of us who spend time in that great  city. We are about 20 minutes away from northwestern Indiana and from  the gun shows that are held there, where people don't ask questions  when they sell firearms. All you need to do is to have the money and  the open trunk of your car to fill it up with guns and drive them back  to the city of Chicago. That is why no State can solve this problem. We  need Federal legislation.   As I talk to people across this country, they tell me the  heartbreaking stories of sitting down with their children who have gone  through some drill or program at school to forewarn them of what would  happen if an active shooter were to come onto the premises. As we know,  that reality is not beyond reach. In Connecticut, we saw a beautiful  first grade class that was attacked by a killer with a weapon who took  the lives of those children. If that scandalous massacre of children in  a first grade classroom didn't move this Congress and this President to  act, what will?   The President said to me in a conversation several weeks ago that we  are going to have a background check bill and that it will be the best  in the history of the world. Well, I was skeptical when he said it. I  am even more skeptical today. I knew what would happen. When the  President had a choice between the public interest of gun safety and  the special interest of the National Rifle Association, the National  Rifle Association prevailed.   This President refuses to come forward with any proposal, and Senator  McConnell believes his hands are tied and cannot bring this issue to  the floor of the Senate. He cannot run the risk that his Members would  have to be on the record as having taken a vote, as they were elected  to do, on an issue of this importance.                                    S. 386    Madam President, this is not the only issue that we are ignoring--the  only issue that is, frankly, not even being considered on the floor of  the Senate. There is another one that is equally important to me and to  most people across this country, and that is dealing with the challenge  of immigration.   A few years ago, a bipartisan group of Senators--eight of us--I,  Senator McCain, Senator Schumer, and others--sat down and wrote a  comprehensive immigration reform bill. It was months of Republicans and  Democrats sitting down, face-to-face, night after night, going through  every section of our immigration code to come up with a comprehensive  bill to deal with the obvious shortcomings, but we did it. We brought  it to the floor of the Senate and it received 68 votes. There were 14  Republicans who joined the Democrats to pass this comprehensive  immigration reform. We sent it to the Republican House of  Representatives, and Speaker Boehner refused to even consider it. So  all of our effort and all of our work was really for nothing.   We continue to face the challenge of immigration. We know what it is  like at the border. Under this President, we have seen the worst border  situation in modern times. His refusal to acknowledge the three Central  American countries that are sending all of these immigrants to the  United States has led to some horrible circumstances.   Recently, the inspector general of Health and Human Services came  forward with a report on the Trump administration's response to this  border crisis. It was a report on the policy of zero tolerance. I am  sure you will remember it. It was under Attorney General Sessions, and  he somehow found a quotation in the Bible to justify forcibly removing  children from their parents. We removed 2,880 children from their  parents at the border under this zero tolerance policy before there was  an uprising in the United States against it and before the President  backed off of it.   I commend the inspector general's report on what happened to those  children--to every American. I saw it firsthand. I witnessed these  children as they were being removed from their parents and the trauma  they went through as a result.   So why aren't we debating the immigration policy on the floor of the  U.S. Senate? I am told that perhaps, later today, the junior Senator  from Utah--at this point, I think he is the senior Senator from Utah-- will come forward with a unanimous consent request to consider fixing  one part of the immigration problem. I want to fix that problem and  many more.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 2517         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.
