 Mr. President, July 4 is a day to recognize our Nation's  Declaration of Independence 244 years ago. On this day, we collectively  pause to honor the values that make this Nation great.   July 4 is also a day of shared reflection to see how well we have  made more tangible the ideals of our founders ``to create a more  perfect union.'' As we look across the landscape of our country today,  these words ring with even greater resonance. Our Nation and our people  face a call to action to continue the fight against racial injustice,  an injustice that has limited the freedom of too many for too long.   The collective ideals to which Thomas Jefferson gave voice in the  Declaration's promise of ``Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of  Happiness'' still echo through the American experience--from Alexander  Hamilton's immigrant dream, birthed before our Nation, to the Rev. Dr.  Martin Luther King, Jr.'s July 4, 1965, sermon at Atlanta's Ebenezer  Baptist Church. As Dr. King said, ``If we are going to make the America  Dream a reality, we are challenged to work in an action program to get  rid of the last vestiges of segregation and discrimination.''   America has been and will be a leader in the world. The American  people historically have cherished and spearheaded this role.  Leadership at any level comes with responsibility, and, in this case,  it means we must look to put our own house in order, where we must  address domestic injustices.   We must continue our tireless work to create a more perfect union.  The struggle will not stop until all men, women, and children can live  the American Dream as Dr. King envisioned. To do this, we must continue  to assess the true meaning of liberty and freedom. As we begin to  acknowledge fundamental elements of our Nation's history, we must  recommit to ensuring freedom for all.   Our country's strength lies in the diversity and equality of our  people. Through this diversity and through this equality, today we may  celebrate the unity described in the very declaration of our Nation's  freedom and independence.   On this historic day, we must also celebrate our country's capacity  to change. We have overcome monumental challenges before. The majority  of our Founders did not comprehend that Black Lives Matter. Today, we  work to ensure actions that back up those important words.   Still, as we reflect on the Nation's founding, we recall our past,  honor that which is great, and effect the call we perpetually hear to  make our Nation a more perfect union.                            ____________________
