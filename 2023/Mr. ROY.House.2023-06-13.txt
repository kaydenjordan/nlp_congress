 Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman from Kentucky for  yielding me time.   Mr. Speaker, here we are engaging in the theater of the absurd, yet  again, from our colleagues on the other side of the aisle just  blatantly denying the power grab being carried out by the executive  branch yet again. They don't seem to care so long as it suits their  ends in terms of policy.   Everybody who follows this understands that the court is almost  certain to strike this down. We have already seen it happen in the  Fifth Circuit. We are pretty clear about the extent to which this is an  abuse of the Administrative Procedures Act, the extent to which this is  an unconstitutional violation of our Second Amendment rights, and the  court, no doubt, like the Fifth Circuit, will follow suit.   That is just the simple truth, just like we expect the court to most  likely rule that the President's power grab to extend a bailout for  student loans will also be struck down. That is almost certainly true.   However, what is also true is that it is incumbent upon the United  States Congress--the House of Representatives in particular--to stand  up in defense of the Constitution, in defense not just as might seem  most apparent here, a defense of the Second Amendment which this most  certainly is, but, in fact, a defense of separation of powers, that, in  fact, it is not the executive branch that makes law.   When the Speaker of the House actually says that the President  doesn't have power to do something and then refuses, as the previous  Speaker, Speaker Pelosi, did to do anything about what the President is  doing to exercise that authority unconstitutionally--as was the case  with the student loan--then it begs the question: Do any of my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle give a whit about separation  of powers or about the fact that it is a clear abuse of the power of  the executive branch?   The answer is no. That is the clear truth. They don't give a whit  about that, nor do they give a whit about it here because they like the  outcome of the policy: the banning of a piece of plastic. That is the  truth.   However, it is not really about the pistol braces, is it? Because  really that was, in fact, something created by marine and Army veteran  Alex Bosco inventing the pistol stabilizing brace to help his friend, a  disabled combat veteran, at the shooting range.   At the time, the ATF--President Obama's ATF--advised Mr. Bosco that a  stabilizing brace did not convert a pistol into a short-barreled rifle.  He relied upon that.   Now, here we are a decade later, and the Biden ATF wants to reverse  that by executive fiat, not through the congressional powers, not by  legislation, as was possible last summer when my colleagues had the  House, the Senate, and the White House. No. No. They prefer to go ahead  and use the unaccountable and unelected bureaucrat at the ATF to make  policy.   We are here to say that that is a bad idea. It is a bad idea for the  Republic, it is a bad idea for freedom, and it is a bad idea with  respect to our fundamental rights.   The reality here is my colleagues on the other side of the aisle know  full well what they want to do. It is not just to ban an accessory.  They want to ban firearms. They want to ban firearms from top to  bottom, and this is a step to do it. I have always been taught that if  your opponents say something, you should believe them. That is the  reality.   I hope my colleagues on this side of the aisle will stand up to the  CRA and send it over to the Senate where it most assuredly might end up  being a message amendment because the President of the United States  will almost assuredly veto it because he doesn't care about separation  of powers either.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my friend from Kentucky for  yielding.   The gentleman from Massachusetts was questioning why he hasn't heard  from any veteran groups in support of this.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to include in the Record an  article titled: ``Wisconsin veterans sue ATF over new rule for  stabilizing braces.''    Mr. Speaker, there are others. The fact of the matter is  there are many veterans groups--that is one; we will get you some  more--who are supportive of this bill and who are supportive of this  effort to protect their Second Amendment rights.   That is a fact because my colleagues on the other side of the aisle  want registration because they want to take guns from the American  people because they know that liberty rests with the people.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Wisconsin who frequently  comes down to the floor and engages and uses the Special Orders, as we  call them. It is great to see him down here.   I often state I wish we would have more engaged debate on the floor  of the House, actual debate, not just the kind of fake debate where we  go back and forth for an hour equally divided over a bill that we  pretty much predetermined will be passed on a partisan basis but  actually pick an issue and engage in thoughtful debate back and forth  about a topic.   I would encourage any of my colleagues who are willing to do so on,  frankly, either side of the aisle where we have reasonable  disagreements that we could engage and try to deal with.   The fact is for too long, in this country, in the House of  Representatives, we have been dealing with a uniparty.   We have been dealing with essentially not a lot of difference in  terms of the total output of what this town does.   We have strong disagreement here on the floor. We pass bills. We get  them passed that nobody on that side of the aisle is going to vote for  and vice versa, knowing they are going to go to the Senate and die or  knowing they are going to get to the White House and not be signed or  knowing they are not going to have 60 votes in the Senate.   When push comes to shove on the things that matter, when we come to a  spending bill, it is all the same. It ends up being effectively the  same. It is the only explanation for being $32 trillion in debt.   Now, by virtue of the bipartisan effort of this body, the bipartisan  effort of the Senate, the signature of the President, we now know we  will be roughly $36 trillion in debt in January of 2025.   We know this, and we did it. We embraced it, but we didn't materially  change the trajectory. Yeah, we dented it a tiny fraction.   We had a spending freeze for 2 years that is a part of a deal that  isn't even yet consummated because we haven't done the appropriations  process.   We patted ourselves on the back--some of us did--for oh, well, we had  to get this done because we might default.   Every time we talk about this effort, it is that we must raise the  debt ceiling, or we are going to get to a place where we are going to  default on the debt.   The fact is, it is just simply not true. We were never going to  default on the debt. The President of the United States was never going  to choose in terms of the prioritization of payments to end up in a  place where we were not going to make the payments on the interest on  the bonds. That is just a fact.                                time  2130    We play this game. To raise the debt ceiling and increase the  borrowing level, we say, wait, maybe we should get some changes for  that.   We get up to the date, and what happens? People say we are going to  default. All of Wall Street calls all the folks and say, well, you are  going to do that, aren't you? Everybody hops, both sides of the aisle.   Here we sit, yet again, going from $32 trillion to now, predictably,  $36 trillion in January 2025. As sure as the Sun coming up, the House  of Representatives, the Senate, and the President just agreed to  mortgage your children's future again because that is what we do. That  is what the House of Representatives does.   The point here is, as I said, we were never going to default on our  debt. What we are going to do with almost the same amount of certainty  as what I just described is default on the American Dream. That is  where we are headed, a full-scale, unequivocal default on the American  Dream.   This is all led by the people who are supposed to be representing the  American people in this great Republic but who are barreling us right  down the path, if we are not there already, to default on the American  Dream.   The hardworking American family right now, today, is sitting out  there in this country unable to afford groceries, unable to afford gas,  unable to afford housing, and unable to afford healthcare.   I talked to staffers in this building in their twenties, and they  looked at me and asked: How am I ever going to afford to buy a house?   They genuinely mean it. They don't know.   The hardworking plumber in the district I represent in central Texas  who never took out a student loan is now being forced to pay for his  neighbor's master's degree.   The veteran is paying for some liberal arts major to get the same  student loan benefits he earned by risking his life for America.   The nurse wants to save lives without a Federal bureaucrat telling  her she needs to take a needle in her arm to keep her job.   The blue-collar workers are watching their way of life sacrificed to  the climate cult and billions of corporate crony tax subsidies in the  so-called Inflation Reduction Act, enriching elite, wealthy investors-- true--and corporations--true--all while empowering the Chinese  Communist Party, weakening our own grid, and undermining our own  national security--all true.   The rancher right now in Texas who is putting diesel in his truck is  forced to subsidize a tech worker making six figures to buy a Tesla  hundreds of miles away. This body just encouraged it.   Minority and poor taxpayers are trying to make ends meet but have  expanded IRS audits, three to five times more than other Americans.   The fact is, we are on the verge of defaulting on the American Dream.   It is not enough to play politics and just pass something and then  try to point the finger at the other party. Well, we just got this, and  it is better. That ain't working. It is simply not working.   We had a rather raucous meeting in our Republican Conference this  morning. I make it a practice not to talk  [[Page H2880]]  about what we do in private meetings. Some of my colleagues do not  adhere to that same standard or rule. It tends to leak like a sieve. A  lot of the conversations we had in that private meeting are not fully  private now.   To my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, but particularly my  colleagues on this side of the aisle, my Republican colleagues, let me  be very clear: I will be happy to engage personally anytime, anywhere,  on any of these issues. We can have disagreements, and we can  reasonably disagree. I am going to say emphatically right here in front  of God, in front of all the people I represent in this hallowed  Chamber, I don't give a rat's rear end what you think compared to what  my constituents think. I don't.   My job is to care what my constituents think. My job is to care about  people on the airplane or down the street who pull me aside every day  and thank me and thank a few of my colleagues for daring to stand up  against the uniparty and an institution that is trampling their way of  life. I will stand with them.   I will stand with the American people sick of having the American  Dream pulled out from under them. I will stand with them.   I will be happy to work with my colleagues. I love and respect many  of my colleagues. I do not answer to my colleagues. I answer to the  people I represent, and I am going to darn well stand up and defend  them.   I am going to fight to stop spending money we don't have. I am going  to fight to secure the border of the United States. I am going to fight  for all the people I just described who are losing their ability to  afford a home, afford groceries, to be able to carry out  their livelihood, their job, without being forced to take a needle.    I am going to fight for the guy trying to put diesel in his truck and  not have to subsidize a Tesla. I am going to fight for people to have a  stable grid. I am going to fight for the national security of this  country. I am going to fight to stop China from encroaching on this  country.   I am not going to give lip service for ads to go win political  campaigns when you did nothing. I am not going to do that. I am not  going to try to sell the American people on something that didn't  occur.   That is what we do in this body all the time. It is time that stops.  We have a duty--yes, a bipartisan duty.   If any one of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle would  actually like to join the party of standing up for the American people  and standing up in defense of this country instead of a radical leftist  ideology that results in a pride flag being hung at the same level as  the United States flag on the front of the White House and people  parading around topless in front of the White House, the people's house  for their President--have we no respect? Does the flag of the United  States mean nothing?   It is the flag of the United States. Men and women have died for that  flag, and they put that flag up to the side, flanking a pride flag on  the front of the United States President's house. It is despicable.  They did that right on the eve of Flag Day.   Tomorrow is Flag Day. The flag of the United States stands for  something so much bigger than any of these people running around  pretending like they are standing up for, oh, we can't have established  religion, and we are for the separation of church and state. Yet, their  religion is represented by that pride flag on the front of the White  House. It is a religion, just like the cult of climate fetishism is a  religion every bit as much as any religion.   How many lives have been lost with that flag on a patch on the arm of  one of our men and women who have fought for this country, and that is  what they do? I am at a loss for words. I really am.                                time  2140    Mr. Speaker, I am going to read one thing here, and then I am going  to yield to my friend from Pennsylvania. It is going to take me a  couple of minutes.   One of my favorite songs is ``The Ragged Old Flag'' by Johnny Cash. I  will not do this nearly as cool as Johnny Cash does.   It goes like this:       I walked through a county courthouse square.      On a park bench, an old man was sitting there.      I said, ``Your old courthouse is kinda rundown.''      He said, ``Naw, it'll do for our little town.''      I said, ``Your old flagpole has leaned a little bit,      and that's a Ragged Old Flag you got hanging on it.''      He said, ``Have a seat,'' and I sat down.      ``Is this the first time you've been to our little town?''      I said, ``I think it is.''      He said, ``I don't like to brag, but we're kinda proud of      that Ragged Old Flag.''      ``You see, we got a little hole in that flag there      when Washington took it across the Delaware.      And it got powder-burned the night Francis Scott Key sat      watching it writing `Oh, Say Can You See.'      And it got a rip in New Orleans with Packingham and      Jackson tuggin' at its seams.''      ``And it almost fell at the Alamo beside the Texas flag,      but she waved on through.      She got cut with a sword at Chancellorsville      and she got cut again at Shiloh Hill.      There was Robert E. Lee, Beauregard and Bragg,      and the south wind blew hard on that Ragged Old Flag.''      ``On Flanders Field in World War I      she got a big hole from a Bertha gun.      She turned blood red in World War II.      She hung limp and low by the time it was through.      She was in Korea and Vietnam.      she went where she was sent by her Uncle Sam.''      ``She waved from our ships upon the briny foam,      and now they've about quit waving her back here at home.      In her own good land here she's been abused--she's been             burned,      dishonored, denied and refused.''      ``And the government for which she stands is scandalized      throughout the land.      And she's getting threadbare and wearing thin,      but she's in good shape, for the shape she's in.      `Cause she's been through the fire before      and I believe she can take a whole lot more.''      ``So we raise her up every morning      take her down every night.      We don't let her touch the ground and we fold her up right.      On second thought, I do like to brag,      'cause I'm mighty proud of that Ragged Old Flag.''    On tomorrow, Flag Day, I hope we will honor the American flag. I know  that my friend from Pennsylvania is proud to be a Member of Congress,  but certainly I would think more proud to have worn the uniform of the  United States military and devote his life in service to his country.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Perry).    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Pennsylvania.   Again, I want to reiterate on this eve of Flag Day my appreciation  for his service to this country wearing the uniform and in Congress. He  understands what citizenship means.   I am deeply appreciative of him for that. I am deeply appreciative of  his friendship. I am deeply appreciative of the friendships I have here  in this Congress, my colleagues whom I am proud to serve with across  the spectrum, but particularly those colleagues who are willing to  stand in the fire when it is needed.   We don't have much time left, Mr. Speaker. I don't say that lightly.  You cannot look at this country with objective and clear eyes and  believe that we are on the right path. We are not. We are so far off  the right path that it is going to take a massive course correction and  trajectory change to save this great Republic for our kids and  grandkids.   That is not hyperbole. Our children and our grandchildren are on the  precipice inheriting now--booked, as I said before--$36 trillion of  debt guaranteed, give or take a few billion, in January of 2025.   I am just going to be honest. To be lectured by some of my colleagues  this morning, to be lectured about my motivations for why I am here on  the floor of the House and standing up and speaking right now and for  it to be alleged that it is for clicks or for money, the only thing  that would have made it more ironic is if that meeting had occurred in  the NRCC.   The fact is it is our job right now to stand up and defend the  country and not wait for some time in the future.   I don't want to hear another thing about, Well, we will do it when.  We will do it when we have the Senate. We will do it when we have 60 in  the Senate. We will do it when we have a bigger majority. We will do it  when we have someone in the White House.   Why don't we do it right now? Right now?   Let's have these debates. Let's have these fights out on the floor of  the House right now, because I can promise you, the debt deal that we  just passed ain't going to get the job done. It is not, and everybody  here knows it.                                time  2150    Yet, they are going to go out and sell it as if it is something that  it isn't; thinks, well, that is water under the bridge. Well, that is a  hell of a lot of water under the bridge. There is $4 trillion worth of  water under that bridge.   Now we have got to go to work to pass appropriations bills. Will  those appropriations bills turn the trajectory of this country away  from the iceberg? That is my question for my colleagues.   We should appropriate to the FY22 levels that we have been talking  about since last December, that we told the American people we were  going to do.   We should appropriate the Federal bureaucracy back to pre-COVID  levels because nobody in America thinks we should continue to spend at  post-COVID levels. I am going to stand on that. I am going to keep  fighting for that. I believe the American people want us to do that. I  believe they want the bureaucracy to be shrunk. I believe they want  their country back. I believe they want their lives back. I believe  they don't want any more bureaucrats interfering with their freedoms,  and I think we should stand united, yes, united in defense of the  American people in fighting for their freedom. That is what I believe  we should do.   Does my friend from Pennsylvania have anything else he wishes to add?    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Pennsylvania. I am going  to close with this: An opinion in the United States District Court for  the Northern District of Texas, Fort Worth Division.   ``Defendants, illegal aliens, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to  transport and harbor illegal aliens. The sentencing information shows  that on behalf of the Juarez cartel, defendants participated in an  alien smuggling conspiracy. Their participation included operating an  illegal alien stash house in Fort Worth, Texas, and transporting those  who had been smuggled into the United States to their desired  destination upon full payment. The smuggling organization charged  $10,000 to smuggle an adult illegal alien into the United States and  between $12,000-$14,000 to smuggle a child illegal alien.''   I am going to stop there. More money to smuggle a child illegal  alien.   ``Law enforcement discovered the Fort Worth portion of this smuggling  operation after a man in Baltimore, Maryland (the husband) paid the  organization to have his wife and 2-year-old daughter smuggled into the  United States after they arrived in Mexico from Honduras. The husband  contends that he paid the smuggling organization $1,000 to smuggle his  wife and child into the United States. They were then transported to  the stash house in Fort Worth, where the husband contends a member of  the smuggling organization demanded he pay an additional $23,000 before  his family would be released. The member also told the husband, `they  would do things to his daughter he [would] not like' if he did not make  the payment.''  [[Page H2882]]    It goes on to describe the absurdities of cartels in active  engagement in this Republic, in this country, and we are doing nothing  about it. The judge closes out: ``The guidelines--the sentencing  guidelines--do not adequately take into account these facts when  recommending an appropriate prison range. The current prison guideline  calculation of 51-63 months fails to meet the requirement that any  sentence provide adequate deterrence and just punishment. Accordingly,  the parties are provided notice that the court intends to vary upward  from the applicable guideline range so that they may address this at  the time of sentencing.''   My point is, a Federal judge is having to step in to do the work that  we are supposed to do here, to stand up and defend this country, not  just for ourselves, but for the people being abused in our name. These  are human beings.   Texans are getting absolutely ravaged in south Texas, ranches getting  overrun, people dying from fentanyl, and here, migrants getting abused  in the false name of compassion. Literally, thousands of dollars to  have to pay to get out from a stash house.   As we head into Flag Day tomorrow, and we think about what that flag  represents for people around the world seeking to come here, is that  what it is?   Is it to be in a stash house where a little girl is being threatened?   Why won't we do anything about it?   Why should we appropriate money to a Department of Homeland Security  that refuses to secure the homeland?   We have a job. We have a job to represent the people of the United  States and to actually do what we are supposed to do to defend the  United States and ensure that we have a sovereign nation. We should  think about that tomorrow as we head into Flag Day.   While the White House flouts the United States flag, we should honor  it. We should honor it right here, and we should honor it, remembering  that the flag consists of 13 horizontal stripes, 7 red alternating with  6 white. We know that the stripes represent the original 13 Colonies;  the stars, the 50 States of the Union.    A lot of people don't know, though, that the colors of the flag are  symbolic as well. Red symbolizes hardiness and valor, white symbolizes  purity and innocence, and blue represents vigilance, perseverance, and  justice.   Are we going to stand up for those tomorrow?   Are we going to stand up those for the rest of this Congress or are  we going to continue to punt for some future date when everything  magically works out politically so that you can finally stand up and do  what you know is right today?   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 9 o'clock and 57 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Wednesday, June 14, 2023, at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
