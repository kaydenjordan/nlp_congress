 Mr. Speaker, the American people have one thing on their  minds, and that is inflation. So let's talk about it.   Inflation is caused by a rapid increase in the money supply, the kind  of increase that only follows a drastic rise in government spending.  Since Inauguration Day, Biden and the Democrats have passed nearly $4  trillion in new spending.   For reference, that is almost all the money we brought in last year,  and we had record revenues. It is all out the door before we even fund  the government. But that is not all. Through his executive orders,  Biden has singlehandedly spent another $1.5 trillion.   This reckless spending has set off an economic crisis the likes of  which we have never seen. The average American family will spend an  extra $8,000 this year just to keep pace with rising prices. For most  Georgians, that is almost 2 months' pay.   The current majority has dug us deeper and deeper into debt. It is  time to stop digging.   Republicans will put an end to this recklessness and restore fiscal  sanity to the people's House.                            ____________________
