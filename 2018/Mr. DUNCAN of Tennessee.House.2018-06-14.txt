 Mr. Speaker, I know that one of the easiest  things in this world to do is to spend other people's money; and for at  least 50 years or more, we have been reading and hearing about  unbelievable waste by the Pentagon and excessive charges by defense  contractors who hire so many retired admirals and generals.   But in today's American Conservative magazine, there is an article  about Air Force spending that really takes the cake. The article is  entitled: ``Why Do Air Force Planes Need $10,000 Toilet Seat Covers?''  The story is by Dan Grazier, a former Marine captain. He wrote the  following:   ``. . . a Department of Defense contractor told the Air Force that  each new toilet seat cover for the C-17 cargo plane will cost $10,000.  Will Roper, the Air Force's Chief Acquisition official, rather than  pooh-poohing the cost, defended it by claiming the company would have  to switch production from other products to make a limited number of  toilet covers, thus driving up the expense.''   It is unpatriotic, Mr. Speaker, for any Federal department, but  especially the Defense Department, to spend taxpayers' money so  recklessly. I wish someday--someday--we could get a fiscal conservative  in charge at the Pentagon.                            ____________________
