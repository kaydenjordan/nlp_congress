 Madam President, I have the privilege of being with my  fellow Senator, Tom Cotton, as we rise today to honor two Arkansans who  gave their lives in service to others recently.   Arkansas Department of Corrections Officer Sergeant Joshua Caudell  was a member of the department's K-9 team who responded to a call to  assist his fellow law enforcement officers with a disturbance call.   During the course of searching for a suspect, Sergeant Caudell was  shot and later died from his injuries. Born in Little Rock and raised  in Redfield and White Hall, Sergeant Caudell was a White Hall High  School graduate of the class of 2011.   Service was something that defined his life. In high school, he  participated in the school's ROTC program. He then went on to serve in  the Army National Guard and is a 10-year veteran of the Arkansas  Department of Corrections with a variety of units.   He also served his family with deep care and devotion. As a loving  husband and father, Sergeant Caudell put his wife and children above  all else. They shared a special bond and never left any doubt about how  much they meant to each other.   His friends describe Sergeant Caudell as a kind, generous person who  was a real-life hero. He loved to fish and grill, cheer on his  daughter's softball team, ride horses with his fellow Department of  Corrections field officers, and support the Arkansas Razorbacks.   His sacrifice in the name of protecting the community and enforcing  the rule of law will never be forgotten.   We are so grateful for his example and willingness to do the tough  and dangerous job of ensuring public safety.                             Honoring Jason Lang    Madam President, sadly, the Natural State lost another first  responder in  [[Page S1032]]  the last few days, West Memphis firefighter Jason Lang.   Lang was traveling to another city for an EMT training class when he  stopped to provide assistance to others involved in a traffic accident.  He was struck by an 18-wheeler while rendering aid.   Originally from Iowa, Jason Lang was an Eagle Scout and a volunteer  firefighter who was just starting his adult life. We were fortunate  that his path brought him to Arkansas, where he was eager to begin  serving the West Memphis community.   Lang was an enthusiastic and promising young man who, on day one,  wanted to be an integral part of the important work that first  responders do to help support those in need. He learned that example  from his own family, with a father who served as a police officer for  decades and a brother who is a volunteer firefighter.   He may have only been with the West Memphis Fire Department for a few  months, but his chief recalled viewing him as a future leader in the  organization from the first time that they met. His heroic and selfless  actions will be admired and appreciated for years to come.   Those who perform such acts do so without regard for their own  safety, which is the hallmark of public service. So today, we remember  both Sergeant Joshua Caudell and firefighter Jason Lang for what they  gave to their respective communities: themselves, totally and  unflinchingly.   We regret that their actions were necessary, but we will be forever  grateful that these two men did not hesitate to put their own safety  aside in the name of protecting and helping others.   I join with Senator Cotton and so many others to share our gratitude  and admiration for these heroes, as well as our sorrow that they paid  the ultimate price in the line of duty.   We pray for their loved ones and colleagues as they mourn these  fallen guardians who served others to the very end.
