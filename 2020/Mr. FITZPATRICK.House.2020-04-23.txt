 Madam Speaker, we are here today to replenish the  Paycheck Protection Program, and that is a good thing.   We should have been here last week when the program ran out of money,  and we will be back in the same position next week if we don't fix the  PPP.   There are over 700,000 applications currently in the queue, and if  the Treasury Department does not establish guardrails to differentiate  between well-capitalized brokerage firms and undercapitalized mom-and- pop shops, we will not be helping the people who need us the most right  now.   We need to get these small businesses and nonprofits every single  penny they need to survive, and we must hold China accountable for  every single penny.   Madam Speaker, this is not the time to be attacking each other. We  must get through this crisis together. We must have each other's back.  Let's have each other's back. Let's think with our hearts and our  heads, and let's march through this together.
