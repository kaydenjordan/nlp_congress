 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 672) to require continued and enhanced annual  reporting to Congress in the Annual Report on International Religious  Freedom on anti-Semitic incidents in Europe, the safety and security of  European Jewish communities, and the efforts of the United States to  partner with European governments, the European Union, and civil  society groups, to combat anti-Semitism, and for other purposes, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 672         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Combating European Anti-      Semitism Act of 2017''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) During the past decade, there has been a steady       increase in anti-Semitic incidents in Europe, resulting in       European Jews being the targets of physical and verbal       harassment and even lethal terrorist attacks, all of which       has eroded personal and communal security and the quality of       daily Jewish life.        (2) According to reporting by the European Union Agency for       Fundamental Rights (FRA), between 2005 and 2014, anti-Semitic       incidents increased in France from 508 to 851; in Germany       from 60 to 173; in Belgium from 58 to 130; in Italy from 49       to 86; and in the United Kingdom from 459 to 1,168.        (3) Anti-Zionism has at times devolved into anti-Semitic       attacks, prompting condemnation from many European leaders,       including French Prime Minister Manuel Valls, British Prime       Minister David Cameron, and German Chancellor Angela Merkel.        (4) Since 2010, the Department of State has adhered to the       working definition of Anti-Semitism by the European       Monitoring Center on Racism and Xenophobia (EUMC). Some       contemporary examples of anti-Semitism include the following:        (A) Calling for, aiding, or justifying the killing or       harming of Jews (often in the name of a radical ideology or       an extremist view of religion).        (B) Making mendacious, dehumanizing, demonizing, or       stereotypical allegations about Jews as such, or the power of       Jews as a collective, especially, but not exclusively, the       myth about a world Jewish conspiracy or of Jews controlling       the media, economy, government, or other societal       institutions.        (C) Accusing Jews as a people of being responsible for real       or imagined wrongdoing committed by a single Jewish person or       group, the State of Israel, or even for acts committed by       non-Jews.        (D) Accusing the Jews as a people, or Israel as a state, of       inventing or exaggerating the Holocaust.        (E) Accusing Jewish citizens of being more loyal to Israel,       or to the alleged priorities of Jews worldwide, than to the       interest of their own countries.        (5) On October 16, 2004, the President signed into law the       Global Anti-Semitism Review Act of 2004. This law provides       the legal foundation for a reporting requirement provided by       the Department of State annually on anti-Semitism around the       world.        (6) In November 2015, the House of Representatives passed       H. Res. 354 by a vote of 418-0, urging the Secretary of State       to continue robust United States reporting on anti-Semitism       by the Department of State and the Special Envoy to Combat       and Monitor Anti-Semitism.        (7) In 2016, the International Holocaust Remembrance       Alliance (IHRA), comprised of 31 member countries, adopted a       working definition of anti-Semitism which stated: ``Anti-      Semitism is a certain perception of Jews, which may be       expressed as hatred toward Jews. Rhetorical and physical       manifestations of anti-Semitism are directed toward Jewish or       non-Jewish individuals and/or their property, toward Jewish       community institutions and religious facilities.''.        (8) The IHRA further clarified that manifestations of anti-      Semitism might also target the State of Israel, conceived of       as a Jewish collectivity. Anti-Semitism frequently charges       Jews with conspiring to harm humanity, and it is often used       to blame Jews for ``why things go wrong''. It is expressed in       speech, writing, visual forms, and action, and employs       sinister stereotypes and negative character traits.       SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.         It is the sense of Congress that--  [[Page H4276]]         (1) it is in the national interest of the United States to       combat anti-Semitism at home and abroad;        (2) anti-Semitism is a challenge to the basic principles of       tolerance, pluralism, and democracy, and the shared values       that bind Americans and Europeans together;        (3) there is an urgent need to ensure the safety and       security of European Jewish communities, including       synagogues, schools, cemeteries, and other institutions;        (4) the United States should continue to emphasize the       importance of combating anti-Semitism in multilateral bodies,       including the United Nations, European Union institutions,       and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe;        (5) the Department of State should continue to thoroughly       document acts of anti-Semitism and anti-Semitic incitement       that occur around the world, and should continue to encourage       other countries to do the same, and share their findings; and        (6) the Department of State should continue to work to       encourage adoption by national government institutions and       multilateral institutions of a working definition of anti-      Semitism similar to the one adopted in the International       Holocaust Remembrance Alliance context.       SEC. 4. ANNUAL REPORTING ON THE STATE OF ANTI-SEMITISM IN                     EUROPE.         Paragraph (1) of section 102(b) of the International       Religious Freedom Act of 1998 (22 U.S.C. 6412) is amended by       adding at the end the following new subparagraph:        ``(G) Anti-semitism in europe.--In addition to the       information required under clause (vii) of subparagraph (A),       with respect to each European country in which verbal or       physical threats or attacks are particularly significant       against Jewish persons, places of worship, schools,       cemeteries, and other religious institutions, a description       of--        ``(i) the security challenges and needs of European Jewish       communities and European law enforcement agencies in such       countries to better protect such communities;        ``(ii) to the extent practicable, the efforts of the United       States Government over the reporting period to partner with       European law enforcement agencies and civil society groups       regarding the sharing of information and best practices to       combat anti-Semitic incidents in Europe;        ``(iii) European educational programming and public       awareness initiatives that aim to collaborate on educational       curricula and campaigns that impart shared values of       pluralism and tolerance, and showcase the positive       contributions of Jews in culture, scholarship, science, and       art, with special attention to those segments of the       population that exhibit a high degree of anti-Semitic animus;       and        ``(iv) efforts by European governments to adopt and apply a       working definition of anti-Semitism.''.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  California (Mr. Royce) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Engel) each  will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.                                General Leave     I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include any extraneous material in the Record.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from California?   There was no objection.    I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include any extraneous material in the Record.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from California?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to begin by thanking my colleagues Nita  Lowey and Chairman Emeritus Ileana Ros-Lehtinen for their leadership on  the Bipartisan Task Force for Combating Anti-Semitism and for their  good work on this timely and important bill.   Mr. Speaker, I will lay out this case, but it is one we are familiar  with. Hostility towards the Jewish people in some European cities is  very deep, making Jews in certain areas look over their shoulders,  afraid to walk the streets at night. In recent years, this surge in  anti-Semitism has led to an outbreak of violent attacks.   Those violent attacks are targeting certain Jewish neighbors. They  are targeting places of worship. I think back to 2015, the deadly  attacks on the kosher supermarket in Paris and, later on, the synagogue  in Copenhagen.   European governments have since passed laws designed to better  protect their Jewish citizens, designed to punish those who perpetrate  anti-Semitic incidents, but much more work remains to be done because  there needs to be a better coordination on these efforts between Jewish  communities and law enforcement and more comprehensive reporting on the  incidents to identify trends, to identify problematic regions.   In addition, in order to consistently apply anti-Semitism laws  throughout Europe, there needs to be a uniform legal understanding of  what constitutes anti-Semitism.   Let me explain. We must be clear on this. The fire bombing of  synagogues is not a political protest. The defacing of cemeteries, the  yelling slurs at rabbis, the threatening of Jewish school children,  this is not political protest. This is anti-Semitism, and it must be  stopped.   Absent a clear-eyed definition of anti-Semitism, perpetrators of  violent acts have, at times, been given a pass for their actions due to  the flimsy defense of political protest.   Adoption across Europe of a single definition of anti-Semitism would  provide an important foundation for law enforcement officials, enabling  them to better enforce laws and develop strategies for improved  security for the Jewish community.   This bill, H.R. 672, the Combating European Anti-Semitism Act of  2017, calls for these fundamental improvements, and it reaffirms the  U.S. commitment to combating anti-Semitism. It urges European nations  to adopt a working definition of anti-Semitism. It calls for increased  reporting on it.   Anti-Semitic incidents in Europe have to be reported in a way in  which people can be held accountable. Collaborative efforts between  U.S. and European law enforcement and the efforts to improve security  for Jewish communities is another important aspect of this legislation.   Now is the time to act and pass this important measure.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Poe), chairman of the Foreign Affairs'  Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen), who chairs the Foreign  Affairs Subcommittee on the Middle East and North Africa and is our  chairman emeritus.   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the chairman and the  ranking member for working to help bring this important bill to the  floor in a timely manner and, more importantly, for conducting the  affairs of our full committee in an even-tempered, professional manner  that is an example to the rest of the House. It is an honor to serve  under their leadership.   I also want to thank my good friend Nita Lowey because she is the  author of this bill, but I want to thank her for her leadership in  fighting anti-Semitism across the world. She has been at this fight for  many a year. We have worked closely together on defeating this hatred,  one of the world's oldest forms of discrimination. I am proud to be an  original cosponsor of her bill, and I thank the gentlewoman from New  York.   Mr. Speaker, this bill is an important initiative for our Bipartisan  Taskforce for Combating Anti-Semitism, a task force of which I am proud  to be a cofounder and a co-chair along with Mrs. Lowey, Mr. Engel, of  course Chris Smith, Ted Deutch, Kay Granger, Peter Roskam, Marc Veasey,  so many good Members. But more than that, Mr. Speaker, it is an  important initiative for the Jewish communities across Europe who have  been facing a troubling increase in anti-Semitic incidents and attacks  over the past years that have put their safety and their security at  risk.   Mr. Speaker, all across Europe, Jews have been targeted. Their places  of worship have been targeted, their homes, targeted; their businesses,  targeted. Why? Because of their faith.   They have been the target of deadly attacks in European cities,  democratic societies that we call allies: France, Belgium, Denmark,  elsewhere--horrific. This is simply unconscionable, Mr. Speaker.   There is no time to delay in taking action. We cannot allow for an  atmosphere of intolerance and hatred to once again rear its ugly head  in Europe. That is why this bill is an important first step.   We have identified growing anti-Semitism as a problem before, but  this bill will enhance reporting requirements so that we can more  acutely identify the problems and, equally important, Mr. Speaker, we  can identify the security challenges facing these Jewish communities.  Then we can learn how to best tackle this, and we can learn how we can  partner with our European allies and our friends and local law  enforcement, along with civil society, to protect against anti-Semitic  acts. We can get a better understanding of how our partners in Europe  can better educate their children. We can get a handle on how to better  promote awareness in their societies to the dangers of such blind  hatred.   In closing, Mr. Speaker, I want to say that the first step in  fighting anti-Semitism is identifying the problem areas and then  developing a plan to address it. This bill will help us identify the  problem. It is an important first step in taking the necessary action  to protect the Jewish communities of Europe. I urge my colleagues to  support this important bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   First, let me say that the words just spoken by Ranking Member Eliot  Engel are precisely the sentiment that I think we all wish to convey.  We must do all we can to combat anti-Semitism in all of its insidious  forms, and we do it because the consequences, the horrifying  consequences of doing nothing in the face of such evil, are  unconscionable. We must not repeat the mistakes of the past by  remaining silent, as this same poison affects our communities today.   Passage of this bill sends a clear signal that anti-Semitism has no  place in free societies and urges our European partners to provide  practical guidance that will empower law enforcement and better equip  them to tackle this rising problem, and it sends the message that our  own law enforcement is willing to work hand in hand with theirs in  order to tackle this problem.   I appreciate the work of Congresswoman Lowey and Congresswoman Ros- Lehtinen and, of course, Mr. Engel, the ranking member. I urge my  colleagues to join me in support of this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R.  672, the Combating Anti-Semitism Act of 2017, sponsored by my friend  Nita Lowey. I and all of our fellow Co-Chairs of the Bi-Partisan Task  Force for Combating Anti-Semitism are original cosponsors.   Among its provisions, the bill would require the State Department to  include in existing annual reports information about the security  challenges and needs of European Jewish communities and European law  enforcement. This report would also document related U.S. government  efforts to partner with European law enforcement agencies and civil  society groups.   H.R. 672 is important and timely. As witnesses testified at a hearing  I chaired in March on ``Anti-Semitism Across Borders,'' physical  attacks on European Jewish communities, and other forms of anti-Semitic  hatred, remain rampant on the continent. Rabbi Andy Baker, Personal  Representative of the OSCE Chairperson-in-Office on Combating Anti- Semitism and Director of International Jewish Affairs at the American  Jewish Committee noted that even after the deadly anti-Semitic attacks  in Paris, Brussels and Copenhagen, ``problems still remain. Governments  have taken different approaches, and some only in stop-gap measures.''  Rabbi Baker also emphasized that ``We need to be clear-eyed in  confronting and combating anti-Semitism, which manifests itself on both  the right and the left.''   At the same hearing, Paul Goldenberg, Director of the Security  Community Network and Senior Advisor to the Rutgers University Faith- Based Communities Security Program, warned that ``Ever-more connected,  extremist groups in the United States are borrowing, adapting and  enhancing the tactics and strategies adopted in Europe.'' This is an  especially sobering warning, given the man recent anti-Semitic  incidents here in the United States.   Mark Weitzman, Director of Government Affairs for the Simon  Wiesenthal Center, emphasized that ``Fighting antisemitism has always  been a bipartisan commitment and in today's fractured political world  it is more necessary than ever that the U.S. maintain its diplomatic  and moral leadership in this issue. . . . we would strongly suggest  that the position [of Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Anti- Semitism] even be upgraded, to that of Ambassador, thus demonstrating  the importance attached by our government to this issue.''   H.R. 672 is an example of such bi-partisanship. It would ensure that  the Special Envoy, other U.S. officials, the Congress, and civil  society--especially European Jewish communities that their security  groups--have key information to act fully and effectively. With the  right information, and robust action, the United States can help ensure  the safety and security of Jewish communities in Europe and elsewhere.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from California (Mr. Royce) that the House suspend the rules  and pass the bill, H.R. 672, as amended.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  agree to the resolution (H. Res. 145) expressing the sense of the House  of Representatives regarding the fight against corruption in Central  America, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 145         Whereas according to Transparency International's 2016       Corruption Perception Index, the citizens of Honduras,       Guatemala, El Salvador, and Nicaragua perceive high levels of       government corruption;        Whereas widespread corruption in Central America weakens       citizens' faith in public institutions, limits government       capacity to advance development goals, and allows drug       traffickers and other criminals to thrive;        Whereas the International Commission against Impunity in       Guatemala (CICIG) was created at the request of the       Guatemalan Government in 2007, and has strengthened the       capacity of Guatemalan institutions, especially the Office of       the Attorney General, to combat corruption;        Whereas the Office of the Attorney General of Guatemala and       CICIG have recently collaborated to investigate and prosecute       a series of corruption cases involving high-level government       officials, demonstrating that it is possible for governments       in Central America to confront entrenched corruption, and       that no one is above the law;        Whereas the Attorney General of El Salvador has made       significant progress in tackling corruption at the highest       levels;        Whereas after thousands of Hondurans joined street protests       against corruption and in favor of an International       Commission against Impunity in Honduras, the Honduran       Government reached an agreement with the Organization of       American States to create the Mission to Support the Fight       against Corruption and Impunity in Honduras (MACCIH);        Whereas MACCIH has begun to assist the Office of the       Attorney General of Honduras with the investigation into the       more than $300,000,000 that was embezzled from the Institute       of Social Security; and        Whereas the leadership of CICIG and MACCIH and the       attorneys general of Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador       have faced significant challenges, including credible threats       against their lives, attempts to publicly discredit their       work, or efforts to remove them from their posts: Now,       therefore, be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) reaffirms that combating corruption in the Northern       Triangle is an important policy interest for the United       States;        (2) acknowledges that the International Commission against       Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG) and the Mission to Support the       Fight against Corruption and Impunity in Honduras (MACCIH)       are currently making important contributions to this effort;  [[Page H4279]]         (3) urges the Government of Guatemala to continue to       cooperate with CICIG and the Government of Honduras to       continue to cooperate with MACCIH; and        (4) encourages the Governments of Honduras, Guatemala, and       El Salvador to--        (A) publicly support efforts to fight corruption;        (B) respect the independence of the judicial branch and the       Office of the Attorney General; and        (C) ensure that the Office of the Attorney General in each       Northern Triangle country receives sufficient domestic budget       allocations to carry out its core responsibilities and that       budgeted funds are delivered in a timely manner.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  California (Mr. Royce) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Engel) each  will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and to include any extraneous materials in the Record.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from California?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and to include any extraneous materials in the Record.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from California?   There was no objection.    I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 145, which affirms this  body's support for the independent anticorruption commissions in  Central America that seek to combat corruption and combat impunity in  the countries of the Northern Triangle region.   I would like to commend the gentlewoman from California (Mrs.  Torres), a new member of the committee, for her work on this important  resolution. Of course, I appreciate Mr. Engel, the ranking member and  the former chairman of the Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere, for  his long-time focus on this critical region.   Mr. Speaker, in recent years, the U.S. has seen a surge in illegal  migration from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. Now, that is the  Northern Triangle of Central America.   Many of these migrants are fleeing violence. They are fleeing  criminality and institutionalized corruption. More than anything, the  citizens of these countries want governments that will work for them.   As a result of these governments, the international community has  responded. Governments in the region, including the United States, have  helped to establish the International Commission Against Impunity in  Guatemala--that is called CICIG--and the Mission to Support the Fight  against Corruption and Impunity in Honduras, known as MACCIH.   Both of these organizations are making important contributions to  tackling the culture of corruption and impunity in their respective  countries and are working to give the citizens of these countries  confidence in their own judiciary. These organizations have put  politicians and public servants on notice that nobody should be above  the law and that their citizenry demands transparency.   For example, this special body in Honduras has begun to assist the  Office of the Attorney General with the investigation into the more  than $300 million that was embezzled from the Institute of Social  Security and, in Guatemala, has trained the prosecutors that  successfully built high-profile corruption cases against multiple  government officials, including the former Guatemalan President,  President Molina.                                time  1645    Once again, I want to thank Representative Torres for bringing this  measure forward and for her efforts in working with the Northern  Triangle countries to urge greater respect for an independent judiciary  and to bring greater security and prosperity to the people of the  Northern Triangle countries.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen), who chairs the Foreign  Affairs Subcommittee on the Middle East and North Africa.   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for the time.   I applaud the work that both Chairman Royce and Ranking Member Engel  have done in helping to focus more of our foreign policy priority here  in our own Western Hemisphere.   I also applaud Congresswoman Norma Torres for authoring the measure  that we have before us today, H. Res. 145, reaffirming our dedication  to the fight against corruption in Central America. It is an important  measure, Mr. Speaker, and it is an important fight.   For years, I have been a strong advocate for this fight because,  where corruption is allowed to spread, drug trafficking and crime  inevitably thrive;  [[Page H4280]]  and this is negative for our neighbors, it is bad for us, and it is bad  for our interests. That is why it is vital that we make battling  corruption in the region more of a priority of our foreign policy.   In fact, earlier this year, I traveled to Honduras and Guatemala with  my good friend Albio Sires, and we saw firsthand how these governments  are attempting to tackle corruption in their countries. It is not easy,  Mr. Speaker. They are making progress and taking some of the tough  decisions necessary, but there is so much more to be done and so much  more that they need to do, but they need help from the United States.   That is what we heard when we hosted the attorneys general from the  Northern Triangle countries here in Washington, D.C., just last month  to discuss what they are doing to fight corruption and what assistance  they might need from us. That is why this resolution before us is so  important and so timely.   We must urge the governments of Central America to do more to battle  corruption, but we also must pledge to do more ourselves because they  cannot do it alone. Central American governments must take a stand and  voice their support for anticorruption programs. They must respect and  defend the authority of the judicial branch, and they must make it a  priority. That is not easy for them to do.    Some of these governments have shown a willingness to take these  steps, but, sadly, Mr. Speaker, not all of them have. While we urge  willing partners to take the steps necessary to fight corruption, we  must be willing to do more for those unwilling.   That is why I have reintroduced my NICA Act, which aims at tightening  the economic screws on the Ortega regime until we see some drastic  reforms, including efforts to end corruption. It is our duty to support  our neighbors so that our partners to the south can live in far more  open, free, and democratic societies.   It is also in the benefit of our security and it is in the benefit of  our national interests to do so. That is why I urge my colleagues to  support H. Res. 145. I also urge my colleagues to support my NICA Act  and to take a more engaged role in our foreign policy interests in our  own Western Hemisphere.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Norma  Torres for authoring this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr.  Moolenaar), a member of the Committee on Appropriations.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Norma  Torres for authoring this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr.  Moolenaar), a member of the Committee on Appropriations.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the  gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Kinzinger), a member of the Committee on  Foreign Affairs and an Air Force pilot.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen), who chairs the Foreign  Affairs Subcommittee on the Middle East and North Africa.   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Royce again for  yielding the time.   Mr. Speaker, I stand in strong support of Ranking Member Eliot  Engel's Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act, H.R. 1677, of which I am  proud to be an original cosponsor, and I commend him and the chairman  for all of their hard work in authoring the bill and bringing it before  us today.   During our committee's hearing on Syria in April--and we have had so  many hearings--one of our witnesses made a point that I think bears  repeating, a point that highlights the importance of the ranking  member's bill before us today. As long as Assad remains in power, there  is very little chance that we will be able to defeat ISIS or its  offshoots because Assad, in many ways, has facilitated the growth of  the very jihadist groups for which he claims are protecting Syria.  Hogwash.   As we talk about how to stop the slaughter in Syria, we must remember  that no one bears more responsibility for that slaughter than Assad. He  and his regime are the ones dropping barrel bombs. They are the ones  unleashing chemical weapons on their own people. And if we want to have  any chance of stopping the bloodbath, of defeating ISIS, or of putting  an end to the immense humanitarian challenges spreading throughout the  region and beyond, we must put a stop to Assad.   This bill ratchets up the pressure on Assad and his collaborators,  especially his main allies--Russia and Iran--while expanding on the  Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act, a bill which I  authored and which became law in 2012. It gives the administration new  tools to go after individuals and entities working with Assad in the  finance, aircraft, transportation, telecom, and energy sectors, as well  as  [[Page H4290]]  it gives them the tools to target individuals complicit in human rights  abuses.   I am glad to have worked with the ranking member and our esteemed  chairman to include my amendments in this bill, amendments that would  determine that denying or hindering access to humanitarian aid is a  serious human rights violation, and, as such, it would allow the  administration to sanction any individual responsible for doing so.   All of these tools, Mr. Speaker, are vital components of doing  something that we still desperately need in Syria: a comprehensive,  holistic strategy that looks beyond short-term tactical successes and,  instead, targets the foundation of so many of the problems rippling  through the region.   If we continue to narrowly focus on ISIS without getting at the root  of the Syrian conflict--Assad, Russia, and Iran--then we will only be  treating the symptoms instead of the disease.                                time  1730    If we are to have any hope of finding a solution in Syria, the kind  of pressure that this bill would achieve is an essential piece of that  puzzle.   I offer my full support for this bill, and I urge my colleagues to do  the same.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Connolly) will control the time.   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.    Mr. Speaker, in closing, I would like to once again recognize the  work of Ranking Member Engel and the other committee members who have  contributed to this bill.   Our committee has heard the firsthand accounts of the suffering. We  heard the testimony from Raed Saleh of the Syrian White Helmets as he  spoke of their efforts to rescue and treat those who were killed and  injured in Assad's brutal air assaults. When the bombs come in, as they  often do, his organization, which was nominated for the Nobel Peace  Prize, runs toward those shelters being destroyed to provide relief for  the victims and to pull them out.   We have heard of the terror. More than a year ago, Dr. Mohamed  Tennari of the Syrian American Medical Society described for the  committee the sound of helicopters overhead, the thump of exploding  bombs, and the overpowering smell of bleach in the air. This brave  doctor described the horrendous effects this toxic gas has on the human  body and the slow, agonizing deaths as the chlorine gas turned to  hydrochloric acid in the lungs of victims.   Many of those victims he spoke of were children. They were targeted  by the regime. People were targeted as they slept in their beds in  their neighborhoods. Just a few weeks ago, one family lost 20 relatives  in a single sarin  [[Page H4291]]  gas attack. Of the 92 victims of that attack on that day, 23 were  children.   Mr. Speaker, in 2016, efforts to establish a lasting cease-fire  failed, resulting in an aggressive campaign by Syrian and Russian air  assets against eastern Aleppo. U.N. officials described that assault as  ``crimes of historic proportions.''   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support this legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1677 ``Caesar  Syria Civilian Protection Act of 2017.''   This bill, introduced by my colleague, Foreign Affairs Committee  Ranking Member Eliot Engel, uses sanctions to put pressure on the  Syrian government and anyone supporting it to stop committing war  crimes against humanity.   I support this legislation for its important and necessary purpose to  halt the wholesale slaughter of the Syrian people, encourage a  negotiated political settlement, and hold Syrian human rights abusers  accountable for their crimes.   The Syrian government, empowered with support from Iran and Russia,  has pursued a strategy of targeting civilians to eliminate any  opposition to its rule, including arresting anyone who opposes it.   The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights has reported the deaths of  60,000 people in prisons since the start of the conflict.   The Syrian government is the main aggressor in a conflict that has  resulted in at least 400,000 dead and 14 million Syrians displaced;  between 2011 and 2015, the Syrian Network for Human Rights attributed  96 percent of civilian deaths to the Syrian regime.   Additionally, President Bashar al-Assad has blocked United Nations  humanitarian aid from reaching the intended recipients.   Who is Caesar? Caesar, who uses the pseudonym to remain anonymous as  a way to protect his family, defected from the Syrian military in 2013.   He worked as a crime scene photographer for the Assad government  after joining the military, years before the current conflict began.   As the conflict escalated, so did the number of bodies he would  photograph each day.   Photographing the torture and rising death began to change his  attitude towards the regime and in 2013, with help from the opposition,  he faked his own death and defected from the Syrian military.   When he fled in August 2013, Caesar had collected over 53,000  photographs of detainees who had been tortured and killed.   He handed these photographs over to an anti-government political  group, the Syrian National Movement, who then distributed the  photographs to other groups, including Human Rights Watch (HRW).   With these photographs, HRW ``found evidence of widespread torture,  starvation, beatings, and disease in Syrian government detention  facilities.''   With the conflict in Syria in its fifth year, the U.S. House of  Representatives introduced a bill intended to punish the Assad regime  and its supporters and based it on both Caesar's photographs and his  testimony in front of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs this past  July.   The photographs and testimony show a clear connection between the  reported human rights violations and the Assad government, legitimizing  the bill and giving clear evidence to the international courts if  President Assad stands trial for international war crimes.   H.R. 1677 is intended to sanction both the Syrian regime and any  actors, what the bill refers to as a ``foreign person,'' who support  its human rights violations by imposing sanctions on them.   This support can be in any capacity, such as economic or military  support.   H.R. 1677 is important and necessary as the United States cannot sit  in silence while tens of thousands innocent civilians are slaughtered  by Assad's authoritative regime.   Assad's crimes are not only against humanity but also against  democracy, and I fully support legislation aiming to stop these  atrocities.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Hultgren). The question is on the motion  offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. Royce) that the House  suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1677, as amended.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________
