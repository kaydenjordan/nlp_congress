 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize  the first responders in Uvalde. It has been 22 days since the terrible  incident in Uvalde occurred, and many of the discussions have been  about the victims. I will talk about some of the survivors. Some of  those survivors are first responders.   In particular, one gentleman, Javier Martinez, is a lieutenant for  the Uvalde Police Department. He was one of the first people on the  scene. He engaged with the shooter. He was actually wounded. He goes in  there and he clears the room.   But afterwards he wasn't done. There are a lot of copycat threats,  and Javier Martinez, even though he was going through all that, went  down to the high school, and he secured the high school. The next day,  he was on duty. He put his uniform on, and he went to work the next day  and the next day.   There are many stories just like this. When the fire happened,  everyone ran to the incident, and they didn't stop. Some of the law  enforcement officers, Border Patrol agents, after they got done  clearing that room, they went to other elementary schools. There are  seven elementary schools in Uvalde. This happened days on.    I mention that because while the community of Uvalde, while my  district is healing, there are all these heroes that are walking among  us.   Another person I will mention is Ann. Ann is the director of the ER  there in Uvalde. She helped save lives.   There are so many people that have just helped. After the cameras are  gone, after everyone stops listening or even remembering what happened  in Uvalde, we will be there as one community coming together.   Over a year ago, my community asked me for a mental health hospital.  Last year, we secured $2 million for that. When I hosted the President  a couple weeks ago, we asked for $23 million on that. Mental health is  at the core of all of this. There is a mental health crisis not only in  Uvalde, but I would argue across the country. We have to make sure that  we are devoting the resources necessary to protect our children, to  protect ourselves.   My whole community of Uvalde, I would argue, needs mental health  assistance right now. A lot of us are getting that. My own staff,  essentially, we turned into a FEMA office, and we were dealing with all  these crises.   Someone reminded me yesterday that I essentially have relived this  crisis 22 days now. A lot of us are in that exact same boat. I mention  that to say, we have to get rid of this stigma behind mental health. We  have to realize all of us, from a young age to an old age, go through  things in life, and we need mental health professionals in order to get  through that.   Today, I thank all the first responders in Uvalde for everything they  are doing, the men and women, just like Javier Martinez, who put their  uniform on, go to work. There are heroes walking among us that  sometimes get forgotten. They are not forgotten today nor every other  day. God bless them.                            ____________________
