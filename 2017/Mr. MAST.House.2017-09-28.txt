 Mr. Speaker, I rise today especially pleased to have had my  personal pastor, Todd Mullins, give our opening prayer this morning to  the House of Representatives.   I am honored to welcome Pastor Mullins onto the floor of the House of  Representatives as our guest chaplain this morning, and I thank him for  sharing those very important words with our colleagues and that  scripture as well.   Todd Mullins is the senior pastor of Christ Fellowship in Palm Beach  Gardens, Florida, where he served since his father founded the church  in 1984.   I can say a great deal about my friend, Pastor Todd Mullins, but the  most important thing that I could say about him is that he is a man of  God, and that he works every single day to try to help and change  lives.   I think that is the most important thing any one of us can do. That  is why I am so proud to call him a friend. He is a person who has  devoted his life to working on the lives of others.                            ____________________
