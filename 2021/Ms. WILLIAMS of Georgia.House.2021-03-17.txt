 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the  Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act.   The Violence Against Women Act is a decades-old law that helps  protect some of my most vulnerable constituents from abuse.  Unfortunately, the law has been expired since 2018.   At a time when the pandemic has forced many women in unsafe domestic  situations to stay home, we owe them action. And I came to Congress to  get results.   Today, I'll be proud to vote to advance strong and bipartisan  legislation to reauthorize and update the Violence Against Women Act.   The bill is going to extend the protections the law has in place  while improving violence prevention and victim services. It will ensure  communities of color are well served by the law.   And what's more, the bill is forward-looking. It designs studies to  assess the challenges survivors face with things like achieving  economic security and paying off their student loans. Today, I'm  offering an amendment to make sure these studies consider how these  matters can have disparate impacts by race, ethnicity, sex, sexual  orientation, and gender identity.   I urge my colleagues to support my amendment and the bill before us  today.
