 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of  H.R. 3359, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Act of  2017, authored by my colleague, Homeland Security Committee Chairman  McCaul. I am an original cosponsor of this bill.   Mr. Speaker, America faces a new, emerging peril: threats to our  cyber systems and networks. This bill calls for the authorization of a  designated cybersecurity agency within DHS by retasking the National  Protection and Programs Directorate as the Cybersecurity and  Infrastructure Security Agency. This change will allow DHS to provide  specific focus on the ever-increasing cyber threats that face our  Nation. This bill will help to ensure that the United States can  respond to any attack against our Nation's cyber assets.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman McCaul for his work on crafting this  important piece of legislation, and I urge all my colleagues on both  sides of the aisle to support its passage.
