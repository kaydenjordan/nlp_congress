 Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the  passage of this year's omnibus spending bill and to express my  excitement  [[Page H3844]]  for the community project funding the Fourth Congressional District of  Illinois will receive.   These crucial funds, totaling over $10 million, will expand  affordable housing; improve access to healthcare; support violence  prevention and counseling; and even build an enclosure around a  community swimming pool, an absolute must-have in the windy city.   Working class, immigrant neighborhoods like mine have never gotten  the kind of investment and resources that other neighborhoods enjoy.   I started as an activist to change that, to bring resources to my  community, and I am proud to announce that this vital funding package  will transform countless lives.                            ____________________
