 Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Correa for yielding, and I  thank him for organizing this Special Order.   It is a part of immigration law--it is not a violation of immigration  law, it is a part of immigration law--that people fleeing for their  lives can come to the United States and apply for asylum. Not only is  that in our statutes, but it is also in a treaty that we ratified.  People concerned about the rule of law ought to realize this is part of  our law.   Here is what is happening. People fleeing for their lives, primarily  from Central America, are going to the ports of entry. In some cases,  we have received reports that they make their claim and their children  are taken away from them, I believe in violation of law.   In other cases, even though they are there to make an application,  they are turned away by Border Patrol. They then go down the road and  find a Border Patrol agent to turn themselves in to, to make their  claim for political asylum. And when that happens, their children are  then taken away from them.   Mr. Speaker, there is a report today from the Department of Health  and Human Services, which says that since this policy was adopted by  the Trump administration, 1,329 kids have been taken from their parents  in this cruel policy. I think that this is not the American way.  [[Page H5143]]    Mr. Speaker, I saw a report from CNN today. Here is what it says:  ``The undocumented immigrant from Honduras sobbed as she told an  attorney Tuesday how Federal authorities took her daughter while she  breastfed the child in a detention center . . . when the woman  resisted, she was handcuffed. . . .''   The Catholic church has spoken out again today from CNN, and this is  what Cardinal DiNardo said:         Families are the foundational element of our society and       they must be able to stay together. While protecting our       borders is important, we can and must do better as a       government, and as a society, to find other ways to ensure       that safety. Separating babies from their mothers is not the       answer and is immoral.    We are here today to say: America, we need to take a stand. The  President and his administration has decided to terrorize children in  an effort to deter people from availing themselves of the opportunity  provided for under immigration law. That is simply wrong.   America, now is the time to be heard.
