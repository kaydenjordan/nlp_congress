 Mr. President, the basic purpose and function of the U.S.  Constitution is to protect the American people from the dangerous  accumulation of power at the hands of the few. You see, that kind of  protection is necessary to make us free. In that respect, it is the  structure of our government, set forth in the Constitution, that truly  makes us free. It is the bulwark against what would rob us of our  freedom.   The Framers spent those hot summer days of 1787 in Philadelphia  principally debating the structure and role of the Federal Government.  Through the centuries of this great American experiment, it has been  the structure of our government, not simply the Bill of Rights or other  substantive provisions--it has been the structure that has been the  most effective protection from waves of oppression and the whims of  dictatorship.   Tragically, under the auspices of CRT, unrestrained progressivism,  and a false sense of national destiny, the modern left has embarked on  a campaign of sorts to condemn the Founders, to tarnish the  Constitution itself, and deface the structure and institutions that  protect our liberty. Progressives have been astoundingly, shockingly,  effective.   Unfortunately, this effort to seize power to enact a radical agenda,  no matter the cost, is not a new tactic of the Democratic Party.  President Franklin D. Roosevelt engaged in an institution-shaking  campaign to pressure the Supreme Court to consent to and accept with  constitutional infirmities his radical New Deal agenda.   He wanted to pack the Supreme Court by increasing the number of  Justices to appoint his own political loyalists who would then do his  bidding. His threats to the structural Constitution of the United  States led to the infamous ``switch in time that saved nine.''   Now, Roosevelt's plan to pack the Supreme Court failed as a  legislative matter. When it got to this body, when it reached the  Senate floor, it didn't go anywhere, but it left a lasting mark, and it  has not been a favorable one.   Legal scholars, historians, politicians, and people of every stripe  and political persuasion have since then condemned this. For example,  this Court-packing campaign has been called a ``bad idea'' just in the  last few years by the late Justice Ruth Bader-Ginsburg. It was likewise  called ``a bonehead idea'' by then-Senator Joe Biden. And yet today  many Democrats are returning to that rejected notion and, like a dog to  its vomit, going back to a bad idea that was bad then and remains bad  now.   The Supreme Court has consisted of nine Justices since 1869, over 150  years. It is a settled number that most Americans agree should stay.  Not one person has argued that we need to increase the number of  Justices because of a human resources problem or a workforce problem.  No, it is not that; it is rather that they want to influence the  outcome of decisions. They want to politicize the Court.   Tragically, the independence of the judiciary is thus being  threatened, and it is being threatened, I would add, on several fronts.  You have got misguided groups like Ruth Sent Us, along with others,  that have attempted to pressure conservative Justices by protesting at  those Justices' homes and places of worship.   When you show up to someone's home, the home of a public official,  especially if that person is a judge or Justice, it is unlawful; 18  U.S.C. section 1507 plainly prohibits that because you are trying to  influence them. You can't do that. It is unlawful. In fact, that is a  Federal felony, a serious one in fact.  [[Page S2563]]    It is a serious offense because when you show up at the home of a  public official like that, regardless of whatever else you might say or  what the signs you are carrying might have printed on them, the lasting  message, whether these words are spoken or not, is, ``We know where you  sleep.'' That is an implicit threat of physical violence.   On other fronts, you have got certain Members of Congress, including  some Members of this body, who are willing to place the Court's  independence at risk. You have got some Members of this body, including  the senior Senator from Massachusetts, who went out and screamed with  some of the same protesters in front of the Supreme Court and has  written an op-ed for a local paper stating her intent and her desire to  pack the Supreme Court, while pioneering the hashtag  ``ExpandTheCourt.'' I would venture that the Court is much more popular  nationally than is her agenda.   But popular acclaim and the support of the constitutional structure  of the United States is, of course, not the goal of the modern left.  Their goal is power. Fittingly enough, the ambition of individuals is  precisely what the Constitution is designed to restrain.   It is working as intended. James Madison wrote of the Constitution in  Federalist 51:         If men were angels, no government would be necessary. If       angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal       controls on government would be necessary. In framing a       government which is to be administered by men over men, the       great difficulty lies in this: you must first enable the       government to control the governed; and [then] in the next       place, oblige it to control itself.    I pray that my colleagues supporting this dangerous effort will  exercise the self-control of our constitutional form that our  constitutional form of government requires. We have all sworn an oath  to that, and that oath requires us to take into account the form and  the role that it plays in protecting our freedom.   The current efforts to undermine and delegitimize the Court are  multifaceted and have included the unprecedented treatment of  Republican-nominated nominees to the Court, including the public high- tech condemnation of Clarence Thomas and the similarly unfounded  attacks on Brett Kavanaugh, on Sam Alito, and on other Republican  nominees to the Court; Senator Schumer's very public attempt to  intimidate the Court by standing in front of the Supreme Court Building  during oral arguments in a Louisiana abortion case, June Medical,  shouting: ``I want to tell you Gorsuch, I want to tell you Kavanaugh,  you have released the whirlwind and you will pay the price. You won't  know what hit you if you go forward with these awful decisions.''    The Constitution is a structure. It is a process and an organization.  When Democrats threaten another branch of government for political  ends, they threaten that structure itself. It is dangerous. It is  wrong. And I pray for the sake of our Nation that it never succeeds.   To that end, every Member of this body should be condemning these  efforts and condemning the efforts of those described in the Axios  article that ran today explaining that the Department of Homeland  Security is now having to investigate serious credible threats of  people wanting to burn down the Supreme Court of the United States,  people wanting to assassinate Supreme Court Justices and law clerks.   We must all condemn them. And I hereby do so in the strongest terms I  am capable of communicating.
