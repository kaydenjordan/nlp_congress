 Madam Speaker, Americans nationwide have felt the  impact of this year's extreme weather, from flooding to wildfires to  record heat. In Washington State, heat domes in June and August of this  year have caused hundreds to die of heat exposure, roads and highways  to buckle, and shellfish to broil in their streams.   The iconic Mount Rainier, one of the snowiest places on Earth, was  not immune to this. The unprecedented heat, nearly 40 degrees above the  previous recorded high, has had a devastating impact on the mountain.  This image shows Mount Rainier during most of the summer, its sides  bare, compared to its typical snow cover.  [[Page H5510]]    For longtime residents of Washington State, it is jarring to see  Mount Rainier without snow on its peak. In just 4 days this summer, 4  days in late June, the peak of the heat dome, the mountain lost 30  percent of its total snow cover. This is a visual demonstration that  climate change is real.   The lack of snow became more notable as the summer progressed, and  this heat is an ecological issue and an economic issue. Washington  State's shellfish industry is among the largest in the Nation,  contributing $270 million to the State economy and supporting nearly  3,000 jobs.    The heat dome this summer devastated shellfish farms that make up the  core of this industry. Shellfish growers reported shellfish baking to  death, literally, in shallow water and on the beach. Taylor Shellfish,  located in my district, reported losing over 2 million clam seeds.   As our planet warms and climate change takes hold, these extreme  weather events are becoming more common, costing lives and critically  damaging our environment and our economy.   Against this backdrop, our need to pass transformational climate  change legislation becomes even more stark and more urgent. We must  invest in electric vehicle infrastructure. We must dramatically expand  public transit. We must build an energy grid using renewable sources of  power.   We have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to create tens of  thousands of jobs and build a sustainable society for future  generations. My district, my State, and our planet depend on it.                            ____________________
