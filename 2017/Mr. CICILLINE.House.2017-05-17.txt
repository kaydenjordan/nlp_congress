 Mr. Speaker, our Nation is in the middle of a public  health crisis. Drug overdoses are now killing more Americans each year  than car accidents. And 336 Rhode Islanders died last year as a result  of a drug overdose. That is up from 290 in 2015 and 238 deaths in 2014.   Nationwide, overdose deaths involving prescription and illicit  opioids have quadrupled since 1999. This is a crisis that threatens  Americans of all different backgrounds--young and old, Black and White,  urban and rural. It is a crisis, plain and simple.   All of us who serve the government have a responsibility to stop it.  That is why I was so alarmed earlier this month when I learned that  President Trump is considering slashing funding for the Office of  National Drug Control Policy by 95 percent. Slashing funding for the  lead Federal agency in this fight would have a devastating impact on  families in Rhode Island and all across our country.   Let's work together. Let's work across the aisle, Democrats and  Republicans, to defeat this short-sighted proposal and, instead,  advance real, comprehensive solutions to this public health epidemic.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2266, the  ``Bankruptcy Judgeship Act of 2017,'' which authorizes the  establishment of four additional permanent bankruptcy judgeships and  converts 14 temporary bankruptcy judgeships to permanent status.   I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of this legislation, which  is a necessary response to alleviate the strain on certain bankruptcy  courts that have experienced a significant increase in bankruptcy  filings over the past decade or more.   Importantly, this legislation adopts the recommendations of the  Judicial Conference of the United States, the national policymaking  body of the federal courts, and does not impose additional fees on  ordinary consumer debtors or small businesses.   As the Conference notes in support of this measure, while bankruptcy  filings have decreased nationwide, the bankruptcy courts that would  receive permanent or new judgeships under this legislation ``have seen  weighted filings increase by more than 55 percent.''   Furthermore, without this legislation, all 14 temporary judgeships  covered by this bill will lapse later this month on May 25.   Allowing a lapse in these judgeships would have potentially crippling  effects on the bankruptcy system.   For example, five of the six authorized judgeships of the U.S.  Bankruptcy Court of the District of Delaware--the preferred venue for  corporate reorganization under Chapter 11--are temporary.   Accordingly, I urge my colleagues to support this important  legislation.   I thank Ranking Member Conyers, the bill's sponsor, for his  leadership on this bill, along with Judiciary Committee Chairman  Goodlatte and Subcommittee Chairman Marino for their support.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2266,  the ``Bankruptcy Judgeship Act of 2017.''   H.R. 2266, the ``Bankruptcy Judgeship Act of 2017,'' would authorize  four additional permanent bankruptcy judgeships and convert 14  temporary bankruptcy judgeships to permanent status based on the most  recent recommendation of the Judicial Conference of the United States.   H.R. 2266 was introduced on May 1, 2017 by Ranking Member John  Conyers, Jr. (D-MI) together with Chairman Bob Goodlatte and  Subcommittee on Regulatory Reform, Commercial and Antitrust Law Chair  Tom Marino (R-PA) and Ranking Member David Cicilline (D-RI) as original  cosponsors.   This bipartisan legislation is time-sensitive as the temporary  judgeships are due to expire on May 25, 2017. No hearing has been held  on this legislation.   A bankruptcy judge may hear and determine all cases arising under the  Bankruptcy Code and certain related proceedings. A district court,  however, may withdraw--in whole or in part--any case or proceeding  referred to a bankruptcy judge. If designated by the district to  exercise such authority, a bankruptcy judge may conduct a jury trial on  consent of all the parties.   Currently pending before Congress is H.R. 244, the ``Consolidated  Appropriations Act, 2017,'' which extends for one year the temporary  judgeships for the District of Delaware (two judgeships), the Southern  District of Florida (two judgeships); the Eastern District of Michigan;  the District of Puerto Rico; and the Eastern District of Virginia.   In analyzing bankruptcy judgeship needs, the Judicial Conference  employs, as a first step, a case weight formula devised by the Federal  Judicial Center that is intended to provide a more accurate and useful  measure of judicial workload than a mere count of filings does.   Pursuant to Conference policy, ``if a district's annual weighted  caseload per authorized judgeship is 1,500 weighted filings or more,  the district will receive consideration for an additional judgeship.''   With respect to the Conference's current request for additional  bankruptcy judgeships, the weighted case filings have increased by more  than 55 percent for most of these districts since the last time  additional judgeships were authorized in 2005, according to the  Conference.   In addition, all 14 of the temporary bankruptcy judgeships that the  bill converts to permanent status are set to lapse as of May 25, 2017.   To offset the cost of this legislation, H.R. 2266 increases the  quarterly fee payable that chapter 11 debtors pay to the United States  Trustee System Fund, but only with respect to debtors that have  quarterly disbursements in excess of $1 million dollars during the  period when the Fund has less than $200 million.   This provision is substantively identical to a legislative proposal  made by the prior Administration as represented in President Barack  Obama's budget request for 2017.   Taken together, the resulting analysis provides a reliable basis upon  which Congress may assess the necessity of authorizing additional  judgeships and extending temporary judgeships.   For all of these reasons, I support this legislation.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte) that the House suspend the  rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2266, as amended.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________
