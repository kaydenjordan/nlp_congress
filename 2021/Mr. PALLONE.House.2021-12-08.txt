SEC. 7. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.         For purposes of carrying out this Act, there are authorized       to be appropriated $100,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2022       through 2026.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 3537.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, in July, the Committee on Energy and Commerce held a  hearing to learn about the challenges associated with finding  treatments for neurodegenerative diseases, including ALS.   We heard from the lead scientist from the National Institutes of  Health and the Food and Drug Administration, and researchers at top  universities, who discussed the difficulties scientists have had in  understanding the complexities of the disease and developing  biomarkers, a critical tool for drug development.   FDA told us about the guidance they had provided to the industry on  ensuring clinical trials were inclusive, and the agency's willingness  to consider novel clinical research methods. However, we also heard  from patients who said that FDA's guidance was not doing enough to get  results on the ground.   Given the length of time it often takes to diagnose ALS, many  patients have found themselves locked out of clinical trials, despite  the guidance urging developers to allow more flexible enrollment.   As a result, patients and their families are left to fight this  devastating disease with very limited medical interventions. According  to the patient advocates, FDA's guidance was not being implemented by  developers and was not being followed by the agency itself. So H.R.  3537, the Accelerating Access to Critical Therapies for ALS Act, takes  real steps to improve processes and activities at FDA to ensure  patients can access clinical trials.   This legislation will help us get closer to effective cures and  treatments for ALS. It requires FDA to develop and carry out an action  plan to show how the agency will address ALS and other  neurodegenerative diseases over the next 5 years.   The bill also creates a new grant program at FDA to cover research  costs to characterize rare neurodegenerative diseases, identify  molecular targets for the diseases, and increase efficiency and  productivity of clinical trials.   Additionally, the bill creates a new grant program at the Department  of Health and Human Services that will help pay for investigational  drugs to prevent, diagnose, mitigate, treat, or cure ALS in expanded  access programs. Expanded access is an important pathway for patients  to receive experimental treatments, which should only be used when  clinical trials and other effective treatments are not available.   Mr. Speaker, in committee, we ensured there would be a path forward  for patients who are not able to participate in clinical research, but  also clarified the intent and parameters of the program to maintain the  scientific integrity of our research agencies.   The legislation now requires the Government Accountability Office to  measure the program ahead of a 5-year sunset to ensure that these novel  grant programs are benefiting patients and researchers. The grants  included in this bill are charting new territory for NIH, and it is  important we measure their level of success before we explore efforts  to expand this program beyond ALS.   Mr. Speaker, this bill would not be here on the floor today were it  not for the steadfast determination of patients and their families. At  our hearing on this legislation in July, Brian Wallach and his wife,  Sandra Abrevaya, cofounders of ``I Am ALS,'' spoke so eloquently of  their own personal fight against ALS, and charged us with the task of  passing this bill.                                time  1500    Hundreds of patient advocates across the country have made their  voices heard to Members as well. To Brian, Sandra, and all the patients  and their families, I reiterate what I said during our full committee  markup: We heard you and now we are acting. We are grateful for your  collaboration and willingness to work with us to improve this bill.   I also want to acknowledge the work of Representative   Mike Quigley,  the sponsor of this legislation, who has been tireless in his efforts  to see this legislation across the finish line. I appreciate his  willingness to work with us to get this bill to the committee so that  it was ready for action here on the floor. I also want to thank our  chairwoman of the Health Subcommittee, Ms. Eshoo, for all that she has  done to move this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the ACT for ALS, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Quigley), the sponsor of the bill and the champion in the  fight against ALS.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewomen from  California (Ms. Eshoo), the chairwoman of the Health Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky), the chairwoman of the Subcommittee on  Consumer Protection and Commerce.     Mr. Speaker, after listening to the personal stories on  both sides of the aisle, I don't think anyone would question why this  bill is important in order to provide hope to so many, as the speakers  said, in order to try to find a cure and in order to try to find more  treatments and clinical trials. All these are basically put into this  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, again, I urge unanimous support for this bill on both  sides, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5487) to improve research and data collection on  stillbirths, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5487         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

(b) Progress Report.--Not later than five years after the       date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Health and       Human Services shall submit to the Congress a comprehensive       report on the progress and effectiveness of the Perinatal       Pathology Fellowship Program established under section 1123       of the Public Health Service Act, as added by section 3 of       this Act.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 5487.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, stillbirth is one of the most devastating losses that  affects more than 24,000 families each year. Stillbirth touches  families of all races, religions, and socioeconomic status.   For many parents, stillbirth is a loss that hits unexpectedly. In  fact, up to half of all stillbirths occur in pregnancies that had  seemed problem-free. However, miscarriages and stillbirths are not  systematically recorded, even in developed countries, suggesting that  the numbers could be even higher.   While there has been some progress in reducing stillbirths, causes  and risk factors have not been explored extensively.   H.R. 5487, the SHINE for Autumn Act of 2021, is an important first  step in promoting positive change around this issue. The legislation is  in honor of Autumn Joy, who was born stillborn on July 8, 2011. For the  last decade, her mother, Debbie Haine, has transformed her loss into  action.   The legislation seeks to bolster research on stillbirths and  stillbirth risk factors to lower our Nation's stillbirth rate. H.R.  5487 would provide resources to State and Federal health departments,  improve data collection around stillbirths, and increase education and  awareness.   Since a stillbirth is such a private, devastating life event, the  data collected is only intended for the purpose  [[Page H7515]]  of informing public health research and improving health outcomes. The  resources provided in the legislation to the Centers for Disease  Control and Prevention, the National Institutes of Health, and State  health departments to improve data collection and increase education  and awareness is simply the beginning of a longer term solution toward  the prevention and reduction of incidences of stillbirth nationwide.   I want to thank Representatives Herrera Beutler, Roybal-Allard,  Mullin, and Castor for their work on this important legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan bill,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Castor), who is a member of the Energy and Commerce  Committee and chair of the Select Committee on the Climate Crisis.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Roybal-Allard), the prime Democratic  sponsor of the bill and the chairwoman of the Appropriations  Subcommittee on Homeland Security.    Mr. Speaker, I urge support for this critical  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5561) to reauthorize a program for early detection,  diagnosis, and treatment regarding deaf and hard-of-hearing newborns,  infants, and young children, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

(b) Report.--Not later than two years after the date of the       enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General shall--        (1) complete the study under subsection (a) and submit a       report on the results of the study to--        (A) the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of       Representatives; and        (B) the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions       of the Senate; and        (2) make such report publicly available.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 5561.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Over the last 20 years, we have been very successful in addressing  one of the most common birth defects affecting America's children,  congenital hearing loss. Children with this condition are born with  hearing loss and are at risk for delays in speech, language, social,  and emotional development. Fortunately, early detection and  intervention is highly effective in preventing these adverse effects.   Since the year 2000, Congress has passed and subsequently  reauthorized Early Hearing Detection and Intervention programs, also  known as EHDI programs; and these programs support State and territory  programs and systems of care to identify and support children who are  deaf or hard of hearing. As a result of these EHDI programs, early  hearing loss screening, diagnosis, and treatment services have greatly  increased over the last 20 years.   Consider that before 1993, only 1 in 10 newborns were screened for  hearing loss. Recent data indicates that today, 97 percent of all  infants are screened within the first month of their lives; 77 percent  of infants receive audiological evaluations and diagnosis by 3 months  of age; and 70 percent of infants were enrolled in early intervention  services before 6 months of age. These are remarkable achievements that  help ensure all children with hearing loss have the same opportunities  as children who can hear.   So today, we are considering a bill that will help us build on these  achievements. H.R. 5561, the Early Hearing Detection and Intervention  Act of 2021, would extend funding for the EHDI programs for 5 years  through fiscal year 2026. This legislation will ensure that these  services continue to be available for children that are deaf or hard of  hearing.   I want to commend our Health Subcommittee Ranking Member Guthrie for  his leadership on this bill. I urge all my colleagues to support it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge support for this bill on a  bipartisan basis, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5551) to amend title III of the Public Health Service Act to  reauthorize the National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental  Disabilities, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5551         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Section 317J of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C.       247b-11) is amended by striking subsection (e) (relating to       authorization of appropriations).     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 5551.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in support of H.R. 5551, the Improving the Health of Children  Act, which reauthorizes the National Center on Birth Defects and  Developmental Disabilities. This center was established by Congress in  2000 to improve the health of millions of our Nation's most vulnerable  citizens, our infants and children, people with disabilities, and  people with blood disorders. It is the only center at the Centers for  Disease Control and Prevention whose mission focuses on these  populations.   Birth defects, Mr. Speaker, affect 1 in 33 babies and are a leading  cause of infant death in the United States. Children with birth defects  who survive often experience lifelong physical and mental disabilities.  In addition, over 500,000 children are diagnosed with a developmental  disability each year.   Blood disorders such as sickle cell disease, anemia, and hemophilia,  affect millions of people each year in the United States, cutting  across the boundaries of age, race, sex, and socioeconomic status.   So H.R. 5551, sponsored by Representatives Carter and Trahan,  reauthorizes the work of this center for 5 years and helps maintain the  programmatic focus of the center.   It has been 15 years since the last authorization, and the importance  of the center's work continues to grow. Whether it be supporting  partnerships to continue research on autism or coordinating a rapid  response to Zika, the center plays a critical role in preventing birth  defects and helping people with disabilities and blood disorders live  healthy and productive lives.   So, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill so that we  can ensure vital surveillance and research continue to focus on the  well-being of people with birth defects, disabilities, and blood  disorders.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Massachusetts (Mrs. Trahan), a member of the Energy and Commerce  Committee and the Democratic sponsor of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I urge support on a bipartisan basis, and I  yield back the balance of my time.  [[Page H7518]]     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1193) to amend title IV of the Public Health Service Act to  direct the Director of the National Institutes of Health, in  consultation with the Director of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood  Institute, shall establish a program under which the Director of the  National Institutes of Health shall support or conduct research on  valvular heart disease, and for other purposes, as amended.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 1193.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, valvular heart disease is a rising health threat to many  otherwise healthy people. Each year, more than 25,000 Americans lose  their lives to valvular heart disease, and they are predominantly young  women. Unfortunately, the disease's reach is only increasing with more  than 5 million diagnoses each year.   Despite this rising incidence, there is so much that we do not know  about valvular heart disease. Specifically, we do not have a good  understanding about what makes the disease life-threatening.   Today, we are taking an important step to address this gap by  considering H.R. 1193, the CAROL Act. I commend Representative Barr for  introducing this legacy bill in honor of his late wife, Carol, who died  unexpectedly in June of 2020 from an underlying valvular heart disease  condition. This bill will help other families avoid the same tragedy  his family has faced.   The CAROL Act will expand research on valvular heart disease and its  treatment by authorizing a grant program administered by the National  Institutes of Health in collaboration with the National Heart, Lung,  and Blood Institute. It will also require the Centers for Disease  Control and Prevention to carry out projects to increase education,  awareness, and diagnosis of valvular heart disease and to reduce  cardiac deaths caused by valvular heart disease.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  New York (Miss Rice), a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee.   Miss RICE of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the  CAROL Act, which I am proud to co-lead with my friend, Representative    Andy Barr, which will fund critical breakthroughs in our understanding  of valvular heart disease.   Millions of Americans live with some form of valvular heart disease,  and most of them go their entire lives without a serious issue or  incident. But over 25,000 people die in this country from this  condition every single year.   Last year, Andy's wife, Carol, tragically passed away from a heart  valve condition called mitral valve prolapse.   The CAROL Act will honor Carol's life by creating a new grant program  administered by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute to fund  valvular heart disease research.   Our hope is that this research will improve our knowledge of this  poorly understood condition and one day produce a cure that will  prevent other families from having to endure the same tragedy that  befell the Barr family. I cannot think of a more beautiful tribute to  Carol's life than that.   Andy, I commend you and your family for your incredible strength and  for turning your grief into action. It was my honor to join you on this  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Pallone, Chairwoman Eshoo, Ranking  Member Rodgers, and Ranking Member Guthrie for bringing this critical  bill to the floor. I urge all members to support it today.     Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Panetta).    Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time, as we hear from the Republican Members.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to  the gentlewoman from Washington (Mrs. Rodgers).    Madam Speaker, let me just say again what a tribute that    Andy Barr has made to his wife.   Madam Speaker, this is such an important bill in terms of trying to  deal with this disease. Again, I urge bipartisan support, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1667) to address behavioral health and well-being among  health care professionals, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

(b) Reporting.--Not later than 2 years after the date of       enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall provide to the       Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions of the       Senate and the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House       of Representatives an update on the activities and outcomes       of the initiative under subsection (a), including a       description of quantitative and qualitative metrics used to       evaluate such activities and outcomes.        (c) Authorization of Appropriations.--To carry out this       section, there are authorized to be appropriated $10,000,000       for each of fiscal years 2022 through 2024.       SEC. 4.

Not later than 4 years after the date of enactment of this       Act, the Comptroller General of the United States shall       submit to the Congress a report on the extent to which       Federal substance use disorder and mental health grant       programs address the prevalence and severity of mental health       conditions and substance use disorders among health       professionals. Such report shall--        (1) include an analysis of available evidence and data       related to such conditions and programs; and        (2) assess whether there are duplicative goals and       objectives among such grant programs.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 1667.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, the COVID-19 pandemic has placed an extraordinary  amount of stress on physicians and other health professionals.  According to a recent survey by the Physician Foundation, nationwide,  half of physicians report feeling anxious due to COVID-19-related  concerns, and nearly 60 percent report experiencing burnout. That is a  significant increase from just two years ago.   Yet, many are not getting the help they need. Only 13 percent of  providers have sought treatment to address pandemic-related mental  health concerns. Nearly half of emergency physicians report not feeling  comfortable seeking mental health treatment for fear of professional or  personal repercussions, even though 87 percent say they have been  experiencing increased stress.   Now, earlier this year, Congress took action in the American Rescue  Plan to address these concerns. We invested in training for healthcare  professionals on strategies to reduce burnout and stigma associated  with seeking mental healthcare; and we provided support to the  employers of frontline providers so they can better care for the mental  health needs of their workforce.   These were important investments for a workforce stretched to the  limit, but there is still more to be done. And that is why Congress  must pass H.R. 1667, the Dr. Lorna Breen Healthcare Provider Protection  Act.   This legislation is named in honor of Dr. Lorna Breen, a sister,  friend, daughter, and emergency department physician, who tragically  died by suicide after the physical and mental toll of the pandemic  became too unbearable. Dr. Breen was fearful of seeking assistance for  her debilitating mental burden, which left her despondent and  physically unable to move from her office chair.   Earlier this year, her family testified before the Committee on  Energy and Commerce about how the workload and stress of her position  during the beginning of the pandemic broke an otherwise indomitable  spirit of a compassionate woman with a strong love of her job and her  coworkers and her patients.   The Dr. Lorna Breen Healthcare Provider Protection Act will make  significant strides in improving access to mental and behavioral health  services. First, the bill authorizes grants for training health  profession students, residents, or healthcare professionals in  evidence-informed strategies to reduce and prevent suicide, burnout,  mental health conditions, and substance use disorders.   It will also identify and disseminate evidence-informed best  practices for reducing and preventing suicide and burnout among  healthcare professionals. The legislation also establishes a national  evidence-based education and awareness campaign targeting healthcare  professionals to encourage them to seek support and treatment for  mental and behavioral health concerns. And finally, it calls for a  comprehensive study to be conducted on healthcare professional mental  and behavioral health and burnout.   This bill received unanimous support in the Committee on Energy and  Commerce and is part of a series of bipartisan bills the committee has  worked on to bolster and support our healthcare workforce.   I thank the sponsors of this bill, most importantly, Representative  Wild, who was the lead sponsor, and my colleagues on the committee for  their steadfast work in honoring Dr. Breen, her family, and the  countless healthcare providers who will now have additional support and  resources available to them. It is my hope that this bill will lead to  more healthcare providers seeking help when they need it without fear  of repercussions or stigma.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Pennsylvania (Ms. Wild), the lead sponsor of the bill.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Chu).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Krishnamoorthi).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Michigan (Ms. Stevens).    Madam Speaker, I urge support for this bill, which is  bipartisan, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4555) to amend the Public Health Service Act to authorize a  public education campaign across all relevant programs of the Health  Resources and Services Administration to increase oral health literacy  and awareness.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4555         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Oral Health Literacy and       Awareness Act of 2021''.       SEC. 2. ORAL HEALTH LITERACY AND AWARENESS CAMPAIGN.         The Public Health Service Act is amended by inserting after       section 340G-1 of such Act (42 U.S.C. 256g-1) the following:       ``SEC. 340G-2. ORAL HEALTH LITERACY AND AWARENESS.         ``(a) Campaign.--The Secretary, acting through the       Administrator of the Health Resources and Services       Administration, shall establish a public education campaign       (referred to in this subsection as the `campaign') across all       relevant programs of the Health Resources and Services       Administration (including the health center program, oral       health workforce programs, maternal and child health       programs, the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program, and rural health       programs) to increase oral health literacy and awareness.        ``(b) Strategies.--In carrying out the campaign, the       Secretary shall identify oral health literacy and awareness       strategies that are evidence-based and focused on oral health       care education, including education on prevention of oral       disease such as early childhood and other caries, periodontal       disease, and oral cancer.        ``(c) Focus.--The Secretary shall design the campaign to       communicate directly with  [[Page H7526]]       specific populations, including children, pregnant women,       parents, the elderly, individuals with disabilities, and       ethnic and racial minority populations, including Indians,       Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians, in a culturally and       linguistically appropriate manner.        ``(d) Outcomes.--In carrying out the campaign, the       Secretary shall include a process for measuring outcomes and       effectiveness.        ``(e) Report to Congress.--Not later than 3 years after the       date of enactment of this section, the Secretary shall submit       to the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of       Representatives and the Committee on Health, Education,       Labor, and Pensions of the Senate a report on the outcomes       and effectiveness of the campaign.        ``(f) Authorization of Appropriations.--To carry out this       section, there is authorized to be appropriated $750,000 for       each of fiscal years 2022 through 2026.''.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 4555.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, oral health is an important component of general  health and well-being, but it is a big problem for many Americans.  Tooth decay is the most common chronic disease in both children and  adults in the United States. More than one in four adults have  untreated cavities, and nearly half of American adults show signs of  gum disease.   Regular preventative dental care can catch these oral health problems  early when they are easiest to treat. Unfortunately, less than half of  Americans use the oral healthcare system. One of the best ways to  promote oral healthcare is to increase oral health literacy.   H.R. 4555, the Oral Health Literacy and Awareness Act, will  accomplish this by expanding oral health literacy programs. H.R. 4555  will authorize a public education campaign to increase oral health  literacy and awareness across all relevant programs of the Health  Resources and Services Administration.   This bill will also help us learn about the effectiveness of targeted  oral health literacy campaigns, and it will inform future efforts to  improve oral health literacy for all Americans.   I want to thank Representatives Cardenas and Bilirakis, members of  the Energy and Commerce Committee, for their bipartisan work on this  legislation. I urge my colleagues to support this important bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Cardenas), a member of the Energy and Commerce  Committee who is the lead sponsor of the bill.    Madam Speaker, I urge bipartisan support for this bill.   As Mr. Cardenas said, there is nothing, really, more important than  oral health. We know there are so many times when poor dental care has  led to much more severe problems of all sorts, so this is really an  important bill.   Madam Speaker, I urge its support, and I yield back the balance of my  time.  [[Page H7527]]
