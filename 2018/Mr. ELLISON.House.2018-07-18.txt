 Mr. Speaker, I, along with so many Americans, looked on  with great shock as we saw the President capitulate to Vladimir Putin.  It was truly a stunning and worrisome moment for me.   In fact, in that European trip, the President insulted our allies and  then openly embraced a man who attacked our democracy, invaded and  annexed other countries, and authorized lethal attacks on his political  enemies and other countries.   Yet the President still embraced him.   It is a moment of alarm for the whole Nation, but it is important to  note that there is something we can do about it, as the President has  also urged the U.S. Congress to eliminate funding for the Election  Assistance Commission.   This is very serious because we know that Russia assisted in the  hacking and attack of over 21 States' election systems. The President  may not be concerned, but Congress ought to be.   Unfortunately, today we expect to have a vote in which we are voting  on a bill that eliminates the funding of the Election Assistance  Commission. This should be rejected, as we should reject the  President's failure to stand up for our values.                            ____________________
