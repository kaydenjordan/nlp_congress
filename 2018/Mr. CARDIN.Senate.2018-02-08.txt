 Mr. President, first, I want to thank Senator Markey and  concur in his comments in regard to the Dreamers. Yes, we are pleased  that we have a bipartisan agreement today. I am still in the process of  reading all the details before making a final judgment, but it is  certainly good news that the Democrats and Republicans--  [[Page S798]]  the leadership--have come together in an agreement.   I join Senator Markey and am pleased that the majority leader is  going to bring before the floor of the Senate in a fair manner next  week the immigration issue to protect Dreamers. I would also add that  those in temporary protective status, TPS, should also be considered.   We have a process, and I hope that the spirit that we have seen on  the budget agreement will continue next week as the Senate works, as it  should, in a bipartisan manner to protect the Dreamers and do what is  right. I also want to acknowledge that there is no such commitment from  the Republican leadership in the House. I join with Leader Pelosi in  urging Speaker Ryan to set up a similar process in the House so that we  can get a bill to the President and signed into law to protect the  Dreamers. The President created this problem by putting a date on their  backs, and it is our responsibility to respond in a timely way. I am  glad to see that the Senate is prepared to take action.                          Prudent Layperson Standard    Mr. President, I took this time because I want to talk about one  specific provision in healthcare that was passed by Congress in the  nineties, but let me just preface that by saying that in this budget  agreement, I am pleased to see there are bipartisan agreements on  advancing healthcare in America. A bill that I have worked on since we  imposed the therapy caps way back in the nineties, which made no sense  at all, will finally correct that mistake permanently and allow those  who are in need of the most severe therapy services--those who are  stroke victims or in similar situations--to be able to get that care  without a cap as to the amount of services they need.   I am also pleased to see that we are going to be dealing with  telemedicine--an issue I have worked on and many Members have worked  on--improving dialysis treatment. Some of the issues we have all worked  on include community health centers, the 10-year extension of the  Children's Health Insurance Program, and rural healthcare. There are a  lot of good things in this bipartisan agreement to advance healthcare,  and I am pleased about them.   I just want to remind my colleagues that if we are successful in  getting that enacted into law, we still have to make sure it is  implemented in the manner in which we intended. I give as an example  the prudent layperson standard on emergency medical treatment. I was  involved in that process in the 1990s. The reason this came to our  attention is that insurance practices in the 1990s were such that it  was not unusual for an insurance company to deny payment for emergency  services. An individual would have the classic symptoms, for example,  of a heart attack--the pain, the sweating--and then did what a prudent  layperson would do, which is go to the nearest emergency room to get  treatment. Well, after the examination was complete, if they found out  the person did not have a heart attack, the person would be discharged  from the hospital and go home. A few days later they would get the bill  for that visit and then almost have a heart attack when the insurance  company would not pay the bill. We recognized that as not being right,  so we took action to change that.   In response to these dangerous and unfair requirements, Maryland  enacted the prudent layperson standard in 1992. If it was prudent to go  to the emergency room for care, the insurance company had to reimburse  it. Later, in 1997, I led the national effort to extend the prudent  layperson standard to all Medicare plans and Medicaid managed care  plans as part of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. I worked with  President Clinton, who eventually signed an Executive order in 1998 to  have the standard apply to all government insurance programs.   Then I fought to have my patient's bill of rights amendment, which  included the prudent layperson standard, enacted as part the Patient  Protection and Affordable Care Act for individual and group health  plans. So now it is effective for all plans in this country. There is a  definition of what an emergency medical condition is and when it is  prudent to do that. It is spelled out in the statute dealing with the  seriousness of the symptoms, as it could deal with bodily harm, et  cetera.   Despite the Federal law, private insurers are, once again, using  tactics to prevent people from seeking care in an emergency room.  Several newspapers, from the Los Angeles Times to the Columbus  Dispatch, have reported that Anthem--one of the Nation's largest  insurers--has implemented an avoidable emergency room program to reduce  what it deems as unnecessary ER visits and address rising healthcare  costs. This program has been rolled out in several States, including  Kentucky, Missouri, Ohio, Indiana, Georgia, and New Hampshire.   According to these news reports, patients who believe they have  emergency symptoms go to the ER for emergency medical care. After  several tests, the physicians and nurses determine there is no  emergency medical condition. The patient returns home, relieved to be  OK. A few weeks later, they receive a letter from the insurance company  refusing to cover the care received in the hospital. This is wrong. We  said it was wrong in the 1990s, and we took steps to change that. We  now have laws that make it very clear.   The Anthem avoidable ER policy forces people who are in some sort of  acute distress to determine, before they even leave their homes, if  their symptoms are really serious enough to go to an emergency room.  What we had back in the 1990s was preauthorization for emergency care.  Can you imagine trying to make a phone call before you go to an  emergency room to talk to somebody as to whether you should go there or  not, wasting valuable time, or being told to go to a hospital different  from the closest hospital, again, causing really serious jeopardy? That  is what we had. People should not be forced to act as their own doctor  and second-guess themselves when they truly believe they are having a  medical emergency.   A wrong decision based upon economic considerations--the ability to  pay the bill--could be deadly. We should not discourage people from  seeking necessary medical treatment, and we should not allow insurance  companies to return to the time when they could callously refuse to  cover emergency care provided to individuals who genuinely and  reasonably believe they need it.   As we will be considering shortly additional improvements in our  healthcare system to eliminate the cap that we have on therapy caps, to  make it clear that we want to make telemedicine more available, to help  dialysis patients, to deal with our children in the Children's Health  Insurance Program, to deal with rural healthcare, let us also make sure  that we set up the ability to make sure that our policies, in fact, are  carried out. We should not allow an insurance company such as Anthem to  act as if what Congress did does not exist. I think that is our  responsibility.   I look forward to working with our colleagues in a bipartisan way to  improve healthcare and access for all Americans.   With that, I yield the floor.                                Cloture Motion
