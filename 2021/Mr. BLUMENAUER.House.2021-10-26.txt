 Madam Speaker, I thank Congressman Levin for the  courtesy of yielding to me and for organizing this recognition for  Richard Trumka.   As has been documented here on the floor this evening, he was truly a  giant in terms of organized labor, for social justice, his passion, his  energy. But I wanted to just note one item that I thought was really  remarkable.   As I became chair of the Trade Subcommittee on Ways and Means, Mr.  Trumka arranged for me to have lunch with him and a half dozen  different leaders, with six international union presidents talking  about the need to be able to have a worker-centered trade policy.                                time  1745    It was a remarkable exchange of ideas and opinions and commitments to  work together. And we took a NAFTA agreement that could not pass on the  floor of the House and worked together to be able to have a process  that was worthy of support. There was nobody who was more essential to  that than Richard Trumka, who was tireless in his efforts to make sure  that that legislation moving forward would respect workers' rights,  that we would deal with enforcement of labor agreements. They should be  worth the paper they were printed on.   I'll go to my grave convinced that if we had had that opportunity  earlier with the Obama administration, we wouldn't have had some of  those concerns, we could have resolved issues of investor-state and  worker rights.   Rich Trumka was tireless in terms of his determination. He was a  tough negotiator. He was fair. He was honest. As I say, reaching out  even to a new subcommittee chair. He took the time, brought people  together so that we could fashion an area of common cause going  forward.   It struck me, as the measure of the man, with all the things that  were on his plate, that he would take the time to deal with these  important details and be able to expose it to other labor leaders. It  is the measure of his leadership, the legacy that he leaves, and we are  all fortunate that we have had an opportunity to work with him over the  years. He will be missed but his legacy will linger on.
