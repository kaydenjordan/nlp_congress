 Mr. Speaker, today, I will be voting for the  transportation appropriations bill, and one of the reasons why is that  it provides exactly the right amount of funding for California's high- speed rail, which is zero dollars.   Zero dollars are appropriated for high-speed rail in this bill, and  it is well past time that we stop throwing good money after bad.   High-speed rail was an idea in the early 2000s in California that  might have initially had some promise, but because of sheer political  dysfunction, it has become perhaps the biggest boondoggle in United  States history.   The price tag is now pegged at $128 billion, and a decade and a half  after it was approved, there is still absolutely nothing to show for  it. When you look at the press releases that come out from the high- speed rail authority, it is almost beyond belief what now counts as  success.   This press release is from just 5 days ago: ``California High-Speed  Rail Authority Moves Closer to Designing Tracks and Systems.''   This is a decade and a half after the project was conceived.  According to The New York Times, at the current  [[Page H5473]]  pace, the high-speed rail project will not be completed in this  century.   Last year, an investigation by The Times produced a story headlined:  ``How California's Bullet Train Went Off the Rails.'' The Times  explained that the tortured effort to build the country's first high- speed rail system is a case study in how ambitious public works  projects can become perilously encumbered by unrealistic cost  estimates, flawed engineering, and a determination to persist on  projects that have become too big to fail.   The Times reported how one of the early operators that actually knows  how to build high-speed rail systems, SNCF, became so frustrated after  their ideas and plans were repeatedly discarded that they pulled out in  2011 and decided to go to North Africa, where it was less politically  dysfunctional. Indeed, they then helped Morocco bring a high-speed rail  system online in 2018.   All the while, the condition of California's roads continues to  deteriorate and are among the very worst in the country. They are  unsafe. They cause needless wear and tear on vehicles. They cause  Californians to be stuck in traffic for hours on end.   This is an area where my particular district has unique needs. The  Third Congressional District is one of the few parts of California that  is still growing. Cities like Roseville, Folsom, and Lincoln are  growing as fast as anywhere. People want to come to our communities  because of the high quality of life. We have eluded the downward spiral  that has afflicted many other parts of California because we support  small businesses, law enforcement, and public safety. We have local  governments that are accountable to taxpayers.   Precisely because of this success, many people want to move into our  communities, and it is creating major challenges when it comes to  traffic. Because of that, I have made it a top priority to look for  every possible opportunity to stop spending Federal dollars on wasteful  projects like the high-speed rail boondoggle and instead direct those  funds to needed local road projects that will alleviate traffic for my  constituents.   I was very glad to participate earlier this year in the  groundbreaking for the I-80 fifth lane project, which is going to  improve travel times westbound on I-80 between Douglas Boulevard and  Riverside Avenue.   In the Transportation appropriations bill, which will be voted on by  the House today, I have secured funding for three important projects in  our district.   The first is the U.S. 50/Empire Ranch Road Interchange Project, which  would reduce traffic congestion and improve safety on adjacent  interchanges, ultimately enhancing local and regional circulation and  transportation infrastructure in Folsom and surrounding areas.   The second is the Blue Oaks Boulevard Roadway and Bridge Widening  Project, which is going to alleviate a critical transportation  bottleneck.   The third is the Folsom Lake Crossing safety improvement phase two  project, which would enhance road safety on Folsom Lake Crossing by  adding a median barrier rail to minimize head-on collisions, injuries,  and fatalities.   Mr. Speaker, this is the way that Federal funding should be directed  toward infrastructure and projects that will improve the quality of  life for our constituents.   I am glad in the bill that we will vote on today that is the priority  and that we will be sending zero dollars to the failed California high- speed rail.                            ____________________
