 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I noticed that the gentlewoman from New Mexico just  posited that it is Republicans who want to drive up the prices and  costs of everything for the American people. However, Mr. Speaker, what  she doesn't tell you is that what she means is that we don't believe  that government funding is how one measures how people prosper in this  country. In fact, it is our Democratic colleagues who force through  regulations, policies, and programs that are making the American Dream  completely out of reach for the American people. We are seeing it every  single day with a President and administration that literally don't  care what the impact is on the average American family.   Mr. Speaker, 87 percent of Americans do not have student loans. Large  numbers of Americans have paid off their student loans or are still  working to do so. My wife, who is the product of a single mom and who  put herself through school and figured it out, is still paying off her  loans, which she has done for 20 years now. That is the truth.   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle want to ignore the  Supreme Court. They want to end-run both common sense and the law. They  want to find ways to subsidize the handful at the expense of the many.   They are doing it not just with education. While they destroy our  education system and undermine the American Dream for the American  public, they are also doing it with respect to chasing unicorn energy  dreams while they subsidize billion-dollar corporations. They subsidize  the wealthy with EVs, electric vehicles that cost $16,000 more than the  average internal combustion engine. Now, they have a rule being carried  out by executive fiat by the administration that they want to put in  place that will force, by 2032, approximately two-thirds of the fleet  of automobiles being built for the American people to be electric  vehicles.   That might be concerning if you are a working-class American given  that they cost $16,000 more, given that they are demonstrably more  expensive to repair, and given that they are demonstrably less flexible  for your life, Mr. Speaker. If you live, for example, in Texas, you  might need to drive from Austin to Midland or Austin to Dallas or  Houston or need to be able to move around the State. You might be a  farmer and need to haul goods and services.    My colleagues on the other side of the aisle don't seem to care about  people who live in the northern States, where it is cold and where  batteries take a full charge just to defrost--in Alaska, for example.   That mandate doesn't seem to matter to my colleagues on the other  side of the aisle, so the American people are going to be the ones left  holding the bag, unable to do their jobs, unable to carry out their  livelihood, and unable to afford the basics of life.   The average American family is spending $11,000 a year more just to  make ends meet since the beginning of this administration in January  2021. Now, this administration wants to pile on.   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle want to stop us from  doing our job in Article I to check an out-of-control executive branch  and an out-of-control Biden administration that is bankrupting the  American family and destroying the American Dream.   Republicans in this body, in this Chamber, have been advancing bill  after bill that would help the American people, secure the border, have  a strong national defense, help them afford education, and stop the  ridiculousness of these mandates driving up the cost of vehicles. They  send them over to the Senate, and they die.   The only question is whether Republicans are going to stand up and  jam down the throats of recalcitrant Democrats and this administration  changes to this administration's policies that are undermining the  American people and the American Dream.   That is the truth. That is the actual truth.                                time  1300     Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for spending time here on  the floor of the House commemorating the life of former First Lady  Carter. We are reminded, as we heard his words and as we have  commemorated her life, of the longstanding love affair and relationship  between the First Lady and President Carter.   Regardless of my disagreements with them on policy and politics, they  are two great public servants who committed to live out their faith,  their Southern Baptist Christian faith, in real time, whether it was  Habitat for Humanity or in numerous other ways.   We are reminded of how important it is for those of us in public  service to have our committed spouses--in my case, my committed wife,  who is at home carrying out all the tasks of keeping our family, with a  14-year-old son and a 12-year-old daughter, going--how we could not be  here without them, and how honored we are by their sacrifices on our  behalf and cannot possibly convey what it means while we are up here  doing the work of the people to have our wives or husbands back home  supporting us from afar.   I would note, while we are commemorating our spouses--in this case,  First Lady Carter--or the longstanding relationship between former  President Bush and Barbara Bush, how important those relationships are  for all of us in public service.   I would also be remiss if we didn't talk about our mothers. My mama  turned 75 last week, and I was not able to be here to wish her a happy  birthday, so I am going to wish her a happy belated birthday a week  later and thank her for all she has done for me and all of her  sacrifices and her love in raising me.   We in my family believe in the American Dream and believe in that  generational transfer of love of this country and transfer of the work  of one generation to the next, a generation that was working the fields  that then became a generation that was working in the factories that  became a generation that was then going to college to a generation that  would then have a son that could go to law school and end up on the  floor of the House of Representatives.   That is what is great about this country. That is what we need to  restore in this country.    On that note of respect and love for our parents, our love for our  moms, I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Williams), my friend,  to be able to give him some time on the floor to commemorate the life  of his mama.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from New York for his  touching remarks about his mother. We will be praying for him and his  family, knowing that she is in a better place, knowing that we are all  here for a brief period of time, and we are celebrating a life well  lived. I am sure she was proud to see you on the floor of the House of  Representatives. We will honor her life by doing our job.   To that point, you heard my friend from New York (Mr. Williams)  talking about the life of his family, and it reflected what I started  talking about, that generational transfer of the American Dream, the  extent to which one generation sacrifices so the next can live that  American Dream.   My grandmother was a single mom in West Texas with my father, who was  a 7-year-old stricken with polio. She had just lost her husband, my  grandfather, to cancer. She didn't run around asking for help. She  didn't say: Where is the government? She got a second job. She woke up  at 4:00 in the morning. She did all the rehab my father needed so that  he could walk, got him through polio. She ran and became the first  woman elected county clerk in Nolan County, Texas. She wasn't running  around asking for some sort of handout because her father was an  orphan, the bastard child of somebody that we don't know--we believe  him to have been an American Indian in Mississippi--and was sitting in  an orphanage and then moves to West Texas to figure out how to build a  family, build the American Dream, farm. That is where my grandmother  grew up.   She didn't ask for people to be giving her something because her  family wasn't treated right, or she drew a short straw because her  husband died of cancer, or her son had polio. She just worked. She just  did what you are supposed to do.   That core aspect of the American Dream is what currently is  increasingly unattainable for the vast majority of Americans. Too many  Americans today are looking out and saying: I cannot live as my parents  and my grandparents did. I can't afford to buy a house because interest  rates are so  [[Page H6139]]  high and houses are so high. I can't afford to buy a car. I can't  afford to buy groceries. I can't figure out how to manage to keep my  family safe and secure in my own home and community. They are looking  out across the future and over the horizon.   For the first time in really our history, Americans are questioning  whether this country will exist for their kids and grandkids, whether  their kids and grandkids will be able to have a better life than they  did. That is unacceptable, but yet that is what we currently face.   I want to be very clear. This is the direct consequence of radical  leftist positions by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle in  this body, in the other Chamber, and in the White House. It is the  direct consequence of Democrats who refuse to sit down at the table to  constrain spending when we need to, to secure the border of the United  States, to determine foreign policy that is built on the national  security interests of the United States and not the fad of wearing a  pin.   They don't want to work with us on how to have a military focused on  how to do its job rather than radical social engineering to reengineer  the Department of Defense. They don't want to sit down and work with us  to ensure that we are able to have the energy that we need to power our  homes affordably.   All of these things that I am rattling off are actual existential  threats that our country faces.   Spending: We are $34 trillion in debt. Nobody possibly knows what $34  trillion of debt means.   I can tell you what it means in terms of annual interest. We are now  about to be spending more in interest on our debt than to fund the  national defense of the United States. Imagine that.   How can a country succeed, how can we sustain ourselves, if we are  paying more on interest because of our own debt, because of our  irresponsible spending, than on defending our country? Yet that is what  we are doing.   This year, we are spending $2 trillion more than we take in and we  are doing nothing to stop it.   Republicans are trying to hold the line on spending. We get no  support from our Democratic colleagues.   Speaker Johnson is trying to hold the line against the Senate that  wants to keep spending more money, Democratic colleagues who want to  spend more money, and a few of my own Republican colleagues who want to  spend more money.   The Speaker should be congratulated and should be praised for holding  the line on spending. We need to finish the job, and Republicans need  to unite around the Speaker of the House to send a loud message to our  Democratic colleagues and a loud message to the American people that we  are no longer going to continue to spend money we don't have,  destroying the American Dream, driving up inflation, driving up  interest rates, leveraging our own security to the rest of the world,  and making it to where the American dollar is worth nothing.   We have an obligation to hold the line on spending. Are we going to  fight? Are we going to stop the dealmaking, the backroom deals, the  side deals--in this instance, the $54 billion of side deals that my  Democratic colleagues expect Republicans to pack into a spending bill  in order to buy their votes?   Republicans should say no to side deals and gimmicks that blow the  lid off spending.   Republicans should say no to unfunded supplemental spending for wars,  no matter how meritorious.   Do I believe we should help Israel? You bet.   Did Republicans on this floor, with the leadership of Speaker  Johnson, send $14 billion over to the Senate to fund Israel? Yes, we  did.   Was it paid for? Yes, it was. It was paid for out of money set aside  to expand the IRS to target Americans.   Democrats, on a party-line vote in the Senate, killed that bill.   Democrats in the Senate are more interested in siding with the IRS,  expanding the IRS to target American citizens, than they are to stand  with Israel or to be fiscally responsible by taking money already  appropriated and moving it over to pay for an emergency, that emergency  being our friends being assaulted, our friends in Israel being  attacked, with young women being brutally raped, babies being killed,  babies being kidnapped, and innocent civilians shot in the streets.   We saw it with our own eyes. Yet we have colleagues on the other side  of the aisle who don't want to talk about that. They want to brush it  aside. Oh, we can't talk about rape. We need to balance that we are  told by the progressive left.   Republicans stood up alongside our friends in Israel, we passed a  bill that would fund them, we sent it to the Senate, and Democrats in  the Senate chose the IRS over Israel.   Are we going to do our job to spend responsibly?   We have a choice to make. When the funding of the government runs out  in January and early February, we have a choice to make. I hope  Republicans in this body will hold the line and force Republicans and  Democrats alike in the Senate to stop spending money we don't have,  mortgaging the futures of our kids and grandkids.   That is one existential threat. That alone is worth throwing  everything we have at this place to fight to stop spending money we  don't have, to hold the line on piling up debt.   There is another existential threat: wide open borders. Our borders  right now are in crisis.   Just today, video footage of a breached border wall surfaced with  illegal migrants rushing through an opening in the border wall with  their human smuggler shrugging and just saluting the camera.   We have no rules at the southern border now. We have no border. We  have people from all over the world bum-rushing the border of the  United States from terrorist countries, criminals, and people on the  terrorist watch list. We have millions that have been released into the  United States under this administration, and the people in border  States, like my home State of Texas, are the ones left holding the bag.   In this case it was Arizona. Yesterday, the port of entry in  Lukeville, Arizona, was shut down. A port of entry had to be shut down  because Border Patrol could not handle the mass flood of migrants  coming across the border.   Last Monday morning, more than 5,000 migrants were in custody, far  more than Lukeville's holding capacity. I got notices from people just  today. In Eagle Pass, in Del Rio, people flooding into Texas, Border  Patrol overwhelmed.   Last Thursday, while transporting illegal migrants, a human  smuggler's car caught fire while driving 100 miles per hour through  Kinney County, Texas, near where I live.   We can fix that. We can secure the border. We can do it in a matter  of weeks. There is no magic. All we need to do is enforce the laws and  fix some of the laws that have some loopholes.   House Republicans passed H.R. 2, the strongest border security bill  we have ever passed. We sent it to the Senate, and it is sitting there.  They refuse to take it up, because Senate Democrats, like my House  Democratic colleagues, want open borders. They don't believe in  sovereignty. They don't believe we should have a sovereign nation. They  believe in world order. They believe that anybody can come here without  following our laws.   Our bill expanded critical protections by fixing parole and asylum  abuses that are being used by the administration to allow people to  come in against both the spirit and the letter of the law. We have  turn-away authority, and we empower State AGs to sue. We fix the abuses  for unaccompanied children, and we treat all children like we currently  do with Mexico and Canada, which would save little children from  getting sold into the sex trafficking trade by the thousands, little  kids getting abused because my Democrat colleagues want to cynically  use open borders as a political stunt and for political power.   Right now in Texas, on I-35 going up the gut of Texas or across I-10,  there are stash houses littered in San Antonio, littered in Houston,  littered in El Paso and Dallas filled with children getting abused.   A thousand migrants died along the southern border last year while my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle just sat back and did  nothing.  [[Page H6140]]    We have acted. Republicans have acted. We sent legislation to the  Senate, and Senate Democrats are doing nothing.   Existential threat 1: spending. We are acting. We are acting  responsibly. House and Senate Democrats refuse to join with us.   Existential threat number 2: our border. House Republicans have  acted. We have sent a bill over to the Senate. It sits there. The  President ignores it while Texans die from fentanyl poisoning and  Americans die from fentanyl poisoning. Our homes, our hospitals, our  schools get overrun, migrants die, migrants get sold into the sex  trafficking trade, cartels get empowered, and China gets empowered, all  so my Democrat colleagues can pat themselves on the back in the false  name of compassion saying that open borders are good for migrants, when  it is a lie.   Existential threat number 3: American energy dominance. American  energy independence and American energy freedom is being destroyed  minute by minute, hour by hour, by an administration and Democrat  colleagues in this Chamber and in the Senate that are undermining our  ability to produce American, clean-burning natural gas, American  nuclear power, reliable power that we need to fuel ourselves and the  world.                                time  1615    Legislation we have on the floor this week that my Democratic  colleagues refuse, in lockstep, to support would stop the tyrannical  overreach by the executive branch to set a new rule requiring electric  vehicles to be about two-thirds of the fleet by 2032.   Now, why does that matter?   Does the average American know that an electric vehicle takes  basically the same amount of electricity as your air conditioner to  charge up?   Have they thought through the fact that if you have an electric  vehicle in North Dakota or in Alaska, it freezes up and takes an entire  battery charge just to thaw it?   Have they thought through what happens if you are living in west  Texas and it is a 400-mile drive and you need a 200-mile recharge?   Have they thought through that the average electric vehicle costs  $16,000 more than the internal combustion engine?   Have they thought through that if you eliminate every internal  combustion engine in America, it would be less than 1 percent impact on  CO2 production, because China has 1,100 coal-fired plants;  America has 250.   India and China are spewing out CO2 at increasing rates.  We are unilaterally disarming and undermining our own economic strength  while being our own economic prosperity, our own energy freedom, all in  the false name of pursuing unicorn energy theories while my colleagues  on the other side of the aisle that are killing the average American  family, killing their budgets, and now on steroids, existential threat.   All of these EVs, those supply chains start now.   Toyota, General Motors, Ford, they are all going to be pumping out  electric vehicles, starting now.   They are piling up on lots because the American people can't afford  them. The American people don't want them right now. They can't get  them charged. They cost more.   You want to know why you can't afford stuff at home? This.   What are we going to do about it? It is an existential threat to your  way of life, America.   What are your Representatives going to do about an executive branch  that is doing this unilaterally using executive power?   House Republicans are acting. House Democrats will not support it.  The Senate will not advance it.   You will be left stranded--literally and figuratively--without the  ability to get a vehicle to power your lives, your family, your jobs,  advance prosperity, and achieve the American Dream, all so people can  feel good about themselves that they have done something for the  environment, which they never did.   CO2 is going to continue to be spewed out.   We have wind and solar being subsidized to the tune of a trillion  dollars. My Democratic colleagues last August passed a bill that will  subsidize a trillion dollars for EVs, for massive solar farms, for  massive wind farms; almost all of that money going to billion-dollar  corporations--mostly White, elite liberals who like to pat themselves  on the back while they drive their Tesla around, feel good about  themselves, and they drink some wine and eat some cheese while talking  about how they are making the world a better place.   It is doing none of that. Zero.   I can tell you what it is doing. It is crippling the American Dream  for young people. It is making hardworking Americans unable to afford  their job.   If you are a painter or a plumber or an electrician, if you are a  teacher, if you clean houses, how in the hell can you afford an  electric vehicle that costs $16,000 more?   Then Gavin Newsom in California says: Oh, crap, we don't have enough  power today because we are all wind and solar. So guess what, between 3  p.m. and 9 p.m., you can't charge your car.   You think that is made up? That actually happened. That is the world  my Democratic colleagues want you to live in: one with mountains of  debt, with open borders, with fentanyl pouring in, and expensive cars.   They will admit it. That is the amazing part. It is so brazen, they  admit it. When we challenge them in the Rules Committee or on the  floor, they admit it.   The Secretary of Transportation, Pete Buttigieg, literally admitted  we are going to have to force pain on American families to achieve  production and promotion of electric vehicles; pain, while China builds  two new coal-fired plants a week, and we do nothing but cede our ground  to China, subsidize solar panels in China--which by the way, where do  they get the minerals for solar panels? Where do they get the minerals  for batteries? Child labor, cobalt mines, where children are exploited.   Where are my colleagues with their bleeding hearts when these  children are being exploited for cobalt mines?   Oh, Chip, it doesn't fit the narrative. Oh, we are the compassionate  ones. We are the green ones. We are living in our little unicorn land  where everything is hunky-dory. Meanwhile, we have empowered our  enemies, weakened our economy, made it impossible for people to achieve  the American Dream, so you have to go beg for more government funding.   That is not the American Dream I started this speech with when my  colleague from New York was regaling his mom who passed away today in  that generational transfer of the American Dream.   It is not the American Dream of my grandmother, as a single mom in  west Texas raising my polio-stricken father after losing her husband to  cancer. She wasn't asking for handouts. She wasn't asking for subsidies  for some electric vehicle. She just got up and did her dang job.   That is the American Dream that we want to pass down to our kids and  our grandkids, but it is being taken away.   I cannot overstate, these are existential threats. They are killing  the American Dream.   Debt: spending money we don't have.   Borders: wide open; endangering us; killing our kids; killing  migrants; increasing the sex trafficking trade; empowering cartels.    Energy: Instead of having the dominance and independence to push back  on China and Russia; growing our economy; affordable, competitive  automobiles; reliable power; fueling grids; creating economic growth.   True, all of the above, where the market determines whether wind and  solar or nuclear or coal or gas can create the best mix of power  supply. Export liquefied natural gas, drive CO2 down with  clean-burning American energy.   We are not doing that. We are passing regulation after regulation  unilaterally by an executive branch engaged in tyranny, the very  tyranny the Founders warned us about, wrote about, and told us in  Federalist 58, we should use the power of the purse to stop, which is  my question for my Republican colleagues:   Will we use the power of the purse to stop an out-of-control Democrat  administration, a recalcitrant Democrat Senate, and our Democrat  colleagues in the House who are totally comfortable letting the  American Dream  [[Page H6141]]  get totally destroyed with existential threat after existential threat?   Those aren't the only ones. What about healthcare?   I would note that a dear friend of mine, a constituent, recently  diagnosed with cancer, she got her coverage through ObamaCare.   What many Americans don't know is that if you are a Member of  Congress, we are required to have our healthcare through ObamaCare, not  some gold-plated fancy thing everybody accuses us of.   Nope, we get ObamaCare. Well, neither my constituent battling  cancer--nor myself who fought cancer and won 12 years ago--can go back  to MD Anderson--she cannot go to MD Anderson, for the first time--under  ObamaCare, the best cancer hospital in the world.   Suddenly coverage doesn't sound that good, does it? Suddenly, the  ObamaCare mandates that have radically driven up the price of  healthcare, radically consolidated the healthcare industry, radically  enriched the insurance companies, radically enriched the hospital  corporations, radically enriched pharmaceutical companies.   Suddenly, all of that stuff doesn't sound so good when you wake up  and you want to go to the doctor but you are told: Sorry, you are not  on the plan. That is the fact.   Americans, a family of four, spend about $25,000 of their own money  or their corporate match for health insurance. But it is not insurance,  it is crappy managed care, where your insurance company picks your  doctors, your winners, your losers, tells you what you can do or can't  do, when you have to pay an expensive deductible or an expensive copay.   Mr. Speaker, 76 ObamaCare marketplace insurers are proposing to  increase their rates by more than 10 percent even now; 8 want to go by  more than 25 percent.   Let me be clear. Our healthcare system is a complete and total  failure. It is a failure made only worse by ObamaCare.   We can fix it. Republicans have plans to fix it. If Republicans would  grab the mantle and run on it, fearlessly, with expanded health savings  accounts, allowing you to use that money, tax free, to go into a  marketplace and shop for legitimate, affordable insurance; legitimate,  direct primary care with doctors you can call up day and night, like  the old black bag doctors that would come to your House, a burgeoning  industry; healthcare sharing ministries that defray costs, the ability  to go out and compete and save.   There is a massive explosion of technological benefits that we can  now tap into if we were to empower patients and doctors rather than  bureaucrats and health insurance administrators.   We can blow the lid off of it, drive prices down; save our ability to  honor our commitments on Medicare by getting prices down, if we will  just do it.   Instead, we sit around and we run into the corner saying: Oh,  Democrats said something about preexisting conditions.   We are all walking preexisting conditions; we are humans. Set up a  system that would work for that, and the best system is one in which I  can take dollars and go get healthcare from a willing provider of that  care and find a way to make sure that insurance is available in a  catastrophic situation in which you can no longer afford to pay for the  care.   It is the best model across all of the different options. We can do  it, but we have to have the willingness to do it.   Instead, we are sitting here with existential threat 1, massive debt;   Existential threat 2, wide open borders, killing our sovereignty and  killing our kids and our communities;   Existential threat 3, American energy getting destroyed, sacrificed  on the altar to the almighty gods of green energy and unicorn energy;   Existential threat 4, healthcare bankrupting American families,  bankrupting your ability to go to the doctor of your choice,  bankrupting the number of physicians we even have available because  nobody wants to go into this godforsaken industry run by insurance  companies.   Yes, the corporate cronyism, replete in this town, where we just  throw money at big corporations.                                time  1630    We empower the insurance bureaucrats to run our healthcare. Could  there possibly be a more stupid way to create a health system? I can't  think of one.   Finally, existential threat number 5, and there are more, is our  national defense. Republicans passed the strongest national defense  authorization that I have seen in my years of public service and  certainly in my time in Congress. It would refocus our military on its  core mission, which is to be trained to, if called upon, kill people  and blow stuff up.   That is what it is there for. It is not there to build soccer fields,  and it is not there to promote social engineering. It is there to  defend us.   We passed the defense bill that would end the unlawful Biden DOD  taxpayer-funded abortion tourism regulations. It would end the  taxpayer-funded gender transition surgeries at the Pentagon. It would  end the radical climate agenda being implemented at the Department of  Defense, which I have already addressed, and the market that is being  embraced by the Pentagon so we can have EVs rolling around our defense  complex.   ``Hold on, guys. Stop shooting while we plug in our car. Hey, we need  to charge up the tank. Give us a second.'' I am looking forward to the  battery-powered jets.   We assist servicemembers who were discharged for refusing the COVID- 19 vaccine. Our Department of Defense is now begging them to come back  because recruiting levels are so bad.   We end radical critical race theories and diversity, equity, and  inclusion. We have created an inspector general for Ukraine  accountability. We prohibit race-based admissions at military  academies. We have refocused our military on its core mission and to  get rid of the social engineering.   Our Democrat colleagues wouldn't support it, and our colleagues in  the Senate won't advance it, so here we sit. They demand that our  defense be a radical social engineering experiment rather than a lean,  mean fighting machine to defend the United States of America. That is  an existential threat.   Education is a threat.   The litany of regulatory morass in this town is all a threat, but  right now, I am just focusing on debt, on our borders being wide open,  on our destruction of American energy dominance and freedom, on our  broken healthcare system destroying the American Dream and the  inability to access doctors, and on a defense that has been turned into  a social engineering experiment instead of defending the United States.   Each one of these things represents a clear and present danger to our  well-being as a nation and as a people. It is our job and our duty to  stand up and fight.   Mr. Speaker, I call on my Democrat colleagues to stop putting their  heads in the sand and ignoring their duty to address these existential  threats. Stop being a roadblock to the great bills and the great  efforts of Republicans that we are moving to pass over to the Senate  and send to the White House.   Nevertheless, I have to say to my Republican colleagues that when you  predictably see our Democratic colleagues refuse to work with us, don't  cave and don't capitulate. Hold the line. Pick one or two fights that  we can deliver for the American people so that we can go home and look  them in the eye.   I don't care about the campaigns, and I don't care about the ads. I  don't care about any of that garbage. I care about looking at my 14- year-old son and my 12-year-old daughter or my 81-year-old father and  75-year-old mother or a veteran who has fought for this country and who  is wounded and hurting. I want to look them and my constituents who  sent me here to fight in the eye, and I want to be able to say:   We delivered. We fought. We forced the President to the table. We  made him secure the border. We made him restore sovereignty. We did our  job.   We held the line on spending. We reduced spending year over year. We  ended the gimmicks. We stopped the games. We set the table for us to  try to balance the budget and do our job and stop racking up debt.   We restored energy freedom. We opened up American natural gas. We  stopped the regulations that were going to kill our country. We stopped  the mandates on electric vehicles that were going to destroy the  American Dream and drive up the price of automobiles.  [[Page H6142]]    We stopped the wokification and destruction of the American military  that is driving down recruiting and making it to where our military  morale is at its low point.   We stood up and fought for healthcare freedom so that, Mr. Speaker,  you can go to the doctor of your choice, so that you can care for your  family, so that you can make decisions, so that you can afford the  care, and so that you can look at your kids and your loved ones in the  eye and be able to take them to get that care without calling some  bureaucrat on a phone and hoping.    It is our calling; it is our job; and it is the reason we run for  Congress. These are existential threats, and they deserve the level of  attention, fight, and dedication that we campaign on. They deserve us  to do what we said we would do. Is it asking too much that we campaign  on doing these things and then come here and actually do them?   It is long past time for excuses. It is time to meet the moment. It  is time to rise to the challenge to do our job to make the people's  House great again, to make Congress great again, to restore the balance  of power, and to stand up and deliver for the American people so that  we can, in fact, save the American Dream for our kids and our  grandkids.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 4 o'clock and 36 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Wednesday, December 6, 2023, at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
