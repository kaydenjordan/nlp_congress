 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of my amendment,  and I urge all colleagues to support its inclusion in the farm bill  today.   Mr. Chairman, the amendment is simple. It ends eligibility for the  Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program for convicted rapists,  murderers, and those guilty of sexual exploitation.   The 2014 farm bill contained a prohibition for these individuals from  being eligible for SNAP, but the individual also has to be considered a  fleeing felon. This means that, in order to lose eligibility, the  person has to not only be a convicted murderer, rapist, et cetera, but  they also must be in violation of the terms of their sentence.   Mr. Chairman, I believe we should not have to wait before a criminal  who has already been convicted of these acts violates the terms of  their sentence before terminating the benefits.   Mr. Chairman, this amendment would eliminate the fleeing felon  provision from the underlying law and thereby prohibits convicted  rapists, pedophiles, murderers, et cetera, from being eligible for  SNAP.   This is a commonsense proposal that says if you commit these  atrocious crimes that you are ineligible for this government program.   Mr. Chairman, I urge all of my colleagues to vote for this  commonsense amendment and include it in the farm bill that we have  under consideration.   I yield back the balance of my time.
