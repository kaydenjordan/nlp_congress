 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I want to briefly add my personal thanks  to the Senators from Wyoming and Pennsylvania, who just spoke. Their  work on getting this bipartisan solution to the Perkins CTE  reauthorization is nothing short of admirable. I have worked with the  Senator from Florida, Mr. Rubio, for 7 years on an education  demonstration program called the American Dream Accounts. Both of these  terrific Senators were gracious in including it in this bill.   This is a bill that is going to make possible programs all over this  country that will smooth and clear the pathway toward meaningful  employment for young Americans. I wish more people knew about this kind  of work, this kind of effort that these two Senators have made to move  forward the sort of bipartisan, responsible solutions to the real  problems facing Americans, which we need, and I just wanted to take one  moment and thank them both for their tireless work to achieve this good  result today.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
