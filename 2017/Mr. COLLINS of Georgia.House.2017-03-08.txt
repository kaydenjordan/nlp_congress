 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in gratitude--yes,  gratitude--for the opportunity that we have to serve the American  people and by beginning the process of repealing and replacing  ObamaCare.   As Republicans, we understand that even $1 trillion in new taxes--as  the Affordable Care Act dropped on our friends and families--cannot  save a healthcare system that is based on government interference and  overreach. We as conservatives defend compassion, fairness, and  freedom. These values are mutually inclusive, and I submit the American  Health Care Act is a case study in their application.   As insurance markets contract and healthcare options for Americans  evaporate across the country, Medicaid continues to give more Federal  dollars toward able-bodied Americans than toward the elderly and  disabled neighbors that the program was designed to help.   ObamaCare has ushered in a brave new world of diminished health care  and skyrocketing costs, and we cannot let these directives stand.  Republicans are protecting our most vulnerable neighbors by putting  conservative principles back in place. Limiting government, thoughtful  budgets for Federal programs, free markets, and choices are the best  medicine we have to bring relief to struggling Americans, and we are  here to deliver.                            ____________________
