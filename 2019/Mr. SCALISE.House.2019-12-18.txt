 Madam Speaker, I raise a point of order.    Madam Speaker, I raise this point of order for failure  to disclose the waiver of clause 2(j)(1) of rule XI, pursuant to clause  6(g) of rule XIII, which requires the Rules Committee to specify in  their report any waiver of a point of order against a measure under  consideration.   Madam Speaker, this underlying resolution violates clause 2(j)(1) of  rule XI, which entitles the minority of the committee to have the  ability to call witnesses to testify during at least one day of a  hearing on any given measure. This was not afforded to the Committee on  the Judiciary minority members during consideration of the Articles of  Impeachment, despite numerous requests by a majority of the minority  members.   Therefore, I raise a point of order against consideration of the rule  and the underlying resolution for the violation of minority rights and  the denial of this evidence to be put into the Record and for this  hearing, which the House rules require, which was not complied with and  was denied.   Madam Speaker, I urge the enforcement of this rule.    Madam Speaker, impeaching a President of the United  States. This isn't about some solemn duty tonight. Let's talk about  what this is really about.   This has been about a political vendetta, a political vendetta that  didn't just start with the Zelensky call. It started long before that.   Just listen to some of the quotes from Democrats in this Chamber:   Speaker Pelosi: It's been going on for 22 months, 2\1/2\ years,  actually. We cannot accept a second term for Donald Trump. What's more  serious is that he can't win.   This isn't about some crime that was committed. It is about fear that  he might win reelection.   That is not why you impeach a President.                                time  1915    Al Green: ``I'm concerned that if we don't impeach this President, he  will get reelected.''   The list goes on, Madam Speaker. In fact, there are some quotes that  I can't even read on this House floor that some of our colleagues made.   And keep in mind, more than 100 Democrats on this House floor voted  to impeach this President before the Zelensky phone call.   Just look at some of these Articles of Impeachment they voted for 2  years ago:   Fifty-eight Democrats voted to impeach the President over comments he  made about NFL players kneeling for the Pledge of Allegiance. Over 50  Democrats voted to impeach him for that.   Just this summer, over 90 Democrats voted to impeach the President  for comments he made about The Squad. So he makes comments about some  other Members of Congress who make a lot of comments about him, and 95  Members vote to impeach the President of the United States.   This is a political vendetta. It has nothing to do with a crime  committed. There was no crime.   And why don't we listen to some of the witnesses? Obviously, we  weren't able to call all the witnesses we wanted, but there were  witnesses. In fact, Gordon Sondland, U.S. Ambassador to the European  Union, he is mentioned over 600 times in the Schiff report. He was  their star witness.   And what did he say when asked: ``Did President Trump ever tell you  personally about any preconditions for anything?''   His answer: ``No.''   ``Any preconditions for the aid to be released?''   ``No.''   ``Any preconditions for a White House meeting?''   Under oath, he testified: ``No.''   Abuse of power, let's talk about that Article of Impeachment, Madam  Speaker.   George Washington Law Professor Turley, who admitted under oath that  he voted against Donald Trump, spoke to this claim of abuse of power.  In fact, he said: ``If you make a high crime and misdemeanor out of  going to the courts, it is an abuse of power; it is your abuse of  power.''   You are doing precisely what you are criticizing the President of  doing, abuse of power.   There is a House rule, Madam Speaker, that requires--not allows, but  requires--that the minority get a day of hearing, which we asked for  multiple times. They broke this rule. They didn't allow us to have a  minority day of hearing. They didn't want to hear the facts about this  case because it was never about the facts because there was no crime.  It is about a personal political vendetta.   Now let's talk about obstruction of Congress, as they make up these  terms to impeach a President because they didn't find a crime, and they  were looking. It has been an impeachment in search of a crime.   But they talk about obstruction of Congress in saying the President  defied subpoenas, subpoena after subpoena. Let's go through the  Departments.   The Department of State they subpoenaed. Do you know that, literally,  just 4 days after the subpoena, the Secretary of State, himself,  responded to their subpoena?   The Department of Defense, a week later responded to the subpoena.   The Department of Energy responded to the subpoena.   We can go on and on with all of these agencies.   That is an abuse of power, that is an obstruction of Congress,  responding to your subpoena?   That is what they did: They responded.   You might not have liked the answer, but that is not the way this  works. You don't impeach a President because you don't like his foreign  policy, as so many of those foreign policy experts came and testified.   But this isn't just about Donald Trump. They don't just hate Donald  Trump, Madam Speaker. They hate the 63 million Americans who voted for  this President, the forgotten men and women of this country who have  been left behind, Madam Speaker. Madam Speaker, it is those forgotten  men and women of this country that Washington had left behind.   And what is this President doing for them? He is delivering for them:  600 jobs in Pennsylvania; 1,000 jobs, workers in Mingo Junction, Ohio;  $750 million investment for 600 new jobs across this country; The  Detroit News; Chrysler, 6,500 new jobs. That is what this President is  doing to deliver for those men and women of this country who have been  left behind.   It is about time somebody stands up for Americans, and President  Trump is.   So it is a political vendetta.   But if they are going to go through with this, Madam Speaker,  impeachment will not just be a stain on this Democrat majority; the  impeachment will be their legacy.
