 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about  a national problem that has continued for years; that is the rise in  student loan debt. Over 40 million borrowers hold outstanding student  loan balances that exceed $1.7 trillion. The average borrower holds  about $39,000 in student debt.   This is unacceptable. We hear talk about pie-in-the-sky policies,  like debt forgiveness, that come maybe from the other side of this  Capitol or Chamber, what we call the U.S. Senate. These are not just  pie-in-the-sky proposals; they are BS. They are not going to happen. It  is time that Members of this body talk about the solutions that all of  us here helped implement. We actually addressed the student debt issue.   It is through legislation I led with my colleague, Congressman Scott  Peters of California, that was signed into law by President Trump last  year, that would allow employers to make tax-free student loan payments  of up to $5,250 per year to each employee who holds an eligible student  loan, lowering payroll taxes both for employers and the employees.   This public-private partnership model makes student loan payments  eligible for employer-sponsored educational assistance programs, just  like tuition assistance has been for years.   In fact, my good friends at Chegg--and I have got four public  universities in my district, four private universities in my district,  and a handful of community colleges in my district--every one of those  students, like my three kids who are in college right now and grad  school, knows what Chegg is. That is where they are getting their  books. It is a cost-effective, private-sector approach to lower the  cost of textbooks for kids nationwide.   Well, the people of Chegg know how important student debt is, because  they have actually paid back over a million dollars in student debt for  their employees. They have actually taken advantage of this program  that we all passed in a bipartisan way to address this $1.7 trillion  problem.   Every employer out there should do what Chegg has done and take  advantage of the tax provisions that are in place and were put in place  by Republicans and Democrats and signed into law by President Trump.  Let's make sure that you use this as an effective recruitment tool and  retention tool in this economy.   Mr. Speaker, I am asking my colleagues to help get the word out to  our employers across this great country to use what is already  available to them and their employees who have student debt. They can  use this student loan debt benefit to help recruit more workers. They  can use it to retain more talent. They can use it to give their  employees financial freedom and make a real difference in their lives  by reducing their student debt and by reducing the $1.7 trillion in  debt that we have in this country, which outnumbers all auto and credit  card debt combined.   Help the employees. Help America. Let's get this economy back on  track.                            ____________________
