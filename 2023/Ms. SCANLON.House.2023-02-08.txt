 Mr. Speaker, last week was National Gun Violence  Survivors Week, when we reflect on the toll that gun violence takes on  all of us.   It is disgraceful enough that our Republican colleagues are unwilling  to confront gun violence as the leading cause of death among American  children, but last week, several Members of this body chose to mock the  somber week by wearing assault rifle pins.   Those Members paraded through the Halls of Congress and on this  floor, celebrating the weapon of choice for military combatants, mass  murderers, and those who have fetishized the Second Amendment.   This shameless gesture was received loud and clear by Americans,  including  [[Page H743]]  a mother in my district who recently lost her son to gun violence.   She called my office after seeing those Members, distraught by their  casual cruelty and their dangerous promotion of violence.   I rise today as the voice in Congress for that brokenhearted mother  to make this very clear: House Democrats are united in the fight to end  senseless gun violence. We want to advance real solutions, and we will  always stand up to extremist behavior that threatens the safety of our  communities.                                time  1015        Recognizing Betsy Walls, Public Health Emergency Preparedness                                Trailblazer     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a constituent  whose decades of public health service have made our community  stronger.   Betsy Walls is being recognized by the CDC and Prevention as a public  health emergency preparedness trailblazer from Pennsylvania. She is one  of 48 Americans being recognized for their tireless work to protect our  communities from a range of public health threats.   Betsy's distinguished career in serving her community includes  serving as a flight nurse for the Pennsylvania Air National Guard,  where she retired as a lieutenant colonel; she spent 30 years at  Delaware County Memorial Hospital, first as a staff nurse, then a head  nurse, then an evening supervisor, and, finally, as director of staff  education; and she served as director of personal health at the Chester  County Health Department for 18 years.   Betsy's commitment to ensuring our community is ready and able to  respond to disasters has touched thousands of lives. Our community owes  Betsy Walls an enormous debt of gratitude for the strong foundation she  has built to keep our communities strong and healthy for years to come.     Recognizing Philadelphia Eagles Changemaker Award Winner, Dr. Ruth                                   Abaya     The Philadelphia Eagles are headed to the Super Bowl  this weekend, and I want to recognize the team's 2022 Inspire Change  Changemaker Award winner, Dr. Ruth Abaya, an emergency physician at  Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and a scholar of the hospital's  Center for Violence Prevention.   As our country works to tackle gun violence, Dr. Abaya is on the  front lines, treating this issue like the public health crisis that it  is.   In her role as program manager for the Injury Prevention Program at  Philadelphia's Department of Health, she is helping to identify the  most promising practices for violence prevention and intervention for  young people in our region.   A public health approach to gun violence requires a comprehensive,  multifaceted response driven by research and data. It means a focus on  prevention, in addition to treatment. Dr. Abaya's work is moving us  toward the solutions we need to face this crisis head-on and give our  children brighter futures.   I am grateful for Dr. Abaya's dedication to making our community a  safer place for everyone and to the Philadelphia Eagles for their  support for her program.   This weekend, go Birds.                            ____________________
