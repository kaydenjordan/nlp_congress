 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and also for  his tremendous leadership on the Ways and Means Committee and for  really telling the truth.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this bill, H.R. 1, which  really is a tax scam. Republicans are really trying to pull a fast one  on the American people.   This bill would steal from the hard-earned paychecks of millions of  middle-income families to line the pockets of billionaires and  corporations. In fact, 80 percent of the tax breaks would go to the top  1 percent. It also eliminates student loan deductions and eradicates  medical expense deductions.   If this isn't cruel enough, this bill makes it easier for  corporations to ship jobs overseas, so people will actually lose their  jobs. This tax plan does nothing to create better jobs or better wages  or a better future for the middle class. It does just the opposite.   In my home State of California, one in five middle-income families  will see a tax hike next year. The State and local tax deduction would  be particularly hard on my State, where 6.1 million households will see  a tax increase.   Public sector jobs, like firefighters, will lose their jobs, not to  mention the vital services our most vulnerable will need. These will be  cut.   This bill really is a disgrace. Stealing from families who need help  the most to give more to donors--millionaires and billionaires and  corporations--this is really a new low.   Thirty-six million middle-income households, working families, will  pay more in taxes.   We can't forget, also, that this tax scam sets the stage, really, for  a heartless $1.5 trillion cut to Medicare and Medicaid, as we saw in  the Republican budget.   We need to reject this mean-spirited tax scam and vote ``no'' and  then come back and look at how we can support middle-income families,  working families, so everyone has a chance and an opportunity at the  American Dream.
