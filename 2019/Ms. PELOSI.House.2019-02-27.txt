 Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding and I  thank him for his leadership as chair of the Judiciary Committee, for  bringing us to this place promptly. It is an historic day in the  Congress of the United States.   Mr. Chairman, I thank our distinguished colleague from California,  Mr.   Mike Thompson, for his relentless, persistent leadership to make  America safer by bringing forth commonsense background check  legislation. He is a gun owner and a veteran. He has been on both sides  of the gun. He is a hunter. He is an advocate for the Second Amendment.  And, as he said, if this had anything to diminish that, he would not  have his name on it.   Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this strong, bipartisan bill and  join Mr. Thompson in commending Mr. King of New York for making this  initiative bipartisan from the start, in the previous Congress and now.  It is a long, overdue commonsense action to end the epidemic of gun  violence in America.   Let us salute, again, the persistent leadership of so many in this  body. And, again, Mr. Thompson, as chair of the Gun Violence Prevention  Task Force; he has worked in a bipartisan way to protect our  communities, and we are grateful to him for that.   We can do all the inside maneuvering that we want, and that is really  important and essential, but, without the outside mobilization, we  cannot enjoy the success of saving lives and making progress. So I want  to thank the courageous advocates who are here today, in the gallery,  including March for Our Lives and Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in  America, and so many more. They have made a complete difference.   As President Lincoln said: ``Public sentiment is everything. With it  you can accomplish almost anything, without it almost nothing.''   I thank them for building public sentiment to a point where now about  90 percent of the American people support commonsense background check  legislation, including many members, courageously, of the National  Rifle Association.   This bill is proudly bipartisan because gun violence prevention  should not be a Democratic or Republican issue. Gun violence does not  discriminate by party or politics. It reaches into all of our  communities, our schools, our places of worship, our workplaces, and  our streets, and it will require all of our courage to defeat it.    Last night, we were at an occasion to mark the 25th anniversary of  the Brady Bill. Some of us were in Congress at that time. Many of us  here, then or not, admire the courageous work of Sarah and Jim Brady to  make the country a safer place by reducing gun violence.   Twenty-five years ago, we enacted the Brady background check system,  which has denied more than 3 million sales to potentially dangerous  individuals. Yet, the Brady Bill does not stop people from purchasing  guns from unlicensed sellers without a background check at gun shows  and online.   We must pass H.R. 8 to close this dangerous loophole and keep our  communities safe from gun violence. That is what we are intending to do  today.  [[Page H2247]]    George Bernard Shaw said that: ``It is the mark of a truly  intelligent person to be moved by statistics,'' and here are the facts:   Nearly 40,000 lives are cut short every year from gun violence.   An average of 47 children and teenagers are killed by guns every  single day. As I said, it is all about the children, the children, the  children.   We read about the tragic mass murders that have happened in our  country, and they stir us to action, hopefully. Here it has been they  stir us to a moment of silence, and now, finally, to action.                                time  1300    But it is every day. Every day 47 children and teenagers killed by  guns.   And, again, another figure, hearkening back to 90 percent of the  American people want commonsense universal background checks.   The statistics spell out the stories, but it is the human personal  stories that change minds.   How moving it was to hear our colleague, Congresswoman McBath, with  her generosity of spirit tell her personal story of losing her son,  Jordan--I can't even imagine carrying that burden--but turning her  grief and her tragedy into action and courage to run for Congress, to  stand on this floor and share her personal story with us. That takes  real courage.   Let's hope that we all have the courage to save children's lives,  everyone's lives in our country whose deaths can be avoided.   There is no person in this body whose political survival is more  important than the survival of our children.   We are grateful, again, to the young people, parents, survivors  across America who have told their stories, marched for their lives,  and demanded change. This bill delivers that change, ensuring that  people who are a danger to themselves and others cannot purchase a gun  and perpetuate violence in our communities.   This week, the House will build on this progress by passing another  bipartisan background check bill. We must close the Charleston loophole  that enabled the horrific hate crime at Emanuel African Methodist  Episcopal Church.   We salute the majority whip, Mr. Clyburn, for his leadership on H.R.  1112.   Tomorrow, we will vote on that. That is another part of strengthening  the background check provisions.   As Members of Congress, again, we take an oath to protect and defend  the Constitution, the American people. To honor that oath, to honor the  victims of gun violence and their families, Congress must take real  action on this floor. Today, we must pass this bill and take the first  steps toward ending the senseless crisis of gun violence in our Nation.   Again, I hope that all of us will have the courage to save lives,  remembering that no one's political survival here is more important  than the survival of the American people--especially our children.   I urge a strong bipartisan ``yes'' vote and pray that we can do the  right thing and send a clear message to the families of those who have  lost their loved ones to gun violence, that we have crossed a threshold  here today to reduce gun violence in our country and take more steps to  improve the safety of the American people, honoring the Constitution of  the United States, respectful of our hunters and the need for people to  defend themselves, but doing so in a way that does not endanger others.
