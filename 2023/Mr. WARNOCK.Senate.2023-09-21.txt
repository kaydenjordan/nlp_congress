 Mr. President, today I would like to recognize September  as National Recovery Month, a time for us to honor our Nation's  recovery community. This community includes  [[Page S4650]]  those who are battling addiction and the service providers who are  dedicated to supporting them.   On this occasion, I want to extend my appreciation to Georgia's Cobb  County DUI Court, which celebrated its 15th anniversary and 48th  commencement ceremony on September 19, 2023. Founded in 2008 by the  Honorable Melodie H. Clayton and now presided over by the Honorable  Eric A. Brewton, this court plays an important role in supporting  individuals as they work towards sobriety.   Since its implementation, the program has admitted over 700  participants and graduated over 519 individuals. The program's  achievements have been recognized by Georgia's Council of  Accountability Court Judges. The dedication of the Cobb County DUI  Court team has been instrumental in establishing alternatives to  incarceration and providing support to individuals, their families, and  the entire community.   There is no greater way to celebrate National Recovery Month than by  acknowledging the hard work of recovery professionals and participants  as they celebrate 15 years of success.                            ____________________
