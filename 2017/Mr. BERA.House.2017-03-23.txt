 Mr. Speaker, I stand here not as a Member of the Congress,  but as a doctor. And as a doctor, health care is about taking care of  patients.   That is why the bill that might come before us is a bad bill. It  raises the cost of care for many people. It makes millions of folks  lose their health insurance. It raises the cost on elderly patients.  There is an age tax in there.   This is a bad bill. Let's go back to the drawing board. Let's come  together as Democrats and Republicans, and  [[Page H2364]]  let's make sure health care is available and affordable for every  American.   I don't want to go back to the days where I would see a patient who  may have cancer and I couldn't take care of them because they didn't  have that healthcare coverage.   Let's go back to the drawing board. This is a bad bill. You guys know  it is a bad bill. Let's do this, and let's come up with a better bill.                            ____________________
