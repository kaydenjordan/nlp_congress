 Madam Speaker, I rise as a former letter carrier in  support of H.R. 8015, to prevent the dangerous budget and service cuts  proposed by Postmaster General DeJoy.   The Postmaster General claims he has not taken any steps to limit  overtime for postal employees. His statement is hollow, because  internal Postal Service documents show how policy changes prohibit  ``extra'' or ``late'' trips, which means you finish delivering the mail  in your bag that day, and they mandate that carriers ``return on  time,'' which means they can't finish the job.   In normal times, the Postal Service is crucial, but during a  pandemic, on-time and efficient mail delivery is a matter of life and  death.   Today's legislation will not just protect the Postal Service, but,  given that people's homes are now polling places, the service protects  the very essence of our democracy.   Don't mess with USPS.
