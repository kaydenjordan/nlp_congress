 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 2021  recipients of the Greater Hall Chamber of Commerce's annual  agribusiness awards.   The Greater Hall Chamber of Commerce comes together each year to  recognize and celebrate the contribution of agriculture in our everyday  lives. We were blessed to be hosted by the Echols family at Jaemor  Farms this year.   The Farmer of the Year award went to Mr. Scott Glover of Glo-Crest  Dairy and Mountain Fresh Creamery. In fact, I recently had the  privilege to tour Mr. Glover's farm, and it was indeed an impressive  operation.   The Friend of Agriculture award was given to the Hall County School  District's Agri-Business Center for their agriculture programs and the  related education they provide to their students.   Cargill, Incorporated, was awarded the Outstanding Agribusiness award  for its generous donations of nearly $100,000 in the past number of  years.   Additionally, Mr. Phil Hulsey was inducted into the Hall County  Agriculture Hall of Fame for his incredible lifetime contributions as a  dairyman.   Agriculture is the leading industry in Georgia, bringing in about $73  billion annually. I thank the Greater Hall Chamber of Commerce for  allowing me the opportunity to join them in honoring agricultural  leaders in Hall County, Georgia.   Madam Speaker, I congratulate this year's winners on their  achievements in the agriculture industry.                            ____________________
