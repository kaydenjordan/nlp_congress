 Resolving casework is one of the most important services  provided by our offices.   I was shocked to learn that my predecessor left behind numerous  unresolved cases--but, in retrospect, perhaps I shouldn't be so  critical. Maybe the simple reason is they were unable to solve  constituent issues because he and his staff were hampered by the fact  that agency personnel, were either unavailable, or, those who were,  simply didn't have the resources available for them to process  requests. Why? Because they are working from home.   Our functional system of government, how we get things done, was  built to support a government workforce where our people come into an  office, work together, in one place, face to face.   Around that infrastructure, we have businesses (or perhaps I should  say we had businesses) that were built to support that workforce--small  businesses, such as coffee shops, restaurants, dry cleaners, etc.   Most industries, who instituted telework policies during the pandemic  have returned or have begun to return to their respective workplaces.  And like the government, those businesses were designed around an in- office workforce.   This bill does not eliminate telework; it simply returns the  workforce to the policies that were in place in 2019.   And perhaps, with the report, that this bill requests from the OPM,  there is a good chance some agencies will show that telework or other  arrangements make sense.   Fine.   But as of today; we the oversight body, do not have that data.   Let's reset--analyze where we've been and then move forward.   Mr. Speaker, I support H.R.139.    Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to honor Mr. Christopher  Marian Ballaban, a constituent, war hero, and Holocaust survivor in New  York's Third Congressional District.   Last Saturday, on January 28, Mr. Ballaban reached his centennial,  and I would like to enter into the Congressional Record this token of  my appreciation for his long and heroic journey.   Christopher was born in Poland and joined the Polish resistance  against the Soviets at the young age of 16. Throughout his entire life,  he was held in multiple slave camps throughout Europe.   After escaping the final camp, Christopher eventually joined the  British Army and fought against Nazis in Germany and other enemy  forces.   Finally, in the early 1950s, he found his way home to the United  States. I could not be more honored to have a man of such valor  residing in the district that I represent.   Let this serve as a public declaration of respect and admiration for  Mr. Ballaban and his amazing family. I would like to extend the  happiest of birthdays to Christopher, and I hope that our paths cross  soon.                            ____________________
