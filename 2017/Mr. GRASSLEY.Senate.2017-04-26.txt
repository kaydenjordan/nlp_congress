 Mr. President, on April 26 of each year, we celebrate  World Intellectual Property Day and recognize the important role of  intellectual property rights in the fabric of our society. This year,  we take time to recognize the innovators and creators who are making  our lives healthier, safer, and more productive through their ingenuity  and the robust system of intellectual property protections enshrined in  our laws.   The Founding Fathers recognized the value of intellectual property,  empowering Congress ``to promote the progress of science and useful  arts, by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the  exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries.''   Placing this authority within Congress's enumerated powers  underscores the weight that our Founding Fathers placed on intellectual  property's value to the budding Nation as a means of fostering economic  development and growth. Our success as a nation in agriculture,  manufacturing, technology, and medicine shares a common thread of  intellectual property rights.   True to their predictions, our system of intellectual property has  fostered innovation and ensured America's role as an economic engine of  inventions that have made us healthier, safer, and more secure.   Our system of intellectual property rights has evolved since the  ratification of the Constitution and the passage of the Copyright Act  of 1790, but its core mission of promoting innovation has remained  constant.   Our innovators and creators rely on IP protections such as patents,  trademarks, copyrights, and trade secrets to help drive and recoup  their investments of ingenuity.   Of course, the innovation that intellectual property helps encourage  benefits society more broadly as well. It drives enormous economic  activity and development, helping assure America's place as an economic  and intellectual beacon to the world. As the U.S. Chamber's Global  Intellectual Property Center recently pointed out, IP-intensive  industries employ over 40 million Americans, accounting for 34.8  percent of total U.S. gross domestic product.   Iowans have long held intellectual property as an integral part of  our economy. Our commitment to growth and innovation has led to $11.2  billion in annual IP-related exports from the State, more than 667,000  IP-related jobs, and 19.9 percent higher wages for direct IP workers  than non-IP workers.   As a society, we depend on innovators to make our lives better and to  solve the challenges we face. These innovators, in turn, depend on  different forms of intellectual property.   The Judiciary Committee will continue to play an important role in  protecting intellectual property and we will continue to work to  advance innovation. This week, Senator Leahy and I reintroduced the  Patents for Humanity Program Improvement Act to encourage and reward  companies that innovate and use patented technology to  [[Page S2549]]  address humanitarian needs. This legislation improves the incentives  for small businesses to participate in the program, by ensuring that  the prize--a certificate for expedited processing of certain matters at  the USPTO--can be transferable to third parties.   Yesterday, we held a hearing with witnesses from U.S. Immigration and  Customs Enforcement and industry innovators who described the central  role that intellectual property has played in allowing their businesses  to grow and innovate. We also heard about some of the enforcement  challenges that those in IP-intensive industries face as they seek to  protect their intellectual property.   As a cochair of the Congressional Trademark Caucus, which we just  relaunched this week, I recognize the value of trademarks and their  impact on society and the economy, as well as how counterfeiting can  seriously impact consumer health and safety. Counterfeiting of goods  presents a worldwide problem with enormous health and economic impacts,  costing the global economy over 2.5 million jobs per year, while  draining tax revenue and hurting the ability of American companies to  compete in foreign markets.   Similarly, trade secret theft is an increasingly serious problem. A  report by the IP Commission found that annual losses due to trade  secret theft are over $300 billion and is the cause of an estimated  loss of 2.1 million American jobs. That is why we passed into law the  Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016. This important legislation brings  needed uniformity to trade secret law and provides more certainty to  the innovators who rely on trade secrets to develop novel solutions to  important problems that face us as a nation.   Intellectual property is a key driver of innovation and fundamental  building block of our modern economy. This World IP Day, as we  recognize the positive impacts IP has on innovation, let us continue to  find ways to work together to ensure its protection against  infringement and maintain the United States enduring position as the  most innovative and creative country in the world.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I have long been a champion of domestic  biofuel production, including ethanol, biodiesel and cellulosic fuels.  Domestic biodiesel production supports tens of thousands of jobs.  Replacing traditional diesel with biodiesel reduces emissions and  creates cleaner air. Homegrown biodiesel improves our energy security  by diversifying our transportation fuels and reducing our dependence on  foreign oil. Biodiesel itself is a very diverse fuel. It can be  produced from a wide array of resources such as recycled cooking oil,  soybean and other plant oils, and animal fats.   I am proud of the success of the American biodiesel industry, and I  am glad to be introducing today the American Renewable Fuel and Job  Creation Act of 2017, which will ensure the continued success. I  appreciate Senator Cantwell's leadership in joining this effort. I also  appreciate the support of Senators Roberts, Hirono, Blunt, Whitehouse,  Ernst, Heitkamp, Thune, Udall, Heinrich, Shaheen, Klobuchar, Franken,  Donnelly, and Murray. This bill will modify the biodiesel fuel  blender's credit to a domestic production credit starting this year and  extend the credit through 2020.   Congress created the biodiesel tax incentive in 2005 when I was  chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. As a result of this incentive  and the Renewable Fuel Standard, biodiesel is providing significant  benefits to the nation.   Senator Cantwell and I have been advocating the mixture credit be  modified to a producer credit since 2009. Converting to a producer  credit improves the incentive in many ways. The blenders credit can be  difficult to administer because the blending of the fuel can occur at  many different stages of the fuel distribution. This can make it  difficult to ensure that only fuel that qualifies for the credit claims  the incentive. It has been susceptible to abuse because of this.   A credit for domestic production will also ensure that we are  incentivizing the domestic industry and associated American jobs,  rather than subsidizing imported biofuels. A credit for domestic  production will also ensure that we are incentivizing the domestic  industry and associated American jobs, rather than subsidizing imported  biofuels. Since 2014, we have seen imports increase from 510 million  gallons to about 1 billion gallons in 2016, and already in the first  quarter of 2017 imports are 10 percent higher than they were last year  at this time.   We should not provide a U.S. taxpayer benefit to imported biofuels.  By restricting the credit to domestic production, we will also save  taxpayer money. The nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation estimated a  similar amendment adopted in the Finance Committee in 2015 would have  reduced the cost of the extension by $90 million for 2016 alone.   Importantly, modifying the credit will have little to no impact on  the consumer. Much of the credit will continue to be passed on to the  blender and ultimately, the consumer. Additionally, the U.S. biodiesel  industry is currently operating at approximately 65 percent of  capacity, which does not even account for idled capacity. The fact is,  the domestic biodiesel industry has the capacity and access to  affordable feedstocks to meet the demand of U.S. consumers.   The current biodiesel credit expired at the end of 2016. Adoption of  the American Renewable Fuel and Job Creation Act of 2017 should be  strongly considered as part of tax reform efforts currently underway.  Absent tax reform, Congress should include it as part of any tax  legislation extending expired tax provisions.   Modifying the current blenders credit to a producers credit will  ensure that the credit is doing what Congress intended--incentivizing  investment in domestic biodiesel production and promoting American  jobs. Surely we can agree that we should not be providing a U.S.  taxpayer subsidy to already heavily subsidized foreign biodiesel  imports. I therefore urge my colleagues to support the production of  American biodiesel and this commonsense, cost reduction reform.                                  ______                                         By Mr. CORNYN (for himself and Mr. Peters):   S. 945.

Perkins Career and Technical  Education Act of 2006 to authorize funds to identify and eliminate  excessive occupational licensure; to the Committee on Health,  Education, Labor, and Pensions.
