 Congressman Suozzi, I am grateful for you holding this  Special Order. I am grateful for your friendship in Congress and the  work we do together on many things, but, in particular, on our efforts  to repeal the onerous cap on the SALT deduction.   In 2017, the Trump administration raised taxes for middle-class  families in Illinois and across the country by capping the State and  Local Tax deduction at $10,000.   The decision was both bad policy and bad politics. Capping the SALT  deduction raised the tax burden for Illinois working families and small  business owners.   In the 10th District, my district, 42 percent of families rely on the  SALT deduction. Statewide in Illinois, one in three taxpayers file  using the SALT deduction affected by this cap.   And this deduction is not a tax break on the wealthy. Eighty-five  percent of Illinois filers who take the SALT deduction are middle- income individuals and families.   I have heard from constituents, and some of them want to move out of  Illinois because their taxes are simply too expensive. I see everything  our communities have to offer, from our schools, our parks, our public  places, communities that make a difference and make a great place to  raise family; and it  [[Page H3296]]  breaks my heart that someone would choose not to live in the 10th  District just because of an unfair decision made to increase the tax  burden to punish States like Illinois.   The SALT cap also makes it harder for our cities to provide essential  services, like police departments, fire services, fire protection  services, libraries and public health. These services and the workers  performing them are the backbones of our community. The pandemic has  already strained their budgets, and we do not need to strain them any  further.   Finally, it is no accident which States are most affected by the SALT  cap. These are the States most affected: Illinois, New York, New  Jersey, and California.   These States have made the decision to invest in their communities,  to invest in their people. They have invested in their children, their  schools, their infrastructure. We should not be double-taxed just  because we have decided that we want to continue to pay to make our  communities stronger.   Reinstating the full SALT deduction is a decision about fairness and  responsibility. A Federal tax on income already paid to State and local  governments is, quite simply, double taxation. We have the  responsibility to stand up for our families, our small businesses, and  our communities.                                time  2015    We need a tax system that is fair, lifts our Nation, and gives our  children the future that we all want them to have. It is critical that  we reinstate the full SALT deduction and reduce the tax burden for  middle-class families across the country.    Absolutely. As you know, when the income tax was put  in place more than 100 years ago, it was a decision that communities,  that States that decided to invest in their people, would not be double  taxed.   Yet, in 2017, the decision of the Republicans was to specifically  attack these States, these blue States like Illinois and New York. It  is unfair to these communities that are investing in schools, public  services, fire departments, police departments, making the decision to  responsibly pay for them, and then have their residents told they have  to pay a second time with the Federal tax.   To add on top of that, these are the States, like New York and  Illinois, who pay more to the Federal Government than they get back. So  not only are we getting double taxed, we have a burden of subsidizing  the States that are attacking us now.   So this is absolutely unfair. It is unfair to the States. But, more  importantly, it is unfair to the families we represent.
