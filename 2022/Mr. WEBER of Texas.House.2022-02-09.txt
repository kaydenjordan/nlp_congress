 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the life  of the First Lady of Bee Cave, Texas, and former First Lady of La  Marque, Texas, Patricia Ann LeMay Hocking.   Patti, as she was affectionately known, was a fascinating woman with  a colorful background. From an early age, Patti loved ballet. Patti  took ballet lessons with the Houston Ballet Foundation. Patti worked  hard in pursuit of that goal, and eventually, she danced professionally  with the Houston Ballet Company.   Patti graduated from Incarnate Word Academy in downtown Houston,  married Mr. Robert Ellis Hocking--Bobby Hocking--and they settled in  Bee Cave, Texas, where she built, owned, and ran her first of two dance  studios.   After Bee Cave was incorporated in 1987, Bobby Hocking was elected  the town's very first mayor. Patti was always by his side as his  biggest fan and supporter. They traveled together internationally when  Bobby was lead singer in many bands, then as a gospel singer and  evangelist. It was Patti's prayers and influence that brought Bobby  back to his roots, and they spent many years in the ministry,  [[Page H1078]]  copastoring churches in Oklahoma and Texas.   Most recently, the city of La Marque was the beneficiary of her  generous spirit and gift of public service. Patti was devoted to and  passionate about her faith, her family, and her community. A gracious,  giving, and loving woman, Patti was adored by all who met her.   Mr. Speaker, First Lady Hocking will be sorely missed, and I send  Bobby our love.                            ____________________
