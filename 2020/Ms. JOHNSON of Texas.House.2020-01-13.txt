 Madam Speaker, today, I rise in support of H.R.  4302, the Homeless Assistance Act of 2019, which authorizes Public  Housing Agencies to disclose relevant client information to local  government entities and nonprofits. This legislation will enable  communities to better facilitate housing and services for individuals  and families experiencing homelessness, and it will also require these  agencies to prioritize suitable privacy measures for their clients.   This bill will address the challenge of coordination with local  entities who provide housing and unique services to individuals and  families experiencing homelessness. The Federal Privacy Act limits the  ability of Public Housing  [[Page H188]]  Agencies to share critical and timely information with their community  partners, thus creating an unnecessary barrier for individuals seeking  assistance by requiring them to resubmit the same information and  paperwork to multiple entities.   The Homeless Assistance Act will allow agencies to share relevant  client data with local government entities and nonprofits, solely for  the purpose of expediting the identification, assessment, and linkage  of individuals experiencing homelessness to housing and supportive  services.   As founder and co-chair of the Congressional Homelessness Caucus, I  am proud to support the advancement of resources and capabilities  needed to address housing insecurity and access to affordable housing  in our communities.
