 Mr. President, in honor of the parents--and so many  others--of Senator Capito, I thank her for her empathetic,  compassionate remarks. We all have had friends and family who have  suffered, and her remarks are really appropriate.   So thank you for that.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote take place  immediately after my remarks.    Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent that Senator  Ossoff of Georgia be added as a cosponsor of S. 3076, a bill to amend  the Federal Reserve Act.    Mr. President, not a unanimous consent request, but I note  that joining me on the floor today is Ben Ashman, for whom we have  given consent to be on the floor as a Senate fellow in our office for  the year.    I ask for the yeas and nays.
