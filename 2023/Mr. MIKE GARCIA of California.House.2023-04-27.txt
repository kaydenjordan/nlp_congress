 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today because all  levels of government need to do a better job of getting taxpayer  dollars to the classrooms and teachers instead of bureaucrats in  Washington, D.C., and the capitals of our respective States.   From Washington, D.C., to Sacramento to county governments, far too  much educational money is squandered on administrators and central  planning bureaucracies.   I see a path, Mr. Speaker, to paying our teachers up to 12 percent  more without spending an additional dollar from current Federal or  State budgets.   This week, I am introducing a bill that I hope eases the pain for  teachers and students in the classroom. My Cash to Classrooms Act will  ensure States are not allowed to use a backward, regressive formula for  school funding called average daily allowance, or ADA.   In California, statewide data for the 2021-2022 school year shows an  ADA-to-enrollment ratio of 91.4 percent. That means that 8.6 percent of  what should be the average school's budget is withheld because of  absentee rates at the State level.   That is an 8.6 percent reduction to their full funding because of a  metric that, frankly, the schools and teachers can't control. The  teachers and principals largely can't control who comes to school on a  given day.   In many cases, the students and parents themselves can't control when  they come to school. In California, there was a waiver that allowed  schools to be fully funded despite absences because of COVID, but that  waiver itself is now gone.   Also in California, many schools still today require students to stay  home if they test positive for COVID, regardless of the symptoms. So,  students aren't allowed to come to school, but the schools are forced  to eat the costs.   I have heard from parents in Lancaster, California, and Palmdale,  California, in my district, that they actually won't let their kids  walk to school on certain days because they would have to walk there  alone. The neighborhoods aren't safe enough for them to do so, and  there are not enough busing options for them. So, on the days when the  parents are unable to drive their kids to school, they keep them home.   Again, this is not within the control of the schools or teachers, so  we can't blame the parents or the teachers or the students for any of  this. That is a policy failure on the part of Sacramento.   Part of this is making sure that we keep our communities safe and  give our communities busing options. However, again, schools pay the  price when kids don't show up for school.   In reality, this average daily attendance policy is actually very  regressive. It is particularly regressive for disadvantaged groups. It  hurts the underfunded districts, the poorer neighborhoods, and the  schools with higher percentages of minorities the most. These are the  schools that need the funding the most, the schools that have the  highest ratios of students to teachers, and the schools that have the  toughest challenges with recruiting and retaining teachers in the  classroom. These are especially the districts that can't afford to pay  for the buses and additional costs to adequately provide for special ed  children.   These poor teachers and principals are calling parents nonstop after  school to try to get their kids to come back to school. They do so many  times on their own dime and their own time, and some schools have even  gone so far as to put extra people on the payroll for the sole purpose  of ensuring accurate attendance counts, not for the student's sake but  to prevent more money from being lost from the capitals. This, in turn,  pulls even more resources and funding that could be used for teacher  pay or class enrichment.   Schools are having attendance competitions in the classrooms now. I  have seen it firsthand at my own child's school. Having attendance  competitions as a teacher is like having passengers have an on-time  departure competition on a commercial airline. You can root for an on- time departure as a passenger, Mr. Speaker, but, in reality, you have  no say whether the flight takes off on time.   Teachers and principals can root for higher attendance rates, but the  reality is that they can't really control it. Yet, they pay for it when  there are absences.    Mr. Speaker, if you want better quality teachers and more of them,  don't defund school budgets because of attendance. This is actually an  evil practice.   Only seven States, including my State of California, unfortunately,  utilize this average daily attendance, or ADA, method. There is a  reason why 85 percent of the States don't do this. It is because it  aggravates the problems of attendance in our public schools and because  it doesn't make sense.   Let's pay our teachers more, not less. Let's get more resources into  the classroom, not fewer. Let's not let bureaucratic agencies pocket  the cash on underruns that are created as a result of absentees in the  classroom.   In my district alone, local schools are getting only about 90 percent  of their funding because of this archaic way of funding schools. We can  give the teachers a 10 percent pay raise with that money if we didn't  fund schools this way. This would actually attract more talent and a  better quality workforce and keep that talent in the classrooms longer.  [[Page H2073]]    Here is another lever, Mr. Speaker. Administrators at the Department  of Education here in Washington, D.C., on average make two times more  than teachers in classrooms in California. The administrators here--the  bureaucrats in D.C. within the Department of Education--make $120,000,  on average, every year.   Let's pay the bureaucrats less and the teachers more.   Mr. Speaker, I am committed to ensuring money is spent at the lowest  levels of government. One dollar spent from the Federal Government  behaves like 15 cents by the time it gets to the classroom.   Let's download the funds to the local districts, get it out of the  State bureaucrats and the D.C. bureaucrats, and let's ensure the States  fully fund their schools despite attendance rates.                                time  1700                   Celebrating Bishop Hearns 90th Birthday     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a  community giant and historic leader of the Antelope Valley who is  celebrating his 90th birthday this week, Bishop Hearns, Sr. of  Lancaster, California.   Bishop Hearns came from humble beginnings, growing up as a  sharecropper in Mississippi. Driven by the desire to serve, he went on  to fight for our Nation overseas in Korea in the U.S. Army.   He came home and completed his education to become an engineer. He  then started working at the beloved Air Force base in our district,  Edwards Air Force Base, and had a groundbreaking career there.   Upon his retirement from engineering, Bishop Hearns decided to  continue on his life's path of service by being the first African- American official elected in Lancaster, ultimately becoming mayor.   A multitude of accomplishments for a wonderful and heroic man, and  someone I personally have great respect for in many ways, especially as  a spiritual leader in our communities.   As the Antelope Valley gathers to celebrate Bishop Hearns' life, I  too express my thanks and gratitude for his lifetime of continued  service, leadership, and being a role model for all of us. May his  patriotic and heroic life be a guiding light for all of us.           President Biden Should Negotiate with House Republicans     Mr. Speaker, with a myriad of crises  under the President's current watch, from the border to our national  security and, yes, to our economy and national debt, you would think  that President Biden would be eager to come to the negotiating table  with the House GOP to have the debates about the debt ceiling and have  the conversations about viable solutions that actually get our economy  back on track and ensure that we don't default on our debt later this  year.   However, as we are learning, that is not the case. It turns out he  doesn't seem to want to come for negotiations and sit down at the table  with us with an outlook to get to a solution.   How did we get here, Mr. Speaker?   Let's take a trip down memory lane.   Let me remind you that macroeconomics is like physics with a dollar  sign in front of it. For every action, there is a reaction. For every  input, there is an output.   When you look back, for a number of years up until 2020, you will see  that our Nation's annual operating budget was essentially a flat line.  It was about $1.3 trillion every year from about 2009 to 2020.   In 2021, the number became $1.4 trillion.   In 2022, the number was $1.5 trillion.   In 2023, this last fiscal year, the number grew to $1.7 trillion.   This year, when the President comes to Congress with his budget  request, we see that he is asking now for $1.9 trillion.   These numbers and figures are depicted in this chart. This line,  instead of being flat and linear, has gone upwards and is parabolic.   Looking at that from the 2020 budget of $1.3 trillion versus what the  President is asking for today, with $1.9 trillion requested, that is a  growth of 46 percent in just 4 years. That doesn't include the $6  trillion of liquidity pumped into the market spaces and various Federal  agencies and State agencies from the American Rescue Plan, the  Inflation Reduction Act, and the bipartisan infrastructure package.  There is still $6 trillion of additional liquidity in addition to these  annual operating budgets in the market space.   Mr. Speaker, this really is an existential conversation that we are  having about the economy right now. The President and the far left have  been walking us into a turning propeller, and we all know that is a bad  thing.   In the House, the majority, just yesterday, passed a good compromise  bill, a fiscally conservative bill that addresses this concerningly  sharp increase in Federal spending while also raising the debt ceiling,  a looming situation we all must address soon before it turns into  another crisis under Joe Biden's watch. The bill effectively allows us  to avoid walking into the turning propeller.   It is called the Limit, Save, Grow Act, and it will actually provide  $4.8 trillion in total savings and cost avoidance.   It will claw back billions of unspent COVID dollars that are still  out there.   It will repeal the additional funding for 87,000 additional IRS  agents.   It will unleash American energy production to lower energy costs for  American families, making us more energy independent.   It will also put a stop to the bad Federal spending habits from the  last 3 years that we have seen here.   This bill looks to reset our annual operating budget to fiscal year  2022, which is not an extreme position. First of all, FY22 was just 6  months ago, and we were operating under those constraints. As you can  see, it is about the midpoint of our funding profile over the last 4  years.   This is a compromise bill. It is a great position to be in for fiscal  conservatives, and it is something that the President should embrace  and come to the table and have negotiations.   Oh, by the way, this bill does protect Social Security and Medicare,  and it does not harm VA benefits, as some have been pushing a narrative  of. This is good for our veterans, good for our economy, and good for  the future of Social Security and Medicare, things that I have been  very vocal about supporting over the last several years.   These false narratives about conservatives threatening Social  Security and Medicare and VA benefits are outright lies. We are working  to actually protect those programs, not jeopardize them.   President Biden has shown little to no interest in coming to the  negotiating table to pass a fiscally responsible bill that addresses  the debt ceiling. As I said at the beginning, there are many crises  that need to be solved at the hand of President Biden. All roads seem  to be leading to the White House when we look at our blizzard of crises  that we are experiencing right now. We can add the debt ceiling that is  imminently looming in front of us to this blizzard of crises.    As the House Republicans bring forth solutions, the President should  work with us and implement these solutions as the President of the  United States. At a minimum, he should be willing to come to the  negotiating table and in good faith have these conversations, making  compromises to get to a solution, just as our Founding Fathers would  want him to.                     Celebrating A New Space Renaissance     Mr. Speaker, just 120 years ago and  after being around for some 300,000 years, mankind figured out how to  fly in our own atmosphere.   Just 2 years ago, we figured out how to fly a helicopter in the  Martian atmosphere.   Last fall, Artemis I completed its historic trip around the Moon, the  farthest flight on a deep-space mission in a machine that is rated for  human occupancy.   Just last week, SpaceX, under the leadership of Elon Musk, launched  the largest rocket and flying vehicle ever flown on this planet.   We are truly in a new space renaissance and a new golden era for the  great American journey, to the Moon and ultimately to Mars and beyond.   For the folks watching at home, if you have been reading the  headlines, you know that Congress has been debating several important  and, frankly, existential topics here recently.   Whether you are reading about the approaching debt limit crisis, our  open borders, the evacuation of Americans  [[Page H2074]]  in Sudan, the increasing aggression from the Chinese Communist Party,  the CCP, or the fentanyl crisis ravaging our hometowns as a result of  the open border policy, it is easy to get the idea that everything is  all doom and gloom in the world today.   Don't get me wrong, I understand, these are very serious issues, and,  of course, issues that Congress needs to be hitting head-on, and our  President needs to be doing the same.   Some in our country have gotten so fixated on pointing the finger at  Americans and our beautiful country and trying to say how bad we are  that they have lost sight of just how exceptional we are and how we  still inspire many in our country and across the globe.   I stood here in this same spot 2 years ago and said:   ``As a Nation, we are thirsty for something to rally behind,  something that unifies us, something that we can all be invested in, be  intrigued by, be impassioned about, and something to be positive about.   ``There isn't a better movement to get behind than our Nation's  modern space program.''   I believe in those words as strongly today as when I said them.   In addition to the accomplishments I mentioned earlier, in the past 2  years, NASA and American companies have launched Artemis I,  supercharging the mission to establish a permanent human presence on  the lunar surface.   We have sent the James Webb Space Telescope to the far side of the  Moon to provide a generational leap in our understanding of the  earliest days of the universe.   SpaceX in the last 2 years has launched 31 payloads.   NASA has recently named the next four humans to go to the Moon. These  four crewmembers were named as the Artemis II crew. Three out of the  four of them are F-18 pilots. One of them is a Canadian. And Miss  Christina Koch, from North Carolina, who is an award-winning astronaut  herself, will keep them all in line, I am sure.   Congratulations to the Artemis II crew. They have worked hard for  this. They are going to represent the American pinnacle of experience  in space over the next several years and represent us well, as they  have in the past.   Mr. Speaker, my point here is twofold: One, despite all of the  discord and fighting by elected officials, when government agencies are  judiciously regulated and supported by Congress and partner with  private entities that hire the best minds our country can offer, we can  still achieve the impossible.   The public-private partnership with NASA and its commercial partners  is working. The international partnerships between NASA and their  counterparts overseas are working.   The second point is that none of this would have been possible  without the 27th Congressional District of California. Ever since  October 14, 1947, when Chuck Yeager freed mankind from the constraints  of the sound barrier, the Antelope Valley has been synonymous with  aerospace innovation. That is why it is known more frequently as the  aerospace valley instead of the Antelope Valley.   We are now not only the home to Edwards Air Force Base, but also to  the Air Force's Plant 42 where the next generation of military  aircraft, like the B-21 and F-35, are developed and built to ensure  that we maintain air dominance over any nation that would challenge us.   We also have the NASA Armstrong Flight Research Center where the X-59  is being developed to bring quiet supersonic flight to our commercial  airways, Mr. Speaker. It is an aircraft that can fly supersonically and  be hardly heard from the ground by the time it is all done. It is a  fantastic development program, making the entire world more accessible  than it has ever been before with commercial supersonic flight.   The aerospace valley is a source of immense pride for myself and my  constituents, just like how our space missions are a source of pride  for the entire Nation.   I say again, as I said 2 years ago, Mr. Speaker: ``Today, we have no  excuses not to be inspired. We in Congress have no excuses to not  support these exceptional programs in earnest and with pride. We have  no choice.''                             Tribute to Veterans     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to share my  appreciation for all the brave men and women who have selflessly served  the Nation in the United States Armed Forces.    America is the greatest Nation on Earth because of the many  generations that have fought to preserve the freedoms and liberties  that we enjoy as Americans.   As a former U.S. Navy aviator, I flew over 30 combat missions during  Operation Iraqi Freedom, and I understand the service and sacrifice  that our Nation's veterans and their families make.   For generations, young men and women have answered our Nation's call  to serve. From the shores of Normandy to the jungles of Vietnam and the  mountains of Afghanistan, our U.S. servicemembers have protected the  beacon of democracy and her allies throughout the world. This is a debt  that we cannot repay well enough.   Over the past year, we have lost members of the Greatest Generation  in my district, including a gentleman by the name of Lou Moore and  another by the name of Richard Manning. I had the honor of meeting  these World War II heroes, these patriots who lived a life of service  to our Nation. May God bless these American heroes.   To all of our Vietnam veterans, thank you and welcome home.   With all that said, we must ensure that we are actually taking better  care of our heroes and our veterans. As a Member of Congress, my top  priority will always be constituent services, and one of the greatest  honors my staff and I have is to have the ability to assist veterans  with Federal agency casework, most often with the Department of  Veterans Affairs. Since just last year, we have assisted over 200  veterans and stand ready to assist many more.   I especially thank two of my staffers, incredible caseworkers, a lady  by the name of Chris Ward and another by the name of Frances Brown.  They are the best constituent caseworkers in the Nation. Chris and  Frances have processed hundreds of incoming requests from our veterans  and participate in various outreach programs throughout our communities  every week so that our office can be as helpful and as accessible to  our veterans as possible. I am proud of all the work that Chris and  Frances have done and continue to do to fight for our veterans.   Chris and Frances have helped veterans get wrongly accumulated debt  canceled to the tune of hundreds of thousands of dollars of debt. We  have ensured that veterans are receiving their benefits, and assisted  veterans in changing their disability rating to match the reality of  their current conditions. Veterans that have served our Nation should  never have to worry about having their basic needs met or their  privileges and rights honored.   A veteran in our community was trying to obtain his 100 percent  service-connected disability for years. After contacting our office,  one of our caseworkers worked with the VA and got the VA to recognize  his unemployability. This deems the veteran 100 percent disabled due to  being unemployable, and therefore pays him as if he is 100 percent  service-connected disabled.                                time  1715    This veteran was swiftly approved, received a back payment of $6,000,  and now receives his annual stipend of $3,600 per month.   This veteran's casework success story is just one of many that come  from our office, and I am super proud of all the work that my team  does.   I say this not to brag about my team, although I am very proud of  them, but instead, I say this to encourage more veterans to reach out.   If it is taking you more than a couple of days, please reach out, and  we can help you accelerate that process, especially with the VA.   Since being elected to Congress, I've cosponsored numerous pieces of  legislation to assist our military families and veterans, including  bipartisan bills to improve VA healthcare accessibility and benefits to  veterans suffering from disabilities related to toxic chemical  exposure, provide veterans with PTSD access to therapy dogs, and create  a global war on terror memorial on the National Mall.   I will continue to work on behalf of our Nation's veterans, through  both  [[Page H2075]]  casework and legislation, to help bring needed assistance and honor to  those that served our country.   God bless all those who have served. You shouldn't have to call your  Member of Congress to get help, but we are honored to help you and  serve you, and we encourage all veterans to reach out if they need the  help. Mr. Speaker, the VA needs to do better for our veterans.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms.  Foxx), a fellow conservative, someone who has been a mentor and a  leader not only in this body but in the classrooms herself, and she is  the chair of the Committee on Education and the Workforce.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Ms. Foxx for  being outspoken on this issue. I come from California. I have seen the  devastating effects it has had on independent contractors; a record  number of Californians are leaving. No one associated with AB 5 should  be allowed to be in charge of the Department of Labor.                     Raising Minimum Pay for the Military     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to voice  support for my bill, the Raising Annual Income of Servicemembers by  Enhancing Minimum Base Pay Act or the RAISE Act, which would provide  our junior enlisted servicemembers a much-needed pay raise to a minimum  of the equivalent of $15 an hour or roughly $31,200 per year.   As a former naval aviator and officer who represents a district that  has an impact on many facets of our military and defense, I've seen  firsthand just how much our Nation has neglected America's secret  weapon, our heroic servicemembers. I stand here today to say that this  ends.   Mr. Speaker, if you look at the chart next to me, this details the  monthly pay that our junior enlisted servicemembers currently make.   Starting out as an E-1 with less than 2 years, you can see a monthly  salary of just $1,695 or roughly $20,340 a year.   That is the equivalent of about $11 an hour when you normalize it for  a 40-hour workweek. Let that sink in: $11 an hour for someone putting  their life on the line.   It is not until they are in for a few years and have been promoted a  couple times that they make the equivalent of $15 an hour or roughly  $31,000 a year.   In other words, it takes serving your country for several years,  signing away some of your basic rights and freedoms, shaving your head,  leaving home for 6 to 12 months, putting your life on the line, and  going through a multitude of sacrifices, for our servicemembers to make  as much as what a McDonald's worker starts at.   This is embarrassing, and it is flat-out wrong. That is why we must  pass the Raise Minimum Base Pay Act or work this initiative into this  year's National Defense Authorization Act to get our servicemembers the  pay raise that they so desperately need right now. About 30 percent of  our enlisted troops actually qualify for food stamps.   I will not stand here at this podium and feign support for big bills  that provide small support for our troops. I won't do it.   Our Nation faces recruitment and retention shortfalls that we have  never seen before, the steepest in over 50 years.   This is a frightening concern for our Nation's security, especially  as peer threats like the Chinese Communist Party continue to grow--not  just in terms of head count and technologies--their military  capabilities with their eyes fixated on a potential invasion of Taiwan  and the elimination long term of the United States.   Yes, right now we must get our servicemembers a pay raise and  continue to improve quality-of-life issues for them so that we can  strengthen our military's positioning, strengthen its recruitment and  retention, and get our servicemembers a much-needed pay raise.   Mr. Speaker, any NDAA this year that fails to adequately address this  issue fails to take care of our most precious weapon system, our  troops, is not a good NDAA.   It is way past due to do what is right for the warfighter. Mr.  Speaker, I am committed to doing so this year.                               A Pinch of Salt     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to encourage  both parties in this Chamber to add a pinch of salt to our legislative  diets for the sake of the middle-class taxpayers.   The 2017 Tax Cut and Jobs Act or TCJA was the catalyst under the  previous Trump administration that fueled the booming economy from 2018  through 2020 before COVID impacted us and before President Biden and  Speaker Pelosi went on their out-of-control spending sprees.   These out-of-control spending sprees ultimately led to record-high  debt and record-high inflation rates that we are very familiar with  here today.   The TCJA or the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act actually lowered taxes for all  tax brackets and doubled the standard deduction for single and married  filers.   Mr. Speaker, the TCJA had a bit of a middle finger that was aimed at  primarily blue states like mine, the great State of California.   It imposed a $10,000 State and local tax cap or SALT cap for both  married and single tax filers. What this meant is that if you paid more  than $10,000 in State and local income tax or property tax, you  couldn't actually deduct more than $10,000 of those taxes within your  Federal tax returns.  [[Page H2076]]    Despite overall lower tax rates and a doubling of the standard  deduction, many middle-class Americans were actually hurt by this SALT  cap and were net negative within the construct of the TCJA from 2017.   At the time in 2017, a $10,000 limit seemed like a lot, but in  today's dollars, because of the record-high inflation I mentioned  earlier we have seen over the last 30 months, $10,000 now behaves like  the equivalent of $7,000 today in terms of the deduction.   At the time in 2017, only California, New York, and New Jersey were  really affected by this cap. Since 2017, the median home value has  nearly doubled in almost every State nationwide.   Now States that have any income tax or any property tax are hearing  from voters and their constituents that this SALT cap at $10,000 is  actually affecting them, as well.   At the time in 2017, this was seen as a white-collar, upper-class  problem, but in California, New York, and New Jersey, we knew better.   We knew that if you owned a home and had a job, you were likely  affected by this cap. This is very much a middle-class, blue-collar  taxpayer problem in my State and especially in my district.   At the time in 2017, conservatives paid no attention to the fact that  the cap was $10,000, whether or not you were married.   You could be single; $10,000 cap. Married; $10,000 cap. They failed  to recognize that this was, in fact, a marriage penalty that they were  imposing.   Today, Mr. Speaker, I rise to encourage us all to add a pinch of salt  to our legislative agenda. Even doubling the deduction from $10,000 to  $20,000 would still generate 75 percent of the estimated $800 billion  of revenue created by this cap over a 10-year period.   We can still achieve most of the revenue from billionaires with a  $20,000 cap, but we also with that $20,000 cap would allow middle-class  Americans to keep more in their pocket.   To my colleagues on this side of the aisle who see this as a  California problem and say, hey, screw California, I won't support  subsidizing California's broken tax policies.   Well, I will remind you that if you ignore these challenges, you  pretend like these problems don't affect you, you don't screw  California because ultimately, California screws you.    Our problems become your problems, our State problems become Federal  problems, and our tax policies influence Federal tax policies.   I also want to remind folks that California's GDP is roughly 750  percent larger than States like Tennessee and is actually 150 percent  larger than the next biggest State's GDP.   In California, we don't talk about the burden of subsidizing the  other States in terms of GDP and revenue, so we should not look at the  SALT deduction cap as an issue of States subsidizing California on the  tax side.   Make no mistake, Mr. Speaker. Californians pay way too much in taxes,  and Sacramento is beyond dysfunctional.   It is actually offensive how much we pay in taxes, but we can  rightsize the SALT deduction limit at the Federal level to account for  today's realities, and this would help all Americans.   The TCJA turns into a pumpkin and expires in 2025, but our party and  conservatives have an opportunity to address the discrepancies of the  SALT cap within TCJA before then, and we have an opportunity to shape  this policy while we have the majority.   Mr. Speaker, on our side of the aisle, we have a significant number  of Members from California, New York, and New Jersey whose constituents  will accept nothing less than a real legislative victory on the SALT  cap.   Why should they accept anything less? Their daily reality is the  madness of bad economic policies that come from Sacramento and Albany  and are compounded by bad policies here in D.C. like the SALT cap.   I am telling you, Mr. Speaker, a pinch of salt in this session will  ensure fiscal conservatives keep the reins for another Congress.   Ignoring the issue ensures that the far left will not only regain  control of the spending side but also regain control of our tax codes  that are going to be up for a vote in 2025.   Congratulating the Hart Girls' Soccer Team    Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the Hart  High girls' soccer team on their recent CIF championship.   These young women showed up and gave it their all every single game  this last season. Now they are the southern California regional  champions.   They are recognized as one of the best soccer teams in the State, and  I would say probably one of the best soccer teams in the Nation.   I recently had the pleasure of welcoming the Hart High girls' soccer  team to my Santa Clarita office earlier this week.   I saw young leaders, young women who work hard and are disciplined  not only in soccer but also with their academics.   They have accomplished so much at such a young age and have displayed  what young athletic talent and leadership comes out of our beautiful  27th Congressional District in California.   Congratulations to the Hart High girls' soccer team. They are a  shining example of how great our communities are, and they make us all  proud.                                time  1730                                School Safety     Mr. Speaker, across our country, K-12  students are preparing to wrap up school as the summer nears. They have  undoubtedly faced a tough academic year that, for some, has,  unfortunately, been marked by the scourge of violence that continues to  impact our Nation's schools.   This national problem extends from fights on campuses to local  violent crime that breaks out near the campuses that induces lockdowns  to evil, targeted shootings like we saw in Nashville just a couple of  weeks ago.   As our Nation's children recess for the summer, it is on Congress to  use this time to work toward meaningful solutions that protect our kids  as much as they work to protect themselves.   Since the stewardship of President Reagan, our country has retained  and demonstrated a time-tested doctrine of peace through strength to  keep the homeland safe. President Reagan knew then, as we still see  today, that anything less than the full projection of strength and  willingness to protect our own invites attacks from evil actors.   This same principle, which has been employed by our Nation for the  better part of 50 years, should also apply to our most precious asset,  our children. As Americans, we need to be willing to plainly  demonstrate to any person set on attacking our kids in school that any  effort to do so will be met with swift and devastating force. That is  why I introduced the Strengthening School Security for Students Act,  which would require and fund at least two school resource officers for  every 500 students in public schools in the United States using  leftover unobligated COVID funds.   These school resource officers would be trained, they would be armed,  and we would have two for every 500 students. That gives the school the  opportunity to have multiple locations for these resource officers to  put down any threats as quickly as possible.   Some of these SROs actually exist today, but recent data shows that  only about 45 percent of the schools have a dedicated SRO on campus at  least once a week. Mr. Speaker, that is not good enough. Our children  deserve better.   We are surrounded by armed guards here in the Capitol on a daily  basis. Every door we walk in, every building we go into, there are  armed guards around us. Mr. Speaker, my life, your life are not more  important than the lives of our children. They deserve to be protected  as well.   A proportionate amount of SROs on campuses for students sends a  clear, unwavering message that we will protect our students from any  harm. It is critical that we take lessons learned from recent instances  of violence and use them to address existing shortfalls and gaps in our  schools, from hardening campuses to protect students to investing in  the mental health facilities of staff as well as the students.   Mr. Speaker, another bill that I have brought forward to this body is  the Safe Schools Act, which, again, uses existing unspent COVID funds  that have already been obligated to schools and school districts to  improve their  [[Page H2077]]  own security and make proper investments in programs that prevent  violence.   For example, under this bill, schools would be allowed to use funds  that were previously earmarked specifically for COVID relief and train  teachers and faculty on how to best assist children experiencing a  mental health crisis and provide immediate support when issues arise.  If you ask me, that sounds like a great use of our underrun on COVID  funding.   Mr. Speaker, this fight is a personal one for me. Like too many other  folks in this Chamber, my own community has been touched by school  violence when just a few years ago at Saugus High School, my alma  mater, two young lives were taken too soon because of an act of  violence. We can take meaningful action without sacrificing our duty to  protect the constitutional rights of every American.                         Honoring Sergeant Steve Owen     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to encourage  support for my bill, H.R. 1627, the Sergeant Steve Owen Defending Our  Defenders Act. It is critical legislation that would make the murdering  of a police officer a Federal felony punishable by only life in prison  or the death penalty.   For those of you who do not know Sergeant Steve Owen, he was a Los  Angeles County Sheriff in the Antelope Valley in my district, a hero in  our community, a family man who was brutally murdered in broad daylight  on the streets of Lancaster back in 2016 by a vicious criminal who was  out on parole.   Sergeant Steve Owen's death is unfortunately becoming a common story  in this day and age. In fact, in 2021, we saw a 60 percent increase in  murder of law enforcement officers. This is due to the defund the  police movement and soft-on-crime policies from elected officials from  the far left, D.A.s who have been hired by Soros to be soft on violent  criminals, and it has severely handicapped our police officers' ability  to do their jobs and, in some cases, to go home safely at the end of  their shift.   This bill, named in honor of Sergeant Steve Owen, is all too  necessary right now as our police officers face increased rates of  crime against them. It is critical that we pass this legislation to  ensure that our law enforcement officers have the protection necessary  to do their jobs effectively and go home to their families.   This should not be a tough bill to support for either Republicans or  Democrats. The men and women who protect us every day deserve to know  that we have their back. They give us a security blanket in our  communities as elected officials, we should give them a meaningful  deterrence to any criminal who is willing to do them harm. We must do  more to take care of our heroic law enforcement officers who put their  lives on the line on a daily basis to keep our communities safe.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. James), my  good friend and West Point grad.    Mr. Speaker, it is remarkable how  quickly we forgot the lessons learned in Afghanistan. When we see the  situation in Sudan and for Secretary of State Blinken to literally  forget some of the lessons learned so quickly makes us wonder how many  countries we are still vulnerable in as we move forward.   I want to reflect on Afghanistan because it hasn't been that long  and, yet, I think many Americans have actually forgotten what has  happened there.   We made several key strategic errors giving up Bagram Airfield:  Leaving our allies in Afghanistan in the lurch without any notification  in the dead of night, not handing operational control over from a State  Department diplomatic mission in terms of an evacuation back to the  DOD, and recognizing that we were, in fact, in a warfighting scenario  where operational control should have been handed to the Department of  Defense.   It was a demonstration of cabinet members under a weak administration  not having the backbone to stand up and tell their boss, the President  of the United States, the Commander in Chief, that, Boss, we have a  problem. We need to be more proactive.   We need to take a step back, rethink our strategy here, and we need  to make sure that every single American comes home. If you recall, we  were actually bringing home American troops before we brought home  American civilians in many of those cases.   Mr. Speaker, I thank you for the time, and I yield back the balance  of my time.                            ____________________
