 Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support Mr. Emmer's bill,  H.R. 2954.   Dodd-Frank added unprecedented new regulations on industry. As has  been said already by my colleagues, institutions now have to collect 25  additional fields of data. This is more than double what the banks and  credit unions and other lenders had to report prior to passage of Dodd- Frank. Not only do these added requirements increase costs for all  financial institutions, but it has taken lots of time for smaller  community lenders to prepare for them.   This House should be well aware of two surveys of small financial  institutions that reported an alarming inability of those entities to  meet these new requirements.   In fact, in my meetings with small banks and credit unions from  Oklahoma, all of them have raised these specific rules and requirements  as being costly enough to affect their business decisions: such as how  many mortgages they could feasibly originate.   All of this makes this bill not only timely, but immensely necessary.  I represent a district that is full of institutions that originate  fewer than 500 closed-end mortgages or open-end lines of credit in 2  years. While these new requirements were certainly well-intentioned,  their impact on small institutions cannot be overstated and should not  be lessened.   We as a body should continue to find ways to grow the ability of  Americans to receive and to utilize financial instruments, such as  mortgages. These requirements, if put on all institutions nationwide,  will disproportionately affect those who are served by small financial  entities.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support Mr. Emmer's bill.
