 Madam Speaker, war is on our doorstep. With the Russian  invasion of Ukraine, Iran's proxy conflict with Israel, North Korea's  long-range ballistic missile development, and China's belligerence in  the South China Sea, an axis of evil is rising again.   These nations seek to challenge the security of the world that has  provided our Nation's prosperity since World War II. We are answering  the call with this year's NDAA. We drafted this bill to address the  growing national security threats while taking care of our  servicemembers.   The bill increases the top line of defense to keep pace with our  national security challenges.   It provides a 5.2 percent servicemember pay increase, the largest  increase in 20 years. This bill provides a path for COVID vaccine  servicemembers to be reinstated.   The bill curbs a reckless administration's diversity, equity, and  inclusion appetite that detracts from warfighting.   The bill provides needed force structure focus by retaining critical  aircraft and ships, preparing us to deter conflict before 2030.   Madam Speaker, this is the right bill at the right time. We need it  urgently to deter catastrophic conflict.   Madam Speaker, I recognize Ranking Member Norcross. He is a great  teammate. I thank the chairman and urge all Members to support this.
