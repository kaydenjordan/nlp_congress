 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Houston,  Representative Green, and I also thank the Republicans that participate  in the shoot every year. Obviously, we all play to win every time and  we take the competition very seriously. Democrats only lost by about 13  shots this year. We actually did pretty good. So we are improving.   I want to remind everybody that we work on issues like conservation,  environmental issues, and other things where Democrats and Republicans  can come together for the greater cause of the country. I want to  remind the gentleman that next year we are going to find those 13  shots.
