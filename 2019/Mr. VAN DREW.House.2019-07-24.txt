 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Oregon and  chairman of the illustrious Transportation and Infrastructure  Committee.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3409, the Coast  Guard Authorization Act--bipartisan legislation that authorizes  programs and funding of over $11 billion for the United States Coast  Guard through fiscal year 2021.   I am proud to represent New Jersey's Second Congressional District,  home to the United States Coast Guard Training Center in Cape May, Air  Station Atlantic City, and thousands more of our brave men and brave  women who protect our shores and our coastal communities.   This comprehensive bill authorizes critical funding to upgrade and  modernize our fleets and improve offshore navigation safety. It  requires a report on the effects of climate change and the  vulnerabilities of our Coast Guard installations, directs the use of  drone technology for potential use to support missions and operations,  and orders the Commandant of the Coast Guard to brief Congress on the  conditions and need for Coast Guard housing.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman DeFazio and Ranking Member Graves for  bringing this important bill to the floor, and I urge my colleagues to  support H.R. 3409, the Coast Guard Authorization Act. These are our  brave men and women who protect our seas.
