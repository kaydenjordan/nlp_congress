 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support  of the American Rescue Plan.   Madam Speaker, I have been honored to be in public service in my  State legislature, as mayor of West Palm Beach, and now here in  Congress. I can unequivocally say that this is the most important,  impactful piece of legislation that I have ever had the honor to vote  for.   We all know that this past year has tested us like never before. The  pandemic has destroyed lives and livelihoods. It has disproportionately  hurt women, especially women of color, who are already at an economic  disadvantage. The impacts have been devastating. Women have lost 5.3  million jobs, 2 million of which are permanent losses. And that is not  all. Women also make up the majority of our frontline workforce. In  fact, Madam Speaker, we are calling this a ``she'' session.   Schools close and the loss of accessible childcare have only added to  the crisis, but this bill will rescue women and their families with the  relief they need. It will crush COVID-19, get our children safely back  to school, and rescue the childcare industry. It is going to increase  the child tax credit, taking half of our children in poverty out of  poverty. It is going to get the vaccines into the arms of Americans.   I will tell you this, Madam Speaker: My office is getting calls day  after day, all day, from people who want these vaccines.   This rescue package will put money directly into the pockets of  working people and get people back to work.   Women have shouldered so much of this pandemic. So it is time to  extend the helping hand that they and their families need to get  through this pandemic.   I believe, Madam Speaker, that better days are ahead with this rescue  plan, and I urge my colleagues to pass it.
