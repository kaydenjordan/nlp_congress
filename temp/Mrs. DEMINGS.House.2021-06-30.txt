 Madam Speaker, my colleagues way on the other side of  the aisle asked a question: How can we better protect our Capitol  Police?   Well, as a former police chief, let me tell you how.   First, do not replace truth with lies.   Second, uphold the law yourselves.   Third, hold those who beat the police down accountable.   How can you do that without knowing the complete truth, without a  thorough investigation?   My colleagues way on the other side of the aisle brought up the 9/11  Commission being about foreign actors.   Well, let me remind you that the oath that we took says that we will  protect and defend the Constitution of the United States against all  enemies, foreign and domestic.   Madam Speaker, did they forget? Did they ever really know? Or were  they simply too afraid to care?   Well, I care, and so do my brothers and sisters in blue. We will not  forget, and we will not let you forget either.
