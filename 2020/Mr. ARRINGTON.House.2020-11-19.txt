 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a very special  constituent, a legendary west Texan, and a great American and the most  recent inductee into the Texas Panhandle Sports Hall of Fame, Gene  Arrington.   At 6-foot-6, ``Big Air,'' as his friends call him, is a giant of a  man with a larger-than-life story.   He was raised by a single mom on the south side of Amarillo, Texas,  with little more than a roof over his head. In spite of his humble  beginnings, God blessed him with an abundance of athleticism and drive  that helped him achieve tremendous success in the sport of basketball.   In 1956, Arrington led the Palo Duro Dons to their first State  championship basketball title, averaging 20 points a game, and named to  both the all-State and all-tournament teams. He was the only Texan to  be invited to play in the North versus South All-Star Game in Murray,  Kentucky.   After high school, Arrington joined Polk Robison's Texas Tech Red  Raiders, where he started for 3 years, scored 652 points, and pulled  down 409 rebounds in 71 games.   His greatest feat, Mr. Speaker, while playing ball at Texas Tech was  winning the heart of a young coed from Austin, Texas, Betty Lee Cook,  who is now his wife of over 50 years.   If you asked my dad about his greatest achievements, he wouldn't  reference championship titles, all-star games, or all-State and all- conference teams. He wouldn't mention a single athletic achievement or  accolade.   Instead, he would talk about the day he met Jesus and joined God's  kingdom team and what joy and blessing and peace and purpose he  experienced from that relationship.   He would talk about his most impressive score of convincing my mom to  marry him and spend over 50 years doing life with him and how she has  been such a faithful friend and partner and such a hardworking woman  and an amazing mother.   He would talk about coaching three boys to be men and how proud he is  of all three of us and how he prayed every day--every day--for our  happiness in life and in the Lord.   He would talk about his all-star friends and what a blessing they  have been and how sweet life has been and how they have helped him be  more successful.   I am proud of my dad's induction into the Texas Panhandle Sports Hall  of Fame, but, Mr. Speaker, the most important thing to my dad is not  being a Hall of Fame athlete. It is being the best husband, father, and  friend that he can be.   So I congratulate my dad on his Hall of Fame honor. But, more  importantly, I congratulate him on realizing his deepest desires and  his biggest dream of being a world-class father and teaching his boys  the game of life, the love of God, and the true meaning of success.   He is our hero. God bless, and go West Texas.                            ____________________
