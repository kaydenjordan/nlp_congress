 Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the  great contributions of Ducks Unlimited.   For 80 years, Ducks Unlimited has played an important role in the  wetland conservation process in our country by fighting for critical  conservation policies in our national and State capitols and conducting  outreach and education to bring the next generation of sportsmen and - women into play.   They have raised billions of dollars to conserve more than 14 million  acres, and they have biologists on the ground working with local  partners to bring these projects across the finish line.   Ducks Unlimited has had great success in making critical habitat  improvements to wetlands that support healthy flyway populations, clean  air and water, and strong local economies.                            ____________________
