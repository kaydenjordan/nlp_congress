 Madam Speaker, this President has repeatedly lied to the  American people about his election loss. He incited his followers to  attack our democracy, resulting in five deaths. His dangerous efforts  to derail the peaceful transition of power were a violation of his oath  of office. This President is unfit to lead our Nation and unable to  discharge his duties of office.   I call upon my Republican colleagues to speak the truth to their  supporters and join me in holding President Trump accountable by voting  to impeach.
