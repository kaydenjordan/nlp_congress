 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, the former leader of the Soviet Union,  Vladimir Lenin, once said:         You probe with bayonets: If you find mush, you push. If you       find steel, you withdraw.    Well, apparently, the current Russian President subscribes to this  same point of view. President Putin has made no secret of his desire to  restore the former Soviet Union. In 2005, he declared:         The [demise] of the Soviet Union was the greatest       geopolitical catastrophe of the century.    ``The [demise] of the Soviet Union was the greatest geopolitical  catastrophe of the century,'' he said in 2005.   He went on to say:         As for the Russian people, it became a genuine tragedy.       Tens of millions of our fellow citizens and countrymen found       themselves beyond the fringes of Russian territory.    So perhaps we should not have been surprised when, in 2008, Russia  invaded Georgia--that is, the country of Georgia. Then, when it came to  a global response, the Russian President found mush, so he pushed. In  2014, Russia invaded Ukraine for the first time since the end of the  Cold War, taking its Crimea region. Once again, President Putin found  mush, so he pushed.   Today, more than 100,000 Russian troops are massed along the  Ukrainian border. An invasion could happen at any moment. This  impending crisis raises a fundamental question for the freedom-loving  countries of the world: Will President Putin be met with mush or steel?  Will the anticipated cost of an invasion in terms of blood, treasure,  and reputation become so high that he backs down or will a muted global  response encourage his lust for empire?   In times like these, the civilized world looks to the United States  for leadership. Ours may no longer be a unipolar world, with the rise  of China and the dreams of empire of the Russian Federation, but our  country remains a beacon of freedom, strength, and democracy that  serves as an example for the rest of the world.   So the question the world is asking is, Will America still lead? Will  we accept our responsibilities under treaties like that of the North  Atlantic Treaty, which formed NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty  Organization? To be sure, Ukraine is not yet a member of NATO, but will  we and the other members allow Putin to dictate membership in the  multilateral, rules-based order represented by NATO by threats and  force? Will we aid a democracy like Ukraine in its self-defense? These  are questions that lie before us, and so far, the Biden  administration's response has been less than reassuring.   Last year, the administration waived sanctions on the Nord Stream 2  Pipeline, giving Russia the green light to continue its monopoly on the  energy supply to Europe along with its ability, because of that  monopoly, to weaponize energy to an even greater extent.   The administration's response led to a poorly planned and even more  poorly executed exodus from Afghanistan, leaving Afghans vulnerable and  at the mercy of the Taliban and leaving our friends and allies around  the world aghast at the manner in which that exit occurred.   Then, a couple of weeks ago, President Biden suggested that minor  incursions--minor incursions--by Russia into Ukraine may be tolerated-- a line that he would later, thankfully, walk back.   President Biden has given our allies multiple reasons to doubt the  resolve and credibility of the United States as that leader of the free  world. Whether out of naivete or idealism or just error of judgment, it  doesn't change the fact that President Biden has repeatedly projected a  lack of decisiveness and weakness, and Putin, you had better believe,  has taken notice.   As it stands today, the international response to Russian aggression  is disjointed and disorganized at best. France is all in on diplomacy.  The United Kingdom is offering clear but limited military assistance.  Germany, unfortunately, seems to support appeasement. The United States  and the rest of the world are waiting for President Biden to step up to  the challenge.   I believe we have a responsibility to stand with Ukraine and help its  people defend its sovereignty and its democracy. Now, that doesn't mean  having American troops on the ground, but there are other ways we can  help Ukraine defend itself and raise the costs of a threatened Russian  invasion into their country. Forceful language and threats of sanctions  may be important, but they are clearly not enough. We need to take  concrete steps to minimize the likelihood of a Russian attack and  ensure that Ukraine, as I said, has the resources they need in order to  defend themselves in the event of an invasion.   There is a historical parallel. During World War II, President  Roosevelt recognized how critical it was for the United States to  support Great Britain even at a time when the American people were  isolationists and when America's official policy was neutrality toward  the war in Europe. President Roosevelt recognized it was important to  do what we could to support Great Britain during its hour of need, when  it was literally hanging on by a thread, because it lacked the  resources it needed to protect its people and fend off German forces.  So President Roosevelt vowed to transform the United States into what  he called the arsenal of democracy and worked with Congress to devise a  creative solution that later became known as the Lend-Lease Act. This  legislation, signed into law in March of 1941, allowed the United  States to supply our allies with weapons, ships, aircraft--any materiel  they needed in order to mount their defense at a critical time in the  war in Europe.    Later that year, Winston Churchill, the Prime Minister, said the bill  ``must be regarded without question as the most unsordid act in the  whole of recorded history.'' Now, Winston Churchill certainly had a way  with words, and when he calls it an unsordid act, I guess today we  would say it was the most selfless and unselfish act in the whole of  recorded history by the United States of America.   The circumstances today are not those of March of 1941. There is no  mistake about that. Yet, if you look back at the historical parallels-- at the circumstances in 1939, when Hitler invaded Czechoslovakia for  similar reasons for which Putin is claiming he has a right to invade  Ukraine--they are chilling. If we had stood up to Germany then, we  might have avoided a global calamity and prevented the loss of millions  of innocent lives.   So what best to inform our actions today but the experience of the  past, to correct our mistakes, and to duplicate the successful efforts  in World War II or at other times in our history. The lessons of the  past must inform the present, and I believe we still have a duty to  lead when it comes to protecting democracies and freedom-loving  countries around the world.   Once again, America can now become that arsenal of democracy for  Ukraine. To that end, I have introduced bipartisan legislation called  the Ukraine Democracy Defense Lend-Lease Act to ensure that Ukrainian  forces have the resources they need to deter and defend against Russian  aggression.   I am proud to have worked with senior members of the Armed Services  Committee and Senate Foreign Relations Committee--people like Senators  Cardin, Wicker, Shaheen, Graham, Blumenthal, Sullivan, and Hassan--on  this legislation, which will give the administration and give President  Biden more flexibility and more efficiency when it comes to being that  arsenal of democracy for Ukraine.   As it stands today, the President of the United States has a menu of  options to support our friends and allies in times of conflict. In some  cases, like the loan of equipment, the United States could eventually  retain end use. In others, this would make clear we would support  grants or emergency aid where we would not recover the funding or  assets sent to our allies. This  [[Page S426]]  bill provides an additional option on the menu, allowing the United  States to provide assistance that may otherwise be unfeasible unless we  could retain end use. This legislation authorizes the President to  enter into lend-lease agreements directly with Ukraine and provide the  military equipment necessary to protect the Ukrainian people.   My hope is that this will send another message to Vladimir Putin that  not only do you need to consider the statements and actions of the  executive branch but that you also need to look at the bipartisan  support that Ukraine is getting in the U.S. Congress--tangible  support--in terms of weapons they can use to deter and, if not to  deter, to defeat Russian aggression. Russia must know that an invasion  would be met with steel and not mush. If Russian troops make the  decision to move forward, Ukrainian forces would have the lethal  weapons needed to defend their sovereignty. I am proud of the fact that  this effort does have such strong bipartisan support, and I hope more  of our colleagues will join us in this legislation.    This is one important way we can send a message to our friends and  allies around the world that you are not alone, that America can be  trusted, that our commitments are credible and they will be met not  just with words but with action.   Thanks to the leadership of Chairman Menendez of the Foreign  Relations Committee and Ranking Member Risch, I have been proud to work  with this bipartisan group of colleagues to discuss not just this lend- lease legislation but a more comprehensive approach to counter Russian  aggression. We have discussed the lend-lease bill, as well as  additional security assistance and lethal aid for Ukraine.   The group is currently crafting a package of targeted sanctions, as  well, meant to deter Russia from invading. It includes limited but  immediate sanctions in response to ongoing aggression and, in  particular, cyber attacks, which were a new domain unknown in World War  II but which are very real in 2022.   Russia cannot operate under the illusion that it will only receive a  slap on the hand for invading Ukraine. I will leave it to the chairman  and ranking member to make announcements about this legislation, but  suffice it to say that I am encouraged that bipartisan progress is  being made.   We agree on the outlines of what is being discussed, and we are  committed to striking a deal as quickly as possible because time is of  the essence. Nobody knows, except Vladimir Putin, when he will order  the invasion of Ukraine. But make no mistake, America stands with  Ukraine, and we will do everything we can to help them defend  themselves against an invasion by the Russian Federation.   This is not just a Ukraine problem. This is not just a Europe problem  or a NATO problem. The potential for escalation makes this a global  security problem. Russia didn't stop after Georgia or Crimea, and it  likely will not stop after Ukraine.   We are confronting the scope of Russia's power and influence on the  global stage, and America's leadership, as always, is absolutely  crucial.   The United States has a responsibility to promote peace and security  around the world. If Russia invades Ukraine and America does nothing,  we show the world that our position can't be trusted, that our promises  to our allies are not credible, and we also show that we will sacrifice  the lives and the treasure of freedom-loving countries like Ukraine to  the biggest bully on the continent.   A shifting global order would send a signal to other countries, as  well--not just in Europe but around the world, in places like China and  Iran--that all bets are off. They may be incentivized to mount similar  pressure campaigns and not fear retaliation by the United States and  our allies. If that were to happen, America would no longer be the  global superpower. We would suddenly become a regional power with mere  aspirations and no global reach.   Make no mistake, an attack on Ukraine is also an attack on America's  global security interests and on world peace and could have cascading  consequences that right now are too horrible to contemplate.   This is an existential threat to our leadership in the world and to  the global order we underwrite and to our way of life and the way of  life for freedom-loving democracies around the world. A Russian  invasion of Ukraine is far more existential than a mere isolated and  faraway quarrel.   I appreciate the hard work of Senators on both sides of the aisle to  develop this response--this strong response--to Russia's threatened  aggression. We need to do our part to ensure that, when Russia probes  with bayonets, it shall be met with steel.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
