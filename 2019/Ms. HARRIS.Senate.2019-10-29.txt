 Madam President, our Nation mourns the loss of one  of the country's greatest leaders, Representative Elijah Eugene  Cummings, whose life's work as a fervent champion for civil rights and  his beloved community in Baltimore, MD left an indelible mark on our  Nation. Congressman Cummings died on October 17, 2019 in Baltimore, MD.  He was 68 years old.   Representative Cummings was born on January 18, 1951, in Baltimore,  MD. He was the third of seven children born to sharecroppers, Robert  Cummings and Ruth Elma Cummings, who moved north from South Carolina in  search of better opportunities for their family. Representative  Cummings graduated from Baltimore City College High School and went on  to earn a bachelor's degree in political science from Howard University  in Washington, DC, where he served as student government president and  graduated Phi Beta Kappa. Representative Cummings obtained a juris  doctorate from the University of Maryland School of Law in 1975.  Throughout his career, he received 13 honorary doctoral degrees from  universities throughout the country.   Representative Cummings' career in public service began in 1983 when  we was elected to the Maryland House of Delegates. Representative  Cummings proudly served in this role for 14 years, eventually becoming  the State legislature's first African-American speaker pro tempore. In  1996, he was elected to represent Maryland's 7th District in the House  of Representatives as a member of the 104th Congress. Representative  Cummings focused on legislative priorities that promoted equality and  economic development, including: criminal justice reform, lowering  prescription drug prices, and combatting the opioid epidemic, among  others. As a respected Congressman, he became a ranking member of the  Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure and the chairman of the  House Committee on Oversight and Reform.   As the chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform,  Representative Cummings was a powerful voice who achieved a reputation  as a skilled consensus builder. He understood accountability and  protecting those who courageously spoke the truth to protect our  Nation. He fought daily to ensure our democracy was not only intact but  striving to live up to its promise. At the foundation of his fight was  advocacy for justice and equal opportunity for all.   Representative Cummings made it his personal responsibility to  champion civil rights issues, particularly voting rights. His fierce  advocacy was fueled, in part, by the words of his mother who on her  death bed, implored him to ensure the right to vote was preserved. He  would heed her words by delivering his own stirring calls to action. He  understood the significance of the right to vote in our democracy and  worked tirelessly to oppose voter suppression, condemn discriminatory  anti-voting tactics, and launch critical investigations when voters-- particularly people of color--faced discriminatory voting  [[Page S6238]]  challenges. Representative Cummings' visionary leadership and service  has and will continue to strengthen our democracy for generations to  come.   Representative Elijah Cummings' steadfast dedication to the city of  Baltimore, the State of Maryland, and our entire country will continue  to inspire others for generations to come. An impassioned speaker, he  was truly a voice for the voiceless. As a mentor, he helped so many  young people live in their purpose and make the world a better place.  He fought for the soul of Nation and selflessly dedicated his life to  empowering and uplifting his constituents.   Representative Cummings is survived by his wife, Dr. Maya Rockeymoore  Cummings, his children, and a host of family and friends. It was a  great honor to attend his powerful funeral and memorial service with  many of my colleagues and friends.   Representative Cummings often said that ``children are the living  messages that we send to a future we will never see.'' A light is gone  from our world, but Representative Cummings' legacy will shine bright  through all the individuals he touched and all the movements he helped  build.                            ____________________
