 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the bipartisan budget  agreement in order to protect Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security,  while also preventing a devastating default on our debt.   To be clear, this bill is far from perfect, but it prevents a  default, it prevents future efforts to hold this Nation hostage for the  rest of the 118th Congress, and it prevents cruel Republican cuts.   This budget agreement that President Biden negotiated protects  funding for education, healthcare, veterans' benefits, Medicare,  Medicaid, and Social Security. Most importantly, it prevents  Republicans from forcing a devastating default that would kill  countless jobs in my district and destroy our economy.   Mr. Speaker, I join in expressing my frustration with the crisis that  my Republican colleagues have manufactured. The American people deserve  better than a Republican majority that chooses to govern crisis by  crisis. Let's lift this debt ceiling and get on with the people's  business in the people's House.
