 Madam Speaker, after one long year of this pandemic,  many of my constituents are anxious. And, yeah, they are angry. Their  health has been harmed, their businesses have been shut down, and they  are absolutely frustrated waiting for their vaccines. They are not  happy with our ex-President's response, and they are not pleased with  the local response. That is why now, more than ever, we in Congress  need to continue our response to COVID-19.   Madam Speaker, in the past year, we passed five bipartisan bills that  kept  [[Page H771]]  the economy afloat and the poverty rate flat. That is why on this night  with this pandemic raging this year we must support this rule, which  will put shots in arms, checks in pockets, kids in schools, food on  tables, strike teams in nursing homes, keep police and firefighters on  our street, keep pensions secure, and provide vaccines for essential  workers, including my farmworkers on the Central Coast of California,  so that they can do their job for their families and for our food  security.   Madam Speaker, let's do our job tonight for our constituents and for  this country and pass the American Rescue Act.
