 Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 50th  anniversary of the Pell Grant Program.   Fifty years ago, Congress amended the Higher Education Act by  creating the Basic Educational Opportunity Grant to provide direct  financial aid to low-income students so that they would have the same  opportunities and the same access to higher education as others.   Since then, the Pell Grant has been a cornerstone investment in the  lives and futures of nearly 80 million students across the country.   In my district, more than $123 million in Pell grants have been  awarded to students just last year. Think of the difference that has  made.   As a former educator myself, I know that cost is one of the largest  barriers to higher education, and here in Congress I will continue to  do everything in my power to support the Pell Grant Program and ensure  it continues to break down that very barrier.                            ____________________
