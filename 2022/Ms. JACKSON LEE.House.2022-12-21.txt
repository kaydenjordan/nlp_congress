 Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished chairman, I  thank the manager, and I thank my colleague, Congresswoman Sylvia  Garcia from Texas, and Senator Cornyn from Texas, and the other  sponsors.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to acknowledge the crucialness of this  legislation dealing with the lighterers. It is about the economic  engine that many of us have in our communities, and that is, of course,  the port, but also the travel and business and the issues of recreation  that are encountered on large vessels.  [[Page H9927]]    This bill will give these individuals the time that they need to do  the proper work safely, rather than the short time of 29 days, to have  an extended period of time to respond is both, in this climate, an  economic boost, a recognition of fairness in the immigration process,  and to recognize the importance of the hard work that the lighterers  do.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Congresswoman Garcia, Members of the  other body, and Senator Cornyn for the work that is going to shine a  light on better productivity and a better economic aspect of this work.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman and the manager of  this bill.   I display this picture for everyone to see because a picture is worth  a thousand words. This is McKayla and a constituent of mine, Simone  Biles. As indicated, these women have spent years investing in their  sport and rising to the level of excellence, and they are victims that  should not have been victimized.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to support the Respect for Child Survivors Act.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the article titled: ``Senators  Propose New Bill Following USA Gymnastics Scandal.''                 [From NBC Los Angeles, September 22, 2022]         Senators Propose New Bill Following USA Gymnastics Scandal                             (By Kristen Conti)         A group of senators have decided to roll out a bill to       adjust the intricacies of the USA Gymnastics scandal with the       implementation of The Respect for Child Survivors Act,       following the Larry Nassar incident.        The intentions of the act are to improve the way the FBI       interacts with underage witnesses and victims in sex abuse       and human trafficking cases.        The catalyst for this endeavor surrounds the FBl's previous       failures in handling the Nassar investigation from 2015.       Nassar is currently facing decades in prison for abusing       underage athletes on the USA Gymnastics team.        The FBI failed to act, despite being notified of the       allegations in 2015. It took them over a year to take action,       leaving Nassar many more months to prey on the girls.        Olympic gymnasts Simone Biles, Aly Raisman and Maroney are       among the over 100 alleged victims of Nassar.                 What is the Respect for Child Survivors Act?         The Respect for Child Survivors Act, which primarily aims       to handle the interactions between the FBI and abuse victims,       is a parallel to two other acts--The Adult Survivors Act and       The Child Victims Act (CVA).        The act, which has officially been introduced as a bill,       will soon be assigned to a committee whose members will       discuss and implement the necessary and proper changes to the       bill. Next, the bill will be put before the chamber and be       voted on, which will determine whether it will become a law.        The timeline for this process has yet to be determined.              When will the Adult Survivors Act go into effect?         The Adult Survivors Act will go into effect in November       2022. The bill, which is sponsored by Senate Judiciary       Committee Chair Brad Hoylman and Assembly Member Linda B.       Rosenthal, was framed to resemble The Child Victims Act.        The CVA, previously passed in 2019 and extended in 2021,       only covers abuse that happened to people under 18.  [[Page H9930]]                        Who does the Adult Survivors Act serve?         The victims in the Nassar case were under 18 when the       crimes were committed and reported in 2015. However, it       wasn't until 2016 that the FBI began to investigate and truly       ignite action. And at this point, the young athletes       surpassed the age limit the CVA covers.        The Adult Survivors Act allows a one-year windows for       survivors of adult sexual abuse in New York to file a civil       lawsuit. Claims will be eligible even when the statute of       limitations has already expired.     What does the Respect for Child Survivors Act require the FBI to do?         The new legislation will require the FBI to use       multidisciplinary teams with trauma expertise when       investigating these types of cases, even in cases where the       victim is no longer a child.        The bill aims to make sure cases like this are not       prolonged like the Nassar investigation had been.        ``It takes tremendous courage for young victims of sexual       assault to tell their story and overcome the fear that they       may not be taken seriously, may be ignored, or may be       wrongfully blamed,'' said Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, one of       the bill's sponsors.        ``To avoid re-traumatizing victims during the investigation       process, it's imperative we give these individuals the       support they need to ensure survivors feel respected during       the interview process and abusers are prosecuted to the       fullest extent of the law.''        The bill was directly inspired by the testimony of former       Olympic gymnast McKayla Maroney, who was wrongfully treated       during FBI interviews about the scandal.        ``They had legal, legitimate evidence of child abuse and       did nothing,'' said Maroney at a Senate Judiciary Committee       hearing in Sept. 2021.     Mr. Speaker, this bill was inspired by the heroic  testimony of gymnast and survivor McKayla Maroney, who came before  Congress to share a story of the abuse she and more than 100 others  faced at the hands of Larry Nassar.   McKayla told Congress that when she was asked to speak to the FBI  about Nassar's abuse, she told them everything, she poured her heart  out to them. She spoke to FBI agents over the phone for 3 hours. Can  you imagine how painful that was, as she sat on the floor of her  bedroom recounting details of molestation--information she had not  shared with her mother?   She wanted to make a difference. She wanted to protect others. She  said it was the most uncomfortable conversation that she ever had in  her life. But she thought as uncomfortable as it was, she was making a  difference and, hopefully, protecting others from the same abuse. She  thought and trusted that they would act quickly for the sake of the  other girls. She waited and waited and waited and heard nothing. They  did nothing.                                time  1445    We know now that the FBI's failure to listen to McKayla and other  survivors allowed Nassar to continue his abuse, his torture of these  young, beautiful women and continue to molest them. Our outstanding  athletes who we cheer and are so proud when we are looking at the  Olympics, look what they had to suffer.   These young women made great sacrifices to pursue their sport and  represent the best of their country. They put their safety in the hands  of their coaches and their doctors and ultimately, the FBI, the people  who were all supposed to protect them but failed.   I am very grateful to Congressmen Costa and Gonzales and all the  sponsors in the Senate. As the chair of the Subcommittee on Crime,  Terrorism, and Homeland Security, we had a hearing dealing with the  human trafficking issues.   This is a mighty powerful bill. We hope that we will pass the no  trafficking zone bill in the other body that complements this because I  don't know if anybody realizes, this is a scourge, it is an epidemic.  This bill will provide for wraparound services so that whatever is said  by a child, that this can now be utilized to protect others. That is  what the no trafficking zone is about, and that is what we are trying  to protect.   As I close, Mr. Speaker, I want everybody to realize that just in the  last 24 hours they talked about a sextortion campaign against young  boys--where do they do it? Online. Where are children online? At  schools, among other places--to extort from children who are asked to  take pictures of themselves.   This legislation is crucial. The no trafficking zone legislation is  crucial. We hope that it will pass as well, and we are grateful for the  work that has been done.   Finally, let me say that I congratulate those who supported the Equal  Pay for Team USA Act for 2022. I couldn't support it even more.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 4926, the ``Respect for Child  Survivors Act.''   This bill was inspired by the heroic testimony of gymnast and  survivor McKayla Maroney, who came before Congress to share her story  of the abuse she and more than 100 others faced at the hands of Larry  Nassar.   McKayla told Congress that when she was asked to speak to the FBI  about Nassar's abuse, she told them everything. She spoke to FBI agents  over the phone for three hours as she sat on the floor of her bedroom,  recounting details of her molestation--information she had not even  shared with her mother.   She said, ``it was the most uncomfortable conversation I had ever had  in my life, but I thought as uncomfortable as it was, I was making a  difference, and hopefully protecting others from the same abuse . . . I  thought and trusted that they would act quickly for the sake of other  girls. I waited, and I waited and heard nothing.''   We know now that the FBI's failure to listen to McKayla and other  survivors allowed Nassar to continue his abuse and to molest more young  women.   These young women made great sacrifices to pursue their sport and  represent the best of their country. They put their safety in the hands  of their coaches, their doctors, and ultimately, the FBI--people who  were all supposed to protect them but failed.   McKayla is not alone in coming forward to bravely share her story so  that Congress can do better to protect victims and survivors of abuse.  In April, I convened the House Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on  Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Security for a hearing on federal  efforts to combat human trafficking.   At this hearing, we heard from survivors who explained the many  hurdles faced by those who are trafficked. These individuals came from  different parts of the country; they were different ages, ethnicities,  and genders; and they experienced different types of abuse and  trafficking, including both labor and sexual exploitation--but they  nonetheless had a great deal in common.   They often put their trust in an adult who was supposed to protect  them. They often told multiple people about their abuse before finding  someone who would help them escape. And they experienced significant  obstacles as they sought freedom, justice, and healing.   We must do more to make sure that the FBI is never an obstacle. The  treatment that McKayla and other survivors experienced at the hands of  the FBI never should have happened, and with this legislation, Congress  can ensure that it will not ever happen again.   The Respect for Child Survivors Act directs the FBI to use  multidisciplinary teams of trained experts to interview victims of  child sexual abuse or child trafficking. This is critical to providing  trauma-informed care and preventing further harm.   The bill also requires that victims are connected with advocates and  that critical information is shared with these advocates to support  victims' needs.   The bill encourages coordination with Children's Advocacy Centers,  which already have significant expertise in supporting the diverse  needs of child victims.   Lastly, the bill creates a case review process to ensure no victim or  investigation is forgotten.   This legislation is supported by the Rape, Abuse, & Incest National  Network; the National District Attorneys Association; Army of  Survivors; and the National Children's Alliance.   I thank Senators Cornyn, Coons, Grassley, and Klobuchar for their  leadership in bringing forth this bipartisan legislation in the Senate,  and I thank Congressman Costa and Congressman Gonzales for championing  the House companion.   While I hope that we continue to make progress in the fight to combat  human trafficking in the 118th Congress, it is my hope that the Senate  will pass my No Trafficking Zones Act, which already passed the House  this year with bipartisan support.   There is much more that we can and should do to support victims of  child abuse and human trafficking, and to prevent these horrible crimes  from occurring, but I am pleased that we are taking this important step  today.
