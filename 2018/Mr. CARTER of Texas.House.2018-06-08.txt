 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material in the further consideration of  H.R. 5895, and that I may include tabular material on the same.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to  the amendment, even though I am not opposed to it.    Mr. Chair, we understand the gentleman's  concerns, and we certainly will keep them in mind during conference.   Mr. Chair, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman  from Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz).    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to  [[Page H4987]]  the amendment, even though I am not opposed to it.    Mr. Chair, this bill includes $387 million for  opioid treatment and prevention efforts. We understand the gentleman's  concern, and we will keep them in mind during conference.   May I say, having been a criminal trial judge for many years, dealing  with prescription drug abuse and treating prescription drug abuse is  one of the hardest things we have to deal with in criminal law. There  is something about the mental attitude towards a prescription that  causes people to think it is safe.                                time  0930    This abuse that is going on in this country, we have to do something  about it, so I commend the gentleman.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition,  although I don't intend to oppose this amendment.    Mr. Chair, we understand and commend the  gentlewoman's concern about safeguarding the homeless programs. Looking  at what we have done, we have gotten in this bill $7.4 billion in  homeless veterans' treatment services, housing, and job training, and  we certainly are going to keep in mind, when we go to conference, what  the gentlewoman has presented us here today.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the  amendment, although I do not oppose the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, our bill includes $340 million for  the Supportive Services for Veteran Family Program, which is $20  million above the President's budget request. But we understand the  gentlewoman's concerns and we will certainly keep them in mind in  conference.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the  amendment, although I do not oppose the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, we understand that to allay  concerns regarding this proposed rule, the VA is planning to propose a  supplemental rule to amend it. But we will monitor the situation. As we  move to conference with the Senate, we will keep this in mind and be  glad to work the gentleman.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition,  although I will not oppose the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, the FY2018 omnibus included report  language asking the Army to look at alternatives for conveying this  property. We have yet to receive this report. This amendment has no  effect, as  [[Page H4994]]  the underlying bill does not include any funding for the conveyance of  this property.   Mr. Chairman, for that reason, I will not oppose the amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the  gentleman's amendment. I want to reassure my fellow Texans that this  subcommittee is committed to protecting the installations in the great  State of Texas, and I will be on top of that.
