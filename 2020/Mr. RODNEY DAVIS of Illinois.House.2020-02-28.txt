 Madam Speaker, I rise today to  congratulate Teresa Haley, who was honored as the Activist of the Year  at the NAACP Image Awards last week.   Teresa is the president of her local NAACP branch in Springfield,  Illinois, as well as the first female president of the NAACP Illinois  State Conference. She has worked tirelessly to advocate for the Black  community in Springfield and issues critical to NAACP members  nationwide.   I have had the pleasure of working closely with Teresa in an effort  to bring national recognition to the 1908 race riot site in Springfield  by declaring the site a national monument. Ultimately, the riots that  occurred at that site played an integral role in the formation of the  NAACP in 1909, just a year after the race riots in Springfield.   I am proud to recognize Teresa's fearless leadership, and I look  forward to continuing to work with her to bring this national  recognition to Springfield, Illinois.   Madam Speaker, I congratulate Teresa on this prestigious honor. I am  very proud of her.                            ____________________
