 Madam President, I am here to talk about two things.   First, let me give a heartfelt congratulations to Zaila Avant-garde,  this incredible--if we can get the poster up--14-year-old young lady,  who just won the Scripps National Spelling Bee.   She is Louisiana's first winner and is the first African-American  winner of this spelling bee. She dominated, getting words that I don't  think any of the rest of us would have been able to spell.   By the way, I should also note that she holds a Guinness World Record  for dribbling. I am told there is a YouTube video of her dribbling and,  at the same time, juggling basketballs that is incredible to watch.   She has a bright future. Zaila shows that hard work and dedication  bring success.   This week, Senator John Kennedy and I introduced a resolution  congratulating Zaila. And Zaila, if you are watching, if you want to do  it, when you are a little bit older and you want to do an internship in  a Senate office in the U.S. Senate, please give me a call. Believe me,  I will remember you.   And if you wish to do that internship, we are here to encourage you  as you embark on the rest of your life, a life that is going to be  incredibly successful.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Savannah  Tanguis, an intern in my office, be granted floor privileges today,  July 13, 2021.
