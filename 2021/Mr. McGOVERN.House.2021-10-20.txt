 Mr. Speaker, I just returned from leading a fact- finding delegation to Colombia from October 3 to 8.   I have traveled to Colombia a dozen times since 2001. This time, I  traveled to Cali, a city still reeling from intense protests this past  spring and the security forces' excessive response.   It was my second visit to Cali and my third to this specific region.  I met with the mayor of Cali, the Catholic archbishop, youth who had  protested, families whose children were killed during the protests,  local journalists, and human rights defenders.   I then traveled an hour south to the town of Santander de Quilichao  in northern Cauca. The Department of Cauca leads Colombia in killings  of social leaders and former combatants.   There, I met with the U.N. Verification Mission team monitoring  implementation of the peace accord and had a lengthy talk with the  town's mayor. I spent the most time with Afro-Colombian, indigenous,  campesino, women's, and LGBTQ organizations.   The next day, I visited the San Juan community in Sumapaz, a formerly  guerrila-controlled region in the Andes paramo, 3 hours south of  Bogota.   I traveled with representatives of Bogota's mayor, whose jurisdiction  includes Sumapaz. I saw water projects being carried out by campesinos,  indigenous, and former combatants. I attended a town meeting where  everyone was free to have their say.   In Bogota, I met with our embassy and President Duque, leaders of the  Colombian police, the U.N. and the OAS, the International Committee of  the Red Cross, U.S. and Colombian security analysts, Colombian members  of Congress, human rights defenders, and journalists.   I returned disturbed and worried, Mr. Speaker. I am deeply concerned  about the state of human rights, peace, and democracy in Colombia.   I will be listening closely to what U.S. officials say on these  matters at the high-level bilateral dialogue this week in Bogota.   The U.S. has spent over $8.2 billion in taxpayer money on military  and security support for Colombia since 2000. Yet, large parts of  Colombia aren't under government control or have been abandoned by the  state.   Human rights defenders and local leaders are targeted and killed.  Journalists are threatened and subject to illegal surveillance. The  drug trade is flourishing, and illegal armed groups grow in power.   I am especially concerned by the frustration and fears I heard from  organizations that have been fighting for peace for decades but today  feel that things are going in a wrong and very dangerous direction.   It is painful to remember the hope they felt during my last visit in  2017, as they made plans inspired by the peace accord and its promise  of progress.   For them, Colombia has taken a giant step backward, much greater than  understood from Washington before my trip.   Then there were protests this spring where we saw the Colombian  police react violently to legitimate demands for education, health,  food, and jobs. Demonstrators were shot with live ammunition by a  police force that receives U.S. aid.   ESMAD, the riot police, not a recipient of direct U.S. grant  assistance, because of its terrible human rights record, used crowd- control equipment to wound, maim, and kill demonstrators. Some of this  equipment was made in the U.S.A. and likely provided through commercial  sales, which I believe should immediately stop.   Mr. Speaker, what do you say to a woman who asks whether she is still  a mother because her only child was killed in the protests? How do you  comfort a father whose son served honorably with the Colombian military  only to die at the hands of the Colombian police?   I am also deeply concerned about the implementation of the 2016 peace  accord. The agreement provides a roadmap to address longstanding  problems in Colombia, including those that provoked the protests.   But it is a comprehensive agreement that must be carried out  holistically, not a few parts here and there, while ignoring,  undermining, or slow-walking the rest.   But there is reason for hope. In Sumapaz, I saw firsthand what a  committed local government and an organized community can accomplish to  establish peace, security, and development that benefits everyone, not  just a privileged few.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud of so many of our programs and projects in  Colombia. I treasure the friendship between the United States and  Colombia. As a friend and ally, it is critical that the U.S. speak  frankly and forcefully about setbacks to peace, the need for serious  police reform, and the dangerous human rights situation.   If we care about the people of Colombia and their human rights,  Congress has a responsibility to take a deep look at the situation  inside Colombia and reevaluate the priorities of our aid.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from numerous  nongovernmental organizations to Secretary of State Antony Blinken  concerning the upcoming high-level bilateral dialogue.                                                   October 18, 2021.      Secretary of State Antony Blinken,      The State Department,      Washington, DC.        Dear Secretary Blinken: As you travel to Colombia for the       high-level bilateral dialogue, we urge you to use this       opportunity to press the Colombian government for progress on       flagging peace accord implementation and for actions on       critical human rights issues, including improving the dire       situation of human rights defenders, advancing the rights of       Afro-Colombian and indigenous people, addressing the needs of       poor and landless farmers, and confronting the serious       problems of police brutality and racial injustice.        As organizations that have followed events in Colombia for       many years, many of us with programs and close partners in       the country, we are gravely disappointed that to date the       Biden Administration has not placed sufficient emphasis on       these issues and hope that your visit will mark a change. We       urge you to avoid public statements that praise the U.S.-      Colombian partnership while skirting over the deeply       disturbing patterns of human rights violations that should be       a major focus of U.S. concern and diplomacy.        Police brutality. In response to massive, largely peaceful       demonstrations against a regressive tax initiative,       unemployment, and social exclusion, Colombian security       forces, particularly the national police and the ESMAD riot       squad, killed and injured protesters, mainly teenagers and       young adults. Eighty-seven civilians were killed in the       course of the protests according to the Defender la Libertad       human rights campaign. Police shot live ammunition and       projectiles into crowds, including in one case into a group       of families and neighbors assembled for a candlelight vigil       for a young man killed the day before, causing major       injuries, loss of eyesight, and death. Police and ESMAD       targeted, along with protesters, human rights defenders,       journalists, and medical brigade members who provided first       aid to protesters and police. Police sexually abused young       women protesters and threatened women first aid responders       with rape. Family members of victims of police brutality and       human rights defenders seeking justice for police abuses are       stigmatized and their lives threatened. Following these       tragic events, rather than taking significant action to       advance dialogue, police reform, and prosecutions of abusive       security forces, the Colombian government has presented only       superficial police reforms and appears focused on       investigating and prosecuting protesters and those who helped       them. Few cases of security force abuses during the 2021       protests are moving forward in civilian courts; 13 homicide       cases involving security forces have been reported as       inappropriately in the military justice system, which rarely       results in justice.        Peace accord implementation and situation of human rights       defenders. The historic 2016 peace accords, a major legacy of       the Obama-Biden Administration due to its support for       negotiations, are at risk due to weak implementation. As of       September 2021, 292 FARC ex-combatants have been killed since       laying down their arms. Moreover Colombia remains one of the       most dangerous countries on earth to be a human rights       defender; 158 human rights defenders were killed so far this       year in 2021, according to the United Nations. For the second       year in a row, Colombia leads the world in murders of       environmental and land rights defenders, according to Global       Witness. Colombia's community leaders are in danger precisely       because they are building peace on the ground, while the       government has failed to implement its peace accord       commitments, including dismantling paramilitary networks,       protecting  [[Page H5679]]       communities, and bringing effective and rights-respecting       state presence into conflict zones. Peace accord       consolidation is especially weak in terms of implementing the       Ethnic Chapter and gender provisions; protection of human       rights defenders, social leaders, and communities;       dismantling paramilitary networks; protection of ex-       combatants; provision of adequate programs for farmers       committed to coca eradication, and implementation of the       comprehensive rural reform, including provision of land to       displaced persons, poor farmers, and indigenous and Afro-      Colombian people. While U.S. aid to advance peace accord       implementation is important and well-targeted, the failure to       advance peace accord implementation is not primarily a       question of resources, but of political will.        As you dialogue with the Colombian government, we ask you       to publicly as well as privately:        Insist, as a condition of any future U.S. security       assistance, that the Colombian government implement serious       police reform, including transferring the police from the       Defense Ministry to a civilian agency, ensuring all human       rights abuses by police are tried in civilian courts,       dismantling the ESMAD, revising use-of-force-protocols, and       establishing external oversight and controls over the police.       Limiting reforms to increasing human rights courses and       revising internal disciplinary procedures is not an adequate       response. The U.S. government should also encourage progress       on prosecuting cases in civilian courts against security       force members involved in abuses in the context of the       protests, raise concerns regarding specious or excessive       prosecutions of protesters, and urge the Colombian government       to respect the right to protest.        Urge the Colombian government to recommit to fully       implementing the peace accords. It is essential to maintain       U.S. diplomatic and financial support for implementing the       accords as the central framework for U.S. policy towards       Colombia. Please also express publicly support for the work       of the tripartite transitional justice system, namely the       Special Jurisdiction for Peace (JEP), the Truth Commission,       and the Search Unit for the Disappeared.        Express publicly your concerns about the grave dangers       faced by Colombian human rights defenders and social leaders       and emphasize the importance of their role in building peace       and defending the rule of law. U.S.-Colombia actions to       address climate change should also include protection of the       rights and lives of endangered environmental activists, who       are on the frontlines of efforts to protect the planet.        Urge the Colombian government to promptly and regularly       convene the National Commission on Security Guarantees       established by the peace accords, which should include       participation by civil society, government, and ex-      combatants, to develop and implement a plan for dismantling       paramilitary and other illegal armed networks and for       providing security to human rights defenders, communities,       and ex-combatants. This long-delayed commitment, central to       bring rights-respecting security to conflict zones and       protecting human rights defenders, must advance.        Urge the Colombian government to uphold the rights of Afro-      Colombian, indigenous, and Palenquero people. Ask the       Colombian government to prioritize implementing the peace       agreement's Ethnic Chapter. The government should convene the       Special High-Level Mechanism with Ethnic Peoples (IANPE),       mandated by the peace accords, to discuss the best methods to       implement the Ethnic Chapter and should work with Afro-      Colombian and indigenous authorities and civil rights groups       to guarantee its consolidation at the local and regional       level. In addition, urge the Colombian government to       implement the humanitarian accords with communities that       serve to protect such communities, ensure assistance and       protection to internally displaced persons, and address       racial discrimination including the Humanitarian Accord Now       in Choco. We would greatly welcome the revitalization of the       U.S.-Colombian Racial Action Plan (CAPREE) and the       development of a joint U.S.-Colombian strategy with specific       steps to address structural racism.        Urge the Colombian government to prioritize full and       effective implementation of provisions to achieve ``a genuine       structural transformation of the countryside'' as agreed       under the Comprehensive Rural Reform chapter of the peace       accords. This is critical to address the exclusion and       inequality in rural areas, particularly in access to land,       which is a root cause as well as a consequence of conflict in       Colombia. Only limited progress has been made in implementing       provisions to improve access to land, due in part to       administrative delays and inadequate allocation of resources,       and to a focus on formalizing tenure rather than       redistributing land. Peace is unlikely to be sustainable as       long as many poor, landless, marginalized, and displaced       rural families see no improvement in their lives and       livelihoods, which depend on access to land.        Urge the Colombian government to address the failure to       uphold its commitments outlined in the Labor Action Plan       (LAP) and ensure that labor rights are fully applied and       protected in Colombia. As detailed in the U.S. Department of       Labor's recently released Second Periodic Review of Progress       of the Colombia Labor Rights Complaint Submission dated       October 7, 2021, a number of issues and benchmarks of the       2017 Submission Report recommendations have not been       satisfactorily addressed and improved upon by the Colombian       government. As the lack of labor rights enforcement and       protection are an underlying factor in economic inequality       and civic unrest, advancement on labor rights issues is       critical and should be strongly emphasized by the U.S.       government with Colombia.        Insist on progress on reforms of Colombian military and       intelligence services, including to end persistent patterns       of surveillance over human rights defenders and other civil       society leaders, journalists, and judicial personnel. While       members of the military who committed gross human rights       violations can receive transitional justice benefits by       collaborating with the JEP and providing the truth about       their crimes, the Colombian government must still be urged to       provide accountability for the more than 6,000 extra-judicial       executions by members of the Colombian armed forces, largely       of poor young men executed and dressed up in guerrilla       uniforms to be claimed as enemy dead.        The United States should also uphold the peace accords       directly through its own policy choices. First, the United       States should support counternarcotics policy that abides by       the peace accords' drug policy chapter. Such support must       focus on working with small farmer communities to eradicate       and replace coca, providing sufficient support for such       farmers and communities to thrive, and must refrain from       employing harsh and ineffective tactics such as aerial       spraying. Restarting spraying will be seen as undermining the       accords and will drive away farmers from cooperating. The       peace accords emphasize dismantling drug trafficking and       money laundering networks, which are U.S. priorities. Second,       the United States should remove the Comunes Party from the       terrorist list. It is counterproductive to maintain on this       list ex-combatants who have shown their commitment to peace       for the last five years. It demonstrates an ambivalence       towards accords the United States helped to forge and hampers       the ability of the United States and partners to provide       support for reintegration and even for broader community       development programs in areas with ex-combatants' presence.        It is in the interests of both Colombia and the United       States that peace be consolidated, police and military become       more rights respecting, discrimination and violence against       Afro-Colombian and indigenous peoples end, and human rights       defenders be able to operate without fear for their lives.       Only by challenging the Colombian government to address these       serious underlying problems in Colombia can the United States       contribute to this more hopeful future.
