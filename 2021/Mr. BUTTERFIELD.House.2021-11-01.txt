 Madam Speaker, let me first thank Congresswoman  Leger Fernandez for her friendship and leadership, and thank her for  yielding time to me this afternoon.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1619, the Catawba Indian  Nation Lands Act.   A few moments ago, Congressman Clyburn made reference to the fact  that 1619 was a very significant number. What he was referring to,  Madam Speaker, was that it was the year 1619 that the first slaves  arrived in America--the first African slaves, I might say, arrived in  America.                                time  1615    It is very interesting that this bill bears that number, but I am in  full support of this legislation.   Madam Speaker, this is good, bipartisan legislation. You can see that  it has support on both sides of the aisle. It will ratify actions taken  by the Department of the Interior that placed 17 acres of land in North  Carolina that are within the Catawba's service area, as defined by  Congress in 1993, that land was placed into trust for the benefit of  the Tribe.   This bill would enable the Catawba Indian Nation to secure economic  self-sufficiency as envisioned by Congress in passing the Indian Gaming  Regulatory Act of 1987. It will generate millions of dollars in  economic development and create thousands of jobs in North Carolina,  where few jobs currently exist.   That, Madam Speaker, is why I have such a deep interest in this  legislation, because of the economic impact.   The Catawba Nation has already signed an agreement. I need to make  [[Page H6041]]  sure the record is clear about that. The Catawba Nation has already  signed an agreement with our Governor, Governor Roy Cooper, and they  have the support of the local community.   Madam Speaker, I respectfully urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on  this important legislation.    Madam Speaker, let me first thank Congresswoman  Leger Fernandez for her friendship, her extraordinary leadership, and  her passionate leadership. The gentlewoman is a wonderful member of  this body, and I thank her so much for all that she does. She and I  serve on another committee together, the Elections Subcommittee, and I  have seen her in action.    Madam Speaker, I thank all of our cosponsors of this legislation for  their support, both Democratic and Republican, including the Tribe's  Representative, Congressman  Dan Bishop from the Ninth District of  North Carolina, who is my friend.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of my bill, H.R. 2758, the  Lumbee Recognition Act, and I urge my colleagues to vote for its  passage.   Madam Speaker, the Lumbee Recognition Act will finally extend full  Federal recognition to the Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina and make its  members eligible for the same services and the same benefits provided  to members of other federally recognized Tribes.   Most importantly, the bill would establish, once and for all, the  Lumbee Tribe as an independent and sovereign entity under Federal law.   Madam Speaker, we have an opportunity before us to do the right thing  and fix a historic wrong by passing my bill. North Carolina has  recognized the Lumbee Tribe since 1885, and this body, the Congress,  recognized the Tribe in the 1950s but, during the dark days of the  termination era, refused to allow the Lumbee Tribe access to federally  funded services and benefits. What a shame.   Almost all Tribes that were ``terminated'' in this troubling era have  since been restored to Federal recognition. We are long overdue in  delivering the same justice to the Lumbee Tribe.   This legislation has tremendous bipartisan support inside and outside  North Carolina as demonstrated by a unanimous House vote to pass this  very bill last Congress and President Biden's support for full Federal  recognition of the Lumbee Tribe. Now is the time, Madam Speaker, to get  it done.   Madam Speaker, the merits of the Lumbee's claim for full Federal  recognition have long been accepted by our State of North Carolina,  academia, and the Federal Government. It is long past time for Congress  to give the Lumbee the respect they deserve and to treat them with the  fundamental fairness that has been withheld for so many years.   As Ms. Leger Fernandez said earlier, this is the first day of Native  American History Month. What an honor.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' and stand on the  right side of history.
