 Mr. Speaker, I rise in honor of a friend, Marca Bristo,  the brilliant advocate for people with disabilities. She passed away  recently at the age of 66.   In 1977, she became paralyzed from the chest down after a diving  accident at the age of 23. As she adjusted to life in a wheelchair, she  struggled to navigate in an often deeply inaccessible world.   Before long, she founded what is now Access Living, a Chicago-based  nonprofit organization focusing on service and advocacy for people with  disabilities. She served as CEO until shortly before her death.   Marca helped write the Americans with Disabilities Act, landmark  legislation that extended the Civil Rights Act to people with  disabilities. The bill was signed into law in 1990.   Four years later, President Clinton appointed her to serve as Chair  of the National Council on Disability, where she continued working to  increase accessibility and to fight disability discrimination.   Her work revolutionized disability rights. She melded an unparalleled  sense of legislative strategy with deep compassion for people with  disabilities.   We will remember her with pride as we continue to work to expand  disability rights.                            ____________________
