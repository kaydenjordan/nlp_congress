 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the great  progress my Democratic colleagues and I have made for our constituents  this Congress. We worked across the aisle to keep the government funded  and ensure our servicemembers continue to get paid. We fought against  reckless attempts to cut Social Security and Medicare and restrict  reproductive freedom.   Despite the endless chaos and political theater, we have never  stopped legislating, because at the end of the day, Oregonians sent me  here to get things done, and I can honestly say I am sticking to that  promise.   I have introduced six bipartisan bills and cosponsored dozens more.  Just last month, the House passed my first bill to restore land claims  and compensation rights to the Grand Ronde Tribe.   I am proud of the things we have accomplished in 2023, but there is  more work ahead of us. In the coming year, I urge my colleagues in both  parties to join me in pushing past the gridlock. Working together, we  can deliver real, tangible results for the American people.                            ____________________
