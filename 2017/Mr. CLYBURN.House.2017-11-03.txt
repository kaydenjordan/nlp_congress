Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from South Carolina?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, the Republicans have reserved a point of  order against this motion.   Let me be clear about what this means. The Republican leadership does  not want a vote on providing proper CHIP funds to our United States  territories, including Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.   There may be a point of order against this provision, but it is the  same point of order that applies to the Republicans' bill.   Do you know what that means?   They waive the point of order for their bill, but they will not waive  the point of order for this bill.   I won't take up too much time, Mr. Speaker. I just want the body to  know that the Republican leadership is, once again, rigging the game in  favor of the majority.   This isn't about hurting me and the Democratic Members of this body,  no. This hurts the people who are already struggling in Puerto Rico and  the Virgin Islands.                                time  1030    To my friends on the other side of the aisle, you may hide behind  procedural tactics, but the fact remains that doing so denies our  United States citizens living in the territories the proper funding  that the Governor has requested to recover   Mr. Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill which will not  kill the bill nor send it back to committee. If adopted, the bill will  immediately proceed to final passage as amended.   It has been 34 days, Mr. Speaker, since Republicans allowed the  Children's Health Insurance Program and Community Health Centers to  expire. These proven programs insure 9 million children and serve 27  million people.   The bill before us is the latest in a long line of cynical attempts  by President Trump and Republican Leaders to sabotage and undermine the  Affordable Care Act. We ought not be funding efforts to treat  infectious diseases like the flu and measles by taking away the funds  needed to prevent those illnesses from occurring in the first place.   Mr. Speaker, this bill turns on its head that adage, ``an ounce of  prevention is worth a pound of cure.'' Instead of joining President  Trump's campaign to sabotage the ACA, the Members of this body,  Republicans and Democrats, should join to reauthorize CHIP and CHCs for  5 years, fully paid for without robbing Peter to pay Paul.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 and clause 9 of rule  XX, this 15-minute vote on the motion to recommit will be followed by  5-minute votes on the question of passage of H.R. 3922, if ordered, and  approval of the Journal, if ordered.
