 Mr. President, this morning we got to hear the farewell  speech of my friend Lamar Alexander. He is a fantastic speaker and  legislator. It has been an honor to serve with him and to learn from  him. Now you get to hear from the accountant.   I rise today to give my farewell speech on the floor of the U.S.  Senate. It has been the honor of a lifetime to serve the great people  of Wyoming in this position for the last 24 years. I have really  enjoyed being a Senator--not for the title, not for the recognition,  and certainly not for the publicity.   I love solving problems for folks in Wyoming and America. I like  working on legislation. It might shock those who know me, but I never  intended to get into politics. While I always had great respect for  those who served in public office, it wasn't my calling when I left  college.   But over 50 years ago, when I joined the young men's leadership  training group known as the Jaycees, at a State convention in Cody I  spoke about the value of leadership in communities.   The keynote speaker was Al Simpson, who would go on to serve three  terms in the U.S. Senate. After I gave my pitch on the importance of  leadership training, Senator Simpson did his usual fascinating and  humorous speech and then took me aside and said: I don't even know what  party you are in, but it is time you put your money where your mouth is  on this leadership stuff and get into politics. That town you live in,  Gillette, needs a mayor.   My wife Diana and I had only moved to Gillette a few years earlier.  The town was facing a crisis as the discovery of oil, gas, and coal  turned it into a boomtown. The population started to skyrocket, and  city services were not keeping up.   On the way home from that Cody meeting, while my wife was driving, I  told her what Senator Simpson had said and that I was thinking maybe I  should run for mayor. It must have come as quite a shock because she  ended up swerving into the borrow pit and then coming back up onto the  road.   We ended up talking about it seriously for the 4 hours that it took  to drive back to Gillette and thought of a lot of things that needed to  be done to make a difference in our town.   I was new to the community and just 29 years old, but I thought that  Gillette was in need of a budget, agendas, and planning--not the most  exciting topics to get people's attention. I ran anyway, and I did win.   Nearly five decades later, having served as mayor, having served in  the State house, having served as a State senator and then as a U.S.  Senator, I still find myself motivated by the urge to help my community  and my country.   I also find myself still pushing those same three ideas that I did  when I first  [[Page S7158]]  ran for mayor: budgets, agendas, and planning. I keep finding myself  wanting to help solve problems. Once you embrace that responsibility,  it is hard to ever ignore it again. I have found that many of my  colleagues in Congress tend to feel the same way.   The Senate is a very different place than when I arrived in 1997, and  it is a very different place than it was in 1789 when the very first  Senate met. But over all those years, it has been a place for folks  rising to the challenge of being a leader. We are looking to make our  communities and country a better place. We might not always agree on  what the solutions are, but we can respect each other for working to  find one.   Over the years, I have learned a great deal from those around me.  Just like I listened to Senator Al Simpson all those years back, I have  tried to keep an open mind to learning from others.   Now that my time in the Senate is coming to a close, I would like to  pass along some of the lessons I was taught--and some I learned the  hard way--in the hopes that it may be useful for my colleagues working  to get things accomplished in the Senate and for anybody who wants to  be a leader in their community.   In my office we have a mission statement. It reads:         We have been given a sacred trust to work for our families,       grandparents, and grandchildren. We will respect the wisdom       of those before and the future of those to follow. We will       discharge this trust through our legislative policy, our       constituent services, and the way we treat each other, guided       by these three principles:        Doing What Is Right        Doing Our Best        Treating others as They Wish to be Treated    These last three principles are advice my mom gave me often, and they  remain my core values. Every member of my staff is given that mission  statement when they start, and we rely on it to remind us why we are  here and how we should act.   It isn't just a saying. It is a way to work, a way to build trust,  and a way to govern. These values are not always easy to live by. We  are all human, and we all struggle to live up to these ideals we set  for ourselves, but that is why we call them ideals.   I believe these are values we can all agree on, and by remembering  the values we share, we can work together to tackle tough problems and  find shared solutions.   ``Do what is right'' is a great slogan, but you might ask what it  means at a practical level. People see a mess in Washington, so how do  we actually make progress? I believe it involves focusing on common  ground over compromise, especially when it comes to legislating.   People sometimes think that compromise is the answer. I think it  means that I give in to something I don't like, and you give in to  something you don't like, and we both wind up with something neither of  us likes. That is not legislating.   When it comes to legislating, often the best way to get something  done that everyone can agree on is to leave out the things you don't  agree on and focus on what you can get done. That is why I suggest my  80 percent tool.   Generally speaking, people can talk civilly on 80 percent of the  issues. It is only on about 20 percent of the issues that we find real  contention. Now, even picking a single issue out of the 80 percent, you  might still find disagreement, but once again, you can probably focus  on 80 percent of the issue that you can agree on.   It is all about focusing on what you can get done and not focusing on  the points of disagreement, the weeds of debate that have choked  issues, or, to say it another way, it is all about what you leave out.   Former Senator Ted Kennedy, from Massachusetts, and I used this tool  when we led the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee  together, and it worked great. It worked even though we were on  complete opposite sides of the political spectrum.   I once showed Senator Kennedy an article that mentioned how unusual  it was for the most conservative Senator and the third most liberal  Senator to work together, to which he said: So who is ahead of me?   We were able to get legislation passed that others had been trying to  do for years. Here is how we started working together. When I first got  to the Senate, I wanted to change some things with OSHA--the  Occupational Safety and Health. Senator Kennedy, at the urging of my  predecessor, Senator Simpson, did let me sit down and take him through  the bill a section at a time. That is something we always did in the  Wyoming Legislature. When we marked up the bill in committee, Senator  Kennedy said: In all my years in the Senate, I have never had anybody  take me through a bill a section at a time, but I am still going to  have to vote against it. It still got out of committee. But later he  called me about a safety bill he had been working on for over a  decade--a bill to save nurses and medical janitors from accidental  needlesticks--and asked if I would take a look at it. I did. The  biggest suggestion that I gave was to leave out a couple of small parts  that had been jamming up the bill. The bill passed the Senate and the  House unamended and was signed. And now you see needle disposals in  restrooms and all sorts of places. And the issue has never had to be  readdressed.   Later, I became the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions chair, and  Senator Kennedy was the ranking member. We used the 80-percent tool. We  were able to get 35 bills through the HELP Committee in the 109th  Congress. Twenty-seven of them made their way to the President's desk  and were signed into public law. In between, we were able to report out  352 nominations for consideration by the full Senate.   Here is how the 80-percent tool worked. At the beginning of each  year, each of us made a list of the issues the committee should do. We  compared lists. We made an effort to argue some to be on both lists.  Then we worked on the ones on both lists. We usually had a duplication  of about 80 percent of the issues. Then we could pick out any issue and  work on it, usually agreeing on 80 percent of that issue. If we  couldn't find a new way to do the part that had been argued for years,  we simply left it out, believing that 80 percent finished is better  than 20 percent that only makes the press.   The 80-percent tool is where all of our energy, attention, and  talents could be focused. If we just worked on the 20 percent that we  don't agree on, and never will agree on, we will only generate  headlines about how hard we are working, with nothing actually getting  done, just gridlock.   When the news comes on, if we are here in the Chamber arguing and  bickering and getting nothing done, we are focusing too much on the 20  percent. If people do not see much of us, that means we are taking on  the 80 percent and making progress without headlines and often with  unanimous consent.   What we are really talking about is working together. That is what  the heart of the 80-percent tool is. Oftentimes, people say what we  need is more bipartisanship, and there is a very practical reason for  that. In the Senate, you can't get anything done without working with  the other side unless one party has 60 votes or more, which is rare.  And even with 60 votes from one party, the bills that party passes when  they have a supermajority often are flawed. It turns out that when we  work together, we can create a better bill than when we just try do it  alone or force others to accept our ideas. That is why success is not  really about compromise. It is really about what you leave out--or  finding a way to accomplish it doing a mutually agreeable new way.   We used to take the people who had similar amendments and send them  off to see if they could come up with one amendment. Quite often, they  could. It was fascinating, when they came back, they said: It was my  idea. And when all of them report to you that it was their idea, you  know that you have enough votes to pass it.   That is why success is not really about compromise; it is about what  you leave out or finding a third way to come up with a mutually  agreeable goal. Here are a few key steps that I used to find that  common ground to pass legislation. First, find someone from the other  side of the aisle who likes to legislate.   Second, discover and agree on common goals.   Third, consult with stakeholders that will or could affect the  changes being discussed.  [[Page S7159]]    Fourth, hold roundtables instead of hearings. With hearings, each  side beats up on the other's witness with clever, stump-the-professor- type questions. At a roundtable, people who have actually done  something on a policy share their real-life experiences.   Finally, you set aside the part of the issues you can't agree on for  another day. Now you will have a bill that has a good chance of being  passed and signed into law. That is the heart of the 80-percent tool.   This way of working also ensures that we can disagree without being  disagreeable. There is a lot of vitriol in our politics and our world  right now, but you can stay true to what you believe in without  treating others badly. Nothing gets done when we are just telling each  other how wrong we are. Just ask yourself, has anyone ever really  changed your opinion by getting in your face and yelling at you or  saying how wrong you are? Usually, that doesn't change hearts or minds.  That might make the attacker feel better in the moment, but it doesn't  do much for getting anything accomplished. Following the 80-percent  tool will not get you notoriety. It won't get you fame. It won't get  you headlines. Most media coverage requires ``blood in the water.''  However, the ability to work among your peers using this method can,  and will, move us forward and get things done.    This tool is only successful if we are actually working on passing  legislation together, and that means letting the Senate work as it was  intended. One of the best ways to do that is to allow the members of  each committee to actually take time to craft bills. The committees are  where the experts are and where I think some of the best work gets  done. I have already made it clear that I don't think hearings are  overly useful and are often wasted on collecting soundbites for the  evening news. Instead, we should be encouraging committees to give  their members more say in crafting legislation and working together on  best solutions. If you look at bills that pass with strong bipartisan  support, they are usually because flaws were ironed out in committee.  Legislation is oftentimes at its best when it has taken time in  committees being hashed out until it is ready for prime time. You might  not always be able to get everyone on board, but if you have done it  right, you should see strong bipartisan support.   Sometimes this also means letting others take credit for your ideas.  An old salesman's trick is to convince others that your good idea was  really their good idea. Don't let your vanity stand in the way of  getting the job done.   Too often, in the modern Senate, legislation is rushed out of  committee to the Senate floor. And then once it hits the Senate floor,  both sides try to prevent amendments, but the process of allowing  amendments and debates is a core component of how the Senate was  designed to operate. Without it, the Senate can get gummed up. The  gears can get jammed. Without the fresh air that new ideas and  legitimate debate brings, tensions can rise as Senators feel unable to  make progress.   The difficulty is that each party is so worried about the next  election, looking to hold on to the majority, that everybody is either  trying to force the other side to take politically perilous votes or  trying to avoid taking those votes themselves. No matter which party is  in charge, we end up blocking amendments and shying away from allowing  legislation to be altered on the floor of the Senate. And usually those  tough votes don't really make any difference.   It might help if Members made it clear to leadership they would be  willing to take some tough votes in return for more chances to amend  major legislation on the floor. People might be less likely to demand  votes on a poison pill or messaging designed to put the other party in  a tough spot if they knew they could face the same treatment. In the  end, the onus is on the Members of the Senate, on us, to take on a  responsibility to work together in return for a chance to pass  legislation. I suggest that amendments should have to have 60 votes. If  it was so bad that it needed a filibuster, the 60 votes would be  required to end that. But that takes about 3 days. So many have been  willing to allow their amendment to have a 60-vote threshold, and if it  was strong enough, it passed anyway.   I also ask you to avoid comprehensive. Comprehensive bills make it so  large that everyone can find a reason to vote against it. Senator  Alexander is a big promoter of step-by-step. That is taking a piece of  legislation and solving it, and then taking the next step and solving  it, and so on. This practical solution would avoid passing  comprehensive legislation. Comprehensive legislation is usually a  byproduct of compromise, not common ground, and often ends up being  incomprehensible. Giant bills that try to do everything usually end up  with too many unintended consequences and include a litany of unrelated  pieces of legislation that are merely hitching a ride because otherwise  they would never be able to stand on their own merits.   These ``Christmas tree'' bills are often designed so that if you vote  against it, you would be voting against some key legislation for your  constituents. Once again, the ugly nature of compromise over common  ground is clear.   A simple solution I have proposed would be to pass more bills as  individual pieces of legislation, that step-by-step. In Wyoming, bills  have to be focused on a single subject, and all amendments need to be  relevant. In the past, I have introduced a bill that would require that  here, but it never was really treated seriously.   To talk on a little different article, my favorite article of the  Constitution is article V. The reason it is, is it assures that all  States will have equal representation in the Senate. And that can't  even be changed by a constitutional Congress. Since I come from one of  those low-population States, it is very important to us. Sometimes we  are criticized for being overrepresented in the Senate. We have two  Senators, the same as California, New York, and Texas. But in this  argument of unfair representation for States, we find the same inherent  issues we do with the filibuster; our government was not set up to be  majority rule by population alone. Our Founders, through their own  debate, were able to understand the risk of pure democracy and the  benefits of a federalist system, where ideas were represented not just  by population but by regions and shared cultures. Wyomingites deserve  to have their cultural say in our system protected against the  majority. We are all in the United States of America.   The Senate represents more than just the people. To protect the  individuality of the States, of the culture of those who live in the  regions of the country less populated, and it also represents States  that founded our federalist system. Of course, at that time, several of  them had little population.   I have covered a lot of ground, but for my last piece of advice, I  would call on my colleagues to recognize that it is time to formally  allow electronics on the floor of the U.S. Senate. It is an issue near  and dear to my heart and one I think will help how we work in the  Senate. It is clear that anyone who watches C-SPAN that all of us are  already breaking the spirit of the law, checking our phones on occasion  as we walk off or onto the floor. Those devices are often inseparable  from our ability to do our work. We rely on them to do almost  everything. It is time to make this commonsense change, allowing iPads  to be used for speeches, as long as they are laid on the lectern like a  paper speech. And if Senators could do some work from their desks, like  early Senators had to do, we would listen to more of the speeches and  get something done.   I do remember when I brought that one up before, that it was covered  by--in 1997, I thought it was important that we have that use. TIME  magazine did a special article on it. I remember Senator McConnell  going to New York City and coming back to report to me that he got in a  cab and the cabdriver said: You are a United States Senator, aren't  you? Of course, he proudly was. The guy said: So when are you going to  let the guy from Wyoming have his computer on the floor? Senator  McConnell told me if I had lobbied it down to cabbies, that it was time  to do it. But we still haven't done it.   As we move forward, of course, our country has no shortage of  problems we need to address. Some are out of our control, but many of  our own making. If my experience over the years has taught me anything,  it is that we will  [[Page S7160]]  never be able to tackle these challenges unless we find common areas of  agreements and work to solve these problems together.    I hope that everyone listening--especially my colleagues in the  Senate--remembers the core values I spoke of today: Do what is right.  Do what is best. Treat others as they wish to be treated.   I truly believe if we adhered to these ideals, the world would be a  better place for our children and grandchildren.   I want, again, to thank the people of Wyoming for giving me the  opportunity to serve them. I also want to thank my colleagues and  friends who supported me over the years. I want to thank all the  amazing staff I have had over the years in my personal office, in the  DC office, in my State offices in Wyoming; and my staff on the Health,  Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee and on the Budget Committee.  Over the years, I have gotten to work with incredible staff that made  it possible to do more than a Senator by himself or herself could ever  do. Thank you for working so hard over the years.   I also want to give the most thanks to my family for all of their  support over the years, especially to my wife Diana. It has been a long  journey since I told Diana that I was thinking of running for mayor.   You have supported me more than anyone can truly comprehend, and, in  no uncertain terms, I couldn't have done it without you. It has been  more than 50 amazing years together, and I look forward to our next  adventure.   I yield the floor.   (Applause, Senators rising.)    Mr. President, I just want to thank all the people who came  and listened, and I hope there were other Senators who were watching on  their televisions and taking notes on the 80-percent tool and other  things that I mentioned.   But I just appreciate the friendships that I have had here. I have no  qualms about leaving because of the quality of people who will still be  here, still solving problems for America.   There is some great teamwork that never gets any publicity but that  actually functions around here, and I can't thank my friends enough,  particularly Senator Barrasso, who has been a part of this team and has  helped to bring me along. I have learned a lot from him and gotten to  do a lot with him, and he and his wife are good friends of ours. It is  not all that common to be good friends with the other person in your  delegation, but we have a strong delegation and get along well that  way.   I want to thank Senator Whitehouse for his comments and particularly  his promise that he is going to get some reform done so that the  committee is actually doing what everybody thinks it does--providing a  budget that we will follow. Those were goods reform principles that we  put together.   I have always said that the only time we are going to have reform to  the budget is if we can do it just before a Presidential election year  because nobody knows who is going to be in the majority in the Senate  and the House, and nobody knows who is going to be the President.  Otherwise, we want to make sure that we can keep all of the control for  our party that we can.   I want to thank Senator Blunt. I actually remember trying to get some  local food and running into Senator Blunt, who was also looking for  local food overseas, and so we had local food together. That was our  first year in Congress. I have known him for a long time, and I  appreciate your comments.   So thank you, everybody. Thank you, all the people from Wyoming.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
