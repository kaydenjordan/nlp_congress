 Mr. President, this amendment is called the Protecting IP  Act. It is a bipartisan amendment that will help increase enforcement  of the United States and China phase one trade deal.   This deal put in place important protections for America's  intellectual property, the research inventions, copyrights, and more.   China has been a notorious and serial abuser of American intellectual  property for decades, and that is why the phase one deal put in place a  number of important safeguards. Unfortunately, China has not lived up  to their end of the deal. It is critical that we hold China accountable  for its commitments.   As we debate increasing investment in advanced research, we cannot  look the other way and allow China to continue to steal American  intellectual property. That is why I introduced this bipartisan  Protecting IP amendment with Senator Cortez Masto, to ensure the  President and the USTR uses all available tools to enforce the phase  one agreement.   We are in a race against China and must remain globally competitive.  That is why I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense and  bipartisan agreement.    Madam President, today I have the honor of  recognizing the life of a great man, William ``Billy'' Jordan Jarrell.  Billy passed away on May 11, 2021, after suffering from juvenile  diabetes since he was 12.   Billy was part of a large, loving family. He was a beloved brother,  son, cousin, and uncle. Growing up, Billy could often be found on the  baseball field, where he excelled and was even inducted into the Major  League Baseball Hall of Fame in a section dedicated to Little League.  He was also an avid Alabama football fan. Former teammates, classmates,  and coworkers all miss him greatly.   I am thankful for the passion that Billy showed for public service  and grateful for the time that he dedicated to advocating for a range  of issues including energy and Native American issues.   It is my honor to pay tribute to Billy, who was loved by many. I pray  that his friends and family find peace in this hard time.                            ____________________
