 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to honor my friend Patty Rose  for her decades of service to the working people of Pierce County,  Washington.   Born and raised in Tacoma, Patty began her journey at the Service  Employees International Union in 1974 where she held various roles,  eventually becoming a union representative advocating for workers'  rights.   In 1981, Patty joined the Pierce County Central Labor Council,  serving as a delegate and executive board member before her election as  the first female secretary-treasurer.   In this role, she has worked passionately to improve wages, benefits,  and working conditions, making Pierce County a national leader in union  membership with rates twice the national average.   Patty has emphasized inclusivity by partnering with communities often  marginalized and increasing apprenticeship opportunities for young  people.   Her empowering leadership has significantly shaped our community and  helped workers. I am grateful for her partnership and her friendship  and her invaluable advice throughout my career.   As Patty retires, we will miss her presence, but I am happy to report  that she can enjoy more time with her family and traveling in her RV.   Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to recognize Patty Rose's remarkable  career. I wish her a well-deserved retirement.  [[Page H1959]]                                ____________________
