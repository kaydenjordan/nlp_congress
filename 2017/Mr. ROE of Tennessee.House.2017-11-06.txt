 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 3562) to amend title 38, United States Code, to  authorize the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to furnish assistance for  adaptations of residences of veterans in rehabilitation programs under  chapter 31 of such title, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3562         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

(a) In General.--Chapter 21 of title 38, United States       Code, is amended by inserting after section 2102A the       following new section:       ``Sec. 2102B. Adaptations to residences of veterans in         rehabilitation programs         ``(a) In General.--Subject to subsections (b) and (c), the       Secretary may assist a veteran who is entitled to services       and assistance under chapter 31 of this title and is pursuing       a rehabilitation program under such chapter in acquiring such       adaptations to such veteran's residence as are determined       necessary by the Secretary to accomplish the purposes of such       rehabilitation program.        ``(b) Amount.--(1) The aggregate amount of assistance       available to a veteran under subsection (a) may not exceed       $77,307. The Secretary may waive this limitation for a       veteran if the Secretary determines a waiver is necessary for       the rehabilitation program of the veteran.        ``(2) Effective on October 1 of each year (beginning in       2017), the Secretary shall increase the amount described in       paragraph (1) by the percentage calculated under section       2102(e)(2) of this title.        ``(3) Beginning on October 1, 2019, the Secretary shall       submit to the Committees on Veterans' Affairs of the Senate       and House of  [[Page H8503]]       Representatives a biennial report on the use of the waiver       authority under paragraph (1).        ``(c) Regulations.--The Secretary shall prescribe such       regulations as may be necessary to carry out this section.        ``(d) Rehabilitation Program Defined.--In this section, the       term `rehabilitation program' has the meaning given such term       in section 3101 of this title.''.        (b) Regulations.--The Secretary may provide assistance       under section 2102B of such title, as added by subsection       (a), in advance of regulations by issuing notice specifying       the criteria for the application, approval, and oversight       processes relating to the provision of assistance under such       section.

(2) Members of the armed forces residing outside the united       states.--Section 2101A of such title is amended--        (A) by redesignating subsection (c) as subsection (d); and        (B) by inserting after subsection (b) the following new       subsection (c):        ``(c) Limitation.--Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b),       this section shall not apply to the provision of assistance       under section 2102B of this title.''.

(d) Clerical Amendment.--The table of sections at the       beginning of chapter 21 of such title is amended by inserting       after the item relating to section 2102A the following new       item:  ``2102B. Adaptations to residences of veterans in rehabilitation                programs.''.     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, this is the type of legislation that I am proud members  of our committee continue to bring forward. While it is not as flashy  as the GI Bill package we passed earlier this year or Care in the  Community legislation we are working on later this week, this bill gets  to the core of what this Congress should be about: making it easier for  disabled veterans to receive the benefits they have earned.   I commend Mr. Arrington and Mr. O'Rourke for looking at a challenge  and working with the administration and veterans groups to craft this  important bill.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 3562.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in  supporting this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, once again, I encourage all  Members to support this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 1066) to direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs  to submit to the Committees on Veterans' Affairs of the Senate and the  House of Representatives a report regarding the organizational  structure of the Department of Veterans Affairs, and for other  purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1066         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``VA Management Alignment Act       of 2017''.       SEC. 2. REPORT ON THE ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE OF THE                     DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS.         (a) Report.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the       enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs       shall submit to the Committees on Veterans' Affairs of the       Senate and the House of Representatives a report (including       recommendations for legislation the Secretary considers       appropriate) regarding the roles, responsibility, and       accountability of elements and individuals of the Department       of Veterans Affairs.        (b) Matters Included.--In creating the report under       subsection (a), the Secretary shall--        (1) utilize the results of--        (A) the Independent Assessment of the Health Care Delivery       Systems and Management Process of the Department of Veterans       Affairs established by section 201 of the Veterans Access,       Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014 (Public Law 113-146);        (B) any study or report by the Commission on Care       established by section 202 of the Veterans Access, Choice,       and Accountability Act of 2014 (Public Law 113-146); and        (C) other studies or reports, including a report titled       ``Task Force on Improving Effectiveness of VHA Governance:       Report to the VHA Under Secretary for Health'', dated       February 28, 2015; and        (2) specify clearly delineated roles and responsibilities       to optimize the organizational effectiveness and       accountability of each--        (A) Administration, staff office, or staff organization;        (B) subordinate organization of each Administration, staff       office, or staff organization; and        (C) key leader of the Department in relation to any       Administration, staff office, or staff organization, Veteran       Integrated Service Network, or medical facility.        (c) Definition.--In this Act, the term ``key leader of the       Department'' includes--        (1) the Secretary;        (2) the Deputy Secretary;        (3) each Under Secretary;        (4) each Assistant Secretary;        (5) each Deputy Assistant Secretary;        (6) the Chief Financial Officer;        (7) the Chief Information Officer;        (8) the General Counsel;        (9) the Inspector General;        (10) the Director of Construction and Facilities       Management;        (11) the Chief of Staff;        (12) the Chairman of the Board of Veterans' Appeals;        (13) the Vice Chairman of the Board of Veterans' Appeals;        (14) the Director of each Veterans Integrated Service       Network; and        (15) the Director of each medical facility.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend  their remarks and to include extraneous material on H.R. 1066.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, in just a few days, Americans will once again take time  to remember and honor the sacrifices of the very few of our fellow  Americans who have sworn a solemn oath to defend this great Nation.   As an Army Medical Corps veteran myself, I am proud that, with the  support of leadership and Members of both sides, we will pass a series  of bills today and tomorrow that improve the delivery of healthcare and  enhance the benefits available to America's veterans.   On our first bill, H.R. 1066, the VA Management Alignment Act, issues  with the organization and management of the Veterans Health  Administration and the Department of Veterans Affairs, in general, are  nothing new. In 2015, the independent assessment found VA's  organizational structure to be unnecessarily complex, rampant with  mistrust and risk aversion, confused about priorities and strategic  direction, and hampered by a workforce that was losing motivation and a  leadership team that was overwhelmed by crisis management. In 2016, the  Commission on Care found VA to have one of the lowest organizational  health scores in all of the Federal Government and lacking effective  national policies and a rational organizational structure.   Similar findings have been made by veterans, veterans service  organizations, VA employees, the Government Accountability Office, the  VA inspector general, and others in countless reports and testimony and  stories over the last several years. They have also been common themes  in the recent oversight hearings and site visits.   In order to improve the care, benefits, and services that VA provides  to our Nation's veterans and increase accountability for poor- performing employees, VA must first clarify and rationalize the  Department's organizational structure and the roles, responsibilities,  and lines of authority for supervisors, managers, and employees.   H.R. 1066 would jump-start that effort by requiring the VA to use the  work the independent assessment, the Commission on Care, and others  have already done to create a report on how the Department is to be  structured--to include clearly defined roles and responsibilities of  key leaders across all  [[Page H8505]]  levels--and submit it to Congress for review.   I am grateful to Representative Kilmer for sponsoring this  legislation. I urge all of my colleagues to support it.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R.  1066, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I encourage all Members to support  this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 3122) to protect individuals who are eligible for  increased pension under laws administered by the Secretary of Veterans  Affairs on the basis of need of regular aid and attendance from  dishonest, predatory, or otherwise unlawful practices, and for other  purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3122         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Veterans Care Financial       Protection Act of 2017''.       SEC. 2. SECRETARY OF VETERANS AFFAIRS NOTICE OF DISHONEST,                     PREDATORY, OR OTHERWISE UNLAWFUL PRACTICES                     TARGETING INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR                     INCREASED PENSION ON BASIS OF NEED FOR REGULAR                     AID AND ATTENDANCE.         (a) Notice Required.--The Secretary of Veterans Affairs       shall include on the internet website of the Department of       Veterans Affairs a warning to veterans relating to dishonest,       predatory, or otherwise unlawful practices targeting       individuals who are eligible for increased pension under       chapter 15 of title 38, United States Code, on the basis of       need for regular aid and attendance.        (b) GAO Study.--        (1) Study required.--Not later than 18 months after the       date of the enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General of       the United States shall complete a study on financial       exploitation of veterans. Such study shall include--        (A) an analysis of the types of standards used by Federal       and State agencies intended to protect vulnerable populations       from financial exploitation; and        (B) an analysis of the types of financial exploitation       facing veterans who are eligible for increased pension under       chapter 15 of title 38, United States Code, on the basis of       need for regular aid and attendance and any gaps in efforts       to address these issues.        (2) Reports.--        (A) Preliminary report.--Not later than one year after the       date of the enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General       shall submit to Congress a preliminary report on the study       required under paragraph (1).        (B) Final report.--Not later than 18 months after the date       of the enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General shall       submit to Congress a final report on such study.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 3122, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3122, as amended, the  Veterans Care Financial Protection Act.   Mr. Speaker, VA offers an additional pension benefit called Aid and  Attendance, or A&A, to some disabled or elderly veterans who need help  with activities of daily living such as dressing or bathing.   It may come as a shock to many Americans, but there are people out  there who actually take advantage of elderly and disabled veterans by  charging them money to help them apply for A&A benefits when the  application process is free. If veterans need help  [[Page H8506]]  filling out the application, veterans service organizations like The  American Legion, Disabled American Veterans, VFW, and others will help,  at no charge, even if the veteran is not a member of the organization.   Unfortunately, there are many veterans who don't know that the free  help is available and, more importantly, that it is illegal to charge  them a dime to file a claim. So some veterans may end up falling prey  to these dishonest individuals.   H.R. 3122 would help educate veterans and their families by requiring  VA to post warnings on its website about scammers who actually take  money from our Nation's most vulnerable veterans for a service that  should be free.   The bill would also require GAO to conduct a study and submit a  report to Congress on how to better protect vulnerable veterans from  being taken advantage of.   With that, Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to join me in  supporting H.R. 3122, as amended, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I want to associate my remarks to  the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Cartwright). He is absolutely 100  percent correct. To have a vulnerable veteran, an elderly veteran in  need who served this country, maybe in World War II, Korea, Vietnam,  and then to have them taken advantage of is incomprehensible to me.   Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I am prepared to close.  I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, once again, I encourage all  Members to support this needed legislation, and I yield back the  balance of my time.   THE SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Roe) that the House suspend the rules and  pass the bill, H.R. 3122, as amended.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  [[Page H8507]]  rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.   The title of the bill was amended so as to read: ``A bill to direct  the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to include on the internet website of  the Department of Veterans Affairs a warning regarding dishonest,  predatory, or otherwise unlawful practices targeting individuals who  are eligible for increased pension on the basis of need for regular aid  and attendance, and for other purposes.''.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 3656) to amend title 38, United States Code, to  provide for a consistent eligibility date for provision of Department  of Veterans Affairs memorial headstones and markers for eligible  spouses and dependent children of veterans whose remains are  unavailable, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3656         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. ELIGIBILITY OF VETERANS' SPOUSES AND DEPENDENT                     CHILDREN WHOSE REMAINS ARE UNAVAILABLE FOR                     DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS MEMORIAL                     HEADSTONES AND MARKERS.         Section 2306(b)(2) of title 38, United States Code, is       amended--        (1) in subparagraph (B), by striking ``The'' and inserting       ``An individual who dies on or after November 11, 1998, who       is the''; and        (2) in subparagraph (C), by striking ``An'' and inserting       ``An individual who dies on or after November 11, 1998, who       is an''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 3656, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3656, as amended.   Under current law, VA may provide a memorial headstone or marker for  a veteran's dependent child or surviving spouse if their remains are  unavailable. But this law also contains an inconsistency. VA can  provide a memorial headstone or marker for a spouse who dies on or  after November 11, 1998, but can only provide one for a dependent child  who dies on or after December 22, 2006.   The disparity makes it difficult for VA to administer this law. More  importantly, it has led to some confusion among veterans and their  families as to whether a particular family member is eligible for this  benefit or not.   These families are not just mourning, but they are also coping with  the heartbreak of not being able to properly lay their loved one to  rest because the remains have not been recovered. I am concerned that  it is possible that these families may not request a memorial VA  headstone or marker because they aren't sure if they qualify. I hope  that this bill will bring these families some peace by allowing VA to  provide a permanent memorial marker to ensure their loved one will not  be forgotten.   H.R. 3656 would help avoid confusion by making the eligibility dates  for the memorial markers consistent for surviving spouses and dependent  children. This may seem like a small change, but I know it will be very  important to grieving families who want to ensure that their loved ones  are properly memorialized.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting  H.R. 3656, as amended, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from Indiana (Mr. Banks), an active member of the Committee on  Veterans' Affairs and a Navy veteran.    Mr. Speaker, once again, I encourage all  Members to support this commonsense piece of legislation, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 3657) to amend title 38, United States Code, to  authorize the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to provide headstones and  markers for the graves of spouses and children of veterans who are  buried in tribal cemeteries, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3657         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. ELIGIBILITY OF SPOUSES AND CHILDREN OF VETERANS                     BURIED IN TRIBAL CEMETERIES FOR CERTAIN                     DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS BURIAL BENEFITS.         Section 2306 of title 38, United States Code is amended--        (1) in subsection (a)(4), by inserting ``or a veterans'       cemetery owned by a tribal organization or on tribal land       owned by or held in trust by a tribal organization'' after       ``State'';        (2) in subsection (b)(1), by inserting ``, a veterans'       cemetery of a tribal organization or on tribal land owned by       or held in trust by a tribal organization'' after ``owned by       a State''; and        (3) in subsection (f)--        (A) by redesignating paragraphs (1) and (2) as       subparagraphs (A) and (B), respectively;        (B) by striking ``The Secretary'' and inserting ``(1) The       Secretary'';        (C) by striking ``a national cemetery or in a veterans       cemetery of a State or tribal organization for which the       Department has provided a grant under section 2408 of this       title'' and inserting ``a covered cemetery''; and        (D) by adding at the end the following:        ``(2) The term `covered cemetery' means any of the       following:        ``(A) A national cemetery.        ``(B) A veterans' cemetery of a State for which the       Department has provided a grant under section 2408 of this       title.        ``(C) A veterans' cemetery of a tribal organization or on       tribal land owned by or held in trust by a tribal       organization for which the Department has provided a grant       under such section.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 3657, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3657, as amended.   VA provides headstones and markers for the spouses or dependent  children of veterans who are interred in a national or State veterans  cemetery at no charge. But VA is not authorized to provide headstones  or markers for spouses and dependent children who are interred in  Tribal veterans cemeteries. That is not right.   There is no reason that veterans and their families who are interred  in Tribal veterans cemeteries shouldn't receive the same benefits as  those who decide to use national or State veterans cemeteries.   H.R. 3657 would allow VA to provide headstones and markers for  eligible family members who are interred in Tribal veterans cemeteries.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Poliquin for introducing this  bill. I know he has a special interest in this because his district  includes a Tribal veterans cemetery.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3657, and ensure  that veterans who choose to be interred in Tribal cemeteries are given  the same recognition that we give to veterans who are interred in  national or State veterans cemeteries.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from Maine (Mr. Poliquin), my good friend and member of the Veterans'  Affairs Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank both sides of the aisle for these great  bills we are passing this afternoon. It may seem like a small bill to  the American public, but to the individual that is affected--in Maine,  or wherever it may be--this is a huge deal.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues on the Democratic side for all of  the work they have done on the committee in a bipartisan way. It is a  great committee to work on.   This is a very important week for all of us, as we go home this  Friday to begin celebrating Veterans Day. Two very important days on  the committee are Memorial Day and Veterans Day, to honor those who  passed and those who are still with us.   Mr. Speaker, I thank both the Republicans and the Democrats. We put  that at the door's edge, and this week we will be voting on some  important pieces of legislation. We have seven more bills on the floor  tomorrow.  [[Page H8509]]    Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues on the other side of the aisle for  the support they have given our veterans in this country.   I once again urge all Members to support this legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
