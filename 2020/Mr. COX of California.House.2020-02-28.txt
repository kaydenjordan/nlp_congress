 Madam Speaker, I rise in honor of Black  History Month to recognize the Shipes family of Bakersfield,  California, who have served as a pillar of the African American  community for over 70 years.   In southeast Bakersfield, the Shipes' family business, Mr. Discount  Plus store, has stood the test of time. First opened in the 1940s, the  store is one of the last original Black-owned businesses in the  Cottonwood neighborhood of Bakersfield, and it remains a beacon of  Black entrepreneurship.  [[Page H1257]]    Mr. Discount Plus store has become a gathering space for African  American communities as local leaders drive forward plans to revitalize  and transform the Cottonwood neighborhood for future generations to  enjoy.   I am proud to recognize the Shipes family and their business for  serving their community for over 70 years, and we look forward to  another 70 years.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in recognizing Black  History Month and honoring the Shipes family for their service and  dedication to southeast Bakersfield, their community, the Central  Valley, and our great Nation.   Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. and Mrs. Shipes.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today to applaud the  inclusion of my bipartisan bill, the Inhaler Coverage and Access Now  Act, the I CAN Act, into H.R. 2339, the Protecting American Lungs and  Reversing the Youth Tobacco Epidemic Act of 2020.   The I CAN Act is about commonsense prevention and investing in  consistent treatment to avoid expensive care later down the road. Moms  and dads shouldn't have to choose between paying their mortgage or  paying their rent or buying an inhaler for their kids. No one should  have to make that choice. The I CAN Act allows you to access inhalers,  whether or not you have reached your deductible. For so many families,  this removes a critical cost barrier for the care they need and  deserve.   Like so many preventive medicines and procedures, inhalers actually  save patients, hospitals, and insurers money by cutting down on  hospitalizations and medical emergencies before they start. As we all  know, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.   Today, the annual cost of asthma in the United States is more than  $56 billion. Why is that? That is because of the 1.8 million emergency  room visits which could have been avoided if people had the inhalers  they needed.   But worse yet are the 3,300 deaths from asthma each year. And these  deaths were preventable. Let me say that again: These deaths were  preventable. And in the richest country in the world, it is an outrage  that anyone dies because they cannot get the medicine they need. We  need to make treatment accessible, and this bill does just that.   For so many families, our friends and our coworkers, asthma medicine  is lifesaving, and many will pay whatever it takes to get the drugs  they need.   Naturally, Big Pharma knows this, and they have taken advantage of  that. For example, albuterol, one of the oldest asthma medicines,  typically costs $50 to $100 per inhaler in the U.S. Less than a decade  ago, it was $15. Then the manufacturer made some small changes,  repatented it, and raised the price by 600 percent. That is price  gouging. And while it might be good for the drug company's bottom  lines, it is bad medicine for America.   I represent California's 21st Congressional District in the San  Joaquin Valley, which has the worst air basin in the Nation. And to  make matters worse, many of our rural communities have faced extreme  challenges when accessing asthma care.   For my constituents and for patients across the country with asthma,  it was a major priority for me to introduce the I CAN Act, to remove  barriers and increase access to inhalers by providing patients with the  coverage for inhaler medication.   I want to thank the Ways and Means Committee and the Energy and  Commerce Committee for taking the necessary action to protect the  health of America's children.   We can pass the I CAN Act to make inhalers available to everyone. We  can prevent youth tobacco use. We can address the youth e-cigarette  epidemic. We can, with our vote today, show we care, and we can act to  improve the health of our young people.   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2339.
