 Madam Speaker, I come to the floor this afternoon because  of the importance of a coming date. It will be known as a historic date  in the Congress of the United States, Thursday, September 19, which is  the day that, prerequisite to coming to the floor, the Committee on  Oversight and Reform will hold the first hearing on D.C. statehood,  H.R. 51, in 26 years. That will be a historic hearing.   This is not an informational hearing to let us know about statehood.  It is a jurisdictional hearing, the prerequisite to going to the House  floor.   The residents of the District of Columbia, who are number one--mark  that fact--number one in taxes paid to support the Government of the  United States, do not have full rights, the same rights, as other  Americans.   Yes, I can come to the House floor to speak any time I want to, and  yes, with Democrats in power, I have reclaimed the Committee of the  Whole vote, which means that when the committee is gathered here in the  House voting on at least some matters, I get to vote. But, Madam  Speaker, on final votes, I cannot vote, even though, as you have heard,  the people I represent contribute more Federal taxes than any people in  the United States, more per capita than New York and California and  Florida. You name the State, you will be talking about a State where,  per capita, its residents contribute less to support the very  government that is ours and theirs than the people of the District of  Columbia.   So, yes, I have introduced the D.C. statehood bill.   Let me predict right now that that bill will pass. It has virtually  enough cosponsors to pass. Most bills come to this House floor without  many cosponsors, and yet we know they will pass. Well, when you have  almost enough cosponsors to pass the bill, Madam Speaker, I say to my  good friends who are not on the bill, this is the time to get on the  bill so that they will be part of history. I do believe this bill will,  in fact, pass the House of Representatives.   There has already been a forecast that that will happen. That  forecast was in H.R. 1, which has already passed the House. Every  Democratic Member voted for H.R. 1.   H.R. 1 contains findings for D.C. statehood. It found that District  residents pay the highest taxes per capita, that residents of your  Nation's Capital have fulfilled all the obligations of statehood,  fighting in all of the Nation's wars, including the war that gave rise  to the United States of America itself.   It found that there were no historical, constitutional, financial, or  economic reasons why the 700,000 residents of your Nation's Capital  should not become part of a state.   These are findings in H.R. 1 that every Democrat has already voted  for. These were findings for statehood for the District of Columbia.   It found that the District is in one of the strongest fiscal  positions in the United States: a $14.6 billion budget, a surplus of  $2.8 billion, total personal income higher than that of seven States,  per capita personal consumption expenditures higher than those of any  State, and total personal consumption expenditures greater than those  of seven States.   We are not talking about an entity not worthy of statehood. The  qualifications are clear, and there are qualifications to become a  state.   How do you become a state? You get voted a state by a majority vote  in this House. It is hard to become a state, but those qualifications  have been met.   Let us compare the District of Columbia to States that are already  States. Let's take two States of the Union, Vermont and Wyoming. I  begrudge them nothing, except to say  [[Page H7593]]  they have voting Members of the House and the Senate, yet they don't  have as many residents as the District of Columbia. This graph goes  only to 600,000. Now, we are at 700,000 D.C. residents.   Moreover, it should be said that there are seven States in the Union  about the same size, less than a million voters, yet they have two  Senators and a voting Member of the House.   There just is no reason to deny that same right to the residents of  your Nation's Capital.   The authorities that indicate that our bill is constitutional are the  ones we always look to, to find out whether a bill is constitutional.  Congressional Research Service has found that H.R. 51 is  constitutional. The American Civil Liberties Union, the foremost  authority on constitutional rights, has done a study and has found that  H.R. 51 is constitutional. Importantly, Viet Dinh, a conservative legal  scholar who served as the highest ranking Justice Department official  in the George W. Bush administration, because he was Assistant Attorney  General for Legal Policy, Viet Dinh has done a study and found that  H.R. 51 is constitutional.   Do note that 51, that has real meaning, because the District would  become the 51st state.   The findings mean that this House has already voted for H.R. 51  because it has voted for all the findings that are necessary for the  District to become a state.   There is a Senate version of H.R. 1, but the Senate version doesn't  have all the many propositions that H.R. 1 has.   H.R. 1, yes, has findings saying essentially that the District should  be the 51st state, but H.R. 1 has a lot of other things in it. H.R. 1  says that to enhance democracy--and that is what it is, it is an  omnibus democracy-enhancing bill. That is why our findings for D.C.  statehood are in that bill, but it has things in it, like it wants  paper ballots to protect the infrastructure, which sometimes goes down  if there is, for example, a cyberattack; it has donor disclosure  requirements; expanding early voting; no gerrymandering; the President  and Vice President would have to disclose their tax returns.                                time  1645    Those are seen as democracy enhancing, and I fully endorse them. But  compare that to the findings endorsing statehood, which would mean that  700,000 American citizens would have the same rights as every other  citizen, and you will see why H.R. 1 is very important to the District  of Columbia and why we predict that H.R. 51, the D.C. statehood bill,  will pass the Congress, the House of Representatives.   I do want to stress the full qualifications, and one of the most  important is service in the Armed Forces. Not only do the residents of  the District of Columbia pay the highest taxes per capita in the United  States--Federal taxes--but the residents of the Nation's Capital have  served in every war, including the war that gave rise to the Nation  itself.   This is a particularly poignant poster because it shows the major  wars, the World War wars. And notice what the losses have been of  residents of the Nation's Capital who fought and died for their country  without the same rights as others in their country:   World War I, 635 casualties from the District, more than from three  States;   The Korean war, more casualties than from eight States;   World War II, more casualties than from four States;   And, of course, Vietnam, more casualties than from 10 States.   The casualties of war perhaps speak loudest to our struggle for  equality. There is a war memorial, the only war memorial on The Mall,  and it is there because the District lost so many men, and it didn't  have home rule at all.   What is home rule? Home rule is simply a government with a  legislature and an executive.   The District was ruled from this place, from the Capitol. So to  commemorate our war dead after World War I, the Congress placed a  pristine, beautiful monument, the only monument to a single  jurisdiction you will find on The Mall.   People sometimes go there to get married. They go there because it is  beautiful and not terribly elaborate.   It is called the D.C. War Memorial. There are 400 or so names of men  and women who died in World War I actually carved out in that memorial.  That is why our service in the armed services is so important to bring  before the House today.   There is something that I think the average person also doesn't know.  This was a segregated city, and Congress did not allow it to denounce  and get rid of racial segregation. Buses and streetcars weren't  segregated, but public accommodations were segregated.   And yet, during the very years of segregation, we have some very  distinguished members of the Armed Forces who were African Americans  who stand out, still, in American history:   The first African American general, born and raised in the District  of Columbia;   The first African American Air Force general, this is in the entire  country, born and raised in the District of Columbia;   The first African American Naval Academy graduate, born and raised in  the District of Columbia;   The first African American Air Force graduate, born and raised in the  District of Columbia.   What a history of distinguished citizens, particularly these citizens  who served so illustriously in our Armed Forces, reaching the highest  ranks but, nevertheless, who came home with fewer rights or far fewer  rights than any other Americans.   If there is to be a statehood provision that, as I have predicted,  will become law in this House and make its way to the Senate, will  there still be a Capital?   I should indicate some of the issues that may occur to the average  citizen.   Yes, because our bill preserves Federal control over the national  capital area, and that is the Federal enclave. That is right here. That  is where the so-called Federal complex, the Federal monuments, the  Federal buildings, The National Mall, all that Federal jurisdiction is  maintained.   The 51st State gives the District control only over the neighborhoods  where the residents and the businesses are to be found. So there is not  much that is upset or will appear very different, frankly, when  visitors come to what is now known as Washington, D.C.   By the way, it will still be called Washington, D.C., but D.C. will  stand for Douglass Commonwealth.   Where did D.C. get that notion? That notion comes from Frederick  Douglass' own home here in the District of Columbia, that icon of  American history.   It should be noted that, while he is remembered foremost for his work  against slavery in the United States, he was a very energetic proponent  of full equality for all the residents of the District of Columbia.   To this day, we have been able, through a bill I got passed in this  House, to have a statue of Frederick Douglass. We are the only city-- that is what we are at the moment--that has a statue.   Each State has two statues. We expect to get another statue, although  I won't say that until it is announced formally, but then we will be  the only non-State to have two statues.   The statue of Frederick Douglass can be seen right here in the  Capitol, and it acknowledges that it was contributed by the residents  of the District of Columbia.   Now, as ardent as we have been in pursuing statehood, we are  determined to get full equality any way we can. So I have  simultaneously introduced a bill that uses another strategy, and that  is because the District doesn't even have full, what we call, home rule  to make sure, at the very same time that we are pursuing statehood-- because it will take us a little more time to get through the Senate-- that we pursue a strategy that would enhance our home rule so that we  would get many of the same authorities that would come through our  statehood bill.   Those are on a dual track, and let me indicate what some of them are.   For example, every bill that the D.C. Council passes has to come over  here. It is never touched. So it has to lie over here for 30 days. What  nonsense is that? One of the home rule bills to enhance home rule would  simply get rid of that.   You don't need to be a State to have a local prosecutor. Why is the  U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, the street crimes here in  the District of Columbia, appointed by the President of the United  States? Virtually all of  [[Page H7594]]  her jurisdiction is on police crime here in the District of Columbia.  She should be appointed by the Mayor of the District of Columbia. At  the same time we are going for statehood, we will have a bill on this  floor for a local prosecutor.   We will have a bill allowing the Mayor to deploy the National Guard.  We see what is happening with climate change, and every jurisdiction is  on the lookout to prepare itself for whatever may come. The D.C.  National Guard would be our last refuge.   Unlike the Guard in the States and even in the territories, the  District's Mayor or chief executive has no authority to call out the  National Guard if there is a hurricane or if there is a flood, so she  has got to somehow find her way up the chain of command to the  President to say: ``Please, Mr. President, can I call out my own  National Guard?''   The National Guard of the District of Columbia helps us in a  multitude of ways; but in the way that could count most, there would be  a delay because the District doesn't have the authority to call out its  own National Guard. We want that even before statehood. We want that  now.   We don't have control over our local courts. These courts don't have  anything to do with the Federal Government. That authority should be  with the D.C. Council.   There are many more. But to point out the ridiculous nature of not,  in fact, having even rights that Americans take for granted--leave  aside, if you will, the right to vote on this House floor, the right to  Senate representation--but matters about which Congress knows nothing  and wants to know nothing, like a local prosecutor, like the right to  deploy members of the National Guard, you can see why I am on dual  tracks.   One is statehood, which is absolute and pure equality with other  Americans, but, in the meantime, we are unwilling to pass up what we  could get incrementally, and that is simply control over all of our  local matters, or as many of them as we can.                                time  1700    There are many reasons why D.C. statehood is ripe. Denying statehood  to the Nation's Capital is a violation of international law, and that  has been noted.   Our country, in 1977--that is before I came to Congress--signed what  is called the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The  Human Rights Committee of the United Nations has twice indicated that  the United States, by denying the residents of its Nation's Capital  equal rights with other parts of the country, is in violation of  international law.   The Human Rights Committee of the United Nations, said that the  United Nations `` . . . remains concerned that the residents of the  District of Columbia do not enjoy full representation in Congress, a  restriction which does not seem to be compatible with article 25 of the  covenant.''   That is the article we signed in 1977.   And, thus, we have been found in violation of international law.   Madam Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have remaining?    Madam Speaker, we are very pleased at the large number-- now over 100 organizations--that have endorsed D.C. statehood. That is  important to us because they themselves have millions of constituents.   One of our greatest problems has been nationalizing this issue. In  fact, the residents are frustrated that people come to the Nation's  Capital and they think that the residents of their capital have the  same rights they have. We simply don't have a national pulpit every day  that informs them.   So these 100-plus national organizations spreading the word,  cascading it, is very important to us. I am not going to name all 100,  but to give you an idea of how broad their constituency is, they  include people like Common Cause, the National Active and Retired  Federal Employees Association, the Sierra Club, People for the American  Way, and the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace  Workers.   There are unions there. There are good government organizations  there. There are organizations of every kind, and that is one of the  reasons that we are sure this bill is ultimately going to pass the  Senate, as well.   We draw to the attention of the House that democracy has always been  an aspiration of our country. Look at who we are. When our country was  created, only White men could vote. It took 132 years for White women  to be able to vote. They had to sit down in the streets. They had to go  to the old Lorton prison, the prison for the District of Columbia. They  chained themselves to the White House gates.   If you want to know why we are undaunted when we see that half the  population had to go through much that we have experienced and finally  attain the vote, we cannot afford to be pessimistic. But we remind  those who come to this floor and say how proud they are of what a  democracy we are; that H.R. 1 has democracy-enhancing provisions  because we are not a democracy yet.   The worst blow to democracy is that the Nation's Capital does not  have full democracy because it does not have the same rights, including  full voting rights in the Congress itself.   The Framers understood that they were creating an imperfect  democracy. Remember, our Constitution is a set of compromises. They had  to get the Constitution done. They had to abide by three-fifths of a  man. That was the compromise for not counting the Black slaves. There  were many who signed the bill who opposed that in every way, but when  you have a democracy with as many different factions as ours did then,  and have now, those are the compromises you make. You will be faulted  only if, over time, you do not correct those inadequacies.   I am grateful that we had barely come into session--we have been in  session now only since January with Democrats in control of the House-- that the Speaker issued a very powerful statement endorsing statehood;  that our Majority Leader Steny Hoyer has endorsed the bill. And, yes, I  believe that we are coming to the end of an era, an era for 218 years  where the residents of our Nation's Capital have been second-class  citizens.   That is a term normally applied to African Americans, but every  citizen of the United States will tell you second-class citizen knew no  color. It meant every resident of the District of Columbia.   We are closing this era in the House of Representatives during the  116th Congress. I am predicting, based on the number of cosponsors,  that this bill will pass the House.   It will be a historic day. It will buoy this bill to the other side  of this House so that the District becomes the 51st State of the United  States.   I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 5 o'clock and 7 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Wednesday, September 11, 2019, at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
