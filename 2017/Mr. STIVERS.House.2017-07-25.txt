 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in memory of an incredible  leader from my home State of Ohio but also for the United States:  Congressman Ralph Regula. He was a teacher, a patriot, and a veteran.  He served during World War II in the United States Navy. He had been a  schoolteacher and a school principal, and he devoted his life to public  service.   His career in government began with service in the Ohio house of  representatives and the Ohio senate before he came to Congress in 1972.  For nearly four decades in Congress, Congressman Regula became known as  a leader who was willing to reach across the aisle to get things done-- to compromise--both on Capitol Hill and with the White House. He worked  to pass legislation that helped his district and the American people.   His spirit of bipartisanship carried throughout his career when he  remained an outspoken advocate, even in his retirement, for  bipartisanship. He was truly an example of how to get things done.   Through his role on the House Appropriations Committee, he served as  an important advocate for Ohio, including funding for the Cleveland  Clinic and support for the Great Lakes. He was the quintessential  example of what it means to be a public servant.   Mr. Speaker, my thoughts go out to his wife, Mary, and the rest of  his family.
