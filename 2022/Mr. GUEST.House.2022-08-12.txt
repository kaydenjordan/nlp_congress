 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to this  destructive piece of legislation.   Every day I hear from fellow Mississippians who struggle to buy gas  and groceries because of inflation fueled by the left's reckless  spending.   Now, instead of acknowledging the impact their out-of-control  spending has had on Americans, my colleagues across the aisle are  trying to pass legislation that will increase taxes on Americans, spend  hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars on far-left priorities, and  pass legislation that will add an army of IRS agents.   It is time to acknowledge that the American people are suffering  because of legislation exactly like this.   The American people are tired of this economic crisis, and they have  been clear: Do not raise taxes, do not add to this recession with more  wasteful spending, do not weaponize the IRS, and do not vote for this  legislation.   This Congress must listen to the American people and vote against  this bill.                                time  1245
