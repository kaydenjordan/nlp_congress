 Mr. Speaker, this is a bill that should be opposed, and  I agree with Mr. Polis that it is unfortunate it is being rushed  because this may be one of the more significant votes we will take  about our economy in this Congress.   I have heard a lot of rhetoric that this isn't about the Librarian. I  am sorry, it is about the Librarian. Dr. Carla Hayden is probably the  most qualified Librarian of Congress who has ever served. She has done  more in the last 6 months to advance modernization in the Library and  the Copyright Office than her predecessor did in the prior 2 decades.  If we prevent her from appointing a new Register, that effort will be  stalled, and I think that would be tragic.    It has been mentioned that somehow, by making this a political  position, it would be more accountable. I beg to differ. Mr. Polis has  mentioned the view of the Electronic Frontier Foundation that this  would enhance special interests. What they have actually said, and I  think it is very pertinent, is that the bill would allow powerful  incumbent interests to use their lobbying power to control this  increasingly politicized Office.   No President is going to select an appointee who will be shot down by  the special interests. That is quite different than the Librarian who  removed the prior Register because of, I believe, the inspector  general's scathing report about the failure to computerize that office,  essentially wasting $12 million, while misrepresenting that fact to the  Librarian and to Congress.   The national library groups, including the national Copyright  Alliance, the American Library Association, and the like, say this:         It's difficult to understand how the public or Congress       itself would benefit from politicization of the Register of       Copyrights' position by making it subject to Presidential       appointment and Senate confirmation as this legislation       proposes. Such politicization of the position necessarily       would result in a Register more actively engaged in policy       development than in competent management and modernization.    That is what we want out of a Register. We don't want a partisan for  one side of the issue. We want somebody who can run, in an efficient  way, the Copyright Office.   Now, a word about the amendment that has been bandied about as  somehow giving Congress a greater say. I value the friendship of my  colleague, Sheila Jackson Lee, who I have served with for so long, but  I fear her amendment does not accomplish what she said because the  President's power to appoint is limited only by Senate confirmation.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.    It is limited only by Senate confirmation. It cannot be  limited by a list prepared by Congress.                                time  1300    I would just say, finally, that if there is a conflict of interest,  as has been suggested, the Librarian cares only about the public  interests. It is Donald Trump who has the 30 copyrights, and I don't  think we should ask President Trump to take this position with that  conflict of interest, something that all of us have been concerned  about.    Mr. Chair, despite all the rhetoric, this bill does  really just one thing: it takes the appointment of the Register away  from Dr. Carla Hayden, the most qualified Librarian we have ever had at  the Library of Congress, and gives it to President Trump.   Now, the policy excuses for this are simply unpersuasive. Proponents  say that this would give greater transparency to the Congress and the  operation of the Copyright Office. I think this is a ridiculous  statement.   Once a Presidential appointment is confirmed, there is no greater  attention to the desires of Congress or transparency than for any other  non-Presidential appointment. The conflicts that the Republican  Congress had with President Obama's Environmental Protection Agency and  IRS appointees are testimony to that truth.   There are vague claims of elevating the Register and modernizing the  Office, but, in fact, the Library is finally making progress on  modernizing the Office. This bill would actually disrupt that progress.   When you talk about conflicts, the Library doesn't have a conflict  with this, but who does have a conflict is President Trump. He holds 30  copyrights. So I don't think the idea of President Trump being a  superior selector of the Register because of his elevation or his  expertise as a writer really holds any weight.   I would like to mention the amendment that our colleague Sheila  Jackson Lee had offered. I am extremely fond of my friend Sheila  Jackson Lee, but the amendment does nothing because you cannot limit  Presidential appointment power through statute. The President is  limited only by the advice and consent of the Senate.   Finally, I would like to say that the potential for empowering  special interests in this bill is very high. We ought to say ``no'' to  this bill.
