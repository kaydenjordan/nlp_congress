 Mr. Speaker, the Summer Olympics in Tokyo will  kick off in less than a month, and I would be remiss not to mention a  young track star from a college in my district who is making his first  Olympic appearance.   Kenny Bednarek, a 22-year-old sprinter who hails from Indian Hills  Community College in my hometown of Ottumwa, earned a spot on the USA  Olympic team when he finished second in the men's 200-meter dash, with  an impressive time of 19.78 seconds, becoming the first Iowa junior  college athlete to qualify for the Olympic Games.   Though COVID-19 might have delayed the 2020 Summer Olympics, we are  all glad to see that it is back on schedule, and Iowa's Second District  is proud to be represented by such a stellar athlete on Team USA.   I wish you the best, Kenny, and I know you will do great as you go on  to Tokyo to represent both the United States and Iowa in the Summer  Olympic Games.   I would also like to wish my brother Richard Miller a happy birthday.  Richard was a Secret Service agent who guarded five Presidents. Happy  birthday, Rick.    And happy Independence Day to our Nation.                            ____________________
