 Madam President, I rise to recognize two members of my  team who are leaving the Senate after their years of dedicated and  important work. Becca Ward will be leaving on August 7, and Meredith  Booker will be leaving on Friday, July 26.   Both of them joined my team as interns. They have worked their way up  within Team Merkley and have made tremendous contributions to my office  and to our Nation. I know they are both going to do extraordinary  things in the next chapters of their lives, but, first, it is worth  reflecting on their service in the U.S. Senate.   Becca Ward has been an invaluable member of our team for 6 years. She  started as an intern in my Oregon office, and she worked her way up to  be my lead adviser on climate chaos and energy policy. Becca joined  Team Merkley as a full-time staff assistant in 2013. Over the years,  she rose to be a legislative correspondent and then a legislative aide.  She drafted and sent responses to more than 225,000 Oregonians who were  concerned about the climate and the environment.   Becca's terrific work made it clear that she was capable of more, so  she became my top policy adviser on the threat of climate chaos.  Climate chaos presents an existential threat to our planet. Her  professionalism, her substantive expertise, her creativity, and the  network she created proved to be powerful tools in our working to  advance a progressive climate agenda.   When Becca first started working on climate change, she took the lead  and the effort to protect the Arctic Ocean from oil and gas drilling,  which led to the introduction of the Stop Arctic Ocean Drilling Act.  Over the course of her years on this portfolio, she has helped a lot  with the mission 100 bill, which aims to transition the United States  into a 100-percent clean energy economy, and with my Keep It in the  Ground Act, which would stop the expansion of the leasing of our  Federal publicly owned properties for the production of fossil fuels.   More recently, she has contributed by collating the Senate's version  of the Green New Deal, which has set a high bar for progressive climate  efforts in the future. Just last week, she led my staff through the  introduction of the Good Jobs for 21st Century Energy Act--a bold, new  bill that required extensive coordination between the environmental  community and the labor community. It is designed to create good- paying, family-wage jobs and to have high labor standards--a race to  the top in employment during the transition to clean energy.   Becca's efforts to take on the global challenge of climate chaos  hasn't been limited to the United States. She has repeatedly traveled  with me and on my behalf to U.N. Conference of the Parties meetings and  to other international events to engage in the diplomacy that is  necessary for a true global response to a global crisis. She has  shepherded my efforts through the Appropriations Committee to maintain  funding for climate programs and to introduce and pass bipartisan  amendments that support the Green Climate Fund.   In addition to her substantive policy responsibilities, she has been  an incredible team player and a remarkable individual to have with us.  I think it is safe to say that Becca will likely go down in Team  Merkley history as the only member of our team who is also an Olympic  medalist. She has been a fantastic manager and mentor to the members of  the climate team and has been a huge contributor to our office's  efforts to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion in our work. I know  her absence will be felt especially strongly every year when the annual  cherry blossom run comes around.   Becca, you might need to plan a trip to DC for next spring.   While Becca is going to do incredible things for the planet in her  next chapter of helping to expand a recently formed environmental  organization, the Clean Energy Leadership Institute, she will be  greatly missed here as a colleague, as a friend, and as a mentor to so  many of us on the team.   We are counting on you, Becca, to save the planet, so no pressure. We  appreciate your service to Oregon and to our country, and I look  forward to hearing about your efforts in your journey ahead.   Now we turn to another member of Team Merkley, Meredith Booker, who  is, sadly, leaving us in July--in fact, at the end of this week.  Meredith embodies the heart and soul and work ethic of Team Merkley,  and she will be sorely missed by everyone in the immigration, civil  rights, housing, and LGBTQ rights portfolios.   Meredith joined our team as an intern in August of 2016 and quickly  became indispensable, joining the legislative correspondent ranks in  December of 2016.   In June of 2018, she was promoted to legislative aide and hasn't  looked back, taking on more and more responsibility. She came into this  position with a deep understanding and background in criminal justice  and has brought a top-notch performance to every project and task she  has touched. I think most of our office would agree. She is the best  organized member of our team. Her meticulously crafted policy-tracker  spreadsheet has helped our team stay on track in many areas and will  remain a lasting part of her legacy here on Capitol Hill. It doesn't  matter whether it is the smallest project or the biggest high-stakes  moment, Meredith always gets it done and gets it done well.   This work ethic has extended from volunteering countless time to  pitching in with coding parties. Coding parties are when the team stays  late in the evening to work to try to have a prompt response to the  thousands of letters we receive from Oregonians.   It stems from that to hustling to perfect every line and section of  the 2019 Equality Act, resulting in a record of 47 Senate sponsors and  bipartisan passage in the House of Representatives this May. That act  has yet to be considered on the floor of the Senate, but it is way past  time that we establish equality of opportunity for every single  American.   Meredith skillfully navigated working with two different legislative  assistants at times--and sometimes with one LA and sometimes with no  LA--without letting a single decision, memo, or project fall through  the cracks.   She managed reintroduction of the American Savings Act to expand  high-quality retirement savings accounts to every American.   She managed our annual August Breastfeeding Month resolution to  recognize the importance of breastfeeding  [[Page S5020]]  to American families and to the health of the children and the health  of the mothers.   Just a short time ago, when the Department of Agriculture laid out a  plan to destroy Civilian Conservation Corps centers across America, she  dove into the tricky and wonky world of that and proceeded to work  intensely to prevent that from happening and worked successfully to do  that.   She threw herself into the challenge of the retirement integrity act,  designed to make IRAs work more cost-effectively for working Americans  rather than be a loophole for the megawealthy.   Though we have always known we were lucky to have Meredith on Team  Merkley, she has truly stepped up and gone above and beyond in the last  year, after my June 2018 trip to Brownsville led to intensive work on  the issue of family and child separation and to a lot of efforts by  many parties to push back against President Trump's cruelty to migrant  families. When President Trump proposed locking families up in  internment camps, she led the drafting of the No Internment Camps Act  to say that we will never repeat that shameful chapter in our history.  When President Trump threw thousands of children into unregulated child  prisons at Tornillo and Homestead, she leapt into action and worked  with the immigration team to draft the Shut Down Child Prison Camps Act  to end this horrific practice.   Just a few weeks ago, she was instrumental to the introduction of the  Stop Cruelty to Migrant Children Act, legislation to ensure we treat  children with dignity and respect, and that act already has 40 Senators  sponsoring it.   As I have traveled to investigate the Trump administration's policies  toward migrants over the last year, Meredith's codel, or congressional  delegation, binders have become legendary. Whether they are assembled  in support of trips to Texas or Central America--or when she joined the  trip herself, as she did earlier this year when we went to the child  jail in Homestead, FL--you have never seen a binder assembled with so  much meticulous care and attention to detail.   In addition to her many accomplishments supporting legislation and  oversight trips, she worked with countless outside groups to organize a  hugely successful hearing through the Democratic Policy and  Communications Center, or DPCC, on family separation in June of 2018.  She reprised that role this week--in fact, today--working to help  organize another DPCC hearing on the treatment of children at the  southern U.S. border. It occurred just earlier this afternoon, with the  focus on stopping the cruel treatment of migrant children.   She has done all this without letting the effort to respond to  Oregonians' letters fall through the cracks. She probably holds the  record for our team responding to constituent mail, having responded to  more than 256,000 emails in less than 3 years and, in doing so, created  350 unique letters for those responses. That means, on average, that  Meredith has created nearly 150 letters per year and sent approximately  100,000 responses per year. That is a lot of communicating with folks  back home.    America is very lucky that Meredith is taking her talents to the  legal arena. She will be starting at Loyola University of New Orleans  this fall, working toward her law degree. Knowing how much she has done  without a law degree--probably more than most fully accredited  lawyers--I know the world is going to benefit enormously as she pursues  that degree and puts it to work in the fight for justice and equality.  The world of justice and equality will benefit just as we experience  the loss of her talents here in the Senate.   Meredith, we are tremendously grateful for your contributions and  will deeply miss you on Team Merkley. We will absolutely miss you both.  You leave a tremendous hole in our team. Your final assignment is to  make sure that we have some very talented people to carry on the  terrific work you have been doing. Thank you.                            ____________________     Madam President, as our Founders worked to design what  would become the Constitution of the United States, they had certain  core principles in mind--certain principles that were the exact  opposite of the way government worked in Europe. They did not want to  see America be a land run by a dictator or a King. They wanted to make  sure that power was distributed between voting Americans, a principle  Jefferson called the equal voice principle, because distributed power  among the people would lead to laws by and for the people, not laws by  and for the powerful.   They had another principle, and it was the opposite of what existed  in Europe, where a King and perhaps the King's circle were above the  law, not accountable to any core principles of conduct or any rules.  What they did in their lives as rulers in that fashion just simply was  accountable to no one.   But our Constitution had a different vision. The goal was to have  everyone in America accountable to the law--that we are all in this  together. No one is a King. No one is a dictator. That vision is really  embodied in four simple words carved into the facade of the doors of  the Supreme Court: Equal Justice Under Law.   If you stand here in the Johnson Room, just across the hallway, and  you look out the window toward the Supreme Court, you see this: Equal  Justice Under Law. It is a principle so foundational to our vision of a  citizen-run nation, a nation by and for the people, that it was the  source of my first political act.   If memory serves me well, I was a junior in high school. I read an  article in the evening newspaper. Now, at that point, many cities in  the country had a morning newspaper, which was more of the business  community's newspaper, and an evening newspaper, which was more the  workers' newspaper, which made sense. For my father, a union machinist,  his work started at 7 in the morning and concluded 9 hours later at 4  in the afternoon. He would come home, get the evening newspaper, read  it, have dinner, and watch the evening news on television.   In that newspaper that evening, there was an article about Spiro  Agnew, our former Vice President. He was convicted of taking $100,000  in bribes, but what was his penalty? His penalty was a $10,000 fine. I  was enraged: Like, what? People get sent to prison for stealing a loaf  of bread, and the Vice President illegally took $100,000 and gets to  keep 90 percent of it. What kind of a story is that to America, that if  you are wealthy and powerful, you can commit crimes and keep the vast  share of what you have taken in that crime? So I wrote an outraged  letter to the newspaper, and the newspaper published it.   Equal Justice Under Law--it is a very important principle to our  Nation. But today we face a political crisis--a crisis about whether we  have a President who is above the law, and that somehow this phrase,  this principle, the foundation of our country, doesn't apply to this  particular President. If that stands, then we will have lost a core  principle of our democratic Republic.   Tomorrow we are going to have testimony from former Special Counsel  Mueller in the House of Representatives. He is scheduled for some 3  hours before the Judiciary Committee of the House and another couple of  hours with the Intelligence Committee. He will be following up to share  insights and answer questions related to this hefty document: Report On  The Investigation Into Russian Interference In The 2016 Presidential  Election.   There is a lot in this report. You wouldn't know that if you just  listened to our Attorney General, because our current Attorney General  Barr said there is nothing here--nothing in this. That is not the case,  and I have come to the floor tonight to make that absolutely clear.   Here is the easiest way to summarize it. We received an open letter  from more than 1,000 former prosecutors evaluating what is in this  hefty book. It says:         We are former federal prosecutors. We served under both       Republican and Democratic administrations at different levels       . . . line attorneys, supervisors, special prosecutors,       United States Attorneys, and senior officials at the       Department of Justice. The offices in which we served were       small, medium, and large; urban, suburban, and rural; and       located in all parts of our country.        Each of us believes that the conduct of President Trump       described in Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report would,       in the case of any other person not covered by the  [[Page S5021]]       Office of Legal Counsel policy against indicting a sitting       President, result in multiple felony charges for obstruction       of justice.        The Mueller report describes several acts that satisfy all       of the elements for an obstruction charge, conduct that       obstructed or attempted to obstruct the truth-finding       process, as to which the evidence of corrupt intent and       connection to pending proceedings is overwhelming. These       include:        The President's efforts to fire Mueller and to falsify       evidence about that effort;        The President's efforts to limit the scope of Mueller's       investigation to exclude his conduct; and        The President's efforts to prevent witnesses from       cooperating with the investigators probing him and his       campaign.    This statement goes on in some detail, but the point that needs to be  repeated is this point: ``Each of us believes that the conduct of  President Trump described in Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report  would, in the case of any other person . . . result in multiple felony  charges.''   In other words, 1,000--in fact, more than 1,000--Federal prosecutors  said, in their minds, reading just this report, that the President has  committed multiple crimes.   What happened to the principle of equal justice under the law? There  are 1,000 Federal prosecutors who said that anyone else--you or you or  you--would be indicted for felonies as a result of the conduct that is  in this report. But the President has not been indicted.   Why has he not been indicted? It is simply this: An indictment has to  stem from the Department of Justice, which is now run by an Attorney  General who has dedicated himself to preventing the President from  being held accountable rather than to the principle of equal justice  under the law.   No one who does not believe in the founding principle of our Nation  should ever serve as Attorney General of the United States. Yet he  serves and refuses to conduct his responsibilities under the  Constitution. That is why there is no choice but for the House to act.  In the failure of Attorney General Barr to honor the principle that our  Nation was founded on, equal justice under the law, the only recourse  is the House of Representatives.   Down this hallway, through these double doors, not far away, is the  House of Representatives, which is charged under the Constitution with  determining if a President has committed high crimes and misdemeanors.  While there may be a discussion of exactly what is meant by high crimes  and misdemeanors, surely they entail acts of obstruction of justice for  which any other American would have been indicted. Surely, felony  crimes qualify.   The House doesn't determine guilt or innocence. The House plays the  role of Federal prosecutors who are deciding whether to indict. Is the  evidence sufficient to say it is credible and substantial that the  individual conducted a felony, a crime? The answer by 1,000 Federal  prosecutors is absolutely.   It can't be done by the Supreme Court. It can't be done by the  judiciary as long as the Attorney General is blocking it. It can be  done only by the House. That is why the House has to act now and has to  proceed to put together a committee on impeachment or this principle  means nothing.   Then it would come to this Chamber to hold the actual trial. But  there will be no trial if there is no indictment. There is no trial in  the Senate Chamber if there is no impeachment, and there is no  credibility to this principle in America if the House doesn't act.   So I call upon the House to convene that committee and to conduct  that impeachment inquiry, and if they come out of that inquiry with  1,000 Federal prosecutors, they must act and vote to impeach.   This cannot be about politics: Is it a smart thing to do? How will it  affect the next election? Will it put our Presidential candidates in a  strange space? Let's do an opinion poll of America. No, absolutely not.   Our institutions are under assault, and we have a responsibility  because we took an oath of office to the Constitution to defend this  principle. The House took the same oath, and they have a responsibility  to defend that principle.    I am going to take the time to lay out four of those charges of  obstruction justice just to set the stage for tomorrow.   This is what is referred to as a ``heat map.'' It lays out different  cases in which the President interfered with the judicial process, and  then it proceeds to ask: Is there substantial evidence of the three  things that are needed as a foundation for saying that a felony crime  has been committed?   The first is, was there an obstructive act? The second is, was there  a nexus to an issue? The third is, was there criminal intent?   There are four cases in which capable individuals have reviewed the  Mueller report and have said yes on all three--meaning, each of these  is red.   Let's take a look at this. First, let's turn to this issue of efforts  to fire Mueller. I am reading now from page 87 of this hefty report on  the investigation, the special counsel's report.   On page 87, under ``Analysis,'' it proceeds to say: ``In analyzing  the President's direction to McGahn to have the Special Counsel  removed, the following evidence is relevant to the elements of  obstruction of justice.''   Then he walks through each of these three pieces:         Obstructive act. As with the President's firing of Comey,       the attempt to remove the Special Counsel would qualify as an       obstructive act if it would naturally obstruct the       investigation and any grand jury proceedings that might flow       from the inquiry. Even if the removal of the lead prosecutor       would not prevent the investigation from continuing under a       new appointee, a factfinder would need to consider whether       the act had the potential to delay further action in the       investigation, chill the actions of any replacement Special       Counsel, or otherwise impede the investigation.        A threshold question is whether the President in fact       directed McGahn to have the Special Counsel removed. After       news organizations reported that in June 2017 the President       had ordered McGahn to have the Special Counsel removed, the       President publicly disputed these accounts, and privately       told McGahn that he had simply wanted McGahn to bring       conflicts of interest to the Department of Justice's       attention. . . . Some of the President's specific language       that McGahn recalled from the calls is consistent with that       explanation. Substantial evidence, however, supports the       conclusion that the President went further and in fact       directed McGahn to call Rosenstein to have the Special       Counsel removed.        First, McGahn's clear recollection was that the President       directed him to tell Rosenstein not only that conflicts       existed but also that ``Mueller has to go.'' McGahn is a       credible witness with no motive to lie or exaggerate given       the position he held in the White House. McGahn spoke with       the President twice and understood the directive the same way       both times, making it unlikely that he misheard or       misinterpreted the President's request. In response to that       request, McGahn decided to quit because he did not want to       participate in events that he described as akin to the       Saturday Night Massacre.    That is a reference to Watergate.         He called his lawyer, drove to the White House, packed up       his office, prepared to submit a resignation letter with his       chief of staff, told Priebus that the President had asked him       to ``do crazy shit,'' and informed Priebus and Bannon that he       was leaving. Those acts would be a highly unusual reaction to       a request to convey information to the Department of Justice.        Second, in the days before the calls to McGahn, the       President, through his counsel, had already brought the       asserted conflicts to the attention of the Department of       Justice. Accordingly, the President had no reason to have       McGahn call Rosenstein that weekend to raise conflicts issues       that already had been raised.        Third, the President's sense of urgency and repeated       requests to McGahn to take immediate action on a weekend--      ``You gotta do this. You gotta call Rod.''--support McGahn's       recollection that the President wanted the Department of       Justice to take action to remove the Special Counsel. Had the       President instead sought only to have the Department of       Justice re-examine asserted conflicts to evaluate whether       they posed an ethical bar, it would have been unnecessary to       set the process in motion on a Saturday and to make repeated       calls to McGahn.        Finally, the President had discussed ``knocking out       Mueller'' and raised conflicts of interest in a May 23, 2017       call to McGahn, reflecting that the President connected the       conflicts to a plan to remove the Special Counsel. And in the       days leading up to June 17, 2017, the President made clear to       Priebus and Bannon, who then told Ruddy, that the President       was considering terminating the Special Counsel. Also, during       this time period, the President reached out to Christie to       get his thoughts on firing the Special Counsel. This evidence       shows that the President was not just seeking an examination       of whether conflicts existed but instead was looking to use       asserted conflicts as a way to terminate the Special Counsel.    So those are the obstructive acts, efforts to fire special counsel  Mueller.         Nexus to an official proceeding [the second test]. To       satisfy the proceeding requirement, it would be necessary to       establish a nexus  [[Page S5022]]       between the President's act of seeking to terminate the       Special Counsel and a pending or foreseeable grand jury       proceeding.        Substantial evidence indicates that by June 17, 2017, the       President knew his conduct was under investigation by a       federal prosecutor who could present any evidence of federal       crimes to a grand jury. On May 23, 2017, McGahn explicitly       warned the President that his ``biggest exposure'' was not       his act of firing Comey but his ``other contacts'' and       ``calls,'' and his ``ask re: Flynn.'' By early June, it was       widely reported in the media that federal prosecutors had       issued grand jury subpoenas in the Flynn inquiry and that the       Special Counsel had taken over the Flynn investigation. On       June 9, 2017, the Special Counsel's Office informed the White       House that investigators would be interviewing intelligence       agency officials who allegedly had been asked by the       President to push back against the Russia investigation. On       June 14, 2017, news outlets began reporting that the       President himself was being investigated for obstruction       of justice. Based on widespread reporting, the President       knew that such an investigation could include his request       for Comey's loyalty; his request that Comey ``let[] Flynn       go''; his outreach to Coats and Rogers; and his       termination of Comey and statement to the Russian Foreign       Minister that the termination had relieved ``great       pressure'' related to Russia. And on June 16, 2017, the       day before he directed McGahn to have the Special Counsel       removed, the President publicly acknowledged that his       conduct was under investigation by a federal prosecutor,       tweeting, ``I am being investigated for firing the FBI       Director by the man who told me to fire the FBI       Director!''    That covers the nexus to an official proceeding, but what about this  third issue, this issue of intent?   Reading again from the special counsel's report evaluating this,  going to the issue of intent on efforts to fire Mueller:         Substantial evidence indicates that the President's       attempts to remove the Special Counsel were linked to the       Special Counsel's oversight of investigations that involved       the President's conduct--and, most immediately, to reports       that the President was being investigated for potential       obstruction of justice.        Before the President terminated Comey, the President       considered it critically important that he was not under       investigation and that the public not erroneously think he       was being investigated. As described in Volume II . . .       advisors perceived the President, while he was drafting the       Comey termination letter, to be concerned more than anything       else about getting out that he was not personally under       investigation. When the President learned of the appointment       of the Special Counsel on May 17, 2017, he expressed further       concern about the investigation, saying ``[t]his is the end       of my Presidency.'' The President also faulted Sessions for       recusing, saying ``you were supposed to protect me.''        On June 14, 2017, when the Washington Post reported that       the Special Counsel was investigating the President for       obstruction of justice, the President was facing what he had       wanted to avoid: a criminal investigation into his own       conduct that was the subject of widespread media attention.       The evidence indicates that news of the obstruction       investigation prompted the President to call McGahn and seek       to have the Special Counsel removed. By mid-June, the       Department of Justice had already cleared the Special       Counsel's service and the President's advisors had told him       that the claimed conflicts of interest were ``silly'' and did       not provide a basis to remove the Special Counsel. On June       13, 2017, the Acting Attorney General testified before       Congress that no good cause for removing the Special Counsel       existed, and the President dictated a press statement to       Sanders saying he had no intention of firing the Special       Counsel. But the next day, the media reported that the       President was under investigation for obstruction of justice       and the Special Counsel was interviewing witnesses about       events related to possible obstruction--spurring the       President to write critical tweets about the Special       Counsel's investigation. The President called McGahn at home       that night and then called him on Saturday from Camp David.       The evidence accordingly indicates that news that an       obstruction investigation had been opened is what led the       President to call McGahn to have the Special Counsel       terminated.        There also is evidence that the President knew that he       should not have made those calls to McGahn. The President       made the calls to McGahn after McGahn had specifically told       the President that the White House Counsel's Office--and       McGahn himself--could not be involved in pressing conflict       claims and that the President should consult with his       personal counsel if he wished to raise conflicts. Instead of       relying on his personal counsel to submit the conflicts       claims, the President sought to use his official powers to       remove the Special Counsel. And after the media reported on       the President's actions, he denied that he had ever ordered       McGahn to have the Special Counsel terminated and made       repeated efforts to have McGahn deny the story, as discussed       in Volume II. . . . Those denials are contrary to the       evidence and suggest the President's awareness that the       direction to McGahn could be seen as improper.    So there it is--obstruction, a nexus to an investigation, and  criminal intent. Those are the efforts to fire Mueller. That is the  first one laid out in this quote that I am reading from, the first one  that I am conveying to you all, and there are four of these I am going  to go through to set the stage for understanding the gravity of what is  happening in the United States. I think this conversation has been  going on for so long that people have lost sight of the egregious  nature and the criminal nature of the President's conduct--at least the  degree laid out in exquisite detail, as I am reading it to you--and  that more than 1,000 former Federal prosecutors who have looked at  these top four issues and others have said that anyone else would be  indicted, meaning that in their minds, these acts met the three tests  for felony conduct; that is, in their view, the President committed  crimes.   So the second issue is efforts to curtail the Mueller investigation.  The first was to fire Mueller, and the second was to curtail the  investigation. I will start reading the analysis laid out starting on  page 97, continuing through page 98.         In analyzing the President's efforts to have Lewandowski       deliver a message directing Sessions to publicly announce       that the Special Counsel investigation would be confined to       future election interference, the following evidence is       relevant to the elements of obstruction of justice.    Looking first to the obstructive act.         The President's effort to send Sessions a message through       Lewandowski would qualify as an obstructive act if it would       naturally obstruct the investigation in any grand jury       proceedings that might flow from the inquiry.        The President sought to have Sessions announce that the       President ``shouldn't have a Special Prosecutor/Counsel'' and       that Sessions was going to ``meet with the Special Prosecutor       to explain this is very unfair and let the Special Prosecutor       move forward with investigating election meddling for future       elections so that nothing can happen in future elections.''       The President wanted Sessions to disregard his recusal from       the investigation, which had followed from a former DOJ       ethics review, and have Sessions declare that he knew ``for a       fact'' that ``there were no Russians involved in the       campaign'' because he ``was there.'' The President further       directed that Sessions should explain that the President       should not be subject to an investigation ``because he hasn't       done anything wrong.'' Taken together, the President's       directives indicate that Sessions was being instructed to       tell the Special Counsel to end the existing investigation       into the President and his campaign, with the Special       Counsel being permitted to ``move forward with       investigating election meddling for future elections.''    So the obstructive act was perceived to box in the Mueller  investigation so it wouldn't touch on the President. That is an  obstruction of justice. But is there a nexus to an official proceeding?  That is next addressed in the Mueller report as follows:         As described above, by the time of the President's initial       one-on-one meeting with Lewandowski on June 19, 2017, the       existence of a grand jury investigation supervised by the       Special Counsel was public knowledge. By the time of the       President's follow-up meeting with Lewandowski--    I bet you would like to know what comes next, but take a look here. I  can't tell you because it has been blacked out. So whatever it was, it  created a key point about the nexus to the official proceeding. The  section goes on after the blacked out section:         To satisfy the nexus requirement, it would be necessary to       show that limiting the Special Counsel's investigation would       have the natural and probable effect of impeding that grand       jury proceeding.    So nexus and substantial evidence. Let's go to intent. Again, I am  reading from page 97:         Substantial evidence indicates that the President's effort       to have Sessions limit the scope of the Special Counsel's       investigation to future election interference was intended to       prevent further investigative scrutiny of the President's and       his campaign's conduct.    That sums it up. Then it goes on in some greater detail:         As previously described, see Volume II . . . the President       knew that the Russian investigation was focused in part on       his campaign, and he perceived allegations of Russian       interference to cast doubt on the legitimacy of his election.       The President further knew that the investigation had       broadened to include his own conduct and whether he had       obstructed justice. Those investigations would not proceed if       the Special Counsel's jurisdiction were limited to future       election interference only.        The timing and circumstances of the President's actions       support the conclusion that he sought that result. The       President's initial direction that Sessions should limit the       Special Counsel's investigation came just 2 days  [[Page S5023]]       after the President ordered McGahn to have the Special       Counsel removed, which itself followed public reports that       the President was personally under investigation for       obstruction of justice. The sequence of those events raises       an inference that after seeking to terminate the Special       Counsel, the President sought to exclude his and his       campaign's conduct from the investigation's scope. The       President raised the matter with Lewandowski again on July       19, 2017, just days after emails and information about the       June 9, 2016 meeting between Russians and senior campaign       officials had been publicly disclosed, generating substantial       media coverage and investigative interest.        The manner in which the President acted provides additional       evidence of his intent. Rather than rely on official       channels, the President met with Lewandowski alone in the       Oval Office. The President selected a loyal ``devotee''       outside the White House to deliver the message, supporting an       inference that he was working outside White House channels,       including McGahn, who had previously resisted contacting the       Department of Justice about the Special Counsel. The       President also did not contact the Acting Attorney General,       who had just testified publicly that there was no cause to       remove the Special Counsel. Instead, the President tried to       use Sessions to restrict and redirect the Special Counsel's       investigation when Sessions was recused and could not       properly take any action on it.        The July 19, 2017 events provide further evidence of the       President's intent. The President followed up with       Lewandowski in a separate one-on-one meeting one month after       he first dictated the message for Sessions, demonstrating he       still sought to pursue the request. And just hours after       Lewandowski assured the President that the message would soon       be delivered to Sessions, the President gave an unplanned       interview to the New York Times in which he publicly attacked       Sessions and raised questions about his job security. Four       days later, on July 22, 2017, the President directed Priebus       to obtain Sessions' resignation. That evidence could raise an       inference that the President wanted Sessions to realize that       his job might be on the line as he evaluated whether to       comply with the President's direction that Sessions publicly       announce that, notwithstanding his recusal, he was going to       confine the Special Counsel's investigation to future       election interference.    It is laid out in great detail--an obstructive act, a nexus to an  official proceeding, and the issue of intent. This did not happen by  accident--not on the efforts to fire Mueller and not on the efforts to  curtail the Mueller investigation.   Now we will go to the third major point here--the order to McGahn to  deny the attempt to fire Mueller. This analysis in the special  prosecutor's report starts on page 118.         In analyzing the President's efforts to have McGahn deny       that he had been ordered to have the Special Counsel removed,       the following evidence is relevant to the elements of       obstruction of justice.    First, obstructive act.         The President's repeated efforts to get McGahn to create a       record denying that the President had directed him to remove       the Special Counsel would qualify as an obstructive act if it       had a natural tendency to constrain McGahn from testifying       truthfully or to undermine his credibility as a potential       witness if he testified consistently with his memory rather       than with what the record said.        There is some evidence that at the time the New York Times       and Washington Post stories were published in late January       2018, the President believed the stories were wrong and that       he had never told McGhan to have Rosenstein remove the       Special Counsel. The President correctly understood that       McGhan had not told the President directly that he planned to       resign. In addition, the President told Priebus and Porter       that he had not sought to terminate the Special Counsel, and       in the Oval Office meeting with McGhan, the President said,       ``I never said to fire Mueller. I never said `fire.' '' That       evidence could indicate that the President was not attempting       to persuade McGhan to change his story but instead offering       his own but different recollection of the substance of his       June 2017 conversations with McGhan and McGhan's reaction to       them.        Other evidence cuts against that understanding of the       President's conduct.    That is an important line to understand. Is it possible that the  President simply had a different recollection? And the answer in the  special prosecutor's report is this: ``Other evidence cuts against that  understanding.''   The special counsel continues:         As previously described, see Volume II . . . substantial       evidence supports McGhan's account that the President had       directed him to have the Special Counsel removed, including       the timing and context of the President's directive; the       manner in which McGhan reacted; and the fact that the       President had been told the conflicts were insubstantial,       were be being considered by the Department of Justice, and       should be raised with the President's personal counsel rather       than brought to McGhan. In addition, the President's       subsequent denials that he had told McGhan to have the       Special Counsel removed were carefully worded. When first       asked about the New York Times story, the President said,       ``Fake news, folks. Fake news. A typical New York Times fake       story.'' And when the President spoke with McGhan in the Oval       Office, he focused on whether he had used the word ``fire,''       saying, ``I never said to fire Mueller. I never said       ``fire.''    He then said:         ``Did I say the word `fire'? The President's assertion in       the Oval Office meeting that he had never directed McGhan to       have the Special Counsel removed thus runs counter to the       evidence.        In addition, even if the President sincerely disagreed with       McGhan's memory of the June 17, 2017 events, the evidence       indicates that the President knew by the time of the Oval       Office meeting that McGhan's account differed and that McGhan       was firm in his views. Shortly after the story broke, the       President's counsel told McGhan's counsel that the President       wanted McGhan to make a statement denying he had been asked       to fire the Special Counsel, but McGhan responded through his       counsel that that aspect of the story was accurate and he       therefore could not comply with the President's request. The       President then directed Sanders to tell McGhan to correct the       story, but McGhan told her he would not do so because the       story was accurate in reporting on the President's order.       Consistent with that position, McGhan never issued a       correction. More than a week later, the President brought up       the issue again with Porter, made comments indicating that       the President thought McGhan had leaked the story, and       directed Porter to have McGhan create a record denying that       the President had tried to fire the Special Counsel. At that       point, the President said he might ``have to get rid of''       McGhan if McGhan did not comply. McGhan again refused and       told Porter, as he told Sanders and as his counsel had told       the President's counsel, that the President had in fact       ordered him to have Rosenstein remove the Special Counsel.       That evidence indicates that by the time of the Oval Office       meeting the President was aware that McGhan did not think the       story was false and did not want to issue a statement or       create a written record denying facts that McGhan believed to       be true. The President nevertheless persisted and asked       McGhan to repudiate facts that McGhan had repeatedly said       were accurate.    So that is the evidence of the order to McGhan to deny that he had  been instructed to fire Mueller by the President. But is there a nexus  to an official proceeding--the second test? The special counsel's  report continues to address that issue.         Nexus to an official proceeding. By January 2018, the       Special Counsel's use of a grand jury had been further       confirmed by the return of several indictments. The President       also was aware that the Special Counsel was investigating       obstruction-related events because, among other reasons, on       January 8, 2018, the Special Counsel's office provided his       counsel with a detailed list of topics for a possible       interview with the President. The President knew that McGhan       had personal knowledge in many of the events the Special       Counsel was investigating and that McGhan had already been       interviewed by Special Counsel investigators. And in the Oval       Office meeting, the President indicated he knew that McGhan       had told the Special Counsel's Office about the President's       effort to remove the Special Counsel. The President       challenged McGhan for disclosing that information and for       taking notes that he viewed as creating unnecessary legal       exposure. That evidence indicates the President's awareness       that the June 17, 2017 events were relevant to the Special       Counsel's investigation and any grand jury investigation that       might grow out of it.        To establish a nexus, it would be necessary to show that       the President's actions would have the natural tendency to       affect such a proceeding or that they would hinder, delay or       prevent the communication of information to investigators.       Because McGhan had spoken to Special Counsel investigators       before January 2018, the President could not have been       seeking to influence his prior statements in those       interviews. But because McGhan had repeatedly spoken to       investigators and the obstruction inquiry was not complete,       it was foreseeable that he would be interviewed again on       obstruction-related topics. If the President were focused       solely on a press strategy in seeking to have McGhan       refute the New York Times article, a nexus to a proceeding       or to further investigative interviews would not be shown.       But the President's efforts to have McGhan write a letter       ``for our records'' approximately ten days after the story       had come out--well past the typical time to issue a       correction for a news story--indicates the President was       not focused solely on press strategy, but instead likely       contemplated the ongoing investigation and any proceedings       arising from it.    So that is the nexus.   And now to intent.         Substantial evidence indicates that in repeatedly urging       McGhan to dispute that he was ordered to have the Special       Counsel terminated, the President acted for the purpose of       influencing McGhan's account in order to deflect or prevent       further scrutiny of the President's conduct towards the       investigation.   [[Page S5024]]     That summarizes the intent.   Let me just repeat a piece of that.         Substantial evidence indicates that in repeatedly urging       McGhan to dispute that he was ordered to have the Special       Counsel terminated--    In other words, his repeated efforts to have McGhan lie--         the President acted for the purpose of influencing McGhan's       account in order to deflect or prevent further scrutiny of       the President's conduct. . . .        Several facts support that conclusion. The President made       repeated attempts to get McGhan to change his story.    Not just one, but repeated attempts.         As described above, by the time of the last attempt, the       evidence suggests that the President had been told on       multiple occasions that McGhan believed the President had       ordered him to have the Special Counsel terminated. McGhan       interpreted his encounter with the President in the Oval       Office as an attempt to test his mettle and see how committed       he was to his memory of what had occurred. The President had       already laid the groundwork for pressing McGhan to alter his       account by telling Porter that it might be necessary to fire       McGhan if he did not deny the story, and Porter relayed that       statement to McGhan. Additional evidence of the President's       intent might be gleaned from the fact that his counsel was       sufficiently alarmed by the prospect of the President's       meeting with McGhan that he called McGhan's counsel and said       that McGhan could not resign no matter what happened in the       Oval Office that day. The President's counsel was well aware       of McGhan's resolve not to issue what he believed to be a       false account of events despite the President's request.       Finally, as noted above, the President brought up the Special       Counsel investigation in his Oval Office meeting with McGhan       and criticized him for telling this Office about the June 17,       2017 events. The President's statements reflect his       understanding--and his displeasure--that those events would       be part of an obstruction-of-justice inquiry.    So there it is--the intent, all laid out very, very clearly in this  report--obstructive acts, a nexus to an official proceeding, and the  clear intent.   So let's turn to the fourth issue: Conduct toward Manafort. This can  be found on page 131 of the special counsel's report.         In analyzing the President's conduct towards Flynn,       Manafort--    And a third person who has been blacked out in the record--       the following evidence is relevant to the elements of       obstruction of justice:        Section a, Obstructive act.    Here we are addressing if there is evidence--is there substantial  evidence--of the President's conduct toward Manafort.         With respect to Manafort, there is evidence that the       President's actions had the potential to influence Manafort's       decision whether to cooperate with the government. The       President and his personal counsel made repeated statements       suggesting that a pardon was a possibility for Manafort,       while also making it clear that the President did not want       Manafort to ``flip'' and cooperate with the government. On       June 15, 2018, the day the judge presiding over Manafort's       D.C. case was considering whether to revoke his bail, the       President said that he ``felt badly'' for Manafort and       stated, ``I think a lot of it is very unfair.'' And when       asked about a pardon for Manafort, the President said, ``I do       want to see people treated fairly. That's what it's all       about.'' Later that day, after Manafort's bail was revoked,       the President called it a ``tough sentence'' that was ``Very       unfair!'' Two days later, the President's personal counsel       stated that individuals involved in the Special Counsel's       investigation could receive a pardon ``if in fact the       [P]resident and his advisors . . . come to the conclusion       that you have been treated unfairly''--using language that       paralleled how the President had already described the       treatment of Manafort. Those statements, combined with the       President's commendation of Manafort for being a ``brave       man'' who ``refused to `break,' '' suggested that a pardon       was a more likely possibility if Manafort continued not to       cooperate with the government. And while Manafort eventually       pleaded guilty pursuant to a cooperation agreement, he was       found to have violated the agreement by lying to       investigators.        The President's public statements during the Manafort       trial, including during jury deliberations, also had the       potential to influence the trial jury. On the second day of       trial, for example, the President called the prosecution a       ``terrible situation'' and a ``hoax'' that ``continues to       stain our country'' and referred to Manafort as a ``Reagan/      Dole darling'' who was ``serving solitary confinement'' even       though he was ``convicted of nothing.'' Those statements were       widely picked up by the press. While jurors were instructed       not to watch or read news stories about the case and are       presumed to follow those instructions, the President's       statements during the trial generated substantial media       coverage that could have reached jurors if they happened to       see the statements or learned about them from others.        And the President's statements during deliberations of       Manafort ``happens to be a very good person'' and that ``it's       very sad what they've done to Paul Manafort'' had the       potential to influence jurors who learned of the statements,       which the President made just as jurors were considering       whether to convict or acquit Manafort.    Let me point out here that I see in this book substantial sections  have been blocked out under No. 8, the Obstructive Act and under  section C, the Intent. In spite of part of that section being blacked  out, that was the substantial evidence of the effort to influence Paul  Manafort and obstruct justice.         Nexus to an official proceeding. The President's actions       towards Flynn and Manafort and a third person blacked out in       this book appeared to have been connected to pending or       anticipated official proceedings involving each individual.        The President's conduct towards Flynn principally occurred       when both were under criminal investigation by the Special       Counsel's Office and press reports speculated about whether       they would cooperate with the Special Counsel's       investigation. And the President's conduct toward Manafort       was directly connected to the official proceedings involving       him. The President made statements about Manafort and the       charges against him during Manafort's criminal trial. And the       President's comments about the prospect of Manafort       ``flipping'' occurred when it was clear the Special Counsel       continued to oversee grand jury proceedings.    So there is the nexus laid out very clearly in this report on this  effort to influence Manafort's testimony.   And then to intent, page 132.         Evidence concerning the President's conduct towards       Manafort indicates that the President intended to encourage       Manafort to not cooperate with the government. Before       Manafort was convicted, the President repeatedly stated that       Manafort had been treated unfairly. One day after Manafort       was convicted on eight felony charges and potentially faced a       lengthy prison term, the President said that Manafort was a       ``brave man'' for refusing to ``break'' and that ``flipping''       ``almost ought to be outlawed.'' At the same time, although       the President privately told aides he did not like Manafort,       he publicly called Manafort ``a good man'' and said he had a       ``wonderful family.'' And when the President was asked       whether he was asked whether he was considering a pardon for       Manafort, the President did not respond directly and instead       said he had ``great respect for what [Manafort]'s done, in       terms of what he's gone through.'' The President added that       ``some of the charges they threw against him, every       consultant, every lobbyist in Washington probably does.'' In       light of the President's counsel's previous statements that       the investigations ``might get cleaned up with some       presidential pardons'' and that a pardon would be possible if       the President come[s] to the conclusion that you have been       treated unfairly.'' The evidence supports the inference that       the President intended Manafort to believe that he could       receive a pardon, which would make cooperation with the       government as a means of a lesser sentence unnecessary.    To read that again:         The evidence supports the inference that the President       intended Manafort to believe that he could receive a pardon       which would make cooperation with the government as a means       of obtaining a lesser sentence unnecessary.    The special counsel continues under intent:         We also examined the evidence of the President's intent       making public statements about Manafort at the beginning of       his trial and when the jury was deliberating. Some evidence       supports a conclusion the President intended, at least in       part, to influence the jury. The trial generated widespread       publicity, and as the jury began to deliberate, commentators       suggested that an acquittal would add pressure to end the       Special Counsel's investigation. By publicly stating on the       second day of deliberations that Manafort ``happens to be a       very good person'' and that ``it's very sad what they've done       to Paul Manafort'' right after calling the Special Counsel's       investigation a ``rigged witch hunt,'' the President's       statements could, if they reached jurors, have the natural       tendency to engender sympathy for Manafort among jurors, and       a factfinder could infer that the President intended that       result. But there are alternative explanations to the       President's comments, including that he genuinely felt sorry       for Manafort or that his goal was not to influence the jury       but influence public opinion. The President's comments also       could have been intended to continue sending a message to       Manafort that a pardon was possible. As described above, the       President made his comments about Manafort being ``a very       good person'' immediately after declining to answer questions       about whether he would pardon Manafort.    You might be very interested in the additional information about  intent, but I can't read it to you because it is blacked out.  Nonetheless, in that previous paragraph, it is clearly declared the  evidence supports the inference the President intended Manafort to  believe he could receive a pardon, which would make cooperation with  the government  [[Page S5025]]  as a means of obtaining a lesser sentence unnecessary.   Those are the first four cases of obstruction of justice in which a  special prosecutor lays out substantial evidence on the obstructive  act, on the nexus, and on the intent on the efforts to fire Mueller, on  the efforts to curtail the Mueller investigation, on the order to  McGahn to deny that he had attempted to fire Mueller, and on the effort  to influence Manafort by alluding to a potential pardon.   There is a lot more in this book--many other cases that, in the eyes  of analysts, isn't as strong as the first four, but the evidence could  support it, whether it is substantial evidence, but still very serious  stories of efforts to obstruct justice.   Ordinary Americans might say: If, in fact, the special prosecutor  found all three standards met on at least four of these cases, then why  hasn't the President been indicted? Well, indictment has to come from  the executive branch and the Attorney General, who runs the Department  of Justice, who isn't going to do that.   There is a policy within the White House that basically says a  President can't be indicted. Pull out your Constitution and try to find  where the Constitution says that a President can't be indicted. Try to  find that because it is not in there.   ``Equal justice under law.'' That is what our Constitution is about,  not the case of a King who is above the law, so we have a democratic  republic, if we can keep it.   But that means that we are in this principle ``equal justice under  law,'' and if the special prosecutor is not going to make  recommendations based on the White House executive branch principle  that a President can't be indicted and the Department of Justice is not  going to do it, there is only one option, and that is the House of  Representatives. The House of Representatives has the huge  responsibility of defending this principle ``equal justice under law.''  No one else is going to do it. It can't be done here in the Senate  because the Constitution says the responsibility is in the House of  Representatives to decide whether to impeach a President.   There has been a lot of discussion of politics: Is this a smart thing  to do? Does it take up too much time? How will people respond? I can  tell you this, if the House fails to act, then this ``equal justice  under law'' means nothing.   This book is full of events that a thousand former Federal  prosecutors have told us constitutes criminal conduct, and that is why  the House must, in defending their oath of office to the Constitution,  bring a committee together and defend the Constitution--the vision-- that no one in the United States of America, not even the President, is  above the law. It is time--past time--to convene impeachment  proceedings.                            ____________________
