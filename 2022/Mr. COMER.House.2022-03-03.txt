 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor Jane Wheatley, CEO of the  Taylor Regional Hospital in Campbellsville, Kentucky, who retired after  20 years in this critically important position.   While Jane has led this institution for two decades, her service to  the hospital spans much longer. She began working in the business  office in 1978 at what was then known as the Taylor County Hospital  before climbing the ranks to become chief financial officer and later  chief executive officer.   Under Jane's leadership, Taylor Regional Hospital has undergone  dramatic growth to become a regional hub for quality healthcare.  Without a doubt, her vision for growth contributed mightily to the  hospital's success.   She also has a love for Campbellsville that drove her to do all she  could to ensure her fellow citizens did not have to travel far for  vital healthcare needs.   Jane's professional success is a testament to her hard work,  leadership, and desire to improve the community she loves. She leaves a  proud legacy in Taylor County, and I wish her nothing but the best in a  well-earned retirement.                            ____________________
