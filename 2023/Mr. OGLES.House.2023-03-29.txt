 Madam Speaker, I rise to remember those lost in an  unspeakable tragedy that took place in Nashville at the Covenant  School, which is in my district, and to acknowledge the power of  prayer.   At approximately 10:13 a.m., evil ran rampant in the halls of the  Christian academy and claimed the lives of three children and three  staff members:   Hallie Scruggs, age 9;   Evelyn Dieckhaus, age 9;   William Kinney, age 9;   Mike Hill, the school custodian;   Dr. Katherine Koonce, the head of the school; and   Cynthia Peak, a substitute teacher.   These innocent lives were lost in a senseless act of violence.   As a father of three children, I cannot begin to imagine what the  families of these six individuals are experiencing right now.   To my fellow Tennesseans in Nashville and the Covenant School, we are  here for you. We are sending our deepest and most sincere condolences.  My prayers are with each and every one of you.   I also want to recognize the bravery demonstrated by the Metropolitan  Nashville Police Department and to all of the first responders who took  exemplary steps during this tragic event.   To Officers Rex Engelbert and Michael Collazo, thank you. Your  incredible bravery, valor, and courage in the face of danger saved  lives.   Our community is broken. To those who are wondering and trying to  make sense of the world, the Lord says: ``So do not fear, for I am with  you; do not be dismayed for I am your God. I will strengthen you and  help you; I will uphold you with my righteous right hand.'' Isaiah  41:10.   Please join me for a moment of silence.                            ____________________
