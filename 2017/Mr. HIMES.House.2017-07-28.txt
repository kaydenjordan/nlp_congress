 Mr. Speaker, I thank both the chairman and ranking member  for the strong bill that has been offered up today and for the  bipartisan manner in which it was developed and enacted and, hopefully,  will be passed.   I rise in strong support of this bill, but would note for my  colleagues that this authorization bill is an odd one. To fully  understand it, you need to go deep into the basement of this Capitol  and review it behind heavy metal doors.                                time  1200    The bill is full of acronyms and code words and classified  information. As such, it can be hard to understand, and things that are  hard to understand sometimes cause anxiety and fear. Let me take a  moment to describe what this bill does.   This bill has the strong bipartisan support of my fellow committee  members, liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans alike, because  it provides the lifeblood to a truly remarkable group of people who  work behind the scenes and in the dark to keep us safe and to keep us  free.   The unheralded and unacknowledged warriors of the intelligence  community never stop in the work that they do around the world. As we  speak, North Korea is feverishly working to develop the ability to  deliver a nuclear bomb to American shores. Our intelligence community  is watching, evaluating, and planning against this mortal threat.   As we speak, for the first time in a generation, Iran is not  feverishly working to develop the ability to deliver a nuclear bomb to  our shores. Our intelligence community is making sure that that stays  true.   As we speak, Mr. Speaker, for the umpteenth time, terrorists in  places like Afghanistan and Libya and Syria are spending their time  desperately trying to stay alive instead of spending their time  planning to attack our airlines, our cities, and our people.   As we speak, Mr. Speaker, Russia lurks, seeking advantage, promoting  instability, and working to erode international norms and instability.  We should make no mistake about Russia as an adversary, because there  is a lot of noise about this. Russia is a country that invades  neighboring sovereign countries, it murders political opponents, it  bombs Syrian hospitals, and, yes, it conducted an unprecedented attack  on the very core of our Democratic system: our free and fair elections.   This bill funds the warriors who are watching that, who are standing  up against that, in order to keep our system what we all like it to be.   Mr. Speaker, because these activities are carried out secretly in the  dark of night and usually unacknowledged, there is always the  possibility for abuse. These activities, by their nature, run up  against the lines of those values that make us Americans. This is  surveillance. It is other things that are worthy of debate. The members  of this committee spend their days in good argument about what the  limits of those  [[Page H6554]]  activities should be, and we will have additional arguments around  things like the reauthorization of the section 702 surveillance  programs. These are terrific arguments that we have in a constructive  way. These are not arguments that are present in this bill. Just as we  did on section 215, we will have a robust discussion of the section 702  international authorities. These are authorities that raise questions  and that should be subject to the debate of this Chamber.   But this bill, this bill today, is about the lifeblood of a  remarkable group of people who don't always get it right any more than  we do, but who are patriots, who respect the Constitution, and who need  our support in the work that they do to keep us safe and keep us free.   I would like to, again, thank the majority, the chairman, the ranking  member, and especially the staff who worked diligently to make this a  bill that we would unanimously support and suggest to my colleagues in  this Chamber that we don't see a lot of bills like this one, but this  one is worthy of their support.
