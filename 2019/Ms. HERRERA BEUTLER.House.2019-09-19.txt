 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an  important chapter in my region's history that must be remembered, and  it is significant to our whole Nation: the service of African American  regiments known as buffalo soldiers.   Their service stations included Fort Vancouver; and afterward, some  of them made our region their permanent home, men like Willie ``Bill''  Morehouse, who served their Nation with courage and honor.   The buffalo soldiers' place in southwest Washington history began in  April of 1899. That date marks the assignment of buffalo soldiers from  Company B of the 24th Infantry to the barracks at Fort Vancouver. This  was also the first time in history that a unit from one of the Army's  four African American regiments was included in Fort Vancouver's  regular garrison of troops.   The buffalo soldiers' contributions to our Nation continued  throughout subsequent conflicts.   Two years ago, we lost a pillar within the greater Vancouver  community, a member and president of the Moses Williams Pacific  Northwest Chapter of the buffalo soldiers, ``Bill'' Morehouse.   Bill was a member of the United States Army and the National Guard  early in his life, with his military service spanning World War II and  the Fort Vancouver barracks as a POW guard.   His contributions to our community went beyond his military service.  Bill led toy and food drives for underprivileged kids, and he provided  honor guard at military ceremonies and parades.   In just a few days, on September 21, a ceremony will take place to  dedicate a permanent memorial at Fort Vancouver to Bill and to the  buffalo soldiers so he will be honorably remembered. This memorial will  help mark their unwavering commitment to our country, a commitment they  made in the face of racism, unfair treatment, and adversity, policies  of the past.   I am proud that their legacy will live on in Vancouver, that their  fight will live on, and I pledge to do whatever I can to ensure that  the buffalo soldiers' stories of service and sacrifice are not  forgotten.                            ____________________
