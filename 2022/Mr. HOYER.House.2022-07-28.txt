 Mr. Speaker, I regret that we find ourselves in this  position of being divided on this bill. This, like every piece of  legislation we pass, is not perfect. And very frankly, if we made a  judgment on every piece of legislation that we considered that I don't  like some other bill, we would be in real trouble. And maybe we are in  real trouble.   There was a manifesto put out by Xi and Putin when they met some  months ago. Essentially what that manifesto said is the dictatorships,  the authoritarian regimes are going to win because democracies cannot  make decisions, they are too divided, they are too slow. This is what  they were thinking about.   This is a good piece of legislation. It is not the piece of  legislation that I would have written, but it is a good piece of  legislation that does good things for America, and more importantly,  good things for our competitive status in the world.   Mr. Speaker, the pandemic has taught us many lessons. One of those  lessons, reinforced by Vladimir Putin's criminal war against Ukraine,  is that we cannot and must not rely on the unreliable. Let me repeat  that. America must not rely on the unreliable. We saw from the pandemic  how reliable we were for so many things we needed to meet the crisis of  the pandemic.   The minority leader, who told us all that he was going to urge all of  his colleagues to vote ``no'' on this bill, talked about inflation. One  of the reasons we have inflation is because we have shortages. That is  what drives prices up when demand is high and supply is low. You don't  have to be an economist to get that lesson.   This bill seeks to address that issue because as we all know, chips  are ubiquitous in almost everything that we have that has anything to  do with electronics.   Every day, Americans see examples of why we must take steps to make  our  [[Page H7379]]  supply chains more secure and more reliable. This deals with that. Yet  my Republican friends urge a ``no'' vote, not because they think this  bill is bad--they may--but because they don't like another bill. That  is what Xi and Putin are counting on. That is what the autocrats and  authoritarians around the world are counting on, that democracies come  to a halt. Because as democracies they debate and they differ, and they  can't make decisions even when a significant number of the minority  party is for this bill. One-third of the United States Senate  Republicans voted for this bill because they thought it was good for  competition between us and China and between us and everybody else.   That is why it is so sad for me to come here seeing this division on  a partisan basis because of another bill. And so America, if we don't  prevail on this bill, will see our competitive edge squandered because  as the Secretary of Commerce says, there are a lot of countries that  are going to put money on the table and say come to me. I am ready. You  build your factory here. You build your chips here. And if America  needs chips, if our manufacturers need chips, well, they can come to  us. Not good. Good for Putin. Good for Xi. Not for us.   We must not rely on hostile foreign competitors to supply critical  components that sustain America's manufacturing base. Chips are at the  heart of that. That is what this bill is about. That is why we bellied  up to the bar. That is why we are putting a lot of money on the table.   This is not the reconciliation bill. This is about America. It is not  about Republicans or Democrats. This is about America, American  workers, American competitiveness, American manufacturers, American  technology.   I thank the chair for the extraordinary investment she has led in  making our research and development compete with China in a way that we  will win. And if we win, our workers and our people will win.   Microchips. In 2022, microchips are in nearly every product, as I  said, from phones to cars to children's toys. At the same time,  advanced semiconductors are becoming more and more integral to high- tech, advanced manufacturing processes, making them critical to our  economy.   Yes, we can wait, maybe until tomorrow, maybe until January when the  minority party takes over--so they think. Maybe we will wait until  then. Or maybe that won't happen, and we will wait 24 months and Xi and  Putin will be saying, hey, yeah, you go to it. They are lobbying  against this bill. They are lobbying, paying to defeat this bill. Do  not be their handmaiden.   America needs a unified Congress if it is going to compete.  Indivisible, one Nation.   One of the best ways for us to ease inflation and bring costs down  for American workers and consumers is to remove these supply pressures  by making more of these critical components here in our country instead  of relying on importing them from abroad. That is what we heard over  and over and over again from the United States Senate.   We are making materials here at home, creating jobs, and streamlining  our supply chains with this bill. This bipartisan legislation--17  Republicans, one-third of the United States Senate Republicans voted  for this bill.   This bipartisan legislation, the CHIPS and Science Act, which will  always be for me the Make It in America Act, represents the most  significant investment in easing inflation and promoting American  manufacturing and innovation that we have seen in a generation. This is  a Make It in America bill. Every time I say that to an audience, no  matter how red or conservative or how blue or how liberal, they all  shake their head, yes, we need to make it in America. That is what this  bill is about.   While it is not as broad as I and others in the House had hoped for,  the bill, nevertheless, achieves so many of our goals. Don't look a  gift horse in the mouth and say no. It makes good on promises that our  majority made to the American people to govern responsibly and build a  post-pandemic economy that works better for more Americans. But this  was a bill that was fashioned in a bipartisan way.                                time  1345    Nobody said at the time, well, it will be for this bill if we like  every one of the bills you are supporting--what a negative way to  perceive legislation to approach how you vote.   This legislation contains substantial new investment in science,  research, and innovation--again, thank you, Eddie Bernice Johnson-- which will help us maintain our competitive edge, commercialize new  discoveries, and train our workforce to succeed in the global economy.   The investments we are making in this legislation are not only a  major victory for American businesses and workers; they achieve a big  part of the Make It In America plan, which I have talked about since  2010. That is, making supply chains more resilient.   When we make microchips and semiconductors in America, more of our  workers and entrepreneurs will surely ``make it'' in America.   Across America, we are now observing Made in America Week. Isn't that  ironic? This is Made in America Week, yet we have a bill on the floor  which invests in making it in America. The minority leader said on this  floor: I am urging all of my Republican colleagues to vote ``no.''  Surely not because they are against making it in America but because  they don't like some other bill, and they are going to stamp their feet  and have a tantrum about the other bill.   This legislation now truly looks forward in ensuring that our workers  and businesses will continue having opportunities to make it in America  long into the future. This is not about today. It is not about  tomorrow. It is about the next year, the next 10 years, the next  generation. That is what this bill is about.   I plead with my colleagues, don't reject this bill based on a  political perception of it.   Mr. Speaker, I again thank Chairwoman Eddie Bernice Johnson for her  leadership on the House's similar legislation, as well as all the  Members who had policies that were incorporated into this bill.   Today, we have a chance to deliver our promise to enact a major  priority from President Biden's economic agenda, and I would suggest a  major economic agenda of Republicans in the United States Senate, as  articulated by the chairman of the Senate Committee on Commerce,  Science, and Transportation. I hope some across the aisle will still  vote for this bill as their Republican colleagues in the Senate did and  as they had signaled they would do for a long time.   The politics changed, but the challenge we have has not, and the  reality has not. Let us not lose this opportunity. It is disappointing  that some in this House have decided to whip against this bill because  of its leadership's opposition to the agreement announced yesterday in  the Senate to move forward with the Inflation Reduction Act. Whether  you like that bill or not, do not pay the price of this bill. Do not  pay the price of setting our competition with others aside.   One would hope that all of us would be both for investment in  American competitiveness and for reducing inflation and the deficit.  Sadly, that seems not to be the case. Nevertheless, I hope we will have  a bipartisan vote today on this bill.   Let's come together to make our supply chain stronger, protect our  national security, invest in our innovation-driven economy, and  advantage American workers so they can make it in America.   Mr. Speaker, I say to my colleagues: We talk about the loyal  opposition. The loyal opposition need not be loyal to the other party.  It does need to be loyal to the country.
