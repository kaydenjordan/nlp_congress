 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the many women who have  lost their lives to breast cancer and those who have survived.   As you know, October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month. In order to  prevent additional loss of life, it is essential that women educate  themselves on prevention and receive regular screenings.   In 2008, I cosponsored legislation supporting the observance of  Breast Cancer Awareness Month, in part, to help get the message out  that this disease can and does kill men and women of all ages.   According to the American Cancer Society, since 2007, death rates in  older women with breast cancer are decreasing, yet death rates in women  under the age of 50 are steady.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage all women watching to get screened regularly  for this devastating disease.                            ____________________
