 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I have an  additional 10 minutes.    Mr. President, we are soon to be voting on the situation  with the rail industry, which is an enormously important issue, not  only for the 125,000 rail workers involved but for the entire country,  because rail plays an enormous role in transporting very, very basic  and important goods that all of us depend upon. It becomes a health  issue, et cetera, et cetera.   But I want to take a half a moment to put this rail issue into a  broader context and then get back to the rail situation. And that is,  what polls are telling us and what I think each and every Member of the  Senate sees and hears from his or her constituents is, people in this  country are increasingly disgusted with the kind of selfishness and  corporate greed that we are seeing.  [[Page S6931]]    Now, we don't talk about it much, and the media doesn't talk about it  much, but there is more income and wealth inequality in America today  than we have seen in at least 100 years. And the gap between the very,  very rich and the middle class and everybody else is growing wider and  wider.   And today, in the midst of this inflationary period, when so many of  our workers are struggling to put food on the table, when they are  falling behind economically, the billionaire class has literally never  had it so good. These guys don't know what to do with their money. You  don't know how many mansions they can own, how many islands they can  have. Some of them are building spaceships to take them to Mars. They  don't know what to do with their many billions of dollars. And yet, as  we speak, 85 million Americans can't afford health insurance; 60,000 a  year die because they don't get to a doctor on time; 45 million people  dealing with student debt; families can't afford childcare for their  kids. We have 600,000 people who are homeless in America, including  people a few blocks away from the U.S. Capitol.   The rich are getting much richer. The middle class continues to  shrink. And if you want to talk about the excesses of corporate greed,  then you have got to talk about the rail industry and what is going on  here right now.   Now, everybody understands that businesses sometimes have trouble.  They lose money. They are in trouble. They go to their workers and say:  Hey, things are tough, we all have to cut back. We understand that.   That is not the case today with the rail industry. For the rail  industry, business has never been better, recordbreaking profits. This  year alone, for the first three quarters, their profits are up by over  $21 billion. They have so much money that they are able to give over  $25 billion in stock buybacks and in dividends.   That is what is going on with the rail industry. One of the CEOs in  the rail industry makes $20 million a year. Another guy makes $14  million a year. They are doing phenomenally well. But what is also  going on in the rail industry is that over the last 6 years, they have  cut back on their workforce by 30 percent, which means that workers in  the rail industry are asked to do more with less support.   So for 3\1/2\ years, there have been negotiations between the  industry and the 12 rail unions. And the end result of this is that the  workers received a 24-percent increase in their wages. It sounds like a  lot of money. That is for a 5-year period. They have not received a pay  increase in the last 3 years. And if you average it out, that pay  increase is less than inflation to date. It is not a great wage  increase. It is not terrible, but it is not a great wage increase.   I have heard talk about healthcare. They wanted healthcare. They  didn't win on healthcare. What the industry, unbelievably, wanted to  do, despite recordbreaking profits, is ask workers to pay more for  their health insurance. That was beaten back. So they remain at a  status quo. Not a victory, but not a defeat.   But most egregiously, if you talk to the workers as I have--what is  the issue? It is not wages. It is not benefits. Their issue is paid  sick leave. They are one of the few industries in America today that  have zero sick paid leave. Unbelievably, if a worker today on the rail  industry gets sick, that worker gets a mark for missing work and can  and--in some cases--will be fired.   Can you imagine that? Here in Congress, we all--conservatives,  progressives--we have staff--all of us, and people get sick. Of course,  they take time off. You don't fire them. You don't give them marks. You  don't punish them because they got sick. This is America, 2022. You  don't treat people--especially in the rail industry, who are doing  dangerous, difficult work.   Now, I have to be honest. I know that the Secretary of Labor and the  Secretary of Transportation have worked really hard on this issue. But  I need to hear from them the willingness, which I think there will be,  to demand that the industry do what has to be done, and that is to  provide paid sick leave for their workers.   I will have an amendment. I assume that is coming up in a few  moments. This is not a radical idea. It is a very conservative idea.   And it says, if you work in the rail industry, you will get 7 paid  sick days. And I would hope that we would have strong support and the  60 votes that we need to pass this very, very important amendment that  is wanted by every one of the rail unions and, I think, is  overwhelmingly supported by the American people.   With that, I yield all time back.                          Vote on Amendment No. 6503    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, the American people are increasingly  disgusted at the level of corporate greed that we see today. We have  more income and wealth inequality in America now than we have had in  100 years--billionaires getting richer, working people falling further  and further behind.   And there is no clearer example of corporate greed than what we see  in the rail industry today.   In the last year, that industry earned $21 billion in profits-- recordbreaking--and provided $25 billion in stock buybacks and  dividends to their wealthy shareholders. And yet, today, in that  industry, workers who do difficult and dangerous work have zero paid  sick days. Zero. You get sick, you get a mark against you; couple of  marks, you get fired. This cannot and must not happen in America in  2022.   This amendment simply says 7 paid sick days for workers in the rail  industry, and I hope we can win it.  [[Page S6932]]                                Vote on H. Con. Res. 119    I ask for the yeas and nays, and I yield back all remaining time on  both sides.
