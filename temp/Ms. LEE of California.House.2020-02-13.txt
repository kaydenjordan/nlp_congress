 Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for  yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support today of Congresswoman  Speier's bill, H.J. Res. 79. I thank Congresswoman Speier and  Congresswoman Maloney for their consistent leadership as warrior women.   The ERA would guarantee rights to all and would finally affirm  women's equality in our Constitution by removing this arbitrary  deadline.   We know that, too often, women have been relegated to the sidelines  and left  [[Page H1139]]  out of the Constitution, especially Black women and women of color. For  example, there is still rampant gender wage discrimination.   Discrimination against women must end. That is why the ERA is so  important. It would make sure that our government would ensure that  women are treated equally, a right that needs to be clearly outlined in  every aspect of our country.   I want my granddaughters, Jordan, Simone, and Giselle, to know that  they are equal to men, that their rights are enshrined in the  Constitution. They, like every girl and woman, deserve equality in  their country. They should know that their country, the United States  of America, has finally joined the rest of the world to stand up for  their rights as American women.
