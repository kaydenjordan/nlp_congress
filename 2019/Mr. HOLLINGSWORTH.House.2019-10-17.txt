 Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the bill being  discussed today. While I appreciate my good friend Mr. Casten's effort  on the bill, the problem is in the details.    While he clearly stated that this is a narrowly tailored bill, the  reality is that a casual counting of SEC-promulgated rules yields over  600 rules that this would apply to. At 6 months of testing each, that  is over 300 years' worth of testing--300 years. Our Republic hasn't  been in existence for 300 years.   What I hear from Hoosiers back home is they are tired of our  regulators being distracted and going back and looking at the history,  and what they want to be focused on is how they protect investors going  forward.   As Mr. Casten and I have discussed before, I think we share those  laudable aims about ensuring that disclosures truly convey the  information we want them to convey, but this bill doesn't do that.   This bill distracts the SEC from the necessary work on regulating our  markets and protecting our investors by going back and doing hundreds  of investor tests on over 600 different SEC-promulgated rules. Because  of that, I will oppose the bill.
