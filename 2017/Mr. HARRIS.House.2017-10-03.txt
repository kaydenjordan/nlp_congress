 Mr. Speaker, the Nation stands in mourning over the  tragedy in Las Vegas. No one ever wants to be in that situation. But  it, once again, reminds us that, when there is danger, our law  enforcement officers run to it, not away from it.   We are going to hear many stories from that tragedy in Las Vegas, but  many of them will concern those brave law enforcement officers who, at  the risk of their own life, protected and saved the lives of many, many  others.   So, as we mourn the tragedy in Las Vegas, let us always remember and  be thankful for those law enforcement officers who protect us each and  every day.                            ____________________
