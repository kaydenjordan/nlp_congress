 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks.    Madam Speaker, the former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of  Staff, Mike Mullen, called our national debt ``the single biggest  threat to national security.''   Since then, we have added more than $7 trillion more in red ink. Our  national debt today stands at $22 trillion, and it is only getting  worse.   The Congressional Budget Office is projecting trillion-dollar  deficits in perpetuity. These deficits will leave future generations  like my daughter's generation saddled with higher taxes, stagnant  growth, and a lower standard of living. This is simply unacceptable.   Thankfully, pro-growth policies implemented by President Trump and  congressional Republicans have led to a booming economy with 3.2  percent GDP growth and unemployment below 4 percent.   Our strong economy provides Congress a unique opportunity to tackle  this problem, but bold leadership is required to do so.   Unfortunately, it is clear that there will be no such leadership from  the Democrats. The Democrats have failed to perform the most basic  function of government, which is passing a budget. In fact, they have  not even bothered to bring a budget to the floor for a vote. Why, you  might ask? Because the radical left is now in control of the Democratic  agenda and demanding trillions of dollars in additional spending for  programs like the Green New Deal, which aims to eliminate everything  from air travel to requiring every single building in the United States  to be rebuilt or upgraded, banning farting cows, and will cost upwards  of $92 trillion to implement; or, another budget-busting initiative  like Medicare-for-all, which would increase government spending by $32  trillion over the next decade.                                time  1715    Think about that for a moment. The Democrats look at $22 trillion in  debt,  [[Page H3831]]  trillion-dollar deficits, and think that we aren't spending enough  already of our taxpayer dollars.   Thankfully, the Republican Study Committee is here to do something  about it, and we have taken the challenge head-on.   As chairman of the Republican Study Committee's Budget and Spending  Task Force, I am very proud to have worked with a task force of eight  of my colleagues, as well as the rest of our 141-member strong  Republican Study Committee, to produce the ``Preserving American  Freedom'' budget resolution.   This budget reduces government debt by cutting $12.6 trillion in  wasteful spending over the next 10 years.   It ensures permanent solvency for Medicare and Social Security so  that these programs will exist for the seniors who rely on them today,  as well as for future generations.   It repeals ObamaCare and gives unprecedented control to the States to  design healthcare programs that fit the unique needs of their citizens.   It reforms welfare to move more people into employment with a sense  of purpose and self-reliance.   Finally, it matches President Trump's commitment to national security  by fully funding the border wall and making the necessary investments  in our military to ensure the safety of the American people from  foreign threats.   The ``Preserving American Freedom'' budget is the only serious  proposal from Congress to address Washington's addiction to spending  and a bloated and growing national debt. I am very proud to have led  the RSC's effort to tackle this generational challenge and ensure a  brighter future for all Americans.   Madam Speaker, tonight, we are going to hear from some of my  colleagues about this very important budget proposal and what we can do  to address fiscal responsibility so desperately needed in Washington,  D.C.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Cloud).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr.  Mitchell), my good friend and fellow classmate of the last  congressional class, a great conservative leader in the Congress.    Madam Speaker, what I hear from Hoosiers all over my  district is that they sent their Representatives here to bring back  fiscal sanity, to balance our budget. That is what hardworking Hoosier  families do every day.   It is what they have come to find in their State legislature in my  great home State of Indiana as well. Indiana has a balanced budget  amendment. We have legislators who go to the State house and pass  fiscally responsible budgets every 2 years.   It was a pleasure of mine for 6 years to serve with the next speaker,  somebody who is a true American hero and one of the great conservative  leaders of this freshman class in the new Congress.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Baird).    Madam Speaker, the State of Indiana has so much to be  proud of. Indiana provides a road map for the rest of the Nation when  it comes to fiscal responsibility.   There are few leaders in the House of Representatives who do as much  for the conservative cause and promote fiscal responsibility as  Representative Hice from the great State of Georgia.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Hice).    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments  tonight.   Madam Speaker, as I said before, there are 140 members of the  Republican Study Committee. Many of those 140 members are new freshman  Members who were elected just beginning of this Congress, who are  conservative Members who stepped up to the plate to preach fiscal  responsibility, to keep the commitments that they made on the campaign  trail. One of those new Members is my colleague and friend,  Representative Hern from Oklahoma.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Kevin  Hern).    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments.   As the gentleman from Oklahoma said, the Republican Study Committee  budget is the only budget proposal on the table. It is the only  proposal that balances the budget, that begins to rein in wasteful  government spending and begins to pay down a disastrous $22 trillion  national debt.   There are few Members in this Congress whom I have served with who  have preached fiscal responsibility as much as my friend and my  colleague from Georgia (Mr. Allen).   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Allen).    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia, a great  friend and a great conservative in the House of Representatives, for  being here tonight.   Madam Speaker, when the chairman of the Republican Study Committee,    Mike Johnson from Louisiana, asked me to take on this task as chairman  of the Budget and Spending Task Force, I was very proud to do so, not  just because I have enormous respect for Chairman Johnson as a  conservative leader in this Congress, but because of the stature and  reputation of the Republican Study Committee.                                time  1745    At one point, our Vice President, from my home State, Mike Pence, one  of the greatest conservative leaders in this Nation, was chairman of  the Republican Study Committee. And so, too, was another man whom I  respect just as much, one of the greatest leaders in our Nation, the  Republican whip, Mr.   Steve Scalise, from Louisiana, chair of the  Republican Study Committee, too. The reputation of RSC is important  because it is the conservative vehicle in the Congress to advance  conservative principles. No one does that more on a daily basis than my  friend from Louisiana (Mr. Scalise).   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Scalise).    Madam Speaker, this Republican Study Committee budget  proposal was a gigantic effort: over 300 member proposals from the 141  members of the Republican Study Committee who offered ideas and  proposals to include in this budget proposal.   Over the past several weeks, we met on a weekly basis, almost a dozen  times, to put together this budget proposal, assembling a task force of  eight conservative members, who gathered on a weekly basis to comb  through the Federal budget to talk about ways that we could put forth  something that conservatives, not just in Congress but throughout the  country, could be very proud of.   I am really proud that, on our task force, we had Members who came  from different States, different perspectives, who had different ideas.  That made the effort stronger and, in the end, it allowed us to produce  a stronger budget proposal. One of those members, I am very proud to  say, is my friend, the representative from Florida, my colleague,  Representative Yoho.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Yoho).    Madam Speaker, we need to confront this fiscal challenge  now, as it is no longer a far-off concern.   Currently, we are set to run trillion-dollar deficits in perpetuity.  The Social Security trust fund will be bankrupt by 2035. The Medicare  trust fund will be bankrupt by 2026. Without bold and immediate action,  this growing debt will condemn America to a future that is less  prosperous and less free.   My colleagues and I from the Republican Study Committee are  determined to make sure that this never materializes. The Republican  Study Committee preserving the American freedom budget would not only  prevent that bleak future, it would ensure even greater prosperity for  all Americans for years and generations to come.   I could not be prouder to lead this effort on behalf of the  Republican Study Committee and its 141 conservative members.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
