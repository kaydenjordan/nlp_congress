 Mr. Speaker, it is a personal thrill for me to  participate in this special hour. I want to thank the gentlewoman from  California for doing a very good job of surprising our guest of honor  this evening. She did it very well because she did it on policy.   She got Marcy to come here on a night when she should be celebrating,  but she didn't hesitate to come down here to talk about what is wrong  with Wall Street, which shows you how committed Marcy Kaptur is.                                time  1945    When I think of Marcy Kaptur, I think of a string of pearls. She is  always providing pearls of wisdom to all of us. We have heard from many  Members who have spoken about the fact that she has mentored them. I  know when I was a young Member here--young only in time served--that it  was Marcy who came up to me a number of times to show support and to  provide me guidance.   She also has a very elegant way, a very simple and elegant way that  she comports herself. When she talks about issues, she talks with great  passion, but with great dignity--again, a reflection of a string of  pearls.   She has never forgotten her roots. She has never forgotten her  constituents. Now, her blood may be red, but there is a lot of blue  running through them because she has always been there for the blue- collar worker. And she oftentimes in caucus is the conscience for all  of us because she reminds us about the working class: What are we doing  for the working class, lower middle class Americans?   Her commitment to economic justice cannot be lost on any of us  because that has been one of the main principles that has really  directed her work here and has been a moral compass for her.   So when the financial meltdown happened, Marcy had such a passion for  wanting to right this terrible wrong, and she was no longer serving on  the Financial Services Committee, but she had a thirst to learn  everything she possibly could about what was necessary to reform the  system. And I remember her coming to a briefing that I had with some  experts, and then she invited me to a briefing that she had with some  experts because all she wanted to do was get to the truth of what we  needed to do.   She has conviction that she, I think, reflected in all she did  through that financial meltdown because she was going to stop at  nothing less than wholesale changes to fix the system, because, as many  of us felt: never, ever again.   So as I think about the fact that we are celebrating the longest  serving woman in the history of the United States House of  Representatives, I feel so privileged to say that I know you; that I  have served with you. There is no one who is more ethical in this  building than you; there is no one more compassionate in this building  than you; and there is no one more committed to economic justice in  this building.   There has never been, nor do I think will there ever be, anyone who  cares about Ohio like Marcy Kaptur.   Marcy, thank you for being a beacon for all of us to follow. I truly  love you, respect you, honor you; and I am truly pleased that we are  celebrating a wonderful career here tonight that is only going to  continue. But I think we all feel pretty special being part of this  celebration.
