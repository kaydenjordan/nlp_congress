 Mr. President, in recent years we have seen the inability  of the Federal government to quickly adapt to changing technology and  evolving cyber security threats. In June of 2015 the Office of  Personnel Management (OPM) announced it had fallen victim to a major  cyber breach, compromising the personally identifiable information of  more than 22 million current and former Federal employees, including  myself. Seven months later, nearly half a million more Americans had  their social security numbers stolen when the Internal Revenue Service  was hacked. We found out last year that the U.S. Securities and  Exchange Commission had been hacked in 2016.   I spent 28 years in the private sector, 12 years with a global cloud  computing company. We faced new cyber threats daily and our customers  expected security. We delivered, not once was our data compromised.   I know firsthand that industry has the talent and the incentive to  revolutionize cyber security and keep their information systems secure.  The Federal government should unbridle the private sector whenever  possible, utilizing their expertise, learning from their best  practices, and facilitating their innovation.   That is why I am introducing the Cyber Support for Anti-Terrorism by  Fostering Effective Technologies Act or the Cyber SAFETY Act. Since  2002, the Department of Homeland Security's existing SAFETY Act program  has successfully incentivized the private sector's development and  deployment of anti-terrorism and security technologies through limited  liability protections. It has ensured the threat of litigation does not  deter entrepreneurs from developing and commercializing products and  services that protect lives and infrastructure. This legislation will  simply expand the applicability of the program to ensure that cyber  security firms can qualify for these same protections. It will enable  cyber security firms to innovate and commercialize new technologies  without a technology mandate.   I ask my Senate colleagues to join me in support of this important  legislation.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be  printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 2392         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.
