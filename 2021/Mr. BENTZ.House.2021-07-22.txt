 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call the Nation's attention  to a tragic event unfolding in my State of Oregon, the horrifically  destructive Bootleg fire.  [[Page H3827]]    This fire, now the third largest in my State's history, has consumed  some 400,000 acres. That is about 660 square miles of previously  beautiful landscape, pine, fir, sagebrush, grass, and meadows. The fire  has taken millions of board feet of timber, the lives of thousands of  forest creatures, cattle by the dozens, if not hundreds, horses,  fences, buildings, and homes. The fire has released hundreds of  thousands of tons of carbon, which could have remained sequestered far  into the future. The smoke plume created by this conflagration has  reached across this Nation, more than 2,000 miles, to pollute the air  across the U.S., reaching finally the East Coast, including the air  right here in Washington, D.C.   I have spoken with people whose homes and ranches were in the path of  this fire. It moved so fast they could not gather and remove their  cattle in time to save them. They have been sending me pictures of  animals that have perished and pictures of many others who had to be  put down because of injuries they suffered from the flames from which  they could not escape. These are truly some of the saddest photos I  have ever seen.   How did we get here? Fires happen naturally in our Western forests.  They have always been a part of the Western landscape. These fires used  to burn low to the ground at relatively low temperatures. Underbrush,  vegetation, and smaller trees would burn, and in what were normal  times, larger trees would survive.   Then about 100 years ago, our Nation decided to put out and suppress  these fires. For years the trees and brush that grew unabated by fire  were reduced to some extent by logging activities then allowed in our  forests.   In the 1970s, forests saw the beginning of a steep reduction in  forest management, and our forests began to grow unnaturally dense.  Federal regulations decimated the timber industry, leaving more and  more trees and brush on our Federal lands. The fires, fueled by this  huge amount of ever-increasing woody mass, grew in their ferocity and  danger. And now, after years of fire suppression and woefully  inadequate forest management, we are paying the price.   The horrific infernos we are seeing out West are not the fires of  centuries past. These terrifying, out-of-control wildfires become so  immense, they often start burning from the top of the trees, not from  the underbrush, leaping from treetop to treetop, causing the fire to  travel faster and burn hotter.   The blame for our forests' deplorable and dangerous condition does  not belong to any one person or group. However, I must call out the  massive special-interest lawsuit industry that profits from the  operation of the Equal Access to Justice Act by legally kneecapping  almost every attempt to manage our Western forests.                                time  1230    So what is the long-term solution? We are seeing some early evidence  that managed forests fared far better than did forests that were not  thinned or otherwise treated in anticipation of the fires that are sure  to come. Firefighters on the ground indicated that thinned areas slowed  down the fires so that firefighters had a fighting chance to bring the  fire in those areas under control.   This is good news because it means there is some hope. There is a way  out of this if Congress can find the political will to work toward a  solution.   I am pleased to report I am working with ranking member Bruce  Westerman, whose Resilient Federal Forests Act will be a huge step  toward giving the Forest Service the tools it needs to better manage  our vast public lands.   In fact, today, I introduced legislation included in that package,  the Commonsense Coordination Act. This bill will cut through some of  the red tape that agencies must overcome to complete critical forest  management activities.   I express my sympathy to the people suffering from the Bootleg fire  and all the fires across the West. My staff and I have been on nonstop  calls with local officials, county commissioners, and ranchers. The  experiences they are sharing are incredibly sad and made more so by the  fact that we could have done so much better when it came to protecting  our Nation's forests and those that live in and around them. I will  continue to do all I can here in Congress to help.   Lastly, I thank all the brave men and women who are out fighting the  fires, including firefighters, farmers, ranchers, helicopter pilots and  others. This is hot, dirty, difficult, and dangerous work, but their  tireless efforts are saving lives, homes, forests, wildlife, livestock,  and property.
