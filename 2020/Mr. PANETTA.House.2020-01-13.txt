 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 200  firefighters from the United States, including California, who packed  up and deployed out to help our friends from Down Under in Australia  fight one of the biggest fire disasters we have ever seen on this  Earth.   A fire that has burned millions of acres, destroyed thousands of  businesses, farms, and homes, killed 25 people, and incinerated close  to 1 billion animals.   For over 15 years the United States and Australia have shared  firefighters to help each other contain their growing wildfires; but as  we are experiencing--and, yes, due to climate change--our fire seasons  are getting longer and longer, our droughts are getting drier and  drier, and our fires are getting bigger, costlier, and deadlier.   That is why we are so grateful to the firefighters, not only for  their service to our communities but for their willingness to travel  and fight fires in  [[Page H204]]  other countries. That appreciation for those firefighters will be  demonstrated in Congress later this week when I introduce a resolution  recognizing their work, their will, and their courage.   But let that resolution also be a reminder of the work and commitment  needed by all nations to not just fight fires for our safety, but to  continue to fight climate change for our future.                            ____________________
