 Mr. Speaker, if you listen to my friends on the other  side of the aisle, they are going to tell you that having access to a  lawyer in a court is a bad thing, but it is the foundation of American  justice. The foundation of American justice is that, if somebody rips  you off, you can sue them in court.   These arbitration clauses are the fine print, Mr. Speaker, that you  find in these contracts that say, if you have a dispute with this  particular company, you can only go to arbitration. And these  arbitrators are almost always picked by the company themselves.   The fact is this is not justice. It is a railroad court. It is not a  real court, and consumers are less well off. That is why over 100,000  individual consumers across the country wrote in to support the rule  during the public comment period.   If my friends on the other side of the aisle are right, how come they  don't have 100,000 people saying that their position is correct?   The people have spoken. They have engaged in the comment period and  said: We want to be able to go to court to hold these people  accountable.   Wells Fargo ripped off literally hundreds of thousands of Americans.  In 2 million transactions, they opened up accounts people never asked  for.   If you sue them, you might just be limited to an arbitration clause,  which limits your award, and they pick the judge. Why not be able to  join with other Americans and sue in court the good, old-fashioned way:  get some discovery, get some money back, get some justice? This is what  it is all about.   We believe that the American people deserve to take them to court if  they take your money and rip you off. That is what we are standing up  for today.   This is nothing but a U.S. Chamber, Big Business giveaway that they  are talking about. We stand on the side of American consumers. American  consumers want to take them to court.                                time  1600
