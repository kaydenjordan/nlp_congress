 Mr. President, in a moment, I am going to make a unanimous  consent request on a piece of legislation on which my Eastern Oregon  constituents have done an extraordinary job with respect to building a  coalition that brings people together on a contentious issue. It  deserves enormous credit, and I will describe their efforts here  shortly.   I also want to thank, as we begin, Senator Barrasso. Senator Barrasso  will be taking on a new role in January on the Senate Committee on  Energy and Natural Resources. He and I have worked together often, and  I have appreciated his talking with me on this matter as he begins to  look to his new duties in January.   Mr. President, as in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent  that the Energy and Natural Resources Committee be discharged from  further consideration of S. 2828, the Malheur Community Empowerment for  the Owyhee Act, and the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration;  further, that the bill be considered read a third time and passed; and  that the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the  table with no intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I know my colleague does have other  business that he has to get to, but before he attends to that, I just  want to thank him for spending time with me already on this issue. I am  going to outline the extraordinary effort that was made by my  constituents.   I think we all know--and I am going to discuss it--that in the West,  very often, citizens feel nobody is listening to them, that nobody  cares about them. The Senator and I have talked about this. This is  kind of a question of, How do you empower them with a framework that  can help them but also serve as a model for the country?   So a big thanks to my colleague, and I am looking forward to working  with him on this and other matters next year.   What Senator Barrasso and I are discussing is the Malheur  Community Empowerment for the Owyhee Act, known in our part of the  county as the Malheur CEO Act. The bill has been in the works since  late 2018. Back then, when a group of ranchers and business people who  live in Malheur County, OR, came to see me, they came to talk about  this incredible part of Oregon they call home. It is wide open country,  and not many people live there, but those who do want to make sure they  have a say in how it is going to be preserved and managed for the  future.    When I say this bill has been in the works since 2018, that is not  the whole story, because the fact is that the groundwork for this bill  has been in the making for decades, and it is only recently that an  incredible coalition of Oregonians from across the political spectrum  has come together to make it possible for us to propose this  legislation.   As I touched on with Senator Barrasso, in rural areas of the West,  like Malheur County, there is often a feeling that people from  thousands of miles away, particularly in DC, think that they somehow  know better than rural citizens about what is good for those rural  communities. I guess I would sum it up as: In rural areas, there is the  sense that somehow, often, elites just look down on them; that nobody  is listening; that people in power  [[Page S7515]]  consider them kind of simple cowboys who care little about saving land,  air, and water.   Now, I have townhall meetings in every county in Oregon. I had 970 of  them until earlier this spring when we couldn't do them in person due  to the pandemic. So we started doing them virtually. I know from all of  those townhall meetings that constituents in Eastern Oregon are  actually working every day to try to propose commonsense, practical  policies to preserve special places for their kids and their grandkids.  They know that they are working for all Americans because all Americans  own public lands. Eastern Oregonians believe--and I think it is a very  powerful point--that nobody cares more about protecting Oregon's  natural treasures than those who live every day in those communities  and are always thinking about what the future is for their kids and  their grandkids.   I will repeat that.   Folks in rural Oregon know that the land is public land, that it  belongs to all Americans, and they know that their communities' futures  depend on keeping the lands healthy and usable. The ranchers of Malheur  County want to be active participants in improving and keeping the  ecological health of our public lands, and with this legislation that  we are discussing today, they will have a real shot at doing just that.   The fact is that, in some parts of the West, there have been bad  actors who have abused the land for their own gain and flouted the law  in a dangerous way. For example, in 2016, a heavily armed group of  extremists that was not from Oregon, led by members of the Bundy  family, stormed the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge and occupied it  for weeks. There was a standoff that people all over the country saw,  between them and Federal, State, and local law enforcement. There was  one death. Further south, in Nevada, the Bundys have not only stolen  millions of dollars' worth of grazing fees from the American people,  they also basically pushed aside basic environmental standards laid out  by the Taylor Grazing Act, leading to degraded landscapes.   Now, in Malheur County, just a few hours of wide open spaces east of  the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge that the extremists took over, our  ranchers and our small business people, to their great credit, said: We  are going to take a different path, a better path. In Malheur County,  you don't have the Bundys breaking the law. Our Malheur County ranchers  are committed to being better and doing better, but that doesn't mean  they aren't skeptical of people coming in and changing the rules when  it comes to public lands surrounding their communities.   So, in 2018, the Owyhee Basin Stewardship Coalition from Malheur  County came to Washington to meet with me. Senator Barrasso will be  interested in this. This group of ranchers and small business people  came to me with a very improbable request for a Democratic U.S.  Senator: Would I be willing to work with them to pass land management  legislation that could serve as an alternative to a designation as a  national monument?   I thought this would be the point my colleagues would be interested  in: I asked one member of the group if they had come to me because they  thought I might take leave of my senses and say yes to their request.  When I asked them, the person who was looking at me said: Yes, that is  what we thought, Ron.   Looming over the discussion was the history of this wonderful part of  Eastern Oregon. I am not going to take my colleagues through a long  discussion of the history of the Taylor Grazing Act, as it goes all the  way back to 1932. So I will just start with the fact that in this area,  Malheur County makes up most of the Vale District of the Bureau of Land  Management, which, of course, is part of the Department of the  Interior. The Vale District was the poster child for ``scientific  grazing management'' in the 1960s and early 1970s under the Taylor  Grazing Act. Did it live up to its potential? I would say it didn't  because its efforts really were not adequately funded, and it lacked  the consistent monitoring or the adaptive management needed to make it  work on the ground, and that raises the question: What results are  really at issue?   The Taylor Grazing Act is about turning cattle out onto public lands  and attempting to assure they don't destroy the land, but where is the  act when it comes to fighting invasive weeds and actually improving  soil health and responding to climate change and the effects of  rangeland fires? In looking at what happened over the decades--the  1930s, the 1960s, the 1970s--this bill says we are going to answer  those questions for 2020.   The Owyhee Basin Stewardship Coalition from Malheur County wanted to  work together. I was glad that they came with their improbable request.  I said we have got one chance here on our watch to bring people  together, to come up with a sensible proposal. And when they indicated  they wanted to work with me, I basically said: How could I refuse?   Knowing the violence that can erupt in the West when people become  closed off, when people just refuse to talk, that is when you have a  prescription for trouble. As long as we are talking, as long as we are  coming together, as long as we are sitting with each other and maybe  just having a coffee, a tuna fish sandwich, you have an opportunity to  come up with solutions. That is why I agreed to this.   I agreed, in effect, to try to match the courage of these ranchers  and business people in coming forward, and I said: If they are going to  be willing to think through how to do this, I am going to join them.   Now, the other area I want to touch on is--I said at the get-go and I  think this has implications for dealing with public lands in the West.  I said that there has got to be three requirements to help us all  protect the land and preserve the ranching way of life.   First, we would have to bring everybody to the table-- environmentalists, ranchers, local folks, and we would have to bring  some of the folks from the more metropolitan area as well. That is  because, in effect, when I said that, they said: OK. You know your way  around legislation. We will try to find common ground.   And there is common ground on the key question. In every nook and  cranny of Oregon, there are people who care about our natural treasures  in the Owyhee Canyonlands. Malheur County may keep its clock on Idaho  time, but it is enormously loved all across our State. In my view, that  alone ought to be a reason, after decades and decades of differences  with respect to how to manage these treasures, that alone is a reason  to work together.   The second rule of our discussions was all about we weren't going to  litigate this with the press and outside groups every time somebody had  a little question, any kind of a dispute. So, in effect, we had set it  up so that other groups, environmental and ranchers, there was going to  be a lot of opportunity for folks to have their say.   And the third rule was that there would be an understanding that we  would respect our environmental laws. That was also very pivotal. So,  in March of 2019, we got our group together in the conference room at  the National Guard Armory in Ontario, OR, and those were the things  that we wanted to start with that we thought gave us a chance to build  this coalition that could lead to passing legislation to manage these  treasures. So we got ranchers, environmentalists, local businesses, and  we meet, essentially, every other Monday for months and months.   I also want to thank the Bureau of Land Management and the U.S. Fish  and Wildlife Service, Oregon State parks, fish and wildlife management  agencies, local Tribe representatives, all of whom put in enormous  amounts of time offering information, expertise, and good will. I met  with local county officials, as well, relearning their thoughts with  respect to roads and water infrastructure and their most important  local economic needs. So that is what really led to this legislation.   Finally, what we said is that we have to make sure that people have  an opportunity to also talk, sort of, a little bit offline. So after  these sessions, we always found a way to make it to a gathering place  somewhere where people could just have a soda, perhaps something a  little bit stronger, and we could just take the time informally to talk  about what we thought the future was for this incredible part of the  world.  [[Page S7516]]    Now, in closing up, I want to mention that I think land designation  discussions pit people against one another in the West if you do it the  traditional sort of way. We needed some unity if we were going to come  together on a bill. So that is why we wanted to make sure everybody had  a shared understanding of how this would be addressed.   I particularly want at this time to commend Sarah Bittleman, who is  sitting here with me, who, month after month after month, call after  call after call, email after email after email, always tried to keep  this on focus.   I also want to mention at this time our inspiration was the late Mary  Gautreaux, who was in our office for over two decades. She was the  spirit of this effort. She lived in Portland. Yet she was beloved-- beloved--by the people of rural Oregon, the people of Malheur County.  So with Sarah and Mary as the energy behind this, we really set out to  build this coalition, which has gotten us to this point. It was a  coalition driven on the fact that people would take the time to do this  right.   When I brought it to the attention of Senator Barrasso, who obviously  will play a key role in the Energy and Natural Resources Committee next  year, the first thing he wanted to hear about was the kind of  groundwork that had been laid for local input, for local stakeholders.  I described to him much of what we have been talking about.    So I introduced the Malheur CEO Act in November of 2019. It was part  of a legislative hearing in 2020, and let me just very quickly describe  a couple of elements of it. It works this way: It includes range land  management enhancements, loop roads to focus tourist travel and build  the local economy, and about a million acres of wilderness designation.  It also moves around a million acres of land now being studied into  multiple-use management.   The bill implements a few key strategies: a plan to let ranchers do  range improvements, irrigation systems, removing water-sucking juniper,  and replacing invasive weeds with native grasses and improve the  ecological health of the range land.   So here are the pictures to my left. The first is a picture of  rangeland being overrun by weeds. The second shows rangeland in a  native, healthy condition.   Now, the bill also establishes a Malheur Community Empowerment for  the Owyhee advisory group so on an ongoing basis it can advise BLM on  land management. And the bill also provides substantial funding for the  BLM so it can finish environmental soil surveys and carry out  environmental policies associated with this bill and monitor the  implementation of the bill.   The bill includes funding for the study and designation of three loop  roads designed to improve the visitor experience, keep visitors out of  trouble, and drive more traffic to the small retail businesses, which I  think we all understand desperately--desperately--need our attention.   I also want to thank at this point, while I am on floor, Senator  Grassley. He and I have led the bipartisan effort on the Finance  Committee.   I see Senator Manchin here. He knows how strongly we feel about  getting the small businesses the deductibility associated with these  PPP loans.   I bring this up only by way of saying that we are grateful to Senator  Grassley for working with me. He is the chair of the Finance Committee.  I am the ranking Democrat, but Senator Manchin and others deserve  credit for helping us get that proposal moving, and we made it clear we  have to get that in before we go home. Part of it is our concern for  the small retail businesses that we saw in the Owyhee.   Finally, the bill provides for amenities at the Owyhee Reservoir with  a marina. That is also good for the local economy. Recreation is a big  economic engine in our part of the world.   And the last point I will just mention is the bill is a compromise.  Everybody had to make some concessions.   There are folks who feel that the environmental groups got too much  here. There are folks who feel the ranchers and the small business  people got too much. But the fact is, all sides said: We have some core  values and some core priorities. Let's see if we can address the core  values and core priorities on both sides of this so that this  spectacular portion of Eastern Oregon could be protected and preserved  and we could respect and empower the people who call it home and work  so hard to make a living there.   Finally, I ask unanimous consent to put into the Record the names of  all the people who worked so hard on this effort--our Owyhee Basin  Stewardship Coalition. They are ranchers; there are folks on various  kinds of environmental organizations and groups; and they deserve  incredible credit for being willing to put in the time and effort on  something that seemed so improbable.   Finally, I want to thank my partner here in the Senate, Senator  Merkley. He has been terrific as we worked on this. We both share a  love of the land in Eastern Oregon.   Now it is up to the U.S. Senate to get this passed. It isn't going to  happen today, unfortunately, but I want the Senate to know I am going  to stay at it until this gets done. I think it will be of enormous  benefit for rural Oregon. I think it will be of enormous benefit for  our State, and I think it will be a model for how our country brings  people together, particularly as it relates to issues where we have  been polarized in the past   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:         The Owyhee Basin Stewardship Coalition members who sat       through most of the meetings:        Steve Russell, chair/rancher        Andy Bentz, former sheriff and Cliff Bentz's brother        Linda Bentz, rancher and Cliff and Andy's sister-in-law        Elias Eiguren, rancher        Mark Mackenzie, rancher        Jaime Yturriondobeitia, rancher        Paulette Pyle, local consultant and former advocate        And members of the environmental community who also sat       through all or most of the meetings that lead to S. 2828        Tim Davis, Friends of the Owyhee        Ryan Houston and Corie Harlan, Oregon Natural Desert       Association        David Moryc, American Rivers        Nicole Cordan, Pew Charitable Trust        Liz Sullivan, Northwest Sports Fishermen        With special thanks to Brent Grasty and Don Gonzalez at the       Bureau of Land Management without whose expertise many of our       discussions would have been a lot shorter.    I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I am proud to be able to recognize Oregon's  first female Eagle Scouts, the highest rank attainable in the Boy  Scouts of America, or BSA. Evelyn Becker, Juliana Cimral, and Anya  Kramer have demonstrated remarkable leadership, skill, and perseverance  to earn this important distinction and have done it through an  unprecedented pandemic.   For more than 100 years, the Eagle Scout rank has represented a  tremendous accomplishment that is recognized in Oregon and across the  country. To earn Scouting's highest honor, a Scout must demonstrate  mastery of numerous skills and obtain a merit badge for each one, earn  a position of responsibility within their troop, and complete a service  project that will directly benefit their community. Until recently,  girls and young women were not allowed to join BSA, but that finally  changed for the better in February of 2019. Evelyn, Juliana, and Anya,  Oregon's first three female Eagle Scouts, received their rank in  October and will join others in receiving their official Eagle title in  February 2021.   We can see examples of their skills and dedication to improving their  community in the Eagle service projects they tackled. Juliana, a senior  at Jesuit High School, employed her knowledge of and interest in bees  and the importance these pollinators play in the food supply chain to  build 25 bee houses that have increased the pollination and production  of nearby gardens. Evelyn, a sophomore at Scappoose High School, built  a fence to separate her local school from a busy highway and a bioswale  to prevent children from falling into the water and to help improve the  safety of her community. Anya, a freshman at Western Oregon University,  spent months building a partnership between the West Linn Food Pantry  and Period.org so that women in need would have access to feminine  hygiene products, an often overlooked essential.   It has been exciting to see the BSA finally welcoming the other half  of the population into their ranks. Each of these three women watched  their brothers succeed in Boy Scouts while  [[Page S7537]]  growing up. When finally given the chance, they continued that family  tradition of achievement. I am excited to see what new heights these  outstanding Eagle Scouts and community leaders will reach. Many more  will come after them, and our communities will be better for it.   Oregonians always take pride in serving our State and this great  country, and these three Eagle Scouts are a great example of that.  Today I say congratulations to the first women from Oregon to earn the  rank of Eagle Scout, and I wish them many more years of success.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I have introduced the Encouraging  Americans to Save Act (EASA). This legislation makes common sense  reforms to the saver's tax credit by making the credit refundable and  restructuring it as a government matching contribution that is directly  deposited into a worker's retirement savings account.   This bill would offer matching contributions for the first time to  millions of middle and lower income individuals not covered by an  employer-sponsored retirement plan, including those who save through an  IRA under a State or local government savings program-such as workers  in my home State of Oregon under the OregonSaves program. The  government match is also available to middle and lower income savers  who participate in an employer-sponsored plan.   The government match provided by the bill would both encourage saving  and help middle and low income earners build assets by providing an  immediate, meaningful return on their personal contributions. The  legislation would also establish a coronavirus bonus recovery credit  that would provide an additional government match of up to $5,000 to  workers on their retirement saving for a five year period beginning in  2022. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.                                  ______                                         By Mr. GRAHAM:   S. 5036.
