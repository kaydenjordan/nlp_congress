The bill (S. 645) was passed as follows:                                   S. 645         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Fighting Post-Traumatic       Stress Disorder Act of 2023''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) Public safety officers serve their communities with       bravery and distinction in order to keep their communities       safe.        (2) Public safety officers, including police officers,       firefighters, emergency medical technicians, and 911       dispatchers, are on the front lines of dealing with       situations that are stressful, graphic, harrowing, and life-      threatening.        (3) The work of public safety officers puts them at risk       for developing post-traumatic stress disorder and acute       stress disorder.        (4) It is estimated that 30 percent of public safety       officers develop behavioral health conditions at some point       in their lifetimes, including depression and post-traumatic       stress disorder, in comparison to 20 percent of the general       population that develops such conditions.        (5) Victims of post-traumatic stress disorder and acute       stress disorder are at a higher risk of dying by suicide.        (6) Firefighters have been reported to have higher suicide       attempt and ideation rates than the general population.        (7) It is estimated that between 125 and 300 police       officers die by suicide every year.        (8) In 2019, pursuant to section 2(b) of the Law       Enforcement Mental Health and Wellness Act of 2017 (Public       Law 115-113; 131 Stat. 2276), the Director of the Office of       Community Oriented Policing Services of the Department of       Justice developed a report (referred to in this section as       the ``LEMHWA report'') that expressed that many law       enforcement agencies do not have the capacity or local access       to the mental health professionals necessary for treating       their law enforcement officers.        (9) The LEMHWA report recommended methods for establishing       remote access or regional mental health check programs at the       State or Federal level.        (10) Individual police and fire departments generally do       not have the resources to employ full-time mental health       experts who are able to treat public safety officers with       state-of-the-art techniques for the purpose of treating job-      related post-traumatic stress disorder and acute stress       disorder.       SEC. 3. PROGRAMMING FOR POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER.

(2) Public safety telecommunicator.--The term ``public       safety telecommunicator'' means an individual who--        (A) operates telephone, radio, or other communication       systems to receive and communicate requests for emergency       assistance at 911 public safety answering points and       emergency operations centers;        (B) takes information from the public and other sources       relating to crimes, threats, disturbances, acts of terrorism,       fires, medical emergencies, and other public safety matters;       and        (C) coordinates and provides information to law enforcement       and emergency response personnel.        (b) Report.--Not later than 150 days after the date of       enactment of this Act, the Attorney General, acting through       the Director of the Office of Community Oriented Policing       Services of the Department of Justice, shall submit to the       Committee on the Judiciary of the Senate and the Committee on       the Judiciary of the House of Representatives a report on--        (1) not fewer than 1 proposed program, if the Attorney       General determines it appropriate and feasible to do so, to       be administered by the Department of Justice for making       state-of-the-art treatments or preventative care available to       public safety officers and public safety telecommunicators       with regard to job-related post-traumatic stress disorder or       acute stress disorder by providing public safety officers and       public safety telecommunicators access to evidence-based       trauma-informed care, peer support, counselor services, and       family supports for the purpose of treating or preventing       post-traumatic stress disorder or acute stress disorder;        (2) a draft of any necessary grant conditions required to       ensure that confidentiality is afforded to public safety       officers on account of seeking the care or services described       in paragraph (1) under the proposed program;        (3) how each proposed program described in paragraph (1)       could be most efficiently administered throughout the United       States at the State, Tribal, territorial, and local levels,       taking into account in-person and telehealth capabilities;        (4) a draft of legislative language necessary to authorize       each proposed program described in paragraph (1); and        (5) an estimate of the amount of annual appropriations       necessary for administering each proposed program described       in paragraph (1).        (c) Development.--In developing the report required under       subsection (b), the Attorney General shall consult relevant       stakeholders, including--        (1) Federal, State, Tribal, territorial, and local agencies       employing public safety officers and public safety       telecommunicators; and        (2) non-governmental organizations, international       organizations, academies, or other entities, including       organizations that support the interests of public safety       officers and public safety telecommunicators and the       interests of family members of public safety officers and       public safety telecommunicators.
