 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the  veto override on H.J. Res. 39.   In the past 5 months, the Republican-led House of Representatives has  taken more action to hold China accountable for its unfair trade  practices than the past 4 years that I have been in Congress, all while  the Biden administration is actively working to promote Chinese  interests.   The Biden administration is allowing the Communist Chinese Party to  outmaneuver us at every step, even rewarding them by vetoing bipartisan  legislation that puts America first.   Letting Chinese solar companies cheat directly handicaps U.S. solar  manufacturers and puts America at a disadvantage.   Washington Democrats and the Biden administration have been in  lockstep with China since they entered the White House.   It baffles me that the administration is so quick to put America last  to help China succeed. We need a strategic decoupling from China.   Everyone in the United States should be focused on countering Chinese  influence by bringing jobs back to America and implementing solid trade  agreements with our allies.   It is imperative that we override this veto.
