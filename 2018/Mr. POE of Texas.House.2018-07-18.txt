 Mr. Speaker, 10 years ago this August, Russian  tanks rolled across the border into the independent nation of Georgia.  After 5 days of bloody fighting, with thousands of innocent Georgians  displaced from their homes, the conflict ended with the Russians  promising to pull back its forces.   I happened to be in Georgia 1 week after the Russian invasion and saw  the tanks on the high ground and the destruction that the Russians made  of Tbilisi. It is 10 years since that invasion and Moscow and its  troops still occupy one-third of sovereign territory of the Republic of  Georgia.   The Kremlin claims these Russian troops are in Georgia as  peacekeepers. Are you kidding me? It is an invasion. They are a heavily  armed battle group waiting to provoke Georgia into another fight. They  have committed horrific human rights abuses against the Georgian  people, often harassing civilians and denying Georgians the ability to  move about their country freely.   The continued presence of Russian troops on Georgian soil presents a  major violation of international law. America's response at the time  was to condemn and issue sanctions against the Russians, but the Obama  administration removed the punishing sanctions against Russia as part  of its foolish reset with the Kremlin.   We now know this demonstration of weakness only encouraged further  aggression from Russia, and it invaded a neighbor state in 2014. This  time it seized and annexed Crimea from Ukraine, another independent  sovereign state that Russia had sworn to respect. Then Russian tanks  moved on and invaded eastern Ukraine and occupied part of that  territory.   After 10 years of illegal occupation of Georgian territory, we need  to do more to help our Georgian friends resist the Russian bear.  Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, Georgia emerged as the  beacon of hope in the region and hope for democracy. Georgia's faithful  commitment to a strong democracy with free and fair elections serves as  a shining example for other countries in Eastern Europe. Russia hoped  to break this beacon of hope 10 years ago, but Georgia has remained  defiant.   As co-chair of the Congressional Georgia Caucus, I have long seen  that major vulnerabilities remain that Russia could exploit. Georgia is  a small country. It cannot afford to compete with the might of the  Russian bear. That is why I have introduced the Georgia Support Act  along with my caucus co-chair, Representative Connolly from Virginia.   Through this important bill, we hope to significantly enhance  Georgia's ability to combat and deter Putin's wicked activities. With  our assistance, America can provide Georgia specific advantages that  can make any new attempt by Russia a costly endeavor.   Also, with modern warfare extending to cyberspace, we can improve  coordination to identify Russia's cyber attacks and build safeguards  within. This means building up Georgia's ability to combat  disinformation and propaganda from Russia.   As we have seen, Moscow is all over the world trying to undermine  democracies by invading their elections, including our own. Working  with Georgian partners, we can show Russia has been caught.   Additionally, this bill calls on President Trump to impose sanctions  for serious human rights abuses in that occupied territory of Georgia.  Not only will it help our Georgian friends on the front line of Russian  aggression, but it sends a message to the Kremlin that America will and  must stand up against that bad behavior and defend the international  rule of law.   Czar Putin must be shown that his dream of rebuilding the Russian  empire is not going to happen. We must show our freedom-loving friends  around the globe that America will stand with them. The Georgian people  have shown they will fight for freedom, even against overwhelming odds.   While the Kremlin believes that it has prevented Georgia's  aspirations of joining the important organization of NATO by seizing  territory, we can send a signal that that victory is hollow. Georgia is  still on the path to greater integration with the West. Georgia must  remain, with our help, free and prosperous. Russia will find itself  isolated and full of regret for ever following Putin's foolish ambition  of aggression in the region.   And that is just the way it is.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, Lowyal was just like any other  teenager across America. When she was 13 years of age and in school,  daily bullying started. Then her relationship with her mother became  worse. So she dropped out of school, took drugs, and eventually joined  a gang.   Eventually, her newfound ``friends'' introduced her to a ``game''  where she walked up and down the streets, under the constant watch of  her owners. She was the victim of human trafficking, modern-day  slavery. These older men manipulated her youth and stole her innocence  on the marketplace of sex slavery.   My legislation, the Abolish Human Trafficking Act, will increase  prosecutions for perpetrators like the slave traders who trafficked  Lowyal and hold them accountable for their crimes of sex slavery.   America must support victims of human traffickers and put their  predators where they belong: in the jailhouse. We as a community must  rescue victims from this scourge of slavery that is taking place in our  country.   And that is just the way it is.                            ____________________
