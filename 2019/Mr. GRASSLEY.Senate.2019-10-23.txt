 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in  morning business.    Mr. President, later today, I will attend the portrait  unveiling of my former colleague and friend, Senator Ted Stevens, who  served in the Senate from 1968 until 2009.   This portrait is being added to the Senate leadership portrait  collection because of Senator Stevens' service as the President pro  tempore, a position I now hold.   Senator Stevens was known for his tireless work on behalf of the  State of Alaska and their citizens. He had quite a reputation for  reaching across party lines to get the job done.   I am honored to attend today's ceremony adding Senator Stevens'  portrait to the historic walls of the U.S. Capitol.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, before I address the issues before the  Senate right now, I would like to express some concern I have about  whether the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement will be able to get  done this year.   I come to the floor today to express growing worry. The Democratic- controlled House of Representatives looks increasingly less likely to  act this year on the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. That  threatens passage of the trilateral trade deal this Congress, as next  year is a Presidential election year.   It has been about a year since the updated trade agreement with  Canada and Mexico was signed by the leaders of the three nations. It is  a whole year, and Democrats have still failed to act.   Every day that passes, Americans are losing out on economic benefits  of the USMCA. House Democrats seem to have no sense of urgency. For  months now, House Democrats have said they are working on it, that they  are making progress and that they are optimistic that they can get to  yes.   But conspicuously absent from their pronouncements are any mention of  a date or timeline. With every passing month, these seem less like  good-faith assurances and more like stalling tactics.   The new Congress has been seated for more than 10 months now. How  long is it going to take before this can come up?   Ambassador Lighthizer, more than any other Trade Representative I can  recall, has gone above and beyond to accommodate the other party's  policy demands. For nearly a year now, Lighthizer has worked with House  Democrats to find solutions on issues of concern to them, like labor,  environment, intellectual property, and enforcement.   I am beginning to wonder if Democrats are interested in reaching a  compromise at all. It is looking more like they would prefer to deprive  the administration of a victory, even if it comes at the expense of the  American people. That should not stand.   Earlier this month, I wrote a column with Congressman Kevin Brady,  the ranking Republican on the House Ways and Means Committee. We wrote  that time would tell if Democrats cared more about undermining  President Trump than helping the American economy and job creation as a  result of it. Today, it is looking more like the former than the  latter.   If the USMCA is not brought up for a vote in the House very soon,  Democrats will have a price to pay next year when the American people  have a chance to weigh in. There is little Americans dislike more in  politics than zero-sum, oppose-the-other-party politics, no matter the  cost.   The USMCA would create hundreds of thousands of jobs, protect  American industries, and provide confidence to U.S. businesses and  innovators to invest right here in America.   That is what Democrats seem willing to sacrifice by inaction on the  USMCA. But Democrats are making the wrong political calculus. This  underestimates the intelligence of the American voter and their ability  to sniff out a phony.   President Trump has done his job. He has renegotiated a trade deal  that nearly everyone besides a few congressional Democrats can agree is  better than its predecessor we know as NAFTA.   It is now up to the House of Representatives to do their job and  bring this deal to a vote. If they don't act soon, the American people  will hold them accountable a year from now.                                 S.J. Res. 50    Now to the issue before the U.S. Senate--the State and local tax  deduction. This week, Democrats are using the Congressional Review Act  to force a vote on a resolution that would effectively repeal an IRS  regulation aimed at preventing millionaires and billionaires from  exploiting a tax loophole.  [[Page S6069]]  This loophole would allow top income earners to save billions of  dollars in Federal taxes annually.   New York City hedge fund and private equity managers would most  assuredly be some of the biggest beneficiaries under this loophole. At  the same time, the taxpayers with incomes under $50,000 would see  virtually no benefit.   In this case one might think my Democratic colleagues would be  cheering on the Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service  for taking decisive actions and shutting down this loophole for the  wealthy. But this doesn't seem to be the case. Democrats--and only  Democrats--including the Democratic minority leader, are arguing in  favor of allowing wealthy taxpayers to exploit this loophole. Moreover,  predominantly Democratic States have been promoting and bemoaning the  loss of this loophole.   The loophole I am talking about is a concerted effort by  predominantly only Democrat States to help their wealthiest residents  get around the $10,000 cap on the deduction of State and local taxes,  which has come to be known by the acronym SALT.   These efforts to get around the cap have been called blue State SALT  workarounds. These workarounds are essentially State-sanctioned tax  shelters where wealthy residents make payments to a State or local  government-controlled fund in exchange for tax credits they can use to  wipe out most or all of their State taxes.   These States then want the Federal Government to ignore this sleight  of hand and recognize these payments as fully deductible charitable  contributions when they are nothing more than State tax payments. Well,  that is really too cute by half. It is cheating, and these States are  encouraging it, forcing the rest of the country to subsidize these tax  shelters for the wealthy.   The Treasury Department and the IRS have correctly determined that  these workarounds are contrary to the Federal tax law and have issued  sensible regulations to clarify this tax treatment. In doing so, they  applied longstanding tax principles that deny a charity deduction to  the extent the taxpayer receives something of value in return for their  charitable donation. It is simply common sense.   Charity is by definition something done out of the goodness of your  heart without expecting or getting something in return. That is  certainly not the case with these workarounds. There is no charity  involved. In fact, once taking into account both the State tax credit  and the charitable deduction at the Federal level, a taxpayer could  actually receive a tax benefit that exceeds the dollar value of their  so-called donation. That is not charity; that is a tax scam.   Some have attempted to justify this tax scam by pointing to State tax  credit programs that existed prior to the existence of the SALT cap,  but unlike the recently enacted programs, these older programs were not  specifically designed to circumvent Federal tax law when they were  enacted. These preexisting tax credit programs were targeted at giving  taxpayers the option of funding certain nontraditional governmental  activities, such as providing underprivileged children scholarships or  to set aside land for conservation.   My Democratic colleagues have painstakingly tried to defend these  scams by claiming they are efforts to alleviate State tax burdens on  the middle class; however, this argument doesn't even pass the laugh  test. It is undeniable that these workarounds will overwhelmingly  benefit the superwealthy, while the middle class will receive little or  no benefit.   I was pleased to see that at least one Senate Democrat was willing to  be honest about this last night here on the Senate floor. Senator  Bennet of Colorado put it this way:         The vast majority of the benefits of repealing the SALT cap       would go to high-income Americans. Repeal would be extremely       costly, and for that same cost, we could advance much more       worthy efforts to help working and middle-class families all       over the country.    To illustrate this point, I have here a chart based on a nonpartisan  Joint Committee on Taxation distribution analysis. They have made very  clear through their chart showing who would benefit from repealing the  cap on deductions for State and local taxes.   While eliminating these Treasury regulations wouldn't repeal the SALT  cap entirely, it would effectively make the cap toothless, as more and  more States would create workarounds. And let's not forget--the repeal  of the cap is their ultimate goal.   As we can see here on the chart, the majority of the benefits from  repealing the SALT cap--52 percent--would flow to taxpayers with  incomes exceeding $1 million. Let's think about that just for a minute.  Less than half of 1 percent of all tax returns report income exceeding  $1 million. Yet, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation, these  taxpayers would receive 52 percent of the tax benefit if this  resolution of disapproval went through. Another 42 percent of the tax  benefit would go to taxpayers with incomes between $200,000 and $1  million. When combined with those earning over $1 million, you can see  that fully 94 percent of the tax benefit would go to taxpayers with  incomes over $200,000. To put this into perspective, only 7 percent of  tax returns report income exceeding this level.   Now compare this to taxpayers with incomes under $200,000, which is  about 93 percent of all taxpayers. According to the Joint Committee on  Taxation, this group would receive a measly 6 percent of the benefit  from repealing the cap on State tax deductions, as the Democrats are  proposing. Only a handful of taxpayers with incomes under $200,000--or  about 3 percent--would actually see any benefit. Ninety-seven percent  of these taxpayers wouldn't see even one penny of benefit from taking  away the SALT cap.   So, very simply, there you have it. The same Democrats who have  criticized the 2017 tax bill as supposedly benefiting only the  wealthy--can you believe it?--are now actively pushing an agenda that  would overwhelmingly benefit the wealthy. This goes to show how off- base Democratic criticism of tax reform really is, as we have heard it  over the last 2 years.   Far from being a giveaway to the wealthy, the tax reform passed in  2017 was a concerted effort to provide tax relief for everybody.  Republicans accomplished this tax cut for everybody primarily by  lowering tax rates across the board, but we also did it by repealing or  limiting certain regressive tax benefits, such as the deduction for  State and local taxes, the SALT provisions we are talking about. We  then used that revenue to increase benefits that better target low- to  middle-income taxpayers. For example, we doubled the child tax credit  from $1,000 to $2,000 and increased the refundability of that tax  credit. We also nearly doubled the standard deduction, to the benefit  of many lower and middle-income taxpayers. We likely couldn't have made  those changes if we hadn't limited the deduction for State taxes that  mostly benefited the wealthy.   Democrats who wrongly associate this SALT cap with a tax increase on  middle-income folks simply aren't looking at the facts or at tax reform  as a whole. Two years ago, Republicans created a tax cut for an  overwhelming majority of Americans. This is true even for taxpayers  affected by the deduction for State taxes.   Before tax reform, many upper-middle-income taxpayers--particularly  those in the high-tax blue States--had to pay the alternative minimum  tax. We refer to that as the AMT. For anyone who used to pay the AMT,  after you struggled through the incredible complexity of the AMT rules,  you realized an unfortunate fact: The AMT clawed back the deduction for  your State tax payments. Therefore, many of these taxpayers saw little  or no benefit from this deduction before tax reform.   Democrats don't like to admit this inconvenient truth, but it is  true. They don't seem to let facts interfere with their political  rhetoric. So, yes, these same taxpayers are likely now affected by the  SALT cap, but because Republicans largely did away with the AMT--at the  same time, lowering everybody's tax rates--they still received a tax  cut. Let's not forget that these taxpayers no longer have to deal with  the mind-numbing complexity of the AMT. Now a question: Do Democrats  really want middle-income families to have to go back to the nonsense  of figuring out the alternative minimum tax every year?   I have heard Democrats try to justify their efforts to undermine the  SALT  [[Page S6070]]  cap by claiming it was part of some nefarious plot against blue States.  That is simply not true. Yes, more taxpayers in blue States are  affected by the cap given the high State taxes those States impose on  their residents, but the fact is, on average, every income group in  every State saw a tax cut under the 2017 tax cut bill. This isn't just  coming from this Senator, Chuck Grassley, but an analysis by the  liberal Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. In addition, recent  filing season data released by H&R Block shows that, on average,  residents of even high-tax States received a tax cut.   We have also heard fears that the cap will negatively affect blue  State revenues, as higher income taxpayers flee to lower tax  jurisdictions. But concerns about such an exodus aren't new and didn't  start because of the cap; they started because of sky-high taxes in  those very same States.   In November of 2017, prior to the enactment of this tax cut and  reform bill, the Wall Street Journal wrote about ``The Great  Progressive Tax Escape.'' This article focused on IRS tax return data  between 2012 and 2015 that showed billions of dollars in taxable income  leaving high-tax States for low-tax States due to taxpayer migration.  Last time I checked, there was no SALT cap between 2012 and 2015. While  there is some anecdotal evidence that taxpayer migration might be  starting to increase due to the cap, it is not entirely clear at this  point.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a Bloomberg article from  May of this year titled ``Blue States Warned of a SALT Apocalypse. It  Hasn't Happened'' be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                               [May 21, 2019]        Blue States Warned of a SALT Apocalypse. It Hasn't Happened                            (By Martin Z Braun)         To listen to New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, the 2017       Republican tax overhaul that limited state and local       deductions to $10,000 was a devastating blow. The rich would       flee, the middle class would suffer and blue state budgets       would bleed.        Perhaps this will come to pass over time, but so far, there       are almost no signs of it.        New York, in fact, saw revenue rise $3.7 billion in April       from a year earlier, thanks to a shift in timing of taxpayer       payments, a stock market that rallied through much of 2018       and a decade-long economic expansion that's pushed national       unemployment to a 50-year low. Similar windfalls arrived in       New Jersey, California and Illinois--states that, like New       York, had warned of dire consequences from the law.        And it turns out that tax refunds across the U.S. in 2019--      those once-a-year checks from Uncle Sam that people use to       pay credit card debt from Christmas or buy a washing       machine--were roughly the same size as a year earlier. In       all, about 64% of American households paid less in individual       income tax for 2018 than they would have had the Tax Cut and       Jobs Act not become law, according to the Urban-Brookings Tax       Policy Center.        ``Any comment that says this is an economic civil war that       would gut the middle class is overblown,'' said Kim Rueben,       the director of the State and Local Finance Initiative at the       Tax Policy Center. ``If there's going to be any effect of the       SALT limit on the ability of some states to have progressive       taxes it's too early to know that yet.''                                Taxable Income         In some ways, the $10,000 limit on state and local tax       deductions--SALT--is saving states money by lowering their       borrowing costs. That's because investors seeking to reduce       their tax bill are plowing a record-setting amount of cash       into municipal bonds, driving interest rates lower. The extra       yield that investors demand to compensate for the risk of       holding Illinois general-obligation bonds, for instance, has       fallen to the lowest since May 2015, according to data       compiled by Bloomberg.        States are also benefiting from a broader tax base because       the law eliminated some exemptions and limited deductions,       like mortgage interest. Since states that levy income taxes       use federal adjusted gross income or taxable income as the       base, they have more income to tax.        Still, the nerves of Democratic governors and their budget       officers frayed in December when income tax collections       plunged by more than 30 percent from the prior December.       Cuomo was quick to call the tax law ``politically       diabolical'' and an act of ``economic civil war'' against the       middle class.        Then April came.        New York collected $3.4 billion more in personal income tax       revenue last month than a year earlier, a 57% increase,       according to Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli. California took in       $19.2 billion in April, exceeding Governor Gavin Newsom's       estimate by $4 billion.        New Jersey had a record April with tax collections up 57%,       allowing it to boost forecasts for the year by $377 million       and triggering a political battle over how to spend the       windfall. Illinois individual and corporate tax revenue was       $1.5 billion more than projected, allowing Governor J.B.       Pritzker to scrap a plan to put off pension payments.                                Timing Change         April personal income tax collections in 28 states and       Washington increased by $16.3 billion, or 36.2% year-over-      year to $61.4 billion, Bank of America Corp. said.        ``SALT caps do not appear to be a broad system risk to       state credit quality at this point,'' S&P Global Ratings said       recently.        A big reason for the sharp bounce-back after December's       deep revenue declines in New York and other high-tax states:       The SALT limits caused some people to change when they paid       their taxes. Wealthy taxpayers in December 2017 accelerated       big tax payments to take advantage of the unlimited state and       local tax deduction before it expired. Then, with the SALT       deduction capped, that incentive evaporated and taxpayers       waited until this April to pay their 2018 taxes.        Also, some individuals failed to adjust their W-4s after       the passage of the tax law. So people who underwithheld       received more in their paychecks since then but had to pay       more tax in April or received lower refunds.                               Trending Inline         Still, there are some indications that residents in high-      tax states are fretting about the law. Thirteen percent of       house-hunters in both New York and California said they have       started looking for homes in states with lower taxes,       according to a recent survey by brokerage Redfin Corp.        In Westchester County, where a typical property tax bill       for a single family home is more than $17,000, the average       sales price declined 7.6% between the first quarter of 2018       and the same quarter this year. Sales prices for luxury homes       (average price $2 million) plummeted 22% during the same       period, according to appraiser Miller Samuel Inc. and       brokerage Douglas Elliman Real Estate.        Almost half of income taxes paid to California, New York       and New Jersey are from the wealthiest 1% of earners. If they       were to move in large enough numbers, those states could be       in trouble. New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Maryland       sued the Trump administration last year to invalidate the       $10,000 cap, saying that it unfairly targets them. States       have sought to pass loopholes around the limit and there's a       push in Congress to reverse it.        But migration rates in high tax states most affected by       SALT are below pre-recession levels, and generally in-line       with U.S trends, Moody's Investors Service said in April.       Jobs, housing and the weather influence migration more than       taxes, according to Moody's analyst Marcia Van Wagner.        ``Armageddon hasn't resulted from the changes to SALT, but       it still may be too early to measure its impact,'' said Matt       Dalton, chief executive officer of Rye Brook, New York-based       Belle Haven Investments, which manages $9 billion of       municipal bonds. ``You see more mansions listed in New York.       Manhattan real estate sales just had their worst quarter in a       decade.''     As this article highlights, revenue for blue States  this tax season were up, not down.   The ratings agency Moody's released a report in April saying that  there were no discernible signs that individuals were fleeing high-tax  States as a result of the SALT cap. However, even if taxpayer migration  were to occur as a result of the cap, the answer to the problem isn't  repealing the SALT cap; it is for States to look in their own backyard  at their own tax-and-spend policy.   The truth is, these State politicians aren't concerned about their  own taxpayers. What they are really worried about is their continued  ability to gouge those taxpayers with ever-increasing State and local  taxes, which used to be subsidized by taxpayers from other States  through the Federal Tax Code because there was no SALT cap.    In closing, I want to turn back to this very chart, the same one I  discussed earlier. For Democrats still on the fence as to whether to  vote to repeal the IRS regulations on the SALT work-arounds, you ought  to study this chart very closely.   I ask a question to the other side: Could you, with a straight face,  argue that a vote to protect these work-arounds is not a vote to  provide a massive tax cut for the wealthy? This chart shows it is  helping the wealthy.   For Democrats who intend to vote for this tax scam anyway, I don't  want to hear any more long-winded speeches about how the tax bill of  2017 benefited the wealthy. The fact is, after tax reform, the wealthy  now shoulder a larger share of Federal tax burden than they did under  the prior law.   This was made possible by reforms to regressive tax expenditures,  such as our capping the SALT deduction. What is more, these reforms  allow us to target more tax relief to lower and middle-income  taxpayers.  [[Page S6071]]    State work-arounds through the SALT cap are nothing more than State- sanctioned tax shelters. By voting to undermine that cap, Democrats are  voting to enrich the wealthy taxpayers whom they persistently have  vilified as not paying enough. Moreover, they put the tax relief  provided to the middle class in jeopardy.   I yield the floor.
