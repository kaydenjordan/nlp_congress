 Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, today is a sad day. While we gather here  in session, a memorial service is being held to honor three Baltimore,  MD, firefighters who gave their lives in service to their community.  These tragedies  [[Page S493]]  are a stark reminder of the commitment and sacrifice that firefighters  throughout our great Nation make on a daily basis serving communities  large and small. They are truly our domestic defenders and epitomize  their moniker of ``America's Bravest.''   International Association of Fire Fighters--IAFF--Baltimore Fire  Officers Local 964 Lieutenant Paul Butrim and Baltimore Firefighters  IAFF Local 734 Acting Lieutenant Kelsey Sadler and Firefighter/ Paramedic Kenneth Lacayo died after a partial collapse trapped them in  a burning rowhouse in west Baltimore last Monday. These fallen brothers  and sister leave behind grieving family members, a devastated  firefighter family, and a community in mourning. We owe them the  deepest gratitude and respect.   During this difficult time, I ask my Senate colleagues to hold in  their prayers the families and friends of the victims, the members of  the Baltimore City Fire Department, and the citizens of Baltimore. This  tragedy affects us all. Families lost a mom, a dad, a sister, a  brother, an aunt, an uncle, a firefighter, a friend. In the pre-dawn  hours of Monday, January 24, 2022, Baltimore City firefighters were  dispatched to the 200 block of South Stricker Street for a reported  rowhouse fire. As the firefighters responded, the dispatcher relayed  that there was a ``report of persons trapped.'' Shortly after they  arrived at the scene, the building partially collapsed, killing  Lieutenant Butrim, Acting Lieutenant Sadler, and Firefighter/Paramedic  Lacayo. A fourth firefighter, Baltimore IAFF Local 734 member John  McMaster, was transported to Shock Trauma and has since been released  to recover from his injuries. Please keep him and his family in your  prayers, too.   Lieutenant Butrim was just 37, but already a 16-year veteran of the  Baltimore City Fire Department. He was no stranger to putting himself  in harm's way. He was called to the job in 2005 when he began his  training as a firefighter/paramedic. Immediately after completing his  training, he joined the Baltimore City Fire Department. He was always  looking to improve his skills as a firefighter/paramedic, eventually  earning the rank of lieutenant. Those who knew him say that he was not  just an excellent firefighter; he was also an all-around good guy and  always willing to help. Paul was a big sports fan and especially liked  following NASCAR, baseball, and hockey. He married Rachel, his best  friend and love of his life, in 2015. Their son, Nolan, was born in  2016. Tragically, Nolan passed suddenly in February 2019, leaving the  family heartbroken.   Ms. Sadler, 33, a firefighter for 15 years, was serving as an acting  lieutenant for the department when she was killed in the partial  rowhouse collapse. Three days after her death, the Baltimore City Fire  Department officially promoted Kelsey to the rank of lieutenant.  Lieutenant Sadler began her career with the Baltimore City Fire  Department after graduating from high school in 2006. Lieutenant Sadler  had a big heart, a strong will, and the determination to get any task  done. Family was her priority. Her presence in any room made everything  better and brighter. She was an amazing wife to Brandon, an incredible  stepmom to Mila, and the best aunt to Lily and Emmett. When it came to  the job, she earned the respect of her colleagues doing what she did  best. Everyone who witnessed the beauty and dedication in how she lived  her life will remember her.   Firefighter/Paramedic Lacayo, 30, was a native of Montgomery County,  MD. He became a firefighter in 2012 and a paramedic in 2014, serving  first with the Wheaton Volunteer Rescue Squad, where he received  multiple citations for going above and beyond the call of duty. He  joined the Baltimore Fire Department in 2014 and was assigned to Engine  14 in August 2021. All those who knew Firefighter/Paramedic Lacayo well  describe him as the pinnacle of what a good person should be: kind and  humble, always putting others before himself. His exceptional skills as  a firefighter and paramedic were matched by his bright smile and his  unfailing good nature.   Kurt Vonnegut said, ``I can think of no more stirring symbol of man's  humanity to man than a fire engine.'' I agree. There are no adequate  words to describe the pain and the severity of these losses. But today,  this tribute remembers and celebrates their lives, memorializes their  sacrifice, and commemorates their service. These public servants worked  every day on the frontlines, answering the call whenever sudden danger  occurred until the very end. On January 24, these brave men and woman  made the ultimate sacrifice.   Knowing what I know about these fire fighters is best described with  words like service, sense of duty, response, commitment, courage, and  sacrifice. And while those are strong reasons by which to live, sadly,  in the firefighting profession, they are also the reasons by which they  die. It is important to rejoice in the lives and contributions these  lost souls have given, knowing that this world is a safer place because  of the men and women across this country who continue to give their  lives so others may live. From this moment forward, we will honor these  three firefighters who lost their lives for their bravery and courage.  Today, I ask that, in their honor--and for firefighters everywhere-- please help protect our firefighters in their heroic efforts to save  lives.                            ____________________
