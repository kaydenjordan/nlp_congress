 Madam Speaker, I am joined by my colleagues,  Congressman Kind, Congressman Pocan, Congressman Steil, and Congressman  Grothman. We are from Wisconsin, and we are here to request a moment of  silence and pay respects to those who suffered in the senseless  violence at the Waukesha Christmas parade last week on November 21,  2021.   The attack left a devastating impact on our friends and our neighbors  in the community. Anyone who regularly attends the Waukesha Christmas  parade will tell you how joyous a celebration this parade typically is.  It brings the community together.   It is then inconceivable that an individual would shatter lives and  uproot our community in this horrific way.   We are grateful for the firefighters, police officers, healthcare  professionals, and volunteers who immediately answered the call for  help that evening and who continue to help those who remain in serious  condition.   I know the people of Waukesha; they are tough and kind. I know that  we will get through this unspeakable difficulty together as a  community. I pray for healing and peace for all those who were  affected. May love and strength lead us forward in the face of this  evil.   Madam Speaker, I would ask my colleagues to join me in observing a  moment of silence in honor of Virginia Sorenson, Leanna Owen, Tamara  Durand, Wilhelm Hospel, Jane Kulich, and Jackson Sparks, as well as  those still in critical condition and those suffering from trauma  following this tragedy.   Madam Speaker, I ask that the House observe a moment of silence.                            ____________________
