 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor  the life of my friend, Karen Sutton, who recently passed away after a  long, hard fight with cancer.   Karen spent much of her life in Springfield and was a valued member  of our community, always volunteering and attending events all the way  up to a few weeks before she passed.   After a long and successful career in data processing, Karen retired  from the Illinois Department of Health in 2002.   Karen spent much of her time in the bowling alley, playing in  multiple leagues and eventually becoming the league secretary.   Karen also enjoyed traveling to national Mustang shows, where she won  many awards. These shows, put on by the Mustang Club of America,  allowed Karen to connect with the community of drivers from all over  the Nation, whom she greatly valued. She was also praised for her hard  work in helping the judging secretaries during these fun yet  competitive events.    I am grateful to have known Karen and her husband, Carroll, for many  years, and I am thankful for all of her work to make our community a  better place to live.   Karen is survived by her husband, Carroll; daughter, Julie; and son,  Brent. My condolences to the entire Sutton family during this difficult  time.   Karen, may you rest in peace.                            ____________________
