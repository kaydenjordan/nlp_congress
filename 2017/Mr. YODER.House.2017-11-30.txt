 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about the importance of  adoption and what Congress can be doing to help more kids get adopted  into loving, caring families.   November is National Adoption Month, and it is time we talk about how  the GOP tax reform bill, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, will help children  in need of loving families by supporting those whose lives have been  touched by adoption.   Our tax reform bill preserves the adoption tax credit, which allows  taxpayers to claim expenses related to the adoption of a child,  including fees, court costs, and travel expenses. This credit  ultimately helps get more children into permanent, loving families, and  the credit costs only about $3.8 billion over 10 years, a small  fraction of our overall budget.   Mr. Speaker, I worked tirelessly with my colleagues to ensure that  this adoption tax credit was included in the House's tax bill, and I am  pleased that the Senate's version also preserves it in their draft.   I urge my colleagues to work quickly to pass tax reform that  preserves the adoption tax credit while bringing tax relief to all  American families.                            ____________________
