 Mr. President, colleagues, this bipartisan agreement,  which I have had the pleasure of working together with Senator Cornyn  on for more than a year now and which has already passed the Senate by  unanimous consent twice before, would give State, local, Tribal, and  territorial governments the flexibility and the support they need to  fully recover from the COVID-19 pandemic.   As we all know, each community has been impacted differently by the  pandemic and has different needs to recover from the pandemic. This  amendment is about flexibility and prioritizing the local governments  that are closest to the people.   I do want to thank Senators Cornyn, Tester, and Murkowski for their  work on this effort.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.
