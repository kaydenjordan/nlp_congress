 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to surf  legend and filmmaker Bruce Brown, who, at 80 years of age, died this  week.   Bruce Brown challenged a generation of Americans to follow our dream  and to find our perfect wave. He reached out to introduce us to the  magic experience of being propelled by the power of nature on an ocean  wave. Adventure and a rush of excitement was only as far away as a  local beach.   Bruce Brown made movies about surfing. ``Endless Summer'' was his  best known. But his films were more than entertainment. He spoke to our  soul and our spirit of adventure. He inspired us to go for it, to take  on towering waves, just as other Americans scaled the tallest mountain  peaks and even journeyed to the Moon.   Isn't that what America was all about? Isn't that what America is all  about?   My first surfboard was a large, single-fin Velzy. Dale Velzy owned a  surf shop in San Clemente and financed Bruce Brown's first film,  ``Slippery When Wet.''   The surf culture Bruce Brown helped get born is still here. Outsiders  are intrigued by it. You know when you are part of it.   Bruce Brown showed us the way. A few days ago, he passed on and is  paddling into the distant sunset. He followed his dream, he found his  perfect wave, and he rode it as far as it would take him.                            ____________________
