 Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentlewoman from  the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania for her leadership and for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5546, the Effective Assistance  of Counsel in the Digital Era Act.   The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that  in all criminal prosecutions the accused shall have the assistance of  counsel for his defense.   To effectively represent a client and provide the best possible legal  advice, an attorney must be fully informed about the facts of the case.  But this can only be achieved through confidential communication  between the attorney and their client. That is why the attorney-client  privilege is so critical.   The Supreme Court stated in Lanza v. New York that ``even in a jail,  or perhaps especially there, the relationships which the law has  endowed with particularized confidentiality must continue to receive  unceasing protection.''   There are nearly 127,000 individuals currently in BOP custody, many  of whom are in pretrial detention and have not been convicted of a  crime. These Americans are innocent until proven guilty. Like any  person involved in a criminal proceeding, these individuals need to be  able to confidentially communicate with their attorneys in order to  vindicate their rights under law.   The bipartisan Effective Assistance of Counsel in the Digital Era Act  will enable incarcerated individuals to communicate with their legal  representatives privately, efficiently, and safely by prohibiting the  Bureau of Prisons from monitoring privileged electronic communications.   While BOP regulations place protections on attorney visits, phone  calls, and traditional mail, no such protections currently exist in the  context of email communications sent through BOP's electronic mail  service, the Trust Fund Limited Inmate Computer System, otherwise known  as TRULINCS. The TRULINCS email system has become the easiest, fastest,  and most efficient method of communication available to incarcerated  individuals and their attorneys.   Even a brief client visit can take hours, as the distinguished  gentleman from North Dakota pointed out, hours out of an attorney's day  when you include travel and wait times. Confidential phone calls are  often subject to time limitations and cannot usually be scheduled  immediately.                                time  1415    Postal mail can take an especially long time to reach an incarcerated  individual because it must first be opened and screened. These delays  should be unnecessary in a prison system that currently permits  electronic communications and would be if the attorney-client privilege  was consistently applied to email communication.   The situation has become even more urgent in light of BOP's decision  to suspend legal visits as part of its COVID-19 Modified Operations  Plan.   To solve this challenge, H.R. 5546 would require the Attorney General  to ensure that the BOP email system excludes from monitoring the  contents of electronic communications between an incarcerated person  and their attorney.   BOP would, of course, be allowed to retain the contents of those  messages up until the incarcerated person is released, but they would  be accessible only under very limited circumstances. The bill also  allows a court to suppress evidence that is obtained or derived from  illegal access to the retained contents.   Our criminal justice system depends on the attorney-client privilege  to ensure that lawyers are able to effectively represent their clients.  That is why this legislation is so critical.   I thank my good friend, Representative Doug Collins, Chairman Jerry  Nadler, and Ranking Member   Jim Jordan for their leadership, as well  as Members on both sides of the aisle.   I also thank the ACLU, the American Bar Association, Americans for  Prosperity, #cut50, Due Process Institute, Faith and Freedom Coalition,  Families Against Mandatory Minimums, Federal Defenders, FreedomWorks,  National Action Network, National Association of Criminal Defense  Lawyers, Prison Fellowship, and Right on Crime for their support of  this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 5546.
