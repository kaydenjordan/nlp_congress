 Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I certainly  appreciate Senator Hagerty's concerns. The freedom of speech, freedom  of association, and freedom of the press are all very foundations of  our Nation.   But I am also concerned about the power of large tech companies,  which we must--must--hold accountable. The Homeland Security Committee,  which I chair, has held a series of bipartisan  [[Page S2453]]  oversight hearings on social media, including bringing in top  executives to testify and to answer tough questions.   I am deeply concerned, however, that the legislation that we are  discussing today could have serious unintended consequences, including  undermining our national security. This bill could damage our national  intelligence and law enforcement operations by requiring Agencies to  disclose every interaction with a social media platform about the  activity of a terrorist or a criminal on their platform. This can  involve sensitive ongoing investigations and enforcement action,  including the terrorist use of social media to recruit Americans to  carry out attacks against our homeland.   The bill could also chill effects by executive and legislative branch  employees who are working to address online threats and hate speech  directed at Americans and communities all across our Nation. In  addition to creating new redtape for staff trying to address these very  difficult issues, it threatens them with a year in jail for not meeting  paperwork deadlines.    Certainly, we must all protect our Nation's First Amendment and the  right to speak freely. However, this bill will not accomplish that  goal, while potentially undermining our national security.   Mr. President, therefore, I object.
