 Madam Speaker, 166 Members of Congress have  cosponsored H.R. 18, the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act, to make  the Hyde amendment and other current abortion funding prohibitions  permanent and to ensure that the Affordable Care Act conforms with the  Hyde amendment.   According to public opinion polls, most Americans, almost 60 percent,  according to the Marist poll, agree that taxpayers should not be forced  against their conscience to fund abortion.   Years ago, then-Senator Biden wrote to constituents, explaining his  support for the Hyde amendment, and said it would ``protect both the  woman and her unborn child. . . .'' He said: ``I have consistently--on  no fewer than 50 occasions--voted against Federal funding for  abortions. . . . Those of us who are opposed to abortion should not be  compelled to pay for them.'' So said Senator Biden. I totally agree.   Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committees on Energy  and Commerce, Ways and Means, and the Judiciary be discharged from  further consideration of H.R. 18 and ask for its immediate  consideration in the House.
