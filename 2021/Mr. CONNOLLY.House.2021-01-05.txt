 Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished chairwoman of  our committee for her graciousness in not only bringing this bill back  to the floor, but making it the first legislative bill we are going to  consider in the new Congress. I thank my good friend from New York. I  also thank my friend from Alabama for his gracious words and his  partnership on so many issues on our committee on a bipartisan basis.   I want to thank the majority leader for bringing this bill to the  floor. I also want to thank the ranking member of the full committee,  Mr. Comer; and the ranking member of our subcommittee, Mr. Hice, for  cosponsoring this bill, making it as bipartisan as we get.   H.R. 21, the FedRAMP Authorization Act, would finally provide a  statutory framework--which we currently lack--for the Federal Risk and  Authorization Management Program, FedRAMP.    FedRAMP is a standardized approach to certifying and assessing in an  ongoing manner the security of cloud computing technologies used across  the Federal Government. FedRAMP seeks to reduce the redundancies of  Federal cloud migration by creating a ``certify once, reuse many  times'' model for cloud products and services that provide cost- effective, risk-based approach to cloud adoption. Enabling the  efficient and secure procurement of cloud computing technology is an  important part of Federal IT modernization efforts and essential to the  Federal Government's transition to a more virtual posture amid the  pandemic.   In the first 4 years of FedRAMP, the program authorized only 20 cloud  products. Today, there are 211 FedRAMP authorized cloud products that  Federal agencies can use and more than 240 cloud service providers  participating in FedRAMP, 30 percent of which are small businesses-- female-owned, minority-owned, and veteran-owned businesses. In fiscal  year 2020, FedRAMP saw a 50 percent increase in agencies reusing  authorized cloud products.   This bill already passed the House in the last Congress with  bipartisan support not once, but twice; once under suspension by voice  vote and once as an amendment to the House version of the National  Defense Authorization Act.   After incorporating technical assistance that the chairwoman  mentioned from the General Services Administration and other key  stakeholders, I rise again to offer the FedRAMP Authorization Act.   For nearly 4 years, we have worked with the Office of Management and  Budget, GSA, industry stakeholders, and our friends on both sides of  the aisle to make the needed improvements so FedRAMP can be codified in  law.   This bill is essential, and it will demonstrate a universal  commitment to FedRAMP and the accelerated adoption of secure cloud  computing technologies, a vital component of the broader Federal IT  modernization effort. And we know it is needed after the cyber hack,  probably led by the Russians, in the last few weeks.   The FedRAMP Authorization Act would codify the program and address  many of the concerns raised by industry and government stakeholders.   First, the bill reduces duplication of security assessments and other  obstacles to agency adoption of cloud products by establishing a  presumption of adequacy for cloud technologies that have received  FedRAMP certification. This is important so that companies are not  spending millions of dollars simply to get the same certification over  and over again.                                time  1215    The bill would also facilitate agency reuse of cloud technologies  that have already received an authorization-to-operate by requiring  agencies to check a centralized and secure repository.   It requires that GSA work toward automating their processes, which  will lead to more standard security. It will establish a Federal secure  cloud advisory committee to ensure dialogue among GSA, agency  cybersecurity and procurement officials, and industry representatives  for effective and ongoing coordination.   Finally, it authorizes $20 million in annual appropriations for the  program, providing sufficient resources to increase the number of  secure cloud technologies available and to allow free and fair  competition, especially for our small and minority-owned businesses.   Mr. Speaker, I urge that the House act on this first bill on the  first day of our legislative activity. Again, I thank our distinguished  chairwoman for being so generous in bringing this bill up again.
