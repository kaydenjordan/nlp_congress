 Mr. Speaker, our Founding Fathers warned us against what  is happening this week on the House floor when one political party  abandons constitutional principles simply for political gain.   Tomorrow's impeachment vote is shameful and sets a dangerous  precedent. Without bringing forward any evidence of an impeachable  offense, House Democrats have rushed this partisan vote. You cannot  impeach a duly elected President simply because you don't like him.   For the past few months, Speaker Pelosi and House Democrats have been  so obsessed with impeaching President Trump that they have forgotten to  do their sworn duty, and that is to work on behalf of the American  people.   While I am glad we are finally voting on the United States-Mexico- Canada Agreement this week, the vital trade deal was used by Democrats  as a political pawn until after they brought forward their sham  Articles of Impeachment.   Americans must question the timing of the votes this week: a rushed  impeachment vote, and a much-delayed trade deal.   So, when the American people ask me back home, ``What in the world is  [[Page H10606]]  going on in Washington?'' I say, ``It is just putting politics before  the American people.''                            ____________________
