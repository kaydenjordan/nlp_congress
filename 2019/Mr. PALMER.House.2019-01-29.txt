 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman. The gentleman just  acknowledged that I have no social life, but that is fine.   I want to talk a little bit about healthcare. Here is a fact that my  Democratic colleagues were desperately trying to keep from the public.  Not only do the Republicans support providing health insurance coverage  for those with preexisting conditions, but we actually passed  legislation that did just that with the American Health Care Act of  2017.   It included an amendment that Representative   David Schweikert of  Arizona and I introduced that ensured that anyone with a preexisting  condition could purchase health insurance. The Palmer-Schweikert  amendment established a risk-sharing plan that would allow any  individual with a preexisting condition to purchase insurance at the  same price as a healthy individual.   It was actually modeled after a successful State-based program in the  State of Maine. Instead of billions of dollars being paid out by the  Federal Government in bailouts for health insurance companies, our  plan, funded by having the majority of the premiums paid for those with  preexisting conditions, transferred into a fund, a risk-sharing fund.   This represents an alternative approach to ObamaCare's guaranteed  issue provision, which priced everyone as sick, resulting in far higher  premiums. As a matter of fact, the premiums got so high that insurance  companies literally began pulling out of whole States.   What our amendment did was, if someone had a preexisting condition,  they would come to an insurance company, fill out a health survey, mark  down if they had had a heart attack or cancer. The insurance company  would sell them insurance at the same price as anybody else. But when  they paid their premiums, 90 percent of the premiums would go into this  risk-sharing agreement.                                time  1630    The insurance company would only keep 10 percent. Now, if the person,  the individual became very sick, if it became very expensive, the  insurance company would pay the first $7,500 and then 10 percent of the  next $25,000, so the most that they were out was $10,000. The risk- sharing plan would pick up the balance and reimburse the providers at  the same rate as Medicare.   The way this worked was not only did the premiums go into the risk- sharing plan, 90 percent of the premiums, but the rest of us would pay  anywhere from $5 to $10 a month on our premiums. That would go into the  risk-sharing plan, and our amendment was backed up with $38 billion.   What this allowed us to do was create a situation where the actuaries  could actually be more predictive in what the cost would be; and, as a  result, it lowered premiums for everyone. So not only did it cover  people with preexisting conditions, but everyone else's premiums came  down.   As a matter of fact, in that 20- to 30-year-old age group, it came  down 41 percent; 30 to 40 years old came down 33 percent; 40 to 50, 25  percent; 50 to 60, 11.6 percent; and that pre-Medicare 60 to 65 came  down 5.9 percent. So what we were doing was trying to repair the  American healthcare system, doing it in a way that made sense for  people.   Not only that, we have other options that we want to present. For  instance, one of the biggest uninsured populations is young people. It  doesn't make sense to spend the amount of money you have to spend to  pay your premiums when a lot of those folks are earning lower wages.   So we want to set up a plan where you could buy short-term insurance,  buy what you need, what you can afford for that time in your life, and  it would be for 1 year. Depending on what you bought, your premiums  could come down 85 percent. If you needed to extend it, you could  extend it for another 3 years. That is transition insurance.   In addition to that, the vast majority of people in America who have  a job work for a small business, and small businesses aren't part of a  larger group. So we wanted to set up association group plans so that if  you are a small business and your city set up an association group  plan, you could be in that. Or if you are a farmer, you could be a  member of an association group plan that the Farm Bureau established,  and premiums there are projected to come down by as much as 50 percent.   The Republicans have the best ideas for repairing our healthcare  system, making it affordable, and keeping our promise, a promise that  was broken repeatedly: If you like your doctor, you  [[Page H1279]]  can keep your doctor. If you like your insurance, you can keep your  doctor.   It is not just about the cost. It is about improving outcomes and  helping people live better and healthier.
