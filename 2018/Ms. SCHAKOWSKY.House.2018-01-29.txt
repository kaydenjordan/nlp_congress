 Mr. Speaker, let me thank Mr. Scott and the  Congressional Black Caucus for this Special Order.   The Janus case is critically important to public employees, but, more  importantly, to all the people who rely on public services that they  provide.   This is an Illinois case--it is my State--Janus v. AFSCME Council 31,  a relentless fighter for American workers. Before becoming Governor,  Bruce Rauner was chairman of a private equity firm where he put profits  ahead of working families. As Governor, he was the one who filed this  suit.   We need to make sure that we protect workers all over this country.  We need to win this case before the Supreme Court. Justice calls for  winning for union members.
