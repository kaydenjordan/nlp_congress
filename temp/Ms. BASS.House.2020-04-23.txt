 Madam Speaker, a few days after the last bill became law,  stories began to surface of an extreme disproportionate death rate  among African Americans in several cities, with a 70 percent death  rate, while African Americans are only 20 to 30 percent of the  population.   Some cite underlying health conditions as the reason for the extreme  disproportionate death rate, as though this is a reason that nothing  can be  [[Page H1919]]  done, as though we have to just accept this for now.   This bill begins the process of addressing the disproportionate death  rate, but oversight and advocacy from Congress and the public will  still be needed.   The bill calls for a report to be issued in 21 days, where we should  have a better picture of what is happening and, hopefully, provide a  roadmap.   The bill calls for reporting data on demographics including race, on  the number and rates of cases, hospitalization, and deaths from COVID.   When the report is made public, it will be clear that communities  with large African American populations will require focused and  concentrated testing with rapid results, that contact tracing and early  and aggressive treatment will be required, and that hospitals  should reevaluate how they make decisions regarding who has access to  ventilators.    Using formulas that decide based on who they believe has a better  chance of survival will undoubtedly hurt African Americans and  contribute to the disproportionate death rate.   When we gather again to pass another bill, we must include targeted  resources that support aggressive interventions.   It is just not acceptable for the richest country in the history of  the world to allow different populations to suffer like they don't even  live in the United States but live in countries without the resources  to protect its population.
