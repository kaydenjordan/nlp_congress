 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor our brave  law enforcement officers at the United States Park Police. From every  major protest to every parade that occurs on the National Mall, our  Park Police officers answer the call to keep our constituents safe when  they are visiting here in the Nation's capital.   However, due to an increase in the number of demonstrations and the  fact that they are extremely understaffed, one of our Nation's oldest  uniformed Federal law enforcement agencies is now stretched extremely  thin.   As of March 1, 2021, there were fewer than 500 Park Police officers.  That is significantly lower than the minimum requirement they have of  639 officers. This is alarming, and obviously, among other concerns,  this leaves the Nation's most historic landmarks extremely vulnerable.  And that is why today, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3924, the  U.S. Park Police Modernization Act.   And what is the problem? Why are they facing the issues that they are  facing? Well, the bottom line, for whatever reason, is because the pay  and benefits are much lower for the Park Police than for other Federal  law enforcement agencies. And the big question is why is that the case?  That is an outstanding question. Why?   There is no real good reason. And it is for that reason that we, here  in Congress, need to immediately improve the Park Police's pay and  benefits and to put that agency on equal footing with other similar  departments. To do so would incentivize officers to both join the Park  Police, but even more importantly, to stay. Both of those issues are  huge concerns right now. That is how we will ensure that Washington,  D.C., the place where each of us work, the place where our staff works,  and obviously, where many of our constituents come to visit, remain  safe for years to come.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3924. Let's put  our U.S. Park Police on equal footing with other law enforcement  agencies in this area so that they can do the job that we all depend  upon them to do.                            ____________________
