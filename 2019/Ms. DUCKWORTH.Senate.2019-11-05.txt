 Madam President, I come before the Senate today  to honor the life of Kay Hagan, who I had the honor of serving in  Congress with from 2013 to 2014. A beloved public servant,  businesswoman, mother, wife and friend, Kay passed away last month at  the age of 66.   I admired Kay's ability to find common ground and work in a  bipartisan manner without compromising her core beliefs, as evidenced  by both her many legislative successes and her many courageous votes,  including healthcare reform and expanded background checks. She was  also a tireless voice for women's rights, and advocated for hard- working North Carolinians and U.S. Servicemembers by fighting to crack  down on predatory payday lending.   Roughly a decade before I brought my daughter Maile onto the Senate  floor, Kay took on an outdated Senate rule of her own by leading the  successful charge to force the Senate swimming pool to allow women.  Making the Senate a welcoming place for everyone is an ongoing  struggle, but her efforts certainly made it a little bit better for  women Senators for years to come.   Kay was an inspirational role model to young girls and young women in  North Carolina, often encouraging them to run for office at her events.  I have no doubt that many of them now hold public office.   My deepest sympathies are with Kay's loved ones. I am grateful for  her passionate service to her State and our country, and I am proud to  continue her work in the U.S. Senate.                            ____________________
