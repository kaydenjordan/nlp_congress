 Mr. Speaker, I have a map in my office that  shows the areas of the United States that have been impacted by flood.  It is virtually the entire country.   This is the House of ``We the People.'' This is an easy ``yes'' vote.  I urge my colleagues on my side of the aisle to try to explain to the  American people how you can vote ``yes'' six times on an extension and  ``no'' the seventh time.   We did our job in November. We passed some comprehensive reforms to  the NFIP, a 5-year authorization. The Senate has failed. We serve the  people. This is right for the people.   I urge my colleagues to step up and vote ``yes'' on this extension.  We don't like it, but we serve the people. This bill is for the people.                                time  1800
