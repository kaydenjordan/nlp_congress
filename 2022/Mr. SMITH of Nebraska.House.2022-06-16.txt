 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to  this bill.   To suggest that this bill is a collaborative effort is simply  inaccurate. There could be a number of other ways to describe that as  well, but it is unfortunate that we are at a place where we could have  had an opportunity to advance some good legislation.   I am a supporter of the E15 bill. I have done a lot of work on this,  and not just because gas prices are high right now, but because I think  that E15 and allowing consumers more choices at the pump would actually  engage consumers as it relates to energy policy and energy products.   I do have serious concerns, though, as others have mentioned, about  provisions that the Democrats insisted be included in this bill, like  the new, very duplicative investigative authority at USDA.   Even more concerning to me is Democrats' continued strategy of  seeking to blame others for the situation on energy and the cost of  virtually everything in our economy rather than acknowledging that  President Biden's economic policies have actually created this mess.    Biden stimulus dollars have driven inflation. Biden's stimulus  dollars paid Americans not to return to work, therefore, worsening our  supply chain crisis. The President's executive orders canceling new  lease options and shutting down the Keystone XL pipeline have certainly  contributed to increased gas prices.   Real inflation relief legislation would actually reign in spending,  get more Americans back to work, provide broad regulatory relief, and  increase domestic energy production. This bill is certainly not it.
