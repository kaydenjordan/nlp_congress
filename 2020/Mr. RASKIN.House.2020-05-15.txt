 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I want to start by saluting Chairman McGovern, who has done such a  sensational job under adverse circumstances bringing us a new rule so  that we can maintain the continuity of the U.S. Congress.   We are bringing a rule forward today to allow for a very narrow  exception to allow for proxy voting in the coronavirus emergency, when  Members cannot get back to Washington, so we can continue the  absolutely vital and central work of Congress.   That work continues today with the HEROES Act, which will put  trillions of dollars into the heroes of America: the firefighters and  the cops, the teachers, the frontline health workers, the emergency  responders, the people who actually make America run. That is what the  HEROES Act is all about.   We hear a lot in Congress about how much people love the States and  the cities and the towns. Now is the chance to show it. Let's put our  money where our mouth is and support Americans who are struggling with  this crisis brought by the coronavirus and the mismanagement of the  disease from the very beginning, the mismanagement of our efforts to  fight it.   America, as Dr. Bright said yesterday, does not have a plan. We need  massive testing. We need vigilant contact tracing. We need coordination  of logistics rather than pitting the States against each other in a  ruthless competition for PPEs and for ventilators.   The U.S. Government, under our Constitution, should be coordinating  the national effort, not pilfering supplies from the States, much less  pitting the States against each other in a brutal competition.   The HEROES Act takes us in the right direction by putting billions of  dollars into the testing the population needs. A majority of the cases  of infectious transmission comes now from people who are asymptomatic  or presymptomatic.    The only way to deal with the disease and to put the coronavirus on  the run is to do mass testing, diligent contact tracing; and we have  got lots of people who can do it, because more than 35 million  Americans have been thrown out of work in this process.   Let's put millions of people to work being contact tracers. Let's  unify as a country. Let's show that America has the capacity and the  strength to operate under our system of federalism to put money into  the States and the counties and the cities to work together to stop the  disease and to win this major public health battle.   The HEROES Act is the way to go.    Mr. Speaker, I salute the chairman for his determination  to keep the American Government going through this period, and that is  what this resolution is about, the continuity of Congress and the  continuity of government. We are here to keep the great American  experiment in democratic self-government alive through the pandemic,  through the crisis.   The first sentence of the Constitution, the Preamble, says:         We the people, in order to form a more perfect union,       establish justice, ensure domestic tranquility, provide for       the common defense, promote the general welfare, and preserve       to ourselves and our posterity the blessings of liberty, do       hereby ordain and establish the Constitution of the United       States.    The very next sentence vests all legislative power to us, in Article  I, in the Congress, and gives us the right to determine the rules of  our own proceedings.   That is what the Supreme Court calls a political question. It cannot  be second-guessed by the Senate. It cannot be second-guessed by the  President. It cannot be second-guessed even by the Supreme Court. It is  up to us what our rules of proceeding are going to be.   Mr. Speaker, I have watched the debate, and one can only regard with  amazement the full outrage summed up by our colleagues who display  great reservoirs of self-righteousness. And it is amazing to me because  the same Members have been operating for many years, for term after  term, under the current rule, first adopted by a Republican-majority  House, which allows two Members to form a working quorum.   I repeat: The current rule, which this body has ratified repeatedly,  was adopted by a Republican majority, allowing two Members to  constitute a working quorum.    So, how can anyone who has blithely accepted that state of affairs,  when it would have been very easy to do something about it--there was  no pandemic and no plague let loose on the land, with 86,000 people  dead and tens of millions of unemployed. They did nothing about it, but  now they want to suddenly turn on the proposal necessary to guarantee  the continuity of the U.S. Government in which the numerical quorum  majority rule is scrupulously observed through the well-known and well- accepted proxy system. This rule preserves the vote and the voice of  each and every Member of the House.   Unlike the two-Member quorum rule, which was put into place by a  Republican majority, our rule is based on effectuating the will and the  vote of every Member. The proxies must be cast in strict accordance  with the will of the Member, with no discretion, and no room for  judgment.   Mr. Speaker, I expect to be a proxy because I live about a half hour  away from here. I will cast the proxy vote exactly as given to me. And  if I were to decide I know better than the person I am voting for, that  should be the subject of ethical proceedings. I am nothing more than a  letter carrier.   This is what the Congress needs to do. The American people expect  nothing less from us. Let's keep the Government of the United States in  business.
