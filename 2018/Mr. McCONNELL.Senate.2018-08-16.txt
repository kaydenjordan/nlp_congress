 Mr. President, the Senate is back in session this  August for a simple reason: We have more to do for the families across  America who count on us to work hard and to fight for them. That is why  the next legislation the Senate will consider is a pair of critically  important appropriations bills that will fund our national defense,  along with the Department of Labor and the Department of Health and  Human Services.   Talk about subjects that are vital to the American people, at stake  is a 2.6-percent pay raise for U.S. servicemembers, the largest pay  raise for troops in almost a decade; the equipment, tools, and training  they need to complete their mission; and funding to support the  necessary programs we just authorized when the John S. McCain National  Defense Act became law earlier this week.   At stake are billions of dollars to fight back against the opioid  crisis, hundreds of millions to support and retrain American workers  who need a boost back into the labor force, hundreds of millions more  for employment training specifically for our veterans, funding for the  Centers for Disease Control and the National Institutes of Health, and  Federal funding for our Nation's schools. I have only scratched the  surface. There will be plenty of time in the days ahead to discuss and  detail all of the ways this legislation will help our country, as well  as to consider amendments.    Yesterday was a promising start. We agreed to proceed to these two  important funding bills by consent after we wrap up the nominations  that are before us today. Now we need to keep up the collaboration.   There is a reason why it has been quite some time since we have  completed a full, regular process. There is a reason why, for example,  it has been 15 years--15 years--since the Senate passed the Labor,  Health, and Education bill in time for the start of the fiscal year.   This process is not easy. It is hard work for our Appropriations  subcommittees and the full committee to craft this legislation. Then,  on the floor, we need cooperation from both sides to process  amendments, while resisting the temptation to turn the appropriations  process into a free-for-all on all manner of policy issues. But this  year, that is exactly what we are doing.   The Senate has already passed 7 of 12 bills. In the next several  days, we will consider Nos. 8 and 9. Once we finish them, they will  encompass more than 87 percent--more than 87 percent--of total  discretionary spending--two more big strides toward avoiding another  omnibus and appropriating the taxpayers' money in the right way.  [[Page S5672]]                                ____________________     Mr. President, first, the Senate is currently  considering two well-qualified nominees, both for the Fourth Circuit  Court of Appeals. Yesterday afternoon, we voted to advance the  nomination of Marvin Quattlebaum, a graduate of Rhodes College and the  University of South Carolina. He presently serves as a district judge  for the District of South Carolina. At noon the Senate will vote to  confirm his nomination.   When he was nominated to the Federal bench last year, Judge  Quattlebaum received strong, bipartisan support from the Senate. The  American Bar Association deemed him unanimously ``well-qualified,''  their highest possible rating.   Once we complete consideration of Judge Quattlebaum, we will turn to  Jay Richardson. Mr. Richardson is a graduate of Vanderbilt University  and the University of Chicago Law School. He has held clerkships with  Seventh Circuit Judge Richard Posner and with the late Supreme Court  Chief Justice William Rehnquist.   Since 2009, he has served as assistant U.S. Attorney for the District  of South Carolina. Current and former peers in the U.S. Attorney's  Office say he has a ``well-earned reputation for excellent preparation,  good judgment, fairness, and hard work.''   In that role, Mr. Richardson led the successful prosecution of the  gunman who murdered nine innocent people at Emanuel AME Church in  Charleston, SC, back in 2015. Our colleagues on the Judiciary Committee  have received a letter from Jennifer Pinckney, the wife of the late  Clementa Pinckney, one of the victims of that senseless violence. Ms.  Pinckney wrote to enthusiastically support Mr. Richardson's  confirmation. She said that he ``will make a fine jurist.''   I urge my colleagues to join me in voting to confirm both of these  impressive nominees.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on one final matter, Members were back  in our home States meeting with constituents last week. I had the  opportunity to visit a remarkable business in my hometown of  Louisville.   Caldwell Tanks has been making large industrial and water storage  tanks in Kentucky for over 100 years. It is no secret that they do good  business, but when I stopped by on Friday, they had some especially  good news to share. In 2018 they invested $100,000 in upgrades to their  fleet of cranes. Their 150 Kentucky employees, along with hundreds more  in other States, are seeing estimated wage increases of up to 10  percent or more. Preload, Caldwell's sister company, which makes  prestressed concrete tanks, has invested $500,000 in new manufacturing  equipment.   The company's leadership states that all of these improvements--every  one of them--are direct results of the historic tax reform this  Republican Congress passed last year.   Tax reform, along with all of our other pro-growth policies, has  helped to transform the overall business climate in our country. In the  words of Bernie Fineman, Caldwell's CEO, ``the most important thing  that it's done is to provide hope''--hope--``for our future.''   So while these developments alone are remarkable, the conditions that  made them possible are not a fluke--not in a State that has recently  seen its unemployment rate drop to a 42-year low, not in a country  where the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits is about  as low as it has been in half a century.   Tax reform and regulatory reform helped to make this happen. They  helped to unleash free enterprise and give Caldwell's customers the  confidence to fill up the warehouse's backlogs and drive up 2018 sales  by 14 percent so far.   Caldwell is just one case study in what has become a national  phenomenon. Nationwide, consumers are experiencing renewed confidence.  Retail sales are up 6.4 percent from July of last year. According to  one industry survey, a majority of U.S. manufacturers say this  favorable policy climate has been more likely--more likely--to raise  wages for their workers.   Bustling warehouses and rising wages weren't exactly what our  Democratic colleagues predicted when they railed against tax reform  last year or voted in lockstep to oppose its passage, but one would  hope that hindsight is helping our Democratic colleagues to see how tax  reform and regulatory relief were exactly what the doctor ordered and  how they have contributed to a healthy economy that is paying dividends  for American workers and middle-class families.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that with  respect to the Quattlebaum and Richardson nominations, the motions to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table and the President  be immediately notified of the Senate's action.    Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 3699.    I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the  amendment be dispensed with.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  following amendments be called up en bloc and reported by number:  Menendez-Murkowski No. 3705 and Fischer-Baldwin No. 3706. I further ask  consent that at 5:30 p.m. on Monday, August 20, the Senate vote in  relation to the amendments in the order listed and that there be no  second-degree amendments in order to the amendments prior to the votes.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to  speak for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 608, submitted earlier today.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no  intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 609, submitted earlier today.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no  intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 3 p.m., Monday,  August 20; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the morning  hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date,  the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the  day, and morning business be closed; that following leader remarks, the  Senate resume consideration of H.R. 6157 under the previous order.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order under the provisions of S. Res. 609.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 4:33 p.m., adjourned under  the previous order and pursuant to S. Res. 609 until Monday, August 20,  2018, at 3 p.m. and has done so as a further mark of respect for former  Senator Paul Laxalt.                            ____________________
