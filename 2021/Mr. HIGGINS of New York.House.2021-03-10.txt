 Mr. Speaker, today, the House will vote to  approve the American Rescue Plan for poor and middle America.   The false choice of Wall Street or Main Street is no more. This plan  helps the neighborhood streets and the homes where real people live and  struggle every day.   This plan is supported by 75 percent of the American people. It will  help the cities of Niagara Falls and Buffalo, the county of Erie; will  return the American economy to full employment; and will grow that  economy by 6 percent, a rate not seen in many, many decades. This is a  good plan that provides direct assistance to the people of this country  who need it.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this plan.                            ____________________
