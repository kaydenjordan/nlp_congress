 Mr. President, I wish to recognize Marian Wright  Edelman, founder and president emerita of the Children's Defense Fund,  for her powerful advocacy for racial justice and on behalf of children,  the poor, and all marginalized people.   On September 18, the Coalition on Human Needs will honor Mrs. Edelman  as an extraordinary Human Needs Hero. Mrs. Edelman's storied career  spans several epochal chapters of American history. Her activism and  leadership led to the creation of programs such as Head Start,  federally funded child care, the Children's Health Insurance Program,  and tax credits for low-income families. Through the Children's Defense  Fund and in her earlier work, Mrs. Edelman led in opening doors for  children with disabilities, overhauling child welfare services, and  expanding educational opportunities and health care for all children.  From her early fight to ensure that nutrition aid reached the poorest  families to her ongoing advocacy to protect children of color and all  children from the ravages of poverty, Marian Wright Edelman has  assisted tens of millions of children living in poverty and touched  countless lives for the better.   Mrs. Edelman grew up the daughter of a Baptist minister, who raised  her with a strong emphasis on the value of faith, family, and  education. These values would guide her through the challenges of  entering the public sphere as an African-American woman. Mrs. Edelman's  advocacy began while she was a student at Spelman College, where she  was an active participant of the civil rights movement. Upon graduating  from Yale Law School, Mrs. Edelman became the first African-American  woman admitted to the Mississippi Bar. In Mississippi, she practiced  with the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund and was an integral  part of the Freedom Summer of 1964. She was instrumental in exposing  the plight of child poverty in the South and throughout the United  States, culminating in Senator Robert Kennedy's historic trip to  witness the plight of hungry children in Mississippi.   Subsequently, Mrs. Edelman served as counsel to the Rev. Martin  Luther King's Poor People's Campaign. In 1973,  [[Page S5473]]  she founded the Children's Defense Fund, an organization that to this  day continues to work tirelessly to ensure child poverty will one day  be a thing of the past. The CDF's ``Leave No Child Behind'' mission is  to ensure every child ``a Healthy Start, a Head Start, a Fair Start, a  Safe Start, and a Moral Start in life and successful passage to  adulthood with the help of caring families and communities.'' To that  end, CDF continues the tradition of Freedom Schools in 28 States and  empowers outstanding high school students who have overcome tremendous  adversity through its Beat the Odds program.   Through her work, Mrs. Edelman has achieved international renown,  garnering numerous awards, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom.  She has authored several books on her life and our Nation's shared  responsibility to children.   Mrs. Edelman has been a guiding voice in much of my own work in  Congress, and I know that countless other Members of Congress would say  the same. This is particularly true with respect to my involvement in  the Family First Prevention Services Act, a law that changed the way  our Nation supports child welfare services by expanding the largest  Federal program--title IV-E of the Social Security Act which pays for  foster care services--to also support services for families to help  prevent the need for foster care in the first place. This legislative  victory simply would not have occurred were it not for the strong and  steady voice of Mrs. Edelman and her colleagues at the Children's  Defense Fund.   Marian Wright Edelman will long be remembered as one of the greatest  champions of children in our Nation's history, and so it is my honor  and privilege today to recognize Marian Wright Edelman.                            ____________________     Mr. President, this summer, while American families  enjoyed time away from work and from school, the big pharmaceutical  companies revved up their influence machine to dismantle bipartisan  legislation aimed at bringing down prescription drug costs.   In July, the Senate Finance Committee, on which I am the ranking  Democrat, passed legislation that constitutes the most serious and the  most significant bipartisan effort in recent memory to lower drug  prices. It is the result of months and months of work by Members on  both sides. With respect to Chairman Grassley he and I worked literally  every single day for 6 months with our colleagues to try to bring  together this bipartisan package. Now the big pharmaceutical companies  want to shred the bipartisan Finance Committee bill into confetti.    The bill has two particularly important proposals. First, it has an  out-of-pocket cap in Medicare that is going to save senior citizens $27  billion in the next decade. It will end the era when prescription drugs  forced senior citizens into bankruptcy.   The second key proposal is the one that really has Big Pharma  mobilizing their lobbyist armies. It is a provision that stipulates  that if big pharmaceutical companies are engaged in price gouging-- engaged in price gouging--they are going to face consequences. They are  going to be able to set the prices, but if they price gouge, the  taxpayer is not going to funnel up unlimited subsidies any longer. That  is what that provision does that the big pharmaceutical companies are  fighting. It is literally a requirement that drug companies, big drug  manufacturers, when they price gouge, make a payment to Medicare, a  penalty, one might call it. It is going to save the Medicare Program  $60 billion.   If the drug companies raise prices faster than inflation, they will  have to pay the difference back to Medicare. There will be no more  unjustifiable price hikes to please the shareholders at everybody  else's expense and, particularly, no more taxpayer subsidies for price  gouging on pharmaceuticals in America.   For literally years, I have been hearing the big drug companies say  that they didn't want price controls, that price controls would be bad  for innovation. Nobody--nobody--wants to freeze innovation, so we went  back to the drawing board, and we said: OK. You set your price, but if  you do price gouge, if you do hit patients, families, and consumers in  an unfair way, the taxpayer is not going to ladle out unlimited  subsidies. That is what that provision of our bill does.   Unfortunately, the big pharmaceutical companies would do just about  anything to protect the status quo, keep the prices climbing up and up  and the profits rolling in.   Their lobbyists are walking the halls here on Capitol Hill. The  pharmaceutical company executives are pulling out all the stops from  their political headquarters to generate support. Their fear-mongering  messages have spread in op-eds attacking our legislation, saying that  somehow this bill, a bipartisan bill written by Senator Grassley, the  senior Member of the Republican Caucus, is somehow a socialist price  control.  [[Page S5481]]    I already talked about how it is pretty hard to call it price control  if the company gets to set its prices, but it certainly doesn't limit  subsidies. Apparently, the pharmaceutical companies will not accept any  limits there as well.   Basically, the pharmaceutical lobbyists are calling it inhumane for  the Senate Finance Committee to try to fix the broken system and bring  down pharmaceutical prices. They basically say that any effort--any  effort--to hold down prices is socialism.   One op-ed said that the Medicare drug program would cease ``to  function as a market entirely'' if drug companies lost their  constitutional right to limitless--limitless--price increases. Others  have even claimed that drug prices are falling nationwide, which  millions of seniors can tell you is fiction, based on the trips they  take to the pharmacy window.   I have a bottom line, now that the Senate has come back after the  summer break. The big pharmaceutical companies have had just about the  longest winning streak in Washington. It seems as though they have a  couple of lobbyists for practically every Member of Congress. Yet the  Finance Committee voted on a bipartisan basis to actually act in the  face of price gouging and protect American patients and families.   We cannot let the big pharmaceutical companies win this time. We  cannot let them win on that price-gouging penalty in particular. They  want it gone. They know this is going to ripple through the American  economy because people are going to say: Hey, this is a pretty fair  approach. The companies can set their prices, but they don't have a  right to unlimited subsidies.   I personally believe--and the head of the Congressional Budget Office  touched on this for our committee--this has the potential to be copied  in the private sector as well. I think that is a good thing also.   The question for the Senate is going to be this: Are we going to hand  pharma essentially the power of a line-item veto, where they can go in  and strike one provision--one provision--the provision that does the  most to stop drug company price gouging? Whether pharma gets to comb  over our proposals to strike down anything that might curtail their  price increases or cut into their profits--that is really what they are  seeking to do. If pharma can prevent the Senate from taking even the  first basic steps to bring down drug prices, then the question is, What  is going to come next? Are the drug company and the drug lobbyists  going to get their own desks here on the floor of the U.S. Senate? At  least then their influence wouldn't just be in the shadows of the  Nation's Capitol.   The prices of prescription drugs in America are out of control. All  this summer I was having townhall meetings at home. I went to small  pharmacies across my State, urban and rural. Usually, in these  meetings, I would ask if somebody in the audience knew somebody who had  been affected by high insulin prices. Everybody's hand went up. I  asked: How many of you have neighbors who have been affected by high  insulin prices? Everybody's hand goes up.   The fact is that insulin prices have gone up thirteenfold in the last  few years, and that drug is not 13 times better. It is basically the  same drug, basically the same insulin that has been around for decades.    The reason those prices go up and up and up constantly is that the  big pharmaceutical companies can get away with it. Now the Senate  Finance Committee is saying: You aren't going to get away with it any  longer. The days when everybody in Congress would just look the other  way and they could charge anything they want will be over.   There was one particularly interesting article written over the  course of the summer in which the author, using AARP data, basically  said that if Senator Grassley and I and bipartisan members of the  Finance Committee had done this 10 years ago, there wouldn't be a  crisis with drug prices. His argument--he went through AARP data--was,  essentially, drugs that had gone up $5,000 over a few years would have  gone up something like $500--something much more manageable for  American families and patients.   The Senate Finance Committee is moving to actually stop this price  gouging. I don't believe the pharmaceutical industry ought to be able  to overrule 19 Senators on the Senate Finance Committee, Democrats and  Republicans. Pharma shouldn't be able to gobble up 50 billion Medicare  dollars that our legislation would otherwise save as part of the effort  to stop the price gouging.   Our legislation gets to the heart of how drug companies have managed  to manipulate and abuse the broken healthcare system for far too long.  They have done it with a pretty simple formula: Just make sure that the  U.S. Senate lets them do anything they want--no constraints on  companies at all. Keep the seniors on the hook for huge costs when they  are prescribed expensive drugs.   It is not just a crisis in Medicare. A recent study showed that  nearly one-third of American adults said that at some point in the last  year, they chose not to take medication--medication that was  prescribed--because of the cost. In particular, insulin is cited again  and again as a prime example, with tragic stories about people who died  after self-rationing the insulin they needed to manage their diabetes.   Rising drug costs force the people of this country into impossible  choices. You are robbed of your savings if you get your prescriptions  filled, and you are robbed of your health if you don't. Obviously, that  is unacceptable. It ought to be unacceptable to every Member of this  body, just the way it was unacceptable to the Senate Finance Committee  on a bipartisan basis.   I did make clear in the Finance Committee that this was just the  beginning. I believe, for example, it is long overdue for Medicare to  have the power to bargain with drugmakers directly for lower drug  prices. Something like 90 percent of the American people--90 percent of  the American people--believe that it is time to lift the restriction on  Medicare so that Medicare could bargain to hold down the costs of  medicine. We weren't able to get that into the bill, but, at a minimum,  the bipartisan legislation the Finance Committee approved should not be  picked apart by pharma lobbyists, particularly on the key question of  whether they want to stop pharmaceutical price gouging.   On this side, my colleagues and I are going to continue to fight to  get this legislation passed by the full Senate. For now, it is up to  Leader McConnell to bring our bill to the floor.   My message to every Member of this body is this: The Americans who  are battling illnesses and struggling to pay for their medications  cannot wait. These are people who are walking an economic tightrope.  Every month they balance their food bill against their fuel bill and  their fuel bill against their medicine bill. These are Americans who  cannot afford to be shunted aside while the Senate favors business as  usual for the drugmakers.   Every one of us knows what this crisis is all about and how big it  is. Senators were home for weeks this summer. They heard from those in  their communities, in grocery stores, in gas stations, in restaurants,  and in Dairy Queens--everywhere you go. When a Senator is home, folks  come up and tell them a story about how they feel when they get their  prescription drug bills, that they have been hit by a wrecking ball. I  held townhall meetings all over the State. The issue of prescription  drug costs came up at every single one of them.    I am going to close with this. Pharma's winning streak has to end  here, and it has to end now. For the Senate to cave and allow pharma to  block the price-gouging penalty would be an outrage. It would be a  dereliction of duty on the part of the Senate.   I am going to keep up this fight, and I know Chairman Grassley is  going to continue to fight for our bipartisan bill, and I urge Senators  on both sides of the aisle to stand with us.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
