 Mr. Speaker, in their coverage of the President,  the liberal media have given up being objective, and their credibility  is now at an all-time low.   Are the courts next?   When considering the President's written immigration orders, some  judges are basing their decisions not on the actual text but on what  was said during the heat of the campaign.   This is a dangerous development, dangerous to our judicial system and  dangerous to our democracy. The judiciary's role is to interpret the  law and decide whether it is constitutional.   When judges decide to become politicians, injecting their own  political bias into a decision, our Constitution and our government are  at risk.   If the media and the judiciary cease being objective, we should fear  for the future of our country.                            ____________________
