 Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the  Ukrainian supplemental bill.   Madam Speaker, $40 billion, but there is no baby formula for American  mothers and babies.   An unknown amount of money to the CIA in the Ukraine supplemental  bill, but there is no formula for American babies and mothers.   Madam Speaker, $54 million in COVID spending in Ukraine, but there is  no formula for American babies and mothers.   Madam Speaker, $900 million for nonprofits and organizations in  Ukraine, but there is no formula for American babies and mothers.   Madam Speaker, $8.7 billion for economic support and funding in  Ukraine, but there is no formula for American mothers and babies.   If this is about claiming that it is about saving lives, let's be  real, then we would care about war-torn countries like Ethiopia. So  that is a bunch of hypocrisy, because I never hear Ethiopia brought up  here. Totally ignoring our own border crisis, our own baby formula  crisis, and brutal inflation, skyrocketing gas prices that no one can  afford, but $40 billion for Ukraine?   Stop funding regime change and money laundering scams and U.S.  politician coverups of their crimes in countries like Ukraine. The  American people do not support paying for constant U.S. involvement in  foreign affairs while our own government fails our own country.   Let me remind everyone here: We swore an oath to uphold and defend  the Constitution of the United States of America and our borders. We  should be paying attention to our country right now.
