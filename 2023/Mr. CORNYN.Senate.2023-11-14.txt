 Mr. President, tomorrow, President Biden is scheduled to  meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping, and it is safe to say their  meeting comes at an especially fraught time. There is a war in the  Middle East, a war in Europe, and growing tensions in the Indo-Pacific.   In each case, the United States and China have aligned with opposing  powers. China is financing the Russian war while America is supporting  Ukraine. China is propping up the Iranian regime and terrorist proxies  while the United States is backing Israel's righteous defense. China is  threatening its own invasion of Taiwan while the United States stands  firmly in support of Taiwan's defense.   In addition to these conflicts on the world stage, the United States  is facing more direct threats from the People's Republic of China and  the Chinese Communist Party. Economic relations have deteriorated due  to China's subversive trade practices.   The Chinese Communist Party is holding three American hostages,  including Houston native Mark Swidan, who has been imprisoned and  tortured for more than a decade.   More than 70,000 Americans a year are being killed by a synthetic  opioid, fentanyl, which is manufactured using precursor chemicals that  come from--you guessed it--China.   Earlier this year, a Chinese surveillance balloon traveled across the  United States, marking a new level of bravado for the Chinese Communist  Party.   So suffice it to say this is an especially fraught time for U.S.- China relations, but President Biden should not give the Chinese  Communist Party or President Xi a free pass. I hope the President will  deliver a clear message to President Xi that China's aggressive and  hostile actions will not be met with kid gloves. We have a  responsibility to the American people and to our allies to deal with  threats from China straightforwardly and head-on.   Strong leadership from the President is important, but Congress has  an important role to play too. For example, we have a major piece of  unfinished business that is a key to our efforts to counter threats  from China, and that is the National Defense Authorization Act. This  year's National Defense Authorization Act--or NDAA, as we call it-- includes a range of provisions related to long-term strategic  competition with China, and it is time to finish that bill and send it  to the President's desk for his signature.   The Senate passed the NDAA at the end of July, and here we are in  November. I hope this week, after more than 3\1/2\ months of waiting,  we can finally begin to vote on the formal conference process. This  will be key to ironing out the differences between the House and the  Senate so we can deliver a bill to the President's desk that is truly  tough on China and deals with the threat in a realistic and clear-eyed  fashion.   The Biden administration has moved away from the idea of decoupling  from China and now focuses on derisking. Frankly, that makes a lot of  sense to me because it is hard to ignore a population of 1.4 billion  people on the other side of the planet. But we do need to derisk, and  that requires some very specific tasks.   We want to reduce America's reliance on China for key national  security interests, but we don't necessarily want to completely  decouple. I couldn't care less how many businesses want to invest in  Starbucks or Burger Kings in China, but I care a lot about American  investment in artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and advanced  semiconductors.   We know that derisking is harder than it sounds because China does  not play by the rules, as we know. The Chinese Communist Party has  become increasingly aggressive in its efforts to gain power and  influence, embracing illicit tactics like intellectual property theft,  for which it is infamous, forced technology transfers, and predatory  lending.   It is important to understand that this strategy by the Chinese  Communist Party doesn't just benefit China's economy but also its  military. In China, there is no bright line separating the military and  civilian sectors. This is part of a very intentional strategy known as  military-civil fusion, which promotes development of dual-use  technologies. In short, the Chinese Communist Party is focused on  shoring up technologies that bolster its military strength and its  economic power at the same time.   Unfortunately, American investors are fueling the success of Chinese  military-civil fusion, possibly unwittingly, without even knowing  exactly what is happening. I am not talking about covert theft of  intellectual property; I am talking about direct investments in Chinese  companies. American investors are funneling money into companies that  are developing artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and next- generation semiconductors, all of which benefit the People's Liberation  Army. Intentionally or not, these American investors are fueling  China's military strength and funding capabilities that could  eventually be used against the United States and our allies.   Joseph Stalin reportedly said:         We will hang the capitalists with the rope they sell us.    Metaphorically, the United States has provided the Chinese Communist  Party with a lot of metaphorical rope.   At the end of 2020, U.S. investments in Chinese companies totaled  $2.3 trillion in market value. That includes $21 billion in  semiconductors, $54 billion in military companies, and a whopping $221  billion in artificial intelligence. That is American investors in  China, in those sectors.   We now know China as the single largest national security threat of  our time, and it is clear that the United States entities are helping  bankroll its rise. While we have some information--anecdotal really-- that illustrates the scope of the problem, we need more information. We  need more visibility. We need a better understanding of how certain  U.S. investments benefit the Chinese Communist Party and its military  buildup and its belligerent and aggressive actions.   Thankfully, this is a bipartisan priority, and I am glad the Senate  took action over the summer. The Senator from Pennsylvania, Senator  Casey, and I introduced an outbound transparency provision that was  adopted as an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act, and  it passed by a vote of 91 to 6. You don't get that kind of bipartisan  vote around here very often. So I think it sends a very strong message.   This measure simply requires companies to notify Treasury of  investments in specific sectors, including advanced semiconductors,  artificial intelligence, and hypersonics. This is not a broad bill that  prohibits investments in the People's Republic of China. This is  designed to provide information to Congress's policymakers about where  that money is going in particular sectors where we are in the greatest  level of competition with China.   This is all about visibility, about transparency. It will help us  understand where the money is going and allow us to take appropriate  action, if required.   Our colleagues in the House are overwhelmingly supportive of outbound  investment transparency, though there isn't the same level of consensus  that there is here in the Senate. Members of the House have suggested  everything from notification requirements to sanctions, to outright  prohibitions on some investments.   We work very diligently with stakeholders here in the Senate to try  to build consensus. And I think we have achieved that on our outbound  transparency provision. But I do expect our colleagues in the House  will have a thorough debate about various options. And I have to say,  we are fortunate that we have two experts on this topic in the  conference committee of the House.   Chairman   Michael McCaul leads the House Foreign Affairs Committee  and is a powerful and trusted voice on matters related to China. He  recently introduced his own outbound investment legislation and is  committed to including a strong outbound provision in the NDAA.   The conference committee for the Defense authorization bill also  includes Chairman   Mike Gallagher, who leads  [[Page S5496]]  the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party. His  committee has been investigating problematic investments in Chinese  companies, and he has been clear, based upon those investigations, that  Congress needs to enact strong guardrails around investments in China.   But before you do that, you need good information, which is what our  outbound investment transparency provision provides. I am glad Chairman  Gallagher and Chairman McCaul will bring their expertise to the Defense  authorization bill conference committee. And I am optimistic they can  work out with our Senate colleagues a provision that will earn strong  bipartisan support.   After 3\1/2\ months of waiting, I hope the Senate will finally vote  to begin the NDAA conference committee process this week. Once that  happens, the two Chambers can work together in earnest to reach an  agreement on a final version of the bill.   Here in the Senate, I appreciate Chairman Reed and Ranking Member  Wicker for their leadership throughout this process and their support  of this amendment with Senator Casey.   I also want to express my gratitude to Senator Sullivan of Alaska for  his support and his commitment to putting a strong outbound investment  provision in this year's NDAA.   There is a lot of work that remains to be done, but there is  clearly--clearly--an overwhelming bipartisan desire to counter threats  from China through an outbound investment measure. As I noted, this  amendment passed the Senate by 91 to 6.   In the House, Members on both sides have endorsed varying proposals  that address the same problem from different angles. I don't understand  why anyone would be opposed to outbound investment transparency. All we  are asking for is information that may or may not require us to take  further action.   This information is key to our national security and will help the  United States manage risks related to China. And I hope we can get the  job done soon.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
