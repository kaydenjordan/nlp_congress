 Mr. President, along with Senator Collins, I am introducing  legislation that would eliminate the sunset date for U.S. Interagency  Council on Homelessness--the Council--so that this independent agency  can build upon its success in helping to prevent and end homelessness  nationally.   The Council was established under the Reagan administration as part  of the landmark McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act of 1987. Since  that time, it has worked across the Federal Government and private  sector to coordinate homeless assistance nationally. In 2009, the  Homeless Emergency Assistance and Rapid Transition to Housing, or  HEARTH Act, which I authored and introduced along with Senator Collins  and others, expanded the Council's role to work with public, nonprofit,  and private stakeholders to develop a national strategic plan to end  homelessness. On June 22, 2010, the Council unveiled this plan, called  Opening Doors, which has guided its work to develop and expand on  effective strategies across the country to prevent and end  homelessness.   Since Opening Doors was unveiled, the U.S. Department of Housing and  Urban Development, HUD, reports that overall homelessness has decreased  by 14 percent, chronic homelessness by 27 percent, and family  homelessness by 23 percent. In addition, we have seen veterans'  homelessness drop by 47 percent. This progress is not only a result of  the more than $500 million Federal investment in housing and supportive  services through programs like HUD-VASH but is also because of the  direction the Council provides to the Departments of Veterans Affairs  and HUD, as well as public housing agencies administering assistance at  the local level. Specifically, the Council helped various partners  align their resources, efforts, goals, and measures of success for  serving homeless veterans. Under this approach, the Commonwealth of  Virginia, Connecticut, Delaware, the city of New Orleans, and DeKalb  County in Georgia, to name a few, have all declared an end to veterans'  homelessness.   Yet more work remains. And here, too, the Council is an important  part of developing solutions. For instance, nearly 36,000 unaccompanied  youth under the age of 25 experienced homelessness in 2016. While some  communities have started to develop responses to youth homelessness, it  is a complex problem that requires a tailored approach taking into  account the local variables of foster care, primary to postsecondary  education, housing, and healthcare systems. Finding new ways to deliver  and fund assistance to this diverse population is essential, and that  is why Senator Collins and I held a hearing in our subcommittee on this  matter and worked together to include over $40 million in targeted  resources to address youth homelessness in both the fiscal year 2016  and 2017 Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, THUD,  appropriations bills. As part of this new funding, the Council will be  executing a broader collaborative effort with foster care networks, the  juvenile justice community, and education partners to create and find  [[Page S2050]]  success in coordinated, cost-effective solutions that meet community  needs. The Council's expertise in implementing complex Federal programs  at the local level will continue to be critical to the success of this  initiative.   For all of this good work the Council has done and continues to do,  it is vital that we keep its doors open. The Council, as the only  agency at the federal level charged specifically with addressing  homelessness, has helped communities not only reduce homelessness, but  it has also helped to save money. We know that people experiencing  homelessness are more likely to access expensive health care services  and spend more time in incarceration--which are extremely costly to  taxpayers, states, and local governments. According to the National  Alliance to End Homelessness, ``Based on 22 different studies from  across the country, providing permanent supportive housing to  chronically homeless people creates net savings of $4,800 per person  per year, through reduced spending on jails, hospitals, shelters, and  other emergency services.''   The Council has helped to build upon these estimated savings by  identifying and tailoring cost-effective solutions that reduce the  level of health care services, as well as recidivism, for individuals  experiencing chronic homelessness. In fiscal year 2016 alone, the  Council's modest $3.5 million budget catalyzed more than $5 billion in  combined Federal resources that aim to address homelessness. It  develops national strategies that inform the work and improve the cost- effectiveness of programs administered by 19 Federal agencies, and as a  result, communities and Sates are able to leverage housing, health,  education, and labor funding more strategically and effectively.   In our current budgetary environment we need a wise and creative arm  to help our communities identify and maximize resources and  opportunities where possible, to ensure we are actually addressing  homelessness, and not contributing to it. The Council is proof that the  government can work and save money in the process, and our bipartisan  legislation ensures that the Council's doors remain open until there  truly is an end to homelessness nationwide.
