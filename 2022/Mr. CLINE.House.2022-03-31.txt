 Mr. Speaker, the President of the United States takes an  oath, promising to faithfully execute the office that he holds. That is  a promise to uphold and defend the laws of this country and to protect  our Nation's citizens. But President Biden seems determined to violate  that oath when it comes to enforcing our immigration and asylum laws.   There is an undeniable crisis at our southern border, and it is a  direct result of President Biden's halting of the construction of the  border wall, ending the remain-in-Mexico policy and re-implementing  catch and release.   Now, instead of taking steps to rectify the situation that he has  created, President Biden is preparing to pour fuel on the fire by  lifting Title 42. Title 42 is essential to ensuring the immediate  expulsion of illegal aliens. And officials within the President's own  Department of Homeland Security are sounding the alarm. Officials have  said that if this policy is revoked, it would cause a massive run on  the border, even worse than we are seeing right now, resulting in  upwards of 18,000 illegal crossings a day. That is 6.5 million illegal  immigrants crossing every year.   State and local governments, especially school districts across the  country, are being overwhelmed. Customs and Border Protection can  barely keep up as it is, let alone with that kind of surge. President  Biden is failing the American people and his neglect at the border is  having catastrophic consequences.
