 Madam Speaker, I rise to honor the life of fallen  Detroit Police Officer Loren Courts.   Officer Courts died in the line of duty at the age of 40 on July 6,  2022. I and all Michiganders share in the grief during this difficult  time.   A 5-year veteran of the department and second-generation officer,  Officer Courts risked his safety and ultimately sacrificed his life  protecting his community. He will be remembered by his loved ones as a  remarkable public servant, friend, son, husband, and father.   Madam Speaker, I ask all of my colleagues to join me in honoring the  life and service of Officer Loren Courts of the Detroit Police  Department.                            ____________________
