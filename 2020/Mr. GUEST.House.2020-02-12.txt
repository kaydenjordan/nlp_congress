 Madam Speaker, as a member of the Committee on Homeland  Security, I rise today to express my strong opposition to the New Way  Forward Act, which would completely eliminate our Nation's ability to  control our borders and determine who enters our country.   It would cripple the efforts of our law enforcement officers to  remove dangerous criminals from our streets, and it would undermine the  sacrifice that the men and women of law enforcement make every day.   Additionally, the New Way Forward Act would encourage and open new  pathways for convicted criminals to enter and remain in the United  States. Meanwhile, conservative policies like building the wall and  supporting law enforcement agencies reduced the number of apprehensions  by almost 75 percent since May and led to the seizure of more than  50,000 pounds of drugs across our southwest border.   Madam Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to oppose the New Way  Forward Act.                            ____________________
