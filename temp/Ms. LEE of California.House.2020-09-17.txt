 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding and also for his tremendous leadership. And also, I  acknowledge Representative Meng for spearheading this important  resolution.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 908 to condemn all  forms of anti-Asian hate speech related to COVID-19.   Now, this pandemic is leading to an alarming rate of hateful speech  directed at people of Asian and Pacific Islander descent in the United  States. And the truth is, as an African American, I know what hate and  racism is and I know the violence that results.   And the facts are: Since March, there have been over 2,500 reported  cases of anti-Asian discrimination related to COVID-19, including over  1,100 cases in my home State of California.   At the same time, by no accident or coincidence, the White House  continues to refer to COVID-19 as the  [[Page H4499]]  ``China virus'' and ``kung flu'' trying to shift attention and blame  away from this administration's inadequate response and poor  leadership. They would rather scapegoat Asian Americans, exacerbating  anti-Asian hate and violence.   Congress needs to send a clear message that we will stand with our  AAPI community, especially during these challenging times, to fight  bigotry and racism within our country.   Hate speech does lead to violence and discrimination. That is the  truth.
