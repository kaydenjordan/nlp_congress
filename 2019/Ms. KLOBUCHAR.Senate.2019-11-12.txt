 Mr. President, I join my colleagues today in  expressing my opposition to the language in the fiscal year 2020  Interior appropriations bill related to the Environmental Protection  Agency's ability to issue small refinery waivers under the renewable  fuel standard without taking into account the Department of Energy's  recommendations.   The Trump administration continues to undermine the renewable fuel  standard by granting small refinery waivers to multi-billion-dollar oil  companies. Since the beginning of the administration, a total of 85  waivers have been issued, reducing demand for more than 4 billion  gallons of renewable fuel. That is why I have repeatedly called on the  Trump administration to stop issuing any further waivers, immediately  reallocate the remaining gallons, and make public the information  regarding any recipients of these exemptions.   We need more transparency and openness about the Environmental  Protection Agency's, EPA, use of small refinery waivers--who is  applying for and receiving them, how are they documenting their  economic hardship, and how is EPA considering that hardship in the  context of interagency recommendations. The ``small refinery relief''  provision in the appropriations bill will allow EPA to avoid answering  these questions and continue issuing waivers without providing evidence  of hardship.   It is for this reason that I am opposed to the ``small refinery  relief'' language in the fiscal year 2020 Interior appropriations bill.  While the administration must cease issuing any further improper  refinery exemptions, as I have been calling for since these abuses  began, we can start supporting our farmers and rural communities by  removing this harmful provision from the Interior appropriations bill  during conference negotiations. Especially at a time when they are  facing trade uncertainty, low prices, and difficult weather, our  farmers deserve better.                            ____________________
