 Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill to make the  process of siting natural gas pipelines fairer, more transparent, and  more responsive to landowner concerns.   For some time now, I have been listening to Virginians with  passionate views on the process involved in permitting the Mountain  Valley Pipeline, as well as the previous proposal for the Atlantic  Coast Pipeline. For various reasons, many oppose one or both of these  projects, while others support these projects. The Federal Energy  Regulatory Commission, FERC, is tasked with analyzing all the issues-- purpose and need for a project, impacts on people living on the route,  potential risks to the environment or property--and deciding what  course best serves the public interest.   From listening to all sides, I have concluded that while reasonable  people may reach different conclusions, FERC's public input process is  flawed and could be better. Accordingly, this legislation proposes  several steps to address several shortcomings, all of which were  originally brought to my attention by Virginia constituents. For  instance, this bill requires programmatic analysis of pipelines  proposed around the same time and in the same geographic vicinity so  that the full impacts of multiple projects can be analyzed. It requires  a greater number of public comment meetings so that citizens are not  required to commute long distances to meetings at which they must speed  through just a few minutes of remarks on these complex topics. It  ensures that affected landowners are given proper notice and  compensation. It guarantees that landowner complaints will be heard  before construction commences, and it clarifies the circumstances under  which eminent domain should and should not be used.   I am pleased to be joined by my colleague Senator Mark Warner on this  bill, which is an update to a version we introduced in the 116th  Congress. The public deserves reasonable opportunity  [[Page S4642]]  to weigh in on energy infrastructure projects, and we are heeding calls  by our constituents to make this process fairer and more transparent  without mandating a particular outcome.   I encourage the Senate to consider this legislation, not to pave the  way for pipelines nor to throw up insurmountable roadblocks to them but  to give the public greater certainty that the Federal Government's  infrastructure decisions are fair and transparent.                                  ______                                         By Mr. PADILLA (for himself and Mrs. Feinstein):   S. 4870. A bill to approve the settlement of the water right claims  of the Tule River Tribe, and for other purposes; to the Committee on  Indian Affairs.
