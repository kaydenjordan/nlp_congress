 Mr. Speaker, the United States of America has generated  more prosperity than every other nation in history combined. That is  because our divinely inspired system of government prioritizes  individual rights through a republic that has representation, employs  market principles and property rights, and backs it up with rule of  law.   The sponsors of today's legislation are using a pandemic as an excuse  to propose spending $3 trillion on policies that reverse or undermine  all three. Now, we all know it is not going to become law. Instead, it  is part of a strategy to set the initial negotiation bar so  outrageously to the left that the end negotiated result would transform  our Republic to a socialist remotely governed Republic.   When I disagree with legislation content, I often consider  compromise.    Mr. Speaker, when I disagree with the legislative  content, I often consider compromise. But in this case, there is only  one reasonable response, and that is a ``no'' vote.
