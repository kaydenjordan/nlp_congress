 Madam President, I want to talk about good news for two of  our major cities in Missouri. I will start with the sporting news,  which would be the July 12 victory of the St. Louis Blues, when they  earned their spot in the history books when they defeated the Boston  Bruins in game 7 of the Stanley Cup finals.   For the first time in franchise history, the Blues brought the  Stanley Cup trophy to Missouri to celebrate their incredible  achievement and to share it with some of the best sports fans in  America.   Senator Hawley and I look forward to a chance, before too long, to  host the Stanley Cup here at the Senate so all my colleagues will get  to see the joy we have in seeing that come to our State.   It is hard to imagine that just 6 months ago, the Blues were the  lowest ranked team in the NHL. I think at the first of the season the  odds were 60 to 1 that the Blues would win the Stanley Cup. Those were  the highest odds any team faced.   As it turned out, the odds aren't always what counts. What counts is  how you play the season. So they got off to a rough start, changed  their coach in January, and then as the season progressed, at the end  of the regular season, they won 11 straight games.   A rookie, Jordan Binnington, led the team to an incredibly successful  second half. His goalie performance in the second half of the season,  and particularly in the Stanley Cup games, was extraordinary,  especially in that last game.   The Blues eventually moved on to get the third seed in the Western  Conference playoffs. They won their series against Winnipeg in four  games to two in the first round. They advanced to the second round to  defeat the Dallas Stars in a really dramatic double overtime victory in  game seven. They continued their historic run, defeating the San Jose  Sharks in round three, and then the Blues made it all the way to the  Stanley Cup final and ended the season with a decisive 4-to-1 victory  in game seven and at Boston.   I think, if you look back at the record on this, the Blues had  clearly learned to win away from home, and they proved that in the  Stanley Cup.   They played as one team, they played as one unit, but they had lots  of people helping. Ryan O'Reilly set a franchise record with 23 points  in the playoffs. He ultimately went on to win the Conn Smythe Award as  the postseason MVP. Jordan Binnington, whom I mentioned before, became  the first and only rookie goalie to win 16 games in the Stanley Cup  playoffs. Patrick Maroon, a Missouri native, scored a heroic goal in  the double overtime of game seven against the Dallas Stars.   There was another individual who was reflective of just lots of the  fans whom the Blues had with them. This superfan, Laila Anderson, 11  years old, didn't let her battle with a rare, life-threatening disease  prevent her from cheering on the team she loved.   At the beginning of game three in the Stanley finals, she took to the  ice before the puck dropped and fired up the team and the nearly 20,000  fans who filled the Enterprise Center.   Laila became such an important factor to the Blues' victories that  they flew this 11-year-old to Boston to make  [[Page S3635]]  sure their No. 1 fan would be there to cheer them on in game seven.   Shortly after the Blues were presented with the Stanley Cup, she  celebrated with the players on the ice as they passed around that  iconic trophy.   Her inspirational story is just another example of why this was a  season right out of the storybooks. The city of St. Louis and our State  will never forget the Blues' incredible achievement this year.   I would like to congratulate Tom Stillman, the general manager; Doug  Armstrong, the head coach; Craig Berube; and all the coaches, the  players, the fans, and the staff who brought this incredible victory  home to St. Louis.   I look forward to hearing our fans sing ``Gloria'' many more times  next year when the team defends its title as Stanley Cup champions.                                     USDA     Madam President, as the St. Louisans were celebrating the  Stanley Cup, people on the other side of our State in Kansas City  received some great news--this time great news from the Federal  Government, when the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture, Sonny Perdue,  announced on Thursday that two Federal ag research agencies would be  moving their headquarters to the Kansas City region from Washington,  DC.   The Economic Research Service and the National Institute of Food and  Agriculture together will bring more than 500 jobs to the Kansas City  area. It is fantastic news for our State, for our region, I think also  for the workers at those two agencies and their families.   The point of the move is to get these important government offices  closer to the customers they serve and to save the taxpayers money.  Kansas City will be a great place to do both of those things.   Missouri is already home to more than 5,000 U.S. Department of  Agriculture employees and contractors working for a dozen different  Department offices in the Department of Agriculture, but bringing these  two agency headquarters to the State will put them right in the middle  of some of the most exciting and cutting-edge innovation happening in  the ag industry.   Talk about being closer to your customers, the farmers of America,  and closer to examples of innovation, I think this move and Secretary  Purdue's decision is clearly going to show that is the case.   Kansas City is close to at least a dozen land-grant universities in  our State. Two of those would be the University of Missouri in Columbia  and Lincoln University in Jefferson City. These institutions, along  with the other land-grant institutions in the region, are preparing for  the next generation of ag leaders to meet maybe the greatest challenge  of all time as world food demand moves toward doubling between now and  2050 and world food need doubles between now and 2060. A lot more food  is going to have to be grown on the same land with fewer inputs, to  meet our environmental concerns, our climate concerns, our other  concerns, but still feed the world in a way that we are uniquely  positioned to be a lead partner in that partnership of feeding the  world.   The move the USDA has made will give them the opportunity to  strengthen partnerships they already have and have even greater impact  as they work to improve crop yields and develop risk management  strategies.   Our State is also a big part of the Kansas City Animal Health  Corridor, which extends from Manhattan, KS, to Columbia, MO. That  corridor is home to more than 300 animal health companies. It is the  largest concentration in the world of that business and includes five  of the world's largest animal health companies.   Relocating these agencies will save taxpayers a lot of money.  Secretary Perdue anticipates that almost $300 million will be saved  over the next 15 years and all the moving costs will be earned back  within 12 months of the move. It is hard to imagine an investment you  make where you have 100 percent payback in 12 months, but that is going  to happen with this one.   That frees up more resources to go toward grants and research instead  of being paid to the Department's landlords.   (Mr. SCOTT of Florida assumed the Chair.)   I think it will also be a huge upgrade for the lives of people who  will be Federal employees living outside of Washington and in the  middle of the country. Last month, the average house in Washington cost  more than $600,000. In Kansas City, the average price was about a  quarter of that. Now, you can find the $600,000 house in Kansas City,  but it is not the average house being sold like it is here. I know  local banks and mortgage companies are standing ready to help those  Federal families as they move to Kansas City.   Also--now that we have gone from Madam President to Mr. President, as  the Senator from Florida has taken the seat and is in charge of the  Senate here for a while--you are making that decision with the current  employees in mind, but I think you are also making that decision, more  importantly, with future employees. Where will be the best place to  recruit? Where will be the best place to encourage people to do  graduate work and other things that allow them to do their jobs better?  I think there were other choices, but I certainly think the choice of  Kansas City was a good one. There is a thriving economy right now, with  lots of job opportunities. Like the rest of the country, there are more  jobs available than people looking for work. Missouri added 8,200 jobs  last year, and we continue to see that happen.   Our new neighbors will also find that Kansas City is home to  limitless cultural, educational, and recreational opportunities--very  appropriate to mention with my native Missouri and now the Senator from  Florida here in the Chair. We have major league sports teams, like the  Royals, the Chiefs, and Sporting Kansas City. We have a thriving  theater culture, a world-class museum at the Nelson-Atkins Museum of  Art, the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum, Science City at Union Station,  and that names just a few.   The motto of USDA is ``Do Right and Feed Everyone.'' By the way, we  were doing research at the Federal level before there was a USDA. In  the 1850s, ag research was going on right here in Washington sponsored  by the Federal Government. In 1862, when the USDA was formed, one of  the principle reasons was research. These two facilities will be an  important part of that. When the people at ERS and NIFA join the many  USDA colleagues they already have in our State, we think they will find  their mission easier and more rewarding than ever.   It is a great time to look forward toward the future of agriculture.  Certainly Missouri and Kansas City and Kansas and that entire region  that hubs around Kansas City, MO, are excited to be a bigger part of  that. Congratulations to those employees, and congratulations to the  decision Secretary Perdue has made to relocate those two Washington- based organizations to a place where they are going to be closer to the  work they do.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
