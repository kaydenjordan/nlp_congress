 Mr. Speaker, I want to speak about a young man by  the name of Will, who is 34 years old and tells us a story that, if he  was a Canadian, there would be a good chance that he could live 17 more  years. He has cystic fibrosis, and I imagine there are many families  with children who have that, but he is concerned about TrumpCare and  the impact.   At age 2, he was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis, a hereditary disease  impacting 30,000 Americans. He says:         Imagine being under water and coming up for air, but       instead of breathing, you uncontrollably cough that air out.       The harder you try to breathe, the more you cough. At its       worst, this disease feels like a long, drawn-out panic attack       set to the soundtrack of an endless hacking cough. At 34,       statistically, I have 7 more years left before my lungs cease       to function.    He mentions that if he were in Canada, statistically, he would have  17 more years because of the healthcare, but he also says this is not  an exaggeration:         The cold data from a recent study by the U.S. Cystic       Fibrosis Foundation, the conclusion is that Canada's       nationalized single-payer healthcare system that guarantees       health insurance for everyone is the primary reason why       Canadians with my disease will live longer.    But look what happened to him:         For the past 4 years, however, my disease has gone into       reverse. I have been gradually getting better. It is an       extraordinary sensation. A new medication called Kalydeco       made by a company in Boston has given me the promise of       extending both the length and quality of my life. I have been       healthy enough to work abroad as a freelance journalist.    A year and a half ago, Will got married.         My wife and I hope to one day have kids, but today is a       sobering day. The House Republicans replaced the Affordable       Care Act, and if the Senate bill goes through, a plan that       likely won't allow me to remain on this drug, then my long-      term plans go out the window. I have a preexisting condition.       My outlook would likely regress back to the one of short-term       survival and carpe diem. That is a very different future than       the one I plan to have.    That is what TrumpCare represents to millions of Americans: higher  costs; less coverage; not 22 million now, but in 2026, 49 million  Americans will not be insured.   How can you? Where is the moral standing?   It guts protections for preexisting conditions no matter what kind of  smoke and mirrors the Senate is trying to tell us. It does not exist.   It has got a crushing age tax. If you are over 50, more of your  income will be used for your insurance premiums, up to $12,000 to  $15,000.   And it steals from Medicare. It makes the Medicare trust fund  insolvent.   In my own State of Texas, here is a long chart that talks to each  Member, including my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, how  many people in their district will lose their health insurance.   I would ask the question: Is there any mercy? Is there anyone that  understands?   In my district alone, almost 100,000--89,000--individuals will be  losing their insurance; almost 20,000 of those will be children. And it  goes on in other Members' districts, talks about children: 7,000,  9,000, 8,000, 15,000, 13,000, 12,000, 10,000, 14,000, 18,000, 16,000  children in different districts in the State of Texas will lose their  insurance.   And then Will, who would have and has now, because of the Affordable  Care Act, a decent life, with a preexisting condition that he  described, how would you like to come from under water and try to  breathe and that breathing is undermined by the hacking of that cough?   I hope that this bill is derailed. I hope that TrumpCare in the House  and the Senate never sees the light of day, not because I don't want to  work with my colleagues, but because the chronically ill will suffer  and many will die. The statistics show that in the State of Texas, Mr.  Speaker.   I conclude with this one sentence, Mr. Speaker. I want to go back to  Mr. Clay, and I ask the Attorney General to investigate the shooting of  Mr. Castile, and to do it now.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the rule  governing debate of H.R. 1215, the ``Protecting Access to Care Act of  2017'' and the underlying bill.   I oppose the rule for H.R. 1215, the ``Protecting Access to Care Act  of 2017'' for the following reasons:   There were twenty-five amendments proposed by colleagues from both  sides of the aisle.   Only five of those amendments were made in order.   What did all five of those amendments have in common?   These amendments were all submitted by my Republican counterparts.   The rule for this bill incorporates none of the amendments offered by  my Democratic colleagues.   Mr. Speaker, that exclusion is problematic.   The amendments not made in order reflect the crippling partisanship  of the House majority.   I also oppose the underlying bill on the merits, because it limits  noneconomic damages to a mere $250,000, which if enacted, would have a  disproportionately adverse impact on women, the poor, and other  vulnerable groups.   When given the opportunity, members refused to incorporate an  amendment that would increase that cap to reflect the cost of inflation  and a concern for the humane treatment of those individuals affected by  medical malpractice.   H.R. 1215 provides immunity for health care providers who dispense  defective or dangerous pharmaceuticals or medical devices.   Finally, I oppose the bill, because it creates an excessively short  statute of limitations period, makes it harder for victims to obtain  adequate legal representation, and imposes the risk of loss on victims  rather than wrongdoers.   Mr. Speaker, there are numerous examples of people who have suffered  at the hands of medical providers and whose lives will never be the  same.   Consider the case of Olivia, an exceptionally bright high school  senior from Santa Monica, California, who had gained early acceptance  to Smith College in Massachusetts.   She never made it to Smith College, because after a medical procedure  was completed and while Olivia was still under anesthesia, a fellow-in- training pulled the catheter causing Olivia's vital signs to plummet.   Hospital staff waited more than ten minutes to resuscitate her, but  it was far too late for Olivia.   She passed away, and her promising future disappeared.   This tragedy never should have happened.   Mr. Speaker, instead of wasting time on this giveaway to special  interests, we should be improving the Affordable Care Act, and opposing  any bill that would leave over twenty million Americans uninsured, and  investigating Russian involvement in our democratic processes.   For these reasons, I oppose the rule and the underlying bill.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Polis is as follows:              An Amendment to H. Res. 382 Offered by Mr. Polis         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections:        Sec. 2. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the       Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare       the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       2475) to provide for the long-term improvement of public       school facilities, and for other purposes. The first reading       of the bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order       against consideration of the bill are waived. General debate       shall be confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour       equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking       minority member of the Committee on Education and the       Workforce. After general debate the bill shall be considered       for amendment under the five-minute rule. All points of order       against provisions in the bill are waived. At the conclusion       of consideration of the bill for amendment the Committee       shall rise and report the bill to the House with such       amendments as may have been adopted. The previous question       shall be considered as ordered on the bill and amendments       thereto to final passage without intervening motion except       one motion to recommit with or without instructions. If the       Committee of the Whole rises and reports that it has come to       no resolution on the bill, then on the next legislative day       the House shall, immediately after the third daily order of       business under clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into the       Committee of the Whole for further consideration of the bill.        Sec. 3. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 2475.                                   ____           The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to  [[Page H5200]]       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I thank the manager of this  legislation, the cosponsors, Mr. Clyburn, and so many others who have  been part of this historic legislation for their leadership on it.   Mr. Speaker, I rise as a member of the bipartisan Congressional HBCU  Caucus and as an original cosponsor of H.R. 1135.   H.R. 1135 would authorize the appropriation of millions of dollars  from 2018 through 2024 to the Historic Preservation Fund to provide  assistance for the restoration and preservation of historic structures  at Historically Black Colleges and Universities.   Let me indicate that this has been a long journey. The  reauthorization is very special and emotional to many of us. As many of  us know, Historically Black Colleges and Universities came at the wake  of the ending of slavery and were a place of refuge for so many  students.   I am reminded of those individuals who, as freed slaves, told stories  of walking miles to be able to get to a school like Fisk University or  to a school for so many in North Carolina and South Carolina or all  throughout the South. They were great refuges for individuals who  wanted a better life.   It is important to note that in the 1980s, the National Park Service  awarded more than $65 million. These grants require you to cover 30  percent of the project. So it is not a handout. It is a hand-up. It is  preserving the history of this great Nation.   I am very grateful to the Congressional Black Caucus. When the  question is asked, ``What is the Congressional Black Caucus and what do  we do,'' I will say without shame that we are the conscience of this  Nation and we recognize that we have a responsibility to protect the  vulnerable things of this Nation, whether it be people or things.   So the idea was to make sure that not only students have a brilliant  education, but those who would seek knowledge will be able to come to  the campuses of these Historically Black Colleges and Universities.   I happen to represent two State schools: Texas Southern University  and Prairie View A&M. There are many HBCUs throughout the State of  Texas. We are grateful for the leadership that they have given. They  have history.   Soon I will be establishing what we call the Emancipation Trail,  which chronicles the announcement of freedom in Texas. It was called  Juneteenth. It was 2 years that some learned about their freedom after  everyone else was free.   Those stories are being told at the HBCUs, but at the same time, STEM  education is being taught. Oakwood College, a historically Black  college of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, educates huge numbers of  doctors. I am told it has the largest number of African Americans that  go into medical school.   STEM is very important to our HBCUs. Texas Southern University has a  renowned homeland security program.   This is a good bill, and I thank my colleagues for voting for this  very right and positive bill.   Mr. Speaker, as a member of the Bipartisan Congressional HBCU Caucus  and an original co-sponsor, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1135,  which reauthorizes the Historically Black Colleges and Universities  Historic Preservation Program.   H.R. 1135 would authorize the appropriation of $10 million annually  from 2018 through 2024 for the Historic Preservation Fund to provide  assistance for the restoration and preservation of historic structures  at Historical Black Colleges (HBCUs).   Specifically, H.R. 1135, reauthorizes $10 million in annual  appropriations for the National Park Service grant program supporting  the preservation of historic buildings on the campuses of historically  black colleges and universities.   Since the 1980s, the National Park Service (NPS) has awarded more  than $65 million to more than 80 HBCUs to repair historic buildings on  their campuses.   To be eligible for grants under the program, recipients have to cover  30 percent of the cost of a project.   Eligible projects include stabilization, masonry repair, removing  lead paint or other hazards, and the improvement of access for the  disabled.   Mr. Speaker, the Historically Black Colleges and Universities  Preservation Program exists to preserve, and stabilize historic  structures on HBCU campuses through projects such as structural  stabilization, masonry repair, replacement of antiquated electrical and  plumbing systems, abating environmental hazards such as asbestos,  ameliorating termite damage, and replacing leaking roofs.   The HBCU preservation project is critically important because much of  the history of African Americans has been lost due to it not being  considered important enough by historians to study and the fact that  many of the repositories of that history--black churches--have been  destroyed by arson.   I thank and my colleague, Assistant Democratic Leader James Clyburn  for his work in bringing this important legislation to the floor.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud that one of the greatest HBCUs in the  country, Texas Southern University, is located in my congressional  district.   Texas Southern University has a rich history with nine academic  units, 1,000 dedicated staff members, and over 9,200 esteemed students.   Like most of my HBCU Caucus colleagues, I have worked closely with my  local HBCU to provide funding and resources needed to enable them to  fulfill their mission of educating the next generation of social  engineers and conducting research programs addressing issues of major  concern to the African American community.   I was proud to spearhead the initiative that brought more than $13  million in financial aid relief for the students and campus of Texas  Southern University.   I also worked with TSU administrators to initiate digital archive  projects to preserve the records of two of its most distinguished  alumni, the legendary Barbara Jordan and Mickey Leland, both of whom  preceded me as the Member of Congress for the Eighteenth Congressional  District of Texas.   I was pleased to facilitate a partnership between Comcast and TSU's  School of Communication to provide scholarships and internships to TSU  students and in-kind marketing services to the university.   I helped secure funding needed to establish the Center for  Transportation, Training and Research in the TSU College of Science,  Engineering, and Technology.   HBCU's have played a critical role in American history.   As the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. stated:         The function of education is to teach one to think       intensively and to think critically. Intelligence plus       character--that is the goal of true education.    HBCUs do not just educate--HBCUs have and will continue to fill an  important role in education opportunity and engagement for millions of  young people from diverse backgrounds.   I ask my colleagues to support reauthorization of the Historically  Black Colleges and Universities Historic Preservation Program by  joining me in voting to pass H.R. 1135.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.  Res. 397, a resolution that reaffirms the United States' commitment to  Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty and its principle of collective  defense.   In the aftermath of World War II, the greatest conflict in human  history, the United States, Canada, and their Western Europe allies  founded the North American Treaty Organization (NATO) in 1949 in  Washington.   Founded on the principle of collective defense, Article 5 of the  North Atlantic Treaty states that, ``The Parties agree that an armed  attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be  considered an attack against them all.''   In the 68 years since the Treaty's ratification, Article 5 has only  been invoked once, following the terrorist attacks of September 11,  2001, when NATO members came to the aid of the United States.   NATO sent seven planes with 830 crewmen from 13 countries to protect  American skies until May 2002, marking the first time in American  history that the continental United States was protected by foreign  forces.   NATO allies and partners have stood with the United States in joint  operations in the Western Balkans, Afghanistan, Iraq, and elsewhere  around the world.   Until this year, every American president since the treaty's signing  in 1949--Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, Ford, Carter,  Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Clinton, George W. Bush, and Obama--has  publicly reaffirmed the American commitment to Article 5.   American presidents have affirmed this nation's commitment to come to  the aid of any NATO member that is under attack.   That is the symbolic meaning of the immortal words spoken by  President Kennedy in West Berlin at the Brandenburg Gate in 1963: ``Ich  bin ein Berliner.''   Mr. Speaker, the principle of collective defense is the core of  NATO's founding treaty and the NATO alliance has been the backbone of  American national security and foreign policy for nearly 70 years.   The strength and solidarity of this western alliance kept Western  Europe whole, prosperous, and free and paved the way for the collapse  of the Soviet Union and the liberation of the nations of Eastern and  Central Europe, many of which have now been integrated into NATO.   The Constitution of the United States grants Congress the sole power  to declare war, but Article 5 does not increase the chance of war.   Rather, NATO is a bulwark against the outbreak of war because it  deters aggression by any adversary.   As a result, NATO is the most successful military alliance in world  history, successfully deterring the outbreak of a third world war,  seeing the Cold War to a victorious conclusion, and protecting the  principle of territorial integrity.   This is why I strongly support H. Res. 397, which reaffirms the  commitment of the People's House to Article 5 of the North Atlantic  Treaty.   The resolution also expresses support for the agreement reached at  the 2014 NATO Wales Summit calling upon each NATO member nation to  allocate at least two percent of its gross domestic product to defense  by 2024.   The resolution also condemns any threat to the sovereignty,  territorial integrity, freedom and democracy of any NATO ally and  welcomes the Republic of Montenegro as the 29th member of the NATO  alliance.   I urge all Members to join me in affirming the commitment of the  United States to Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty for this  important resolution by voting for H. Res. 397.    Mr. Speaker, today a number of us were able to go to  the children's hospital here in Washington, D.C., and met two  miraculous families, children with complex, chronic diseases. With the  love of their parents, one could not tell they were different from any  other child, yet they had horrific and difficult medical conditions.   Those parents were middle class working families, and said that,  without Medicaid, the half a million dollars of healthcare that keeps  those beautiful children alive and leads them to a pathway of a life of  love would not be possible.   I am glad that the Senate TrumpCare bill has been stopped in its  tracks, the same bill that the CBO has said will cause 49 million  Americans to lose their insurance in 2026.   There is no pathway to reform this bill. There is no White House  meeting, no Presidential cajoling and shooting deals back and forth.  These are lives of Americans, and as long as it takes, we will fight to  the end to stop the demolition of the Affordable Care Act, which most  Americans, over 50 percent, want the Affordable Care Act.   Stop the foolishness.                            ____________________
