 Madam Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart  to remember and honor Dwight Emanuelson of Hilton Head, South Carolina,  who sadly passed recently at the age of 88.   Dwight had an impactful career serving his community. After  graduating from Cornell University, he began a lifelong career as a  successful broker that brought him to Savannah, Georgia. Although  Dwight worked in the financial services industry for over 60 years, his  passion for life and love for his family is what defined him.   Dwight also had a lifelong passion for art, which he shared  generously with the Telfair Museum of Art in Savannah.   When Dwight wasn't admiring artwork, he was enjoying the outdoors  with his children and grandchildren. Dwight's dedication to improving  the lives of others will never be forgotten.   I am proud to rise today to honor Dwight and his lifetime of service  to Georgia's First Congressional District. My thoughts and prayers are  with his family, friends, and all who knew him during this most  difficult time.                            ____________________
