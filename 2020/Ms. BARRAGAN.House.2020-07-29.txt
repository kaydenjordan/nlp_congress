 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman DeFazio for working in a  bipartisan manner, and subcommittee Chairwoman Napolitano, to make sure  this bill got through on a bipartisan basis.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud that two policy changes that I led the fight  for have been included in this legislation. Flooding disproportionately  impacts low-economic communities and people of color.   Mr. Speaker, 18 months ago, a severe storm in my district flooded the  streets of Compton and shut down parts of the 710 freeway. Many  communities lack the money to pay for studies to plan and develop  projects that can reduce damage from flooding and storms. As part of a  new program funded by this bill, the Federal Government will now cover  100 percent of the cost of these studies for a select number of  disadvantaged communities.   This bill also makes it less costly for communities to restore nature  in ways that will reduce the risk of flooding and help provide cleaner  air and water.   For example, it will be easier to restore areas where water covers  the soil, known as wetlands, such as the Dominguez Gap Wetlands along  the Los Angeles River. Or we can more easily afford planting street  trees and trees in local parks to absorb flood water, cool the  community, and clean the air.   In short, this bill will make our communities stronger, built to  last, and better prepared for the future.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the Water Resources Development  Act of 2020.
