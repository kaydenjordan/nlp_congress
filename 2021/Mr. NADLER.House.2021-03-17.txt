 Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 233, I call  up the joint resolution (H.J. Res. 17) removing the deadline for the  ratification of the equal rights amendment, and ask for its immediate  consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the joint resolution.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and insert extraneous material on H.J. Res. 17.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself 3 minutes.   Madam Speaker, H.J. Res. 17 is long-overdue legislation to ensure  that the equal rights amendment can finally become the 28th Amendment  to the United States Constitution. The House passed identical  legislation last Congress on a bipartisan basis, and I hope it will do  so again today.   Madam Speaker, in 1923, Alice Paul first introduced an amendment to  the Constitution to guarantee full equal protection for women. The text  of the amendment is simple and clear: ``Equality of rights under the  law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any  State on account of sex.''   That amendment passed with overwhelming bipartisan majorities in the  House and Senate in 1972.   Unfortunately, it fell just short of being ratified by the requisite  number of States before the arbitrary deadline imposed by Congress ran  out in 1982. In the 40 years since, we have made great strides in this  country to ensure equality. Women have secured the right to vote,  protection against workplace discrimination, and through case law  decided under the 14th Amendment, many other critical protections  denied them for too long on the basis of sex.   Without the ERA, millions of women have still had to march in support  of their rights, their healthcare, their reproductive freedom and  abortion access, and their dignity as equal citizens. Through the Me  Too movement, we have had long-overdue, and sometimes painful,  conversations about the violence and harassment that women and others  experience--whether in the workplace, at homes, or in schools and  universities.   But still, to this day, the Constitution does not explicitly  recognize and guarantee that no one can be denied equal protection of  the laws on the basis of sex. The ERA would enshrine those principles  and take the final, critical step of ensuring that laws disadvantaging  women and gender minorities are subject to the most rigorous form of  scrutiny.   Last year, Virginia became the 38th and last necessary State to  ratify the ERA, and, today, in passing H.J. Res. 17, we will be one  step closer to enshrining it into law. This resolution removes a  previous deadline Congress set in the amendment's proposing clause for  ratifying the ERA, and will, therefore, ensure that recent  ratifications by Nevada, Illinois, and Virginia are given full effect.   We are on the brink of making history, and no deadline should stand  in the way. The Constitution itself places no deadlines on the process  for ratifying amendments. Congress, just as clearly, has the authority  to extend or remove any deadlines that it previously chose to set in  the first place.   The recent ruling by the United States District Court for the  District of Columbia refusing to recognize the recent State  ratifications makes it even more imperative that Congress act now in  removing this deadline. We must make it absolutely clear that Congress  does not want language put in the proposing clause of a resolution 40  years ago to stand in the way of full equality now.   Madam Speaker, I thank Representative Speier for introducing this  resolution, which takes that important step. This resolution will  ensure, at long last, that the equal rights amendment can take its  rightful place as part of our Nation's Constitution.   Madam Speaker, I urge all Members to support it, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, the gentlewoman errs, the deadline for  ratification is not part of the amendment, it is part of the resolution  proposing the amendment. And if Congress can propose a deadline, it can  revoke that proposal since it is not part of the amendment at all.   Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from California  (Ms. Speier).    Madam Speaker, I am glad the gentleman recognizes that  equality includes the right of each woman and man to make their own  decision about their reproductive choices. There can be no equality of  the sexes when one class of people is denied the ability to control  their own bodies.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentlewoman from  Georgia (Mrs. McBath).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Cohen).    Madam Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to the  gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Cohen) that he may control that time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Chu).    Madam Speaker, every amendment since the 22nd, except for  the 27th, has had a deadline for ratification inserted in the  resolution. But if you look at the Constitution, Madam Speaker, you  won't find the deadline. That is because the deadline is part of the  congressional resolution proposing the amendment, not part of the  amendment itself.   What Congress can propose, Congress can alter, which is all we are  proposing to do today.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Pelosi).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Georgia  (Mrs. McBath) to control the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Garcia).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Massachusetts (Mrs. Trahan).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Michigan (Mrs. Lawrence).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro).    Madam Speaker, we are prepared to close.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, Alice Paul's equal rights amendment was introduced in  both Houses of Congress way back in 1923. But 96 years later, the  United States Constitution still does not explicitly declare that women  have equal rights under the law.   We are the only western democracy without such a clause in its  Constitution. Today, we have an opportunity to rectify that glaring  omission.   The arbitrary deadline for ratification that Congress imposed, and  later extended, can be just as easily removed, and that is all this  legislation does. It can be just as easily removed, because it is not  part of the amendment, as some of our Republican friends said.   Every amendment since the 22nd Amendment, except for the 27th, has  had such a clause. And if you look at the text of the Constitution, it  is not there. That is because the deadline is part of the resolution  proposing the constitutional amendment, not part of the constitutional  amendment. If Congress can establish a deadline by resolution, it can  certainly, by resolution, extend or change the deadline. That is all  this resolution does.   Adopting the ERA would bring our country closer to truly fulfilling  values of inclusion and equal opportunity for all people. Adopting this  legislation would help make this a reality.   I urge all Members to support this resolution.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms.  Jackson Lee).   (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to revise and extend  her remarks.)    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 233, I call  up the bill (H.R. 1620) to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act  of 1994, and for other purposes, and ask for its immediate  consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and insert extraneous material on H.R. 1620.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself 3 minutes.   Madam Speaker, the Violence Against Women Act, or VAWA, was signed  into law in 1994 to help ensure that women in America are free from  violence and free from fear. At the time that VAWA was enacted, it was  all too common for violent crimes against women to go without  appropriate response and to remain unaddressed by the criminal justice  system.   But through programs implemented under VAWA, Congress began to help  provide communities in America the assistance they need to combat the  crimes of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and  stalking.   Building on this success, H.R. 1620 is bipartisan legislation that  reauthorizes and strengthens the Violence Against Women Act so that it  can continue delivering vital services to those in need.   VAWA, which is not gender-exclusive, addresses the needs of men and  women, children, persons with disabilities, homeless persons, and LGBTQ  individuals, among others.   This reauthorization would also increase access to grant programs for  [[Page H1457]]  culturally specific organizations and ensure that such organizations  are included in the development and implementation of service,  education, training, and other grants. The range of individuals VAWA  helps is broad and should be as diverse as our communities around the  country. I am pleased that this reauthorization continues our  commitment to this principle.   VAWA has had, and continues to have, a positive impact on people who  rely on its assistance, whether directly or indirectly.   Through grants to State and local governments, the Office on Violence  Against Women in the Department of Justice funds the work of thousands  of advocates in preventing and addressing domestic violence, dating  violence, sexual assault and stalking, and in assisting and training  law enforcement and victim advocates.   In addition, grants administered through the Department of Health and  Human Services provide funds for shelters, rape prevention and  education, programs to address and reduce the sexual abuse of runaway  and homeless youth, and programs to educate the community on domestic  violence. The reach of the work carried out under VAWA is vast, and we  must continue to support it.   This legislation expands services for older survivors of abuse and  for programs targeting rural areas. It also expands the jurisdiction of  some Tribal authorities over non-Indians who commit certain crimes on  Tribal lands to ensure that they are held accountable.   Like the legislation the House passed last Congress, it also includes  provisions protecting transgender individuals, and it bans individuals  convicted of domestic abuse from purchasing firearms.   The Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act is comprehensive and  inclusive legislation that I hope will earn further bipartisan support  in the long tradition of this vital law.   I want to thank the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), the  chair of the Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Security Subcommittee and  the sponsor of this legislation, and the gentleman from Pennsylvania  (Mr. Fitzpatrick) for their outstanding leadership in the effort to  reauthorize VAWA.   I also want to thank the advocates, many of whom are survivors  themselves, for the countless hours they have put into improving this  legislation.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself an additional 15 seconds.   Their efforts, and those of many other Members, have produced this  important bill that will not only continue the progress enabled by VAWA  as originally enacted but will also make the act an even more effective  tool in addressing the horrible scourge of domestic violence.   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I reserve the  balance of my time.                                          House of Representatives,                                Committee on Education and Labor,                                     Washington, DC, March 10, 2021.      Hon. Jerrold Nadler,      Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Nadler: I write concerning H.R. 1620, the       Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2021. This bill       was primarily referred to the Committee on the Judiciary, and       additionally to the Committee on Education and Labor and       other committees. As a result of Leadership and the Committee       on the Judiciary having consulted with me concerning this       bill generally, I agree to forgo formal consideration of the       bill so the bill may proceed expeditiously to the House       floor.        The Committee on Education and Labor takes this action with       our mutual understanding that by forgoing formal       consideration of H.R. 1620, we do not waive any jurisdiction       over the subject matter contained in this or similar       legislation, and we will be appropriately consulted and       involved as the bill or similar legislation moves forward so       we may address any remaining issues within our Rule X       jurisdiction. I also request that you support my request to       name members of the Committee on Education and Labor to any       conference committee to consider such provisions.        Finally, I would appreciate a response confirming this       understanding and ask that a copy of our exchange of letters       on this matter be included in the Congressional Record during       floor consideration of H.R. 1620.            Very truly yours,                                         Robert C. ``Bobby'' Scott,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                      Committee on the Judiciary,                                     Washington, DC, March 15, 2021.        Dear Chairman Scott: I am in receipt of your March 10,       2021, letter regarding H.R. 1620, the ``Violence Against       Women Reauthorization Act of 2021.''        I appreciate your willingness to work cooperatively on this       legislation. I recognize that the bill contains provisions       that fall within the jurisdiction of the Committee on       Education and Labor. I acknowledge that your Committee will       not formally consider H.R. 1620 and agree that the inaction       of your Committee with respect to the bill does not waive any       future jurisdictional claim over the matters contained in       H.R. 1620 which fall within your Committee's Rule X       jurisdiction.        I will ensure that our exchange of letters is included in       the Congressional Record during floor consideration of the       bill. I appreciate your cooperation regarding this       legislation and look forward to continuing to work with you       as this measure moves through the legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                    Jerrold Nadler,                                                          Chairman.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. Scanlon).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Georgia (Mrs. McBath).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Massachusetts (Ms. Clark).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Escobar).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Speier).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Lois Frankel).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Texas (Mrs. Fletcher).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from New York (Mr. Bowman).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. Lawrence).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Green).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from New York (Mr. Espaillat).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. Strickland).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Doggett).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  Speaker of the House (Ms. Pelosi).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz).    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, every year approximately 7.9 million women  are victims of rape, physical violence, or stalking by an intimate  partner. An average of three women are killed every day by a current or  former intimate partner. These grim statistics underscore the crucial  need for us to act without delay to reauthorize VAWA, and to enhance  and expand the Act so that it is even more effective.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join with me in voting for  this critical bipartisan legislation today, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 233, I offer  amendments en bloc.    Madam Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Crist).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Phillips).    Madam Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentlewoman from  New Mexico (Ms. Leger Fernandez).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Madam Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman from Texas an  additional 1 minute.    Madam Speaker, may I ask how much time remains.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands (Ms. Plaskett).    Madam Speaker, the en bloc amendment includes a number of  very important amendments that make significant improvements to the  bill. I appreciate all the Members who contributed to this en bloc  amendment from both sides of the aisle, and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Madam Speaker, I claim the time in opposition to this  amendment.    Madam Speaker, I rise in reluctant opposition to this  amendment.   While I believe it is well-intentioned, and we all want to prevent  the misuse of Federal funds, I am concerned about the effect that it  may have on small service providers that provide crucial services to  victims and survivors.   It is also unnecessary since the underlying bill maintains existing  accountability measures, which have proven to work very well.   This amendment imposes a mandatory bar on receiving grant funds up to  5 years if the grant recipient is found to have fraudulently misused  such grant funds. Smaller providers, many of whom are run on a  voluntary basis, are more likely to make financial errors because they  lack the accounting, financial, and compliance expertise that larger  organizations have.   Many of these small providers are culturally specific, rural, and  Tribal programs that play a crucial role in their communities. Banning  such groups from receiving funding for 5 years in these circumstances  could have an unnecessarily punitive effect and could be detrimental to  the victims and survivors who rely on them.   For many small service providers who rely on Federal funds to support  their operations, such a severe penalty, or even the threat of one,  could make a difference between continuing to serve victims and  survivors in need and shutting their doors forever.   Accountability is vital in all forms, and I appreciate the spirit  behind this amendment; but, for these providers, I fear it could end up  doing more harm than good. It is because of these concerns that this  amendment is opposed by the National Network to End Domestic Violence,  among other organizations, and I must reluctantly oppose the amendment  as well.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1300     Madam Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to the  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 233, the previous  question is ordered on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from  Missouri (Mrs. Wagner).   The question is on the amendment.   The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the noes appear to have it.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that, in the  engrossment of H.R. 1620, the Clerk be authorized to correct section  numbers, punctuation, spelling, and cross-references, and to make such  other technical and conforming changes as may be necessary to reflect  the actions of the House.
