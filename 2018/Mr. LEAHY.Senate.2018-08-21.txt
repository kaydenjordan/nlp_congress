 Mr. President, I just wanted to applaud what the Senator  from Missouri just said. He has had a lot of experience in the other  body and here in the Senate. He and I have been here since a time when  we actually voted on these bills and got them done.   I note that he has been a tremendous help in getting us this far. For  Senator Murray, because of a very necessary absence, I will manage her  part of this bill when it is up. She has worked very hard on it. As the  Senator from Missouri just said, regarding the vote we had in the  Appropriations Committee, keep in mind that appropriations goes across  the political spectrum of both parties, and we reported this bill out  of the committee with broad bipartisan support. I commend Senator  Shelby too.   We are opposed to authorizing legislation on the right or the left,  unless there is total agreement with everybody, because we want to get  these bills done. We still have to go to conference with the House when  they come back in a few weeks. We want to have a solid vote here.   So I thank the Senator from Missouri for the work he has done. We are  getting somewhere, and as someone who has been here for a long time, I  am rather happy to see that.   I yield the floor.   I thank the Senator for yielding.
