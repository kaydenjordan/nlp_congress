 Madam President, in downtown Atlanta at the corner of  Auburn Avenue and Jesse Hill Jr Drive, there is a 65-foot mural of  Congressman John Lewis with the lone caption: ``Hero.''   I personally got to see it yesterday from the Downtown Connector, the  major interstate that runs through the heart of Atlanta, as I drove to  Hartsfield-Jackson airport. I was struck by the void left by his  passing, not only in Georgia, but across our entire country.   When parents teach their children about courage and the fight for  freedom and equality, the story of Congressman John Lewis will be told.  He dedicated his entire life to pushing America to live up to its  promises. He championed nonviolent protests. He stood for community,  justice, and love.   Congressman Lewis's story has inspired millions. At just 18, he wrote  to Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., when he sought to attend the all-White  Troy State University. He went on to become a leader in the civil  rights movement. He organized sit-ins at segregated lunch counters in  Nashville. He was on the buses during the 1961 Freedom Rides. He was  the youngest speaker at the 1963 March on Washington. He was brutally  beaten while leading peaceful demonstrators across the Edmund Pettus  Bridge in Selma, AL.   For the last 33 years, he served Georgia in the U.S. House of  Representatives, where he was known as ``the conscience of Congress.''  He was also known for his many bipartisan friendships. One of them was  with my predecessor, Senator Johnny Isakson, a true statesman. They  shared a powerful moment last year on the House floor when Congressman  Lewis embraced him during farewell speeches to the Senator, one of the  most touching moments in Congress's recent history.   Sadly, Congressman Lewis was not the only civil rights icon we lost  last week. Georgia also lost Reverend C.T. Vivian. Both he and  Congressman Lewis were champions of peaceful, nonviolent protest. I  hope we can honor their legacy by using nonviolent means as we strive  toward equality and a more perfect union.   Georgians cannot think of our beloved State without thinking of these  and so many other civil rights icons and leaders like Dr. Martin Luther  King, Jr. Our Nation is better because of their leadership and their  courage. Their legacy will never be forgotten.   May God comfort the Lewis and Vivian families during this incredibly  difficult time.   (The remarks of Mrs. LOEFFLER pertaining to the introduction of S.  4238 are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced  Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')    I yield the floor.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Senate proceed to legislative session for a period of morning business  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, this spring, 14-year-old Janina  Valenzuela was riding a bike with a friend in Marietta, GA, when she  was killed as part of an initiation into an MS-13 gang. In 2016,  Christopher Dean was brutally murdered by gang members in Atlanta. The  D.A. called it ``the most horrific death'' in recent history. His  murder left two children without a father. In 2010, 11-year-old  Nicholas Sheffey was shot and killed sleeping in his bed during a  drive-by shooting in Chamblee, GA. These are just three of the too many  lives that have been lost, tragically cut short due to senseless gang  violence.   In Georgia, there are over 71,000 known gang members representing a  variety of gangs, including the Ghostface Gangsters, an all-White gang  in Georgia; the Gangster Disciples, which formed in Chicago and quickly  spread to Georgia; and the Aryan Brotherhood, a White supremacy gang.   Nationwide, there are more than 1.4 million members and 33,000 gangs  across the U.S. According to the most recent National Gang Report, half  of law enforcement officials reported that gang-related violence has  increased in each of their jurisdictions. Thankfully, President Trump  and Georgia leaders have taken strong action to address the rising tide  of gang violence and to end the cycles of violence that they cause.   For the first time ever, the Department of Justice has brought  terrorism charges against a member of the MS-13 gang, taking action  against their leader and 21 other gang members.   Under the leadership of Georgia Governor Brian Kemp and Attorney  General Chris Carr, my home State of Georgia has led the way on  confronting gang violence, passing legislation that gives prosecutors  the tools they need to disrupt and dismantle these terrible gang  networks.   Today, I am introducing the Cracking Down on Gangs and Deporting  Criminals Act to apply Georgia's anti-gang, pro-community measures  across our country. This legislation, based on the Georgia law that  Attorney General Carr has called ``one of the strongest statutes in the  Nation,'' aims to deter and punish criminals who set out to destroy  lives and communities. This includes violent crimes like the murders of  Janina, Christopher, and Nicholas.   In addition to violence, gangs run elaborate drug operations. One  recent bust in Pickens County last month resulted in the arrest of  nearly 50 individuals. Law enforcement confiscated nearly $2 million  worth of methamphetamine from a drug ring run by three gangs.   They deal in the abhorrent world of human trafficking. A study in San  Diego County found that an astounding 85 percent of those involved in  human trafficking were actively involved in gangs.   Current Federal gang statute has three strict criteria that are  difficult for prosecutors to meet in order to hold someone accountable  for their participation in a street gang. The legislation I am  introducing today will make it easier for Federal prosecutors to seek  harsh sentences for gang activity. It will facilitate the removal of  criminal gang members who are in our country illegally, and it would  create a national gang database, making it easier to eradicate these  gang networks.   We need to take action now to take violent gang members off of our  streets. Across the country, violence is skyrocketing in our cities,  while radicals call to defund and abolish the police. The troubling  decline in support for law enforcement, coupled with the effects of the  pandemic and recent unrest, threatens the further spread of gang  violence across communities in America.   The Cracking Down on Gangs and Deporting Criminals Act will help keep  our communities safe and support law enforcement in their work to root  out gang activity. No family should have to go through what Janina,  Christopher, and Nicholas did. Parents should be able to send their  children outdoors and off to school without worrying that they won't  make it home, and children shouldn't fear that their parents won't  return home. It is time that we hold gang members accountable for their  vile and evil actions and keep the American public safe                                  ______                                         By Mr. DURBIN:   S. 4242.
