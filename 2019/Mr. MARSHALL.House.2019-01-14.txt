 Mr. Speaker, it is always good to go back home, and  this weekend was especially rewarding for me. My wife and I left D.C.  this past Friday afternoon, flew through Dallas, and landed in Wichita  sometime shortly after sunset.   As we hopped in my truck, the snow had started to fall, and it was a  beautiful Kansas evening. We got home and got to see our two boys. I  woke up the next morning early, went to Sterling, Kansas, for a  business meeting, then went over to Salina and got to meet some more of  my friends.   On the way home, I got to listen to the radio. I listened to a Kansas  State Wildcats basketball game and heard the Wildcats win that game by  1 point. And then when I got home, a special treat: I got to watch both  the Kansas University basketball team win and watch my Kansas City  Chiefs win. And I got to watch those games with my two boys. So it was  a trifecta for Kansas, a great day.   The next morning, I woke up early for church and went to early  service, and basically had to hop in my truck and come back to D.C.  that same afternoon.   On the way back to the airport, I got a little bit of time to  reflect; and one of the things that had come to mind was something that  my good friend, my mentor, the former majority leader, one of the  longest serving majority leaders in the Senate, Senator Bob Dole, had  told me.   One thing Senator Dole says every time I see him is to always  remember where I am from. And I think I get that. I think most of us  get it, that where we are from is so very important to us, and I have  always done a good job with that.   But the other thing that he talked about--I approached him one time  when we were having a tough issue here in Congress, one of the first  issues I had to vote on. What he told me, rather than giving me an  answer, giving me his opinion, was to go back to Kansas, and the people  of Kansas would tell me what to do.   So what is ironic as I went back home for these meetings and to go to  church is that, everywhere I went, I heard the same thing. I heard the  same thing from people in church that I had no idea that they knew so  much about what was going on in Washington.   In Salina, in Sterling, everywhere I went, people asked me: When is  Congress going to give the President his money to build the border?--a  very simple question. So that allowed me to kind of ponder the issue a  little bit more.   I have stood beside the President since day one on this issue. When I  was running for Congress, I made national security, border security the  top priority on what I was going to stand for; and today, I have been  to that border.   As a physician of 25 years and now a Congressman for 2 years, I would  tell you this: There is, indeed, a humanitarian crisis on the border as  well as a national security issue on the border. Whether it is  concerning the 2,000 people who come across that border illegally every  day--every night we house some 40,000 people. We give them a bed. We  feed them. Every day, two tons of illegal drugs come across our  borders.   Mr. Speaker, that sounds like a humanitarian crisis to me and sounds  like a national security crisis to me. People then often ask me:  ``Well, why don't we compromise?''   And I will tell you this. I feel like we have compromised already.  The President, myself, most Republicans, we asked for $25 billion to  secure those borders and to provide humanitarian help for people.   We thought we probably needed to build 1,000, maybe 1,500 miles of  border. We compromised from those numbers back to asking for just $5.7  billion, and now we are asking for moneys to build about 234 miles of  not a wall, but a barrier, a fence.   I think that that is compromise. And, Mr. Speaker, I would ask that  you come back to the table now and negotiate in good faith.   Mr. Speaker, people often talk that this has to be an either/or  opportunity, that we either have to have border security or show  compassion.   We can do both. America can do both. We can have border security, we  can  [[Page H522]]  provide for the humanitarian needs of people, and we can come up with a  compassionate, long-term immigration process.   This system needs to be totally overhauled. I am all in. We have had  several great bills that we have tried to get through.   So, Mr. Speaker, please come back to the table. Let's open up the  government, and let's secure our borders.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to  support H.R. 190, the Expanding Contracting Opportunities for Small  Businesses Act of 2019.   Small business sole source contracting can be a valuable tool for  both Federal agencies and small businesses. However, our Federal  procurement processes are rapidly changing, and the sole source  authority provided by the Small Business Act has not kept up with these  changes. By adjusting the dollar amount thresholds for these contracts,  this bill will increase the opportunities available to certain small  businesses utilizing the Federal procurement process.   While it is critical that agencies maximize opportunities to small  businesses, it is equally important that they have clear guidelines to  guarantee only eligible and qualified firms receive the awards. This  bill will apply new oversight procedure that requires agencies to  coordinate with the SBA to ensure only eligible candidates are awarded  a sole source contract.   I am proud of this legislation and its mission to promote small  business growth, strengthen oversight, and incentivize Federal agencies  to work with small businesses.   Mr. Speaker, I also want to thank my colleague Congressman Schneider  for teaming up with us on this bill, and I encourage my colleagues to  support this bipartisan bill as well.
