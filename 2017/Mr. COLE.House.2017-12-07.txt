 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman, and I thank the  gentleman for yielding time to me.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to urge support for H.J. Res. 123, the short-term  continuing resolution.   I want to begin my remarks by, frankly, congratulating the chairman.  It is his leadership, and my good friend on the other side, they have  put together the bill in April that actually is funding the government  today. A majority of Democrats voted for that in the House and the  Senate. A majority of Republicans voted for it. The President signed  it.   Under the chairman's leadership, all 12 bills passed well before the  deadline that fund the government of September 30. He has been prepared  to negotiate for 80 days. He hasn't been sitting around in those 80  days. He also passed two disaster relief bills and is working on a  third one right now. I think you probably have the hardest working  chairman and committee in Congress. The rest of the government, the  Senate  [[Page H9737]]  in particular, needs to catch up with us.   Now, to their credit, they are actually sitting down with the  President today, and we are beginning to see some progress. We need  this additional time to allow us to fund the government.   To my friends who oppose it, what is your alternative? Shutting down  the government? I know they don't want to do that. They have always  argued against it. I have always thought they were right when they  argued against it, but if we follow their advice and reject this  amendment, the government will shut down on Friday. That doesn't do any  American any good.   Mr. Speaker, the chairman has offered the responsible alternative  here. I urge its passage.
