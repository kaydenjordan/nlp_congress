 Madam Speaker, I rise today in disappointed support of a  second continuing resolution, but let's remember, every continuing  resolution reflects a failure to govern.   House Democrats did our job and passed government funding bills, all  of them, to create good-paying jobs to support the hardworking middle  class and protect our national security.   In September, we voted on a bipartisan basis to extend government  funding through December 3 to allow negotiations to finalize  legislation. Since then, my colleagues across the aisle have refused to  seriously negotiate with us on funding.   That leads us to where we are now, considering another new short-term  CR right before the holiday break, when we should have already  completed our work.   The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over  again and expecting a different result. Sure enough, here we are again,  having to pass another short-term CR because we can't pass funding  bills in a regular manner.   There is more than enough time in a year to come to an agreement and  pass funding bills. America's friends and enemies around the world are  watching us to see if our country can continue to function in a  changing world. We must show them we can, but this effort requires  compromise, as it always has.   I ask them to join us for a bipartisan, bicameral negotiation to  resolve our differences and keep government working for the people.
