Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous material on H.R. 3017.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Illinois?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3017, the Brownfields  Enhancement, Economic Redevelopment, and Reauthorization Act of 2017.  This legislation has broad bipartisan support, and I would like to  thank Chairman Walden and Ranking Members Pallone and Tonko.   I would also like to specifically thank a few of my colleagues who  have exhibited leadership and commitment on this issue, Congressman  David McKinley, my fellow Energy and Commerce Committee member, who  introduced this important bill, and my colleagues on the Transportation  and Infrastructure Committee, Congressman John Katko and Congresswoman  Elizabeth Esty who guided a similar bill through their committee.   We have been working closely with our colleagues on the  Transportation and Infrastructure Committee over these past few months,  and the bill that we will vote on today reflects compromise on both  sides.   The bill takes a very important step in reauthorizing the  Environmental Protection Agency's brownfields program for the first  time since the law was enacted, and so I would like to also thank  Chairman Shuster for his leadership and support as we move forward.   The bill we are voting on today makes several important changes to  the brownfields law that will result in more contaminated sites being  cleaned up and returned to productive use, such as the creation of  multipurpose grants, which will allow communities to use grant funds  for both assessment and remediation, as well as allow communities to  clean up more than one site in a designated area.   The bill also provides liability relief to States and municipalities  who voluntarily acquire brownfields property through their authority as  a sovereign, which will allow local units of government to address  contamination on property they acquire through tax delinquency,  bankruptcy, and/or abandonment.   The bill expands grant eligibility for nonprofit organizations and  for publicly owned brownfields sites that acquired the property prior  to January 11, 2002, which will put more parties into the mix of  persons eligible for grant funding, which will result in more sites  being assessed and cleaned up.   The legislation increases the limit for remediation grants from  $200,000 to $500,000. As we learned from witnesses at our hearings,  this will result in more brownfields sites being cleaned up because  many of the sites that remain to be addressed are more complicated and,  therefore, more expensive.   The bill provides for a limited amount of grant funds to be used for  administrative costs, which will allow small and rural communities to  be able to receive and utilize grant funds, and it carves out grant  money to assist Indian Tribes in small, rural, and disadvantaged  communities as they work to assess and clean up contaminated  properties.   The EPA brownfields program is critical to States and local  communities as they address contaminated industrial and commercial  properties and return them to productive use. Cleaning up these sites  is great for the economy because brownfields grants can be directly  leveraged into jobs, additional redevelopment funds, and increased  residential and commercial property values.   In fact, the brownfields program, on average, leverages over $16 in  private investment for every Federal dollar spent and leverages 8\1/2\  jobs for every $100,000 of brownfields funds expended on assessment and  cleanup.   The brownfields program is a proven results-driven program that has  changed the way contaminated property is perceived, addressed, and  managed. A visible, national example of the brownfields program at work  was the Houston Astros and the Los Angeles Dodgers facing off in game  three of the World Series at Minute Maid Park in Houston, Texas. Minute  Maid Park sits on a former brownfields site that the city of Houston  redeveloped and obviously returned to a very productive reuse,  especially for the Astros.   The EPA brownfields program is uniquely positioned to protect the  environment and spur the economy. You can tell, from the broad  bipartisan support that H.R. 3017 enjoys, the support for the EPA  brownfields program is unqualified. The program has strong support from  local and State governments, private developers, and all sectors of the  economy.   Because brownfields funding is so important to States and local  communities across the country, I want to encourage my colleagues on  the appropriations committee to fully fund this important and  successful program.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support the bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.

Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  West Virginia (Mr. McKinley), the author of this legislation.   Mr. McKINLEY. Mr. Speaker, I, too, rise today in strong support of  H.R. 3017, the Brownfields Enhancement, Economic Redevelopment, and  Reauthorization Act, and I am pleased to be a sponsor of this  bipartisan effort along with my colleagues, Chairman Walden, especially  Chairman Shimkus, and Ranking Members Pallone and Tonko for their work.  I also want to thank the work of my colleagues on the Transportation  and Infrastructure Committee who also were cosponsors of this  legislation, Mr. Katko and Ms. Esty.   The bill represents a broad, bipartisan compromise that will  reauthorize the brownfields program for the first time since 2006. In  addition to the reauthorization, the bill makes several key  improvements that you have heard about here today that will result in  more brownfield sites being cleaned up and returned to productive use.   A little history can explain why this bill was so important to pass.   When America's industrial manufacturing facilities and factories were  being constructed, they typically were located on prime property along  rivers, railroads, and roads. But, over the years, technologically  there were  [[Page H9543]]  changes that took place that transformed how our economy operates. It  also had to deal with unfair imports coming into America. As a result,  many companies failed and the sites became abandoned.   Rusting hulks of former factories and weed-infested sites have become  an eyesore and deter investment in downtown and urban areas. Today,  these locations could still prove to be valuable in creating jobs, and  that is what our prime responsibility is here. We need to improve this  negative stigma that these sites pose to communities and restore these  brownfields into productive resources.   America has, indeed, been identified as having 450,000 brownfield  sites across the country, but only 27,000 have been cleaned up. This  reauthorization is long overdue.   One great success story is Pietro Fiorentini, a supplier to the  natural gas industry who recently broke ground at a new manufacturing  facility in Weirton, West Virginia, that was cleaned up through the  brownfields program. Pietro Fiorentini spent 5 years preparing this  site because of the level of contamination.   I especially want to give a shout-out to Pat Ford, the executive  director of the Business Development Corporation in the northern  panhandle. His efforts have been tireless, working to do great things  like creating jobs in the First District of West Virginia.   His corporation, the Business Development Corporation, has already  received $2.5 million over the years in brownfields grants and has  leveraged those projects into $75 million in private sector money. It  has resulted in over 1,250 new jobs, and another 128 have been  preserved.   You heard earlier from Chairman Shimkus, talking about the 16-to-1  ratio. Pat Ford's group has a 35-to-1 ratio. For every dollar that we  put in for the Federal Government, Pat Ford's group has created $35 of  investment.   In the future, as businesses develop the Appalachian ethane storage  hub that is under way now in the Appalachian area, these newly  reclaimed properties will allow for even more industries and create  more jobs throughout this area.   This bipartisan bill makes very important classifications to CERCLA  liability and petroleum sites. It expands eligibility for nonprofit  organizations. It, indeed, increases the limit for remediation grants  from $200,000 to $500,000. It creates the multipurpose grants. But,  more importantly, it makes it easier for small, rural, or disadvantaged  communities to participate in this program.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage all of my colleagues on the Appropriations  Committee, however, to fully fund this vitally important brownfields  program. Although $250 million is authorized, the appropriators have  only allocated $153 million to this program. Consequently,  revitalization of these former abandoned sites is delayed, and they  remain a stigma, deterring development in our downtown communities.   Overall, this bipartisan bill--and I thank my friends on the other  side of the aisle for how we are all working together on this--will  make great strides toward achieving the goals of getting more  contaminated sites cleaned up, promoting infrastructure, and,  importantly, creating jobs.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``yes.''    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Walberg).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Walberg).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Lance), a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Katko), a cosponsor of the legislation and also a major  leader on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Ohio (Mr. Gibbs), who is a member of the Transportation and  Infrastructure Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Faso), a member of the Transportation and Infrastructure  Committee.   (Mr. FASO asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Will the gentleman yield?    Will the gentleman yield?    Will the gentleman yield?    Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Speaker, the bill we are voting on today makes  several important changes to the brownfields law that will result in  more contaminated sites being cleaned up.   The changes we are making also bring more parties into the process by  clarifying their eligibility to receive funding under the brownfields  program, including making nonprofit entities eligible to receive all  forms of brownfields funding.   Unfortunately, the Environmental Protection Agency provided us  technical assistance a week ago, telling us that the definition we used  for how to delineate which nonprofit organizations should be included  was too limited, and would exclude a number of important organizations  that the EPA currently provides funding to through the brownfields  program, including the Association of State and Territorial Solid Waste  Management Officials, commonly known as ASTSWMO, and other entities  organized under section 501(c)(6) of the Internal Revenue Code that are  involved in the cleanup of brownfields sites around the country.   We need to address this issue as this process moves forward. We need  to figure out how to ensure that these organizations do not lose the  funding that they rely on to make significant contributions to the  brownfields program.   Does the gentleman agree?    I thank the gentleman for his courtesies.    I thank the gentleman for his courtesies.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Maine (Mr. Poliquin).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I am just going to sum up, too, with thanking my ranking member of  the full committee, Mr. Pallone; obviously, my ranking member on the  subcommittee, Mr. Tonko; the associated staffs on both that had been  mentioned numerous times. They did a lot of work in this process. It  was good to get to know the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee  a little bit better, and we look forward to working with them more.                                time  1515     I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey.    Mr. Speaker, I am happy to yield the time to the  gentleman. They tell me what to do sometimes, also, even on that side  of the  [[Page H9547]]  aisle; so, happy to yield. I just want to thank them.   Mr. Speaker, everybody has examples of brownfields in their district  throughout the State. They are all pretty good stories about returning  them to productive use.   I have one produced by the EPA from Danville, Illinois. There are  eight sites. We can go through them.   The point is, here is a successful program that we have authorized.  Our appropriators helped appropriate money that really leverages a  little bit of Federal dollars with private or local community dollars  to bring these locations back to productive use. It is a good effort.   Mr. Speaker, we have got other things on the horizon to work together  on. I enjoyed the opportunity to do that.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues, I ask them to vote yes on the  bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.   Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3017,  the Brownfields Enhancement, Economic Redevelopment, and  Reauthorization Act.   This legislation will strengthen the Brownfields Program, an  important program created by Congress and the U.S. Environmental  Protection Agency in 2002 that assists communities with the cleanup of  brownfields sites and encourages economic redevelopment.   The EPA has estimated that there are 450,000 brownfield sites  nationwide. Through the lifetime of the program, nearly 64,000 acres  have been revitalized. Every federal dollar spent on rehabilitating  brownfields leverages over $16 on average. To date, the Brownfields  Program has leveraged nearly $24 billion and created over 124,000 jobs  across the United States.   Houston is home to one of the country's best known brownfields  success stories, Minute Maid Park, home of the World Series Champion  Houston Astros. Minute Maid Park was built on a former 38-acre  brownfield site in Downtown Houston.   Our district, which is home to dozens of abandoned and former  industrial sites in need of environmental cleanup and redevelopment,  needs to see the expansion of the Brownfields Program so we can have  more success stories like Minute Maid Park.   I hope that appropriators will fully fund the Brownfields Program at  the authorized levels set in this bill, including $200 million annually  for grants to assess and clean up brownfields properties and $50  million annually for grants to assist states and Indian tribes  establish and enhance their own cleanup programs. We have seen funding  for Brownfields drop steadily in recent years, which has impacted local  communities' ability to assess and clean up sites in Texas and around  the country.   This legislation received strong bipartisan support in the Energy and  Commerce Committee and passed by voice vote.   I ask all of my colleagues to join me and vote in support of the  Brownfields Enhancement, Economic Redevelopment, and Reauthorization  Act.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Simpson).
