 Madam Speaker, it is an honor to rise today in support  of H.R. 3245, the Restore the Harmony Way Bridge Act.   The Harmony Way Bridge is a local landmark and was an engineering  marvel when it opened in 1930. Throughout the 20th century, the bridge  connected Posey County, Indiana, and White County, Illinois, creating  an access point for commerce and recreation for Hoosiers from the New  Harmony and surrounding communities, as well as those from White  County, Illinois.   Unfortunately, in 2012, the bridge was permanently closed due to  safety concerns related to structural issues. While the community has  pushed to refurbish and reopen the bridge, until now, Federal law has  stood in the way.   That is why the Restore the Harmony Way Bridge Act is important. It  will convey the bridge to the Indiana and Illinois bridge authorities  and remove the Federal conditions set out on the bridge.   I am glad to see this bill on the floor today, and I want to give  thanks to all those who have helped in the effort. First, I thank Susie  Davis, from my staff, for her work on this bill. I thank Lora Arneberg  from the New Harmony, Indiana, community, whose hard work has been  invaluable in promoting the bridge restoration.   I also thank Indiana State Senator Jim Tomes and State Representative  Wendy McNamara for their efforts at the State level.   Furthermore, I thank my colleagues: Congressman Shimkus, Indiana  Senators Braun and Young, Illinois Senators Durbin and Duckworth, and  all the members of the Indiana and Illinois House delegations, who are  all cosponsors of this bill, for helping me lead this effort in  Congress and finally solving this problem.   The Restore the Harmony Way Bridge Act will breathe life once more  into the Harmony Way Bridge.   Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me on this monumental  occasion and support this bill.
