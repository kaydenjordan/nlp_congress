 Mr. Speaker, I agree with Mr. Sensenbrenner for the  reasons he has outlined that this bill should not become law. However,  I am also speaking in favor of the Amash amendment that has been put in  order that would fix the problems that he has so eloquently outlined.   Before 702 was enacted into law, the NSA and the FBI would need to  get a probable cause warrant to collect this information. We made a  major change that allows this information to be collected when a  foreigner is communicating with an American, and when you go to the  ``abouts'' collection, which the underlying bill would codify, even  when that doesn't occur, when there is merely discussion of a  foreigner. That is not what I think our Constitution requires. And we  did not outsource to the judicial branch or the executive branch the  decision on what the Constitution requires us to do.   Now, we have learned that there is a vast amount of information being  collected--we can't go into the details of that in an open session,  just that we have been told by Admiral Rogers the scope of this--and  that the database that is so-called incidentally collected because of  the architecture of the internet could be searched for Americans  without a warrant is not consistent with the protections outlined in  the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution.   The Amash amendment, which is basically the USA RIGHTS Act, ends  these backdoor searches by requiring a warrant. It ends reverse  targeting. It bans the ``abouts'' collection and prohibits the  collection of domestic communications, prevents the misuse of  information on Americans, and is something that we should support.   Now, in a letter to the Senate in October, a coalition of groups said  this:         The USA RIGHTS Act, which is essentially the Amash       amendment, is markedly superior to all current legislative       proposals to reauthorize section 702.    Who said that?   The American Civil Liberties Union and FreedomWorks, the NAACP, but  also the Project On Government Oversight, and Color of Change. This is  a broad, left-right coalition that has come together, even though there  are many things we disagree on, because we agree on one thing: When we  took an oath to defend the Constitution on our first day of this  session, we didn't take that oath to defend the Constitution when it is  convenient or when we feel like it. No. We took that oath to defend the  Constitution every day, in every way, and with every bill. And without  the Amash amendment, this bill falls short.   Just a note on where we are in the timing. It is true that this has  been delayed, I would say unconscionably delayed, for this proceeding.  But we have more time than has been suggested.   Under the existing act, it provides that, if there is an existing  order from the FISA court, that order remains in effect even if the  underlying bill lapses. We have an order that extends into late April.  So we have a deadline, but it is not this week and it is not next week.  We owe it to our constituents and we owe it to our obligation to the  Constitution to get this right.   When Jim Sensenbrenner, who is someone whom nobody is going to  question his conservative credentials, and when Judge Poe, Zoe Lofgren,  and Jerry Nadler come to the same agreement on the Constitution, I  would hope that our colleagues would listen. Vote for the Amash  amendment, and, if it does not pass, vote against the bill.                                time  1515     Mr. Speaker, I just wanted to respond.   The NSA will not go dark, and I think it is important that we  understand that.   We are collecting the content of phone calls, emails, text messages,  videos, pictures of Americans, putting it in a database and querying  it, searching it without a probable cause warrant. That is the state  today, and that will continue until reform is done. It will not go  dark. I thought it was important to make that clear.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman, I know he wanted to yield to my  colleague from the Judiciary Committee, to have the chance to clarify  that.
