 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 233 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 233         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 1431) to       amend the Environmental Research, Development, and       Demonstration Authorization Act of 1978 to provide for       Scientific Advisory Board member qualifications, public       participation, and for other purposes. All points of order       against consideration of the bill are waived. The bill shall       be considered as read. All points of order against provisions       in the bill are waived. The previous question shall be       considered as ordered on the bill and on any amendment       thereto to final passage without intervening motion except:       (1) one hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the       chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on       Science, Space, and Technology; and (2) one motion to       recommit.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr.  McGovern), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.  During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, on Tuesday, the House Rules Committee met  and reported a rule, House Resolution 233, providing for consideration  of H.R. 1431, the EPA Science Advisory Board Reform Act of 2017. This  legislation will reform the Environmental Protection Agency, or the  EPA, Science Advisory Board to ensure that it is unbiased and  transparent in performing its duties.   The SAB, the Science Advisory Board, was first established by  Congress in 1978 and plays a vital role in reviewing the scientific  foundation of EPA's regulatory decisions, while also providing critical  advice to us here in Congress as well as the Agency. The information it  reviews is used to justify important policy decisions at the EPA and  should be held to the highest standards because it is imperative that  the regulated community and the public can have confidence that EPA  decisions are grounded, that science should be both reproducible and  transparent.   However, shortcomings with the current process have arisen in recent  years, including limited public participation, EPA interference with  expert advice, potential conflicts of interest, and serious  deficiencies with the process to select the board members. Far too  often, the SAB's authority has been used by the EPA to silence  dissenting scientific views and opinions, rather than promoting the  impartiality and fairness that is the cornerstone of unbiased  scientific advice.                                time  1230    At its inception, the SAB was intended to function independently in  order to provide candid advice and guidance to the EPA. Yet, if the  Agency undermines this autonomy, then the SAB's value to both the EPA  and Congress, I believe, is severely diminished.   Mr. Speaker, to address these issues, H.R. 1431 would reform the SAB  and reaffirm its independence so the public and regulated entities can  have that confidence that sound science is driving policy decisions at  the EPA.   The bill makes several important reforms to the SAB, such as  requiring board members to be qualified experts; disclosing conflicts  of interest and sources of bias; and ensuring that the views of  members, including the dissenting members, are available to the public.  It provides the public with the opportunity to participate in the  advisory activities of the board and gives people the ability to view  the agency's responses to issues raised by the SAB.   Additionally, the bill requires that at least 10 percent of the board  is comprised of State, local, and tribal experts; that board members do  not participate in advisory activities that involve reviews or  evaluations of their own work; and that EPA publicly disclose all board  member recusals; and that comments are published in the Federal  Register.   So these reforms will improve the existing regulatory process, while  also reinvigorating the scientific judgements that are often directly  linked to regulatory decisions.   The EPA relies on SAB reviews and studies to support new regulations,  new standards, assessments, and other Agency actions. A transparent and  accountable Science Advisory Board is critically important and can  assure the public that the data that Federal agencies rely on is  scientifically sound and unbiased.  [[Page H2530]]    This legislation would reinforce that the SAB process is a tool to  help policymakers with complex issues, while also preventing the EPA  from taking actions that impede the free flow of impartial scientific  advice.   Mr. Speaker, this rule provides for consideration of an important  measure that will improve the peer review process and ensure sound  science is used in the Federal rulemaking process. It is a simple,  relatively straightforward bill that will make the SAB more consistent,  transparent, and accountable to our bosses, the American people.   Transparency in regulations based on the highest quality science  should not be a partisan issue. In the 114th Congress, a nearly  identical version of this bill was passed by the House, I am glad to  say, with bipartisan support. I hope we can join together again to pass  this important bill with support from Members of both sides of the  aisle, from both parties.   I urge my colleagues to support this rule as well as the underlying  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I appreciate the gentleman's comments. In fact, some of those  comments he was making I thought he was quoting me, or at least quoting  parts of my own speech.   Certainly, I agree that the decisions made by the Environmental  Protection Agency should be based on fact, not by industry insiders,  and that is exactly  [[Page H2531]]  what this legislation would do. I can't think of any instance where  asking for more full public participation as well as transparency is  not a positive step, and that is exactly what we are trying to do here.   In reference to the number of closed rules that we have had this  year, let me just remind the good gentleman that 15 out of the 23  closed rules were actually the Congressional Review Act, the CRAs that  we have been working on. They are prescribed to be a closed rule. That  is the nature of a CRA.   So I would think that, in the good gentleman's estimation of this  bill and all the negative things that could potentially come of it,  that we should be able to come to some bipartisan agreement on this,  especially considering the political climate that we are in today, the  occupant of the White House today, certainly in Republican hands, and I  would think our friends on the Democratic side of the aisle would be  very interested in ensuring an unbiased source of information that  comes from the SAB to give to the EPA in making their important  decisions. This, I would think, would be a good idea for both sides of  the aisle, no matter who is in the White House, and I would agree that  it is.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Weber), my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   As we get back to the bill at hand, I think it is important that  there are a lot of important topics out there that people want to touch  on, and that is all well and good. Just like my friend from Texas, a  fine member of the Science, Space, and Technology Committee, brought up  other bills that are important and that relate to what we are talking  about here today, and I think that is important as well.   But I think I see an underlying theme here. We all agree on one  thing: we want the EPA to use science. We want public participation. We  want and we need transparency.   This is certainly a positive step in a bill, Mr. Speaker, that went  through regular order, that was introduced with bipartisan support,  that went through the markup process, and that was reported out without  amendments, something that this body in the last Congress passed, I  believe, in a bipartisan fashion.   Just to underscore the importance of taking this important step--and  let me underscore again--no matter which side of the aisle you are on,  it is important that we do this because of who you may think is the  right person or the wrong person occupying the White House, it is  important that the EPA has an unbiased source of information in order  for it to make its decisions.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a news release from the American  Chemistry Council.            [From the American Chemistry Council, March 9, 2017]          ACC Supports Legislative Efforts To Improve EPA Science         Washington.--The American Chemistry Council (ACC) issued       the following statement in support of the H.R. 1430, the       ``Honest and Open New EPA Science Treatment Act of 2017'' (or       The HONEST Act) introduced by Chairman Lamar Smith (R-TX) and       H.R. 1431 ``EPA Science Advisory Board Reform Act of 2017,''       introduced by Congressman Frank Lucus (R-OK).        ``Consistency and transparency are key to the regulatory       certainty our industry needs to grow and create jobs. In some       instances, EPA has fallen short of employing the highest-      quality, best-available science in their regulatory decision       making.        ``It is critical that the regulated community and the       public have confidence that decisions reached by EPA are       grounded in transparent and reproducible science. By ensuring       that the EPA utilizes high quality science and shares       underlying data used to reach decisions, the HONEST Act can       help foster a regulatory environment that will allow the U.S.       business of chemistry to continue to develop safe, innovative       products that Americans depend on in their everyday lives.        ``The Science Advisory Board Reform Act would improve the       peer review process--a critical component of the scientific       process used by EPA in their regulatory decisions about       potential risks to human health or the environment. The Act       would make peer reviewers accountable for responding to       public comment, strengthen policies to address conflicts of       interest, ensure engagement of a wide range of perspectives       of qualified scientific experts in EPA's scientific peer       review panels and increase transparency in peer review       reports.        ``We commend Chairman Smith and Congressman Lucas for their       leadership and commitment to advance these important       issues.''     Mr. Speaker, I would like to read an excerpt from the  American Chemistry Council letter:   ``The Science Advisory Board Reform Act would improve the peer review  process--a critical component of the scientific process used by EPA in  their regulatory decisions about potential risks to human health or the  environment. The Act would make peer reviewers accountable for  responding to public comment, strengthen policies to address conflicts  of interest, ensure engagement of a wide range of perspectives of  qualified scientific experts in EPA's scientific peer review panels and  increase transparency in peer review reports.''   That is a strong statement.   I also include in the Record a letter from the American Farm Bureau  Federation.                                                       American Farm                                               Bureau Federation,                                      Washington, DC, March 8, 2017.      Hon. Lamar Smith,      Chair, House Committee on Science, Space and Technology,           Washington, DC.      Hon. Eddie Bernice Johnson,      Ranking Member, House Committee on Science, Space and           Technology, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Smith and Ranking Member Johnson: Later this       week, the House  [[Page H2533]]       Science, Space and Technology Committee will consider       legislation to provide for Scientific Advisory Board (SAB)       member qualifications and public participation. The American       Farm Bureau strongly supports this legislation and pledges       our commitment to work with the committee in pressing for its       swift consideration.        This legislation is a priority because it reforms the SAB       process by strengthening public participation, improving the       process of selecting expert advisors, and expanding the       overall transparency of the SAB. While the SAB should be a       critical part of the scientific foundation of the U.S.       Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) regulatory process,       EPA has systematically used its authority to silence       dissenting scientific experts. Rather than promote fairness,       transparency and independence to ensure unbiased scientific       advice, EPA routinely has ignored its own Peer Review       Handbook and silenced dissenting voices on expert panels.        This legislation seeks to reinforce the SAB process as a       tool that can help policymakers with complex issues while       preventing EPA from muzzling impartial scientific advice.       This legislation deserves strong, bipartisan support. We       applaud your leadership in this effort and will work with you       to ensure passage.            Sincerely,                                                      Zippy Duvall,                                                         President.     Mr. Speaker, the American Farm Bureau Federation  states:   ``This legislation seeks to reinforce the SAB process as a tool that  can help policymakers with complex issues while preventing EPA from  muzzling impartial scientific advice. This legislation deserves strong,  bipartisan support. We applaud your leadership in this effort and will  work with you to ensure passage.''   These are two bipartisan groups looking out for the best interests of  the citizens of our great country, so I think they make strong  statements in support of this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    I think we have run to the end of our speakers.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   This bill is a good idea, and I think the debate that we have had  here today underscores the importance of this as we consider this under  the rule.   H.R. 1431 addresses problems that have arisen over the years with the  Science Advisory Board, and actually would return the Board to its  intended purpose--something maybe the gentleman does not agree with--to  provide independent expert advice on scientific and technical  information.   By modernizing the policies and the procedures of the governing of  the SAB, Congress, with this bill, can take  [[Page H2534]]  critical steps to make sure that the SAB is best equipped to provide  that independent, transparent, balanced review and the analyses of the  science used that guides the EPA's regulatory decisions.   One key issue that this measure would address is the importance of  having regulations that are supported by science and that are  reproducible and accessible for peer review, not antiscience, like some  people have said. Quite the opposite. We want science. We want good  science.    The scientific method demands that the result of scientific studies  be capable of replication. This is all the more critical when the  information is used to develop and set public policy, which is why the  methods and the data used by the EPA and the SAB must be publicly  available for purposes of replication and verification. If you don't  want public transparency, I guess you should vote ``no'' on this bill.   Mr. Speaker, opponents of the legislation have argued that it makes  unnecessary and unproductive changes to the SAB, that it would restrict  the ability of scientists to engage on the issues they specialize in,  creates new burdens through the public comment and transparency  provisions, and weakens the ability of the EPA to use the best  available science and data to support its rules and regulations.   I believe that these arguments fail to recognize what this bill  actually does accomplish. They seem to ignore the importance of  reforming the Federal rulemaking process in a way that ensures sound  science is the bedrock on which Federal rules and regulations are  built--sound science; is that a radical idea--and that these are not  predetermined political agendas.   Unfortunately, the EPA has diluted the Board's credibility by  systematically silencing dissenting opinions, ignoring calls for  balanced participation, and preventing the Board from responding to  congressional reports. Fully 10 percent of the seats on the Board will  be filled by State, local, and tribal representatives, improving the  balance of that participation.   H.R. 1431 simply encourages greater transparency, debate, and public  participation in the Board, which will result in better decisionmaking  at the EPA. I think that is something everyone should be able to agree  on. I don't think public participation is a burden, but, rather, a  benefit that improves the relationship and the interaction between  Federal regulators and the public.   By strengthening public participation, improving the process for  selecting expert advisers, and expanding transparency requirements,  this legislation takes critical steps that will improve our regulatory  system, while also ensuring that the most qualified and the most  capable scientists are free to undertake a balanced and open review of  regulatory science.   Mr. Speaker, it is time to update the law. It is time to restore  independence to the Science Advisory Board. It is time to strengthen  scientific integrity. Science is an invaluable tool that helps  policymakers navigate complex issues, yet this resource has been  severely diminished if the EPA interferes with expert advice, limits  public participation, and fails to disclose potential conflicts of  interest.   As President Reagan said in guidance to the EPA: ``The purpose of the  Science Advisory Board is to apply the universally accepted principles  of scientific peer review to the research conclusions that will form  the basis for EPA regulations, a function that must remain above  interest group politics.''   Mr. Speaker, I believe H.R. 1431 gets to the heart of President  Reagan's point. Greater debate, unbiased scientific advice and  independent peer-reviews, and public participation will only result in  better decisionmaking at the Federal level. I believe that this is the  goal we all share, and I urge all of my colleagues to support this  rule, as well as the underlying bill.   The material previously referred to by Mr. McGovern is as follows:            An Amendment to H. Res. 233 Offered by Mr. McGovern         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections:        Sec. 2. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the       Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare       the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       356) to establish the National Commission on Foreign       Interference in the 2016 Election. The first reading of the       bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order against       consideration of the bill are waived. General debate shall be       confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. After general       debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the       five-minute rule. All points of order against provisions in       the bill are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of       the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report       the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been       adopted. The previous question shall be considered as ordered       on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without       intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or       without instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and       reports that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then       on the next legislative day the House shall, immediately       after the third daily order of business under clause 1 of       rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further       consideration of the bill.        Sec. 3. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 356.                                   ____           The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.
