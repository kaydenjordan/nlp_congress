 Madam Speaker, we have heard repeatedly from the President  of the United States that this bill costs nothing. That is obviously  not true, it costs lots of money.   Last night, my very good friend, the Rules Committee chairman, the  distinguished Member from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern), said it is  fully paid for. I know he believes that. Unfortunately, he doesn't know  that.   We don't have a Congressional Budget Committee score. We have had  five Members of the other party say they would not vote for this bill  unless they had a CBO score. I hope they hold true to that.   Madam Speaker, we should simply not proceed until we have a CBO  score. We will have our differences of opinion, fair enough. But the  American people and all of us in this Chamber ought to know what this  bill costs before any of us are asked to cast a vote.   Madam Speaker, I would urge the support of my friend's point of  order.    Madam Speaker, I want to thank my friend for yielding, but  most of all, I want to thank him for waiting here hour after hour after  hour, as our friends who couldn't get their show in order, broke arms,  broke knees, did whatever they had to do to bring this to the floor.  Thank you for being here and making sure that things were done  appropriately in a procedural way.   Madam Speaker, we have purportedly a $3 billion package in two  different parts in front of us today. We are not going to talk a lot  about the first part of the package, the so-called infrastructure  package, but I want to talk about it because it didn't come through the  Rules Committee, it didn't need to, and it is not going to be subject  to much debate here, but we ought to talk about it.   Now, of the two bills that we are purportedly going to deal with, it  is the better of the two. It is abominable. It is unpaid for. The CBO  has told us it is $400 billion--$398 billion to be precise.                                time  2040    The Senate process that produced it did not go through the committee  of jurisdiction. Worst of all, it is the most egregious surrender of  House prerogatives I have seen in my time here. It has not come through  any committee. We have not had anything to do with it. We are going to  simply accept what a few Senators negotiated and went through and call  it a victory and call it bipartisan. It is nothing of the sort.   Worse than that is the bill that this rule is to advance, and that is  the so-called BBB bill. Now, my friends call it the Build Back Better  bill. I call it the bad bad bad bill. It has been cobbled together in a  convoluted process of missed deadlines, broken promises, and  legislative sleight of hand. The defects are almost, Madam Speaker, too  many to mention.   My friends will say it is paid for. It is not. Quite frankly, they  have about $1.5 trillion of revenue as far as we can tell, and they  have ``$1.75 trillion'' with expenditures. But they intend to make  every program here for 1 year or 3 years or 5 years permanent. So if  you add them all together, it is a minimum of $4 trillion with $1.5  trillion of revenues. So it is an outrageously unbalanced bill.   Some of my friends are going to vote for this because it has  immigration in it. Really? Immigration, frankly, will not survive the  Senate Parliamentarian, and everybody on your side knows it.   Some of them are going to vote for it because it has State and local  tax reform, which is a nice way of saying, my gosh, tax breaks for  millionaires and billionaires in blue States. That too, by  [[Page H6219]]  the way, will probably be changed in the United States Senate if you  believe Senator Sanders and Senator Warren and look at what they have  to say about this thing.   Finally, we have some people who say: Well, I am going to vote for it  because it is just the right thing to do.   It is the wrong thing to do for the American people.    This bill, by the way, will not get better in the Senate.   Now, when it was sold to your side, you were told that we are not  going to move ahead until we have an agreement the Senate will accept.  The Senate won't accept this bill. We are going to send it over there,  and a few Senators are going to write it and send it right back. If you  don't like it now, you are going to like it less when it gets here.   Madam Speaker, we should defeat the rule; we should defeat the  infrastructure package; and when it comes, we should defeat the bad bad  bad bill.
