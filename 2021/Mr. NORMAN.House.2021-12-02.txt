 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and recognize the  service of Marine Corporal John ``Bullit'' Killian of Chester, South  Carolina.   John is no stranger to service and sacrifice. In fact, military  service runs in the Killian family. John's father was a marine in World  War II in the Pacific Theater.   A true American hero, John bravely served our country throughout the  Vietnam war. John's military career began in 1965 after he and several  of his classmates were selected for the draft.   John went through basic training at Parris Island, which he credits  for sufficiently preparing him to survive Vietnam. His first duty  station was Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) in Cherry Point, North  Carolina, where he trained as an electrician and attended an air  conditioning and refrigeration school.   After completing his schooling, John shipped out to Vietnam. He was  based at Camp Evans, which he and his fellow marines called Disneyland  because they got to live in hooches instead of tents.   Affectionately known as Cackalack, John was discharged after 1 year,  11  [[Page H6864]]  months, and 22 days in the Marine Corps. He left Vietnam the day the  Tet Offensive started. His time in the Marine Corps dramatically  affected his life. John said in some ways his service made him harder,  but in other ways softer.   On behalf of the Fifth District of South Carolina, I want to thank  Marine Corporal John Killian for his outstanding service. He has  created a lasting legacy of duty, honor, and courage, and our Nation is  better off for his sacrifice. May God continue to bless John and his  great family.                            ____________________
