 Mr. Chairman, I thank the ranking member and  chairman for their leadership.   Mr. Chairman, my amendment is simple. It is amendment No. 26, and it  would increase funds for the continuum of care grants under the  McKinney-Vento Homelessness Assistance program by $1 million to help  survivors of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or  stalking who are experiencing homelessness and provide them the  resources they need to leave abusive and harmful situations.   These grants provide local organizations, faith-based organizations,  and Tribal entities with the funds necessary to help combat our  Nation's homelessness crisis. Domestic violence shelters funded by the  continuum of care grants are the first place survivors turn to in order  to provide them with the opportunity to escape dangerous and abusive  situations and ultimately helps to prevent the loss of life at the hand  of abusers.   In my own State we had a record number of domestic violence loss in  2022 at a rate of one death every 3.8 days.    Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support  this en bloc amendment.   I would end with a question asked by Jenna Gormal: Will we invest in  prevention measures, housing, economic, and racial equity, commonsense  firearms regulations, body autonomy, or will we accept the deaths of  our family and community members at the hands of domestic violence?
