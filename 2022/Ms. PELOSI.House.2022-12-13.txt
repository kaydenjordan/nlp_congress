 Thank you all. Good morning, my friends. It is wonderful  to be here with you. Thank you for the recognition. L.F. Payne, thank  you for keeping this going and for your leadership. It was an honor to  serve with you in the House--each and every one--I think I served with  all of you, certainly Jane, Donna, and Mr. Secretary of so many titles.  To all of you, welcome back to the Chamber.   It is an interesting time, a busy time. Something that binds us all  together is the oath that we take to the Constitution of the United  States, regardless of party, regardless of the aisle, we are united in  that oath to the Constitution.   I thank you for so much that you are doing in terms of Congress to  Campus and the beautiful ceremony you have each year honoring those who  have gone on to heaven--I assume--having served in the Congress.   We just lost--a week and a half ago--Mr. McEachin. I mention him  because of his recent departure, but also, he said something very  beautiful on his first speech on the floor of the House. He quoted  Christ's first sermon. Imagine that. Christ's first sermon.   I will read this to you, so you know I did not make this up. Mr.  McEachin cited during his first speech the words of Jesus' first  sermon, ``The spirit of the Lord is upon me to bring good news to the  poor.'' Imagine. Imagine.   Again, with all of us here, we offer hope in the face of hardship--on  both sides--we offer a voice to the voiceless, and to bring good news  to those in need.   Now, I have some remarks here, but I thought I would just tell you a  couple stories. We lost Norman Mineta this year, as you know, and some  of us were together at his service. Mr. Ambassador, Governor, former  colleague Jim Blanchard, I call him Jamie because one of his friends  was my friend and always referred to him as Jamie.   He spoke before I did, and he talked about how a number of Members  come together on a regular basis and discuss this, that, and the other  thing, and they have all this guidance that they want to give us. When  I got up, I said, I am very familiar with that group--George Miller,  Tom Downey, Marty Russo, you know, that whole crew--you know who I am  talking about.   When they would call me with this guidance that they brought  together, they would say: Madam Speaker, if you were smart, you would  do thus and so. And I didn't take offense because I used to hear them  say that to Tom Foley and others. Why they thought that was a good  introduction to their remarks, I don't know. In any event, I think it  was said in--I don't know why somebody would say that to you? If you  were smart, you would do it this way. That is the wisdom of the former  Members; but when they were Members, they said that, as well.   I thank you all for what you do to continue taking the experience of  Congress into the community, the values of patriotism to our great  country--what has unified us so much over time. Imagine the wisdom of  our Founders to found a country based on something unknown, undone  before.   Now, I see some Members here who are going to be part of this  organization. All of a sudden, I am like, what? One of these days I  will be joining you, too. I look forward to that, but in the meantime  know that the foundation that each of you has put down when you were  here is something that we continue to draw upon. It is very important  to us--especially at a time when we worked in a much more bipartisan  way, and that always has to be what we strive for--bipartisanship,  accountability, and shedding light on what we do so that the people  understand that their voices are heard.   I hope that you always take pride in your service in Congress no  matter how raucous it may be here. We have seen some raucous times in  our day going way back. Again, please understand the source of strength  and inspiration that you all continue to be to us here, and the fact  that you come together, whether it is on this day or technologically in  other ways, and don't hesitate to call us, even if it is not the  Speaker, but other Members to say: If you were smart, you would do thus  and so.   So it is my pleasure--for the last time--to welcome you to this  Chamber as Speaker of the House. Again, when I  [[Page H9705]]  see you again, I may be sitting on that side of this podium, so I look  forward to that.   Thank you all for your patriotism, for your love of this great  country, the greatest country that ever existed in the history of the  world.   Let me tell you what is happening today. Today, the President will be  signing the Respect for Marriage Act. That is a big deal for some of  us. In my first speech on this floor, I talked about HIV and AIDS 35  years ago. One of the last bills I signed as Speaker for the first time  was the repeal of Don't Ask, Don't Tell. One of the last bills I signed  to send over to the President that he will sign today is the Respect  for Marriage Act, in between the other things that relate to the hate  crimes and all that.   The reason I mention it is because it was always an expansion of  freedom in our country, and that is what we hope we always continue to  do--ever increasing the freedom in our country.   At the end of the day, I will welcome 50 heads of state from Africa.  The President is having an African summit now, and he will be welcoming  50 heads of state at the White House. Then, tonight, they will come  here.   I am so proud that we can show them this temple of democracy, welcome  them here, hear what they have to say, build a strong bond with them.   So many of you have been so much a part of everything that has  happened here. I thank you for that, forever expanding freedom in our  country. Thank you so much. Lovely to be with you.    Mr. Speaker, it is with great joy and great pride that I  rise to celebrate two longtime members of our congressional community-- indeed our family--as they prepare for retirement: Ella Terry and  Patricia Smith, better known as Miss Pat.                                time  1400    On behalf of the United States House of Representatives, it is my  privilege to extend our deepest thanks and appreciation for their  decades of service. With extraordinary devotion and a deep-seated love  for this institution, each has served the Congress longer than most  Members. That is reason to applaud.   Ahead of their well-earned retirements, let us wish them both well.  It is sad to see them go, but we are grateful for their many, many  years of service they have given us.   On our side of the aisle, we all know that Ella Terry has worked in  the House Democratic cloakroom since the dawn of the millennium in  January of 2000, after working for more than a decade in the Capitol  Coffee Shop. She knows our preferences.   Altogether, she has dutifully served on Capitol Hill for 34 years.  She has a warm, caring, steadfast presence, a sunny smile, no matter  how arduous things may be going on the floor or the cloakroom.   With Ella, no one is a stranger, everyone is a friend. She is a  bedrock member of our family here in the House.   When Congresswoman Gabby Giffords first returned to the floor after  the heinous attack on her life, Ella embraced Gabby and told her  through tears: I am so proud of you. Gabby was so proud of you, too.   The late Congressman Elijah Cummings once told his colleagues: Ms.  Ella is my personal adviser. And since he was personal adviser to the  rest of us, we are all in your debt for your advice to him.   Thank you to Ella's daughter, Tawanna, who is here, and  granddaughter, Christina, thank you for being with us; and to your  entire family for sharing her with us for so many years.   Across the aisle, Miss Pat has brought that same unwavering  dedication to her service in the House Republican cloakroom.   For nearly five decades, Miss Pat has been a cherished colleague in  the Capitol; first in the House dining room and in the Longworth House  Office Building, and then for 36 years just off the floor of the House.   A remarkable friend to all those privileged enough to work alongside  her, she has been a daily blessing to this Chamber.   The House is also grateful to Miss Pat's loving family, especially  her two daughters, Nikoshia and Bianca, and her beloved granddaughter,  Lauren.   The House of Representatives is a brighter, more joyful place in  which we serve, thanks to Ella and Miss Pat. These patriots reflect the  highest ideals of public service; a joyful commitment to others, a  profound love for our country, and a lifelong reverence for the  Congress.   Their service, their kindness, and their friendship will be long- remembered by the countless Members and staff they have served over the  years.   Let us join in thanking Ella and thanking Miss Pat, and best wishes  for new adventures that lie ahead for you. Congratulations.   Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to yield to the distinguished gentleman  from California (Mr. McCarthy), the Republican leader.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield back the balance of my  time as we end our tribute to two great Americans, members of our  families, Miss Pat and Ella Terry. Thank you all so much.                            ____________________
