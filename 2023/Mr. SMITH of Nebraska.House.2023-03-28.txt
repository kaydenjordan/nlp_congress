 Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R.  1, Lower Energy Costs Act, an actual solution to the problems we are  facing.   We have seen what happens abroad when Nations are at the mercy of  energy imports from nefarious actors. We have seen what happens at home  when energy prices skyrocket and families struggle to pay for gas and  groceries.   That is why I am a staunch supporter of this bill and the mission  behind it. H.R. 1 is an important step toward unleashing American  energy, lowering prices, and strengthening our energy supply chains.   The American government should not be in the business of picking  winners and losers. We need an all-of-the-above energy approach.   Increasing production and untangling energy from overly burdensome  red tape is key toward providing certainty and stability to American  businesses, consumers, and families. That is why I support this bill,  and I urge a ``yes'' vote.
