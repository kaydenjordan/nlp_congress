 Madam Chair, I rise today to express my support  for H.R. 467, the HALT Fentanyl Act.   This legislation will place all fentanyl-related substances, as a  class, into schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act.   The Energy and Commerce Committee has taken an important step toward  solving our fentanyl crisis. I am proud to have supported this bill  since the 117th Congress.   We have heard from Molly Cain, the Cullens, and countless others who  courageously told their stories of how their children were murdered by  fentanyl. Make no mistake: Fentanyl is a poison in our communities.  Every pill, every toke, every line of cocaine is like playing a game of  Russian roulette every single time.   This crisis is happening at the hands of bad actors such as the  Chinese Communist Party and the drug cartels. China remains the primary  source of illicit fentanyl and its precursors that are trafficked  internationally and through our porous southern border.   In fiscal year 2023, Customs and Border Patrol has seized over 17,000  pounds of fentanyl, enough to kill 11 times the entire population of  the United States.   The HALT Fentanyl Act is an important step in the right direction,  and we must permanently schedule these substances.  [[Page H2584]]    Let's call it what it is: a weapon of mass destruction. Our law  enforcement officers fight heroically every day to combat this  epidemic, and it is imperative that we protect them.
