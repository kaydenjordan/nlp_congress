 Mr. Chair, I rise today to first express my great  appreciation to Chairman Michael Conaway and Subcommittee Chairman  Austin Scott for their hard work in crafting H.R. 238, the Commodity  End-User Relief Act, legislation to reauthorize the Commodity Futures  Trading Commission (CFTC). Chairman Conaway and Subcommittee Chairman  Austin Scott held four hearings throughout the 114th Congress regarding  the CFTC and its future, during which time they invited input from a  wide variety of interested stakeholders. I believe that they have  struck the right balance in providing the CFTC with the authorizations  necessary for the agency to do its job, while increasing oversight,  instituting reforms to protect end-users from regulatory overreach, and  improving consumer protection against fraud or mismanagement.   I am also pleased to see that since the House of Representatives last  acted to reauthorize the CFTC, in light of many years of concern about  aluminum markets and warehousing practices, the London Metal Exchange  has implemented additional reforms to their aluminum warehousing  practices and  [[Page H413]]  contracts. Now that the London Metal Exchange has been recognized by  the CFTC as a Foreign Board of Trade, I look forward to continuing my  review of these reforms and their impact on aluminum markets and end  users, while remaining hopeful that these changes will accomplish their  intended goal.   Once again, I would like to thank all those involved in bringing this  bill to the floor, Chairman Michael Conaway, Subcommittee Chairman  Austin Scott, and Ranking Member David Scott. I ask my colleagues to  join me in supporting this legislation.
