 Mr. President, thank you for your leadership on this  issue, and God knows, how many others. You are a force of nature. I am  happy to be with you on this day.   I come from Delaware, and we have about a million people who live in  Delaware, and they are not shy about telling their congressional  delegation--Senator Coons, Congresswoman Lisa Blunt Rochester, and me-- what they are thinking. We go home just about every night. They get to  tell us a lot of times in person. They also call our office. We have  three offices in Delaware. They call our office here in Washington.  They send us emails. We used to get a lot of letters, but now mostly we  receive emails, not too many letters.   I have never seen the kind of outcry, if you will, from the people of  my State  [[Page S815]]  on any nomination. I have been privileged to serve. This is my 17th  year. So we have seen a lot of nominations come and go, seen a number  of Presidents come and go, but I have never seen anything quite like  this.   I asked my staff to compile for me, through yesterday, the number of  folks who either called us or emailed or sent us letters on the  nomination of Betsy DeVos to be Secretary of Education.   As of yesterday, over 3,700 people had contacted my office. That may  not be a lot from Oklahoma. That may not be a lot from California. That  is a lot in Delaware. I ask my staff to break down--let us know if we  heard from anybody outside of Delaware: over 700. Then I said, for the  folks who contacted us from Delaware with respect to this nomination of  Betsy DeVos, how many were for her? Out of over 3,700--10. I have never  seen anything like that.   So that means there are over 3,700 people in my State who raised  their voice up against her nomination. Just because the numbers are  like 370 to 1 against the nomination, that doesn't necessarily mean I  should oppose the nomination, but it certainly makes me stop and think  if I had been inclined to do so.   I rise today, not just as a United States Senator, but as a  recovering Governor and a father, one who knows the value of public  education from personal experience. My wife and I grew up--she in North  Carolina and me in West Virginia, a little bit of Ohio, and mostly  Virginia--we grew up in public schools. Our sons attended public  schools throughout high school, graduated and went off to college, and  we are proud of what they have accomplished. They are 26 and 28 years  old today. I am very proud of what they have accomplished. I have a  stepson from my first marriage. He lives in Michigan. He raised a  family, four children and his wife, and I am very proud of what he  accomplished--again, a product of public schools.   When I graduated from high school, I was fortunate to win a Navy ROTC  scholarship and go to Ohio State. I worked a couple of jobs while I was  going to school and was able to become one of the first people in my  family ever to go to college and to graduate from college. I spent five  as a naval flight officer during the Vietnam war. At the end of the  war, I came back to the United States and moved to Delaware. There,  thanks to the GI bill and continuing to fly as a Reserve P-3 aircraft  mission commander, I was able to make ends meet and get a graduate  degree in business administration from the University of Delaware.   The 8 years I was Governor, from 1993 to 2001, I spent a big part of  those 8 years focusing on creating a more nurturing environment for job  creation, job preservation. Our Presiding Officer has heard me wax on  in our committee--more often than he probably wants to remember--about  a major job of government under State, local, Federal, is to create a  nurturing environment for job creation, job preservation. In a family,  you have breadwinners, people earning an income, making a way for  themselves, for the rest, and our job is a whole lot easier.   One of the keys to that nurturing environment is to make sure the  young men and women coming out of our colleges, our high schools, our  trade schools have the ability to read, to write, to think, to use the  technology, and to have a good work ethic and go out and be a good  employee for any employer who might hire them.   Public education is personal for me. I have had this remarkable  connection to it for my whole life. In our little State, I visit  schools almost every week. We have a program called Principal for a  Day. I have been Principal for a Day. It is from the State chamber of  commerce. I joke and tell people I have been Principal for a Day in  about half the schools in Delaware. It is probably not quite right but  probably 30 or more. I keep running into kids who went to high school  and say: ``I was your principal, did you know that? Only for a day, but  it was a good day.'' I learned a lot from doing that.   I mentored, for probably a couple of decades, a bunch of different  kids, trying to help be a good role model for them and give them an  extra person to be able to lean on and to count on.   Just recently, I was over at the school a couple of miles from our  home at Mount Pleasant Elementary, which has a terrific elementary  school in the Brandywine School District in Northern Delaware. The  Teacher of the Year there for the State was good enough to let me come  by and shadow her for part of her day and see what a really terrific  teacher does. During the 8 years I was Governor, one of the highlights  of every year was the day I would host, in June at the end of the  school year. We have 19 school districts. Each school district picked  the Teacher of the Year. They have the chance to have lunch--the  Delaware Teachers of the Year--and just to focus on their school  districts and their schools and their classes, what was working to  raise student achievement and really be inspired by all of them.   I hear regularly from my constituents about the importance of public  education. In fact, I was out running late Sunday afternoon, actually  into the dusk. I was going by a Wawa on Philadelphia Pike, just north  of Wilmington. Some guy came by and he rolled down his window. As I ran  along, he said, ``Don't vote for that Betsy DeVos.''   I said, ``Really. Can't get away from it.''   But I hear it a lot. I hear the message loud and clear.   Many of our colleges have covered this nomination at some length. But  I think it bears repeating. I would just say this: Experience matters.  Mrs. DeVos has, as far as I can tell, no experience in public education  as a student, none as a parent, none as a teacher, none as a school  administrator--none.   Maybe that alone should not disqualify her, but it is concerning.  During her confirmation hearing, Mrs. DeVos failed to answer the most  basic questions relating to education policy, and she demonstrated, not  just in my view but certainly the views of a lot of the people who  watched and shared their views with me, that she was unqualified,  really unprepared for what I think is a critical task.   Many of my colleagues who support Mrs. DeVos point to her experience  in Michigan, where Mrs. DeVos used her significant wealth and influence  apparently to push an education reform agenda centered on vouchers,  centered on for-profit charter schools that delivered questionable  outcomes for students and taxpayers.   Let me just say, I was a Governor who proposed legislation, signed  legislation creating charter schools. I have been a champion of public  charter schools in my State and in our country. I have been a champion  here in the Congress. I am not a champion of all these for-profit  colleges and universities that we have. Some of them are very good;  some of them are not.   I am concerned with the advent of for-profit charter schools,  particularly those that are not doing the job, getting the job done and  raising student achievement for the young men and women who are  students there.   Leading the Department of Education is a very big job. It is a very  important job. The Secretary of Education is responsible for overseeing  a budget of some $36 billion for K-12 education and $150 billion for  higher education, as well as managing a portfolio of more than $1.2  trillion in outstanding Federal student loans.   I have been fortunate as a Congressman, as a Governor, as a Senator,  to work with any number of Secretaries of Education in the  administration of George Herbert Walker Bush, the administration of  Bill Clinton, the administration of George W. Bush, and the  administration of Barack Obama--people like Dick Riley, former Governor  of South Carolina, people like Arne Duncan, who was a great school  leader in Illinois and for our country as well. When I think of the  giants they were and the work they did and how knowledgeable they were,  how inspiring they were, how uplifting they were, that is the kind of  leader we need. They were not just all in Democratic administrations or  Democratic and Republican administrations. As much as ever, we need  that kind of leader today.   I will conclude by saying that Mrs. DeVos too often lacks experience,  just as often has the wrong experience that we should expect from  someone to lead the Department of Education at what is really a  critical juncture for our country. I cannot support her nomination  because I am not a convinced that she is interested in bringing  Democrats  [[Page S816]]  and Republicans together on a shared vision of improving public  education in this country. Reluctantly, I must urge my Democrat and  Republican colleagues to listen to this groundswell of voices from  across the country and ultimately oppose this nomination.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Flake). The Senator from Maryland.    Mr. President, I also rise this evening to talk about the  nomination of our colleague from Alabama, Senator Jeff Sessions, to  serve as our next Attorney General.   Like many of our colleagues, I have heard from an incredible number  of people in my State regarding this nomination--some in favor, fewer  than 100--many against. Almost 1,300 Delawareans have called, emailed,  or written to my office, expressing their opposition to Senator  Sessions' nomination.   I would like to share, if I could, just a few excerpts from some of  the emails that I have received concerning this nomination.   We will start with Priscilla from the town of Newport in the northern  part of our State. She wrote to me about the experience of her family  growing up in a segregated society. Here is what she had to say. She  said:         I lived through my parents not having the right to vote,       not being able to go through the front door of a restaurant       or doctor's office, using the colored fountains and       bathrooms. Never again.    Another person, Rhonda from Dewey Beach wrote to me about Senator  Sessions' voting record on voting rights. Here is what she had to say.  She said:         Mr. Sessions has called the Voting Rights Act of 1965 a       ``piece of intrusive legislation.'' Under him, the Justice       Department would most likely focus less on prosecutions of       minority voter suppression and more on rooting out mythical       voter fraud.    Here is one from Wilmington, DE--my hometown now--from a woman named  Dawn. She wrote to me about her concerns as a parent of a child with  autism. She wrote these words:         I am writing to express my deep concern with Jeff Sessions'       nomination for Attorney General. I am a parent of an autistic       son and am terrified that people with these types of views       will be in power to enforce (or not) the laws that protect       the rights of my son and so many others.    Mr. President, the common theme throughout these letters, these  calls, these emails is their fear that Senator Sessions will not be an  Attorney General for all Americans.   I know that many of my colleagues--our colleagues--will soon be  voting  [[Page S960]]  their hopes by voting to confirm Senator Sessions to be our next  Attorney General, but too many of my constituents, including African  Americans, immigrants, women, Muslims, and other vulnerable  populations, have called and emailed my office in numbers that I don't  think I have ever seen before to express their fears and to ask me to  do something about it as their senior Senator.   I have heard their voices loud and clear, and I feel compelled to add  my voice to so many others in opposing this nomination.   Let me just say this as clearly as I can. I do so with no joy, no  joy.   Last night, as I was thinking about what I wanted to share on the  floor this evening, my mind drifted back to another time and place.   The Presiding Officer may not know this. I grew up in Danville, VA,  my sister and I, the last capital of the Confederacy. I got there I  think when I was just about 9 years old and left when I was about to  finish high school.   The home that we lived in right outside of Danville, VA--if you  walked out the front door, about 100 yards down the road on the other  side was a church, Woodlawn Baptist Church. That was our church, and my  mom dragged my sister and me there every Sunday morning, every Sunday  night, every Wednesday night, and most Thursday nights.   When my sister and I were in high school, we stood on the doorstep of  that church Monday through Friday when school was in session, and we  would catch a school bus. About 200 yards down the road, on Westover  Drive, there was another school bus stop, where African-American kids  got on their school bus, 200 yards away. We would drive in our school  bus 10 miles to our school, Roswell High School, and the kids at the  other school bus stop would get in their bus, and they would drive past  our school another 10 miles to get to their school.   On weekends, my dad worked a lot. He was in the Navy Reserve as a  chief petty officer. He was gone a lot on the weekends. My mom worked  in downtown Danville in the five-and-dime store. My sister and I would  catch a bus, and we would ride downtown to go have lunch with my mom on  many Saturdays when we were 9, 10, 11, 12 years old.   I couldn't help but notice when we got on the bus that if you were  White, you got to sit up front, and if you were Black, you sat in back.  We would go to a blue plate diner with my mom at lunchtime. There was  one section where, if you were White, you got to eat there, and another  section where, if you were Black, colored, you would eat there. To go  to the restrooms, it was colored only, White only.   After lunch, my sister and I would go to Rialto Theatre in Danville,  and my mom would give us each a quarter. And for 25 cents, we could see  that afternoon three movies until she was finished with work, and we  would go home together. At that Rialto Theatre, if you were White, you  sat down in front on the first floor; if you were Black, you sat up in  the balcony.   I will never forget that when I was a little boy in Danville, one  day, I went to the dentist's office for some dental care. I remember  this older African-American woman coming into the dentist's office, and  she was in pain with I think an abscessed tooth.   She said: I know I don't have an appointment, but could someone just  help me out of my misery?   They said: I am sorry, ma'am. You don't have an appointment. We can't  do anything for you. And she left crying.   My parents--it turns out I am a Democrat; they were Republican, as  far as I know. They got to vote, and they got to vote regularly. But I  will bet you dollars to doughnuts that the kids at that bus stop who  caught that bus to go to that all-Black, all-African-American school,  my guess is that a bunch of them didn't get to vote because of  something we had in Virginia called a poll tax.   Among the lessons that my sister and I learned at Woodlawn Baptist  Church was the Golden Rule: Treat other people the way we want to be  treated.   Among the things that we learned at that church is Matthew 25: We  should care for the least of these. When I was hungry, did you feed me?  When I was naked, did you clothe me? When I was thirsty, did you give  me a drink? When I was sleeping in prison, did you visit me? When I was  a stranger in your land, did you welcome me? And we were taught: yes,  yes, yes, yes.   Micah 6. In my church this past Sunday, the question was raised: What  is expected of us by the Lord? And we received three answers. And the  three answers: Do justice, love kindness, walk humbly with thy God.    I have taken those lessons from my childhood, and those are lessons  from my own church today. And I want to tell you that as a kid growing  up in Danville, VA, I can understand how other kids in my community  were racist or bigoted. I can understand how it happened in Alabama or  North Carolina, where our Presiding Officer is from.   But somewhere along the line, somebody got ahold of me and said: You  know all that stuff you are talking about in church and the Bible? If  you really believe it, here is how you should act and talk and speak.  And finally it sunk in.   I just want to say that Jeff Sessions has been my colleague. I have  been here for 16 years. He has been my friend and colleague for 16  years. We read the same Bible. There have been times where we read it  together over the years. When we met in my office just a few weeks ago,  we talked about how our faith guides us in our lives. I reminded him of  how Matthew 25 talks about moral obligations, ``the least of these,''  which I have talked about.   As I carefully considered my friend's nomination to serve our country  in such a critical role, I found that while we agree on many issues,  including that our faith is an important guide not only in our personal  lives but in our capacity as public servants, I found that our views on  too many important issues diverged.   Like many Americans, I am troubled by the direction Donald Trump is  seeking to take our country in these first few weeks of his  administration. I believe that an independent Attorney General can  provide a check on this President's legal recklessness, and it may be  more necessary now than at any point in recent history. Donald Trump  has already revealed an agenda that reflects his divisive campaign, one  that I believe will make our economy less robust, less fair, our  environment less clean, our country less inclusive, our freedoms less  free, and our allies less inclined to take America at its word.   Many of us worry that Jeff Sessions will not be the independent check  on this administration that we need, and many of us worry that Jeff  will not hold our Justice Department to the principles that everyone,  no matter their age, income, sex, or color, deserves equal protection  under the law. My colleagues and I have these concerns with a number of  Cabinet nominees. I voted for more of them than I voted against.   Having said that, we need individuals to serve in these key posts who  are willing to speak truth to power. Ironically, that is what got  Acting Attorney General Sally Yates in trouble. She did it a few days  ago when she was fired for refusing to defend the Muslim ban because  she thought it might not be lawful.   Throughout the campaign, Senator Sessions supported a religious-based  test for immigrants, and I fear that Senator Sessions is unlikely to  stand up to Donald Trump and tell him that he is wrong on this front.  To be honest with you, I just believe we need somebody who will do  that, and unfortunately I fear there is a good chance that Senator  Sessions believes Donald Trump just might be right. I am also afraid  that Senator Sessions won't be the independent check our country is  likely to need, especially in this administration.   Ultimately, however, the votes are where they are, and it appears  that our friend, our colleague, Senator Sessions, will be our country's  next chief law enforcement officer and chief attorney. Over these past  days and weeks, I thought about whether our friend is the best person  for the job, as I have said. I know others have too. I also thought  about the millions of Americans who fear that he may have views about  different races and minorities that could seep into the Justice  Department, resulting in an unequal applications of our country's laws.   My thoughts have led me to the example of Lyndon Johnson, a man from  [[Page S961]]  the South who served, as you may recall, in the U.S. House of  Representatives in Texas for a number of years and later suddenly  became President under tragic circumstances, as we all recall, in  November of 1963. LBJ didn't just oppose civil rights while in the  House of Representatives and in the Senate, he often bragged about it.  But he went through a public transformation that would lead him to pass  the first civil rights bill since reconstruction as Senate majority  leader in 1957 and then signed into law some of our Nation's landmark  civil rights laws--the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Voting Rights Act  of 1965, the Elementary and Secondary Act, the Fair Housing Act, and  countless others.   LBJ's transformation didn't happen overnight, though. The truth is  that his views on civil rights and racial justice might have been there  all along.   Here is what Robert Caro wrote about LBJ in the most recent  installment on his life:         Although the cliche says that power always corrupts, what       is seldom said, but what is equally true, is that power       always reveals. When a man is climbing, trying to persuade       others to give him power, concealment is necessary: to hide       traits that might make others reluctant to give him power, to       hide also what he wants to do with that power. If men       recognized the traits or realized the aims, they might refuse       to give him what he wants. But as a man obtains more power,       camouflage is less necessary. The curtain begins to rise. The       revealing begins.    So it was, in Caro's view--and I think he is probably right--so it  was with Lyndon Johnson.   Mr. President, that reminds me of another quote tonight. This is one  from our former First Lady Michelle Obama, who said these words:  ``Being President doesn't change who you are, it reveals who you are.''   It reveals who you are.   We are not confirming Jeff Sessions to be our next President, but we  are confirming him to be our next Attorney General, and we must ask, as  the curtain rises, what will it reveal? What will it reveal about Jeff  Sessions?   Unfortunately, each time Jeff's career has led to more power, whether  it was district attorney in Alabama, attorney general for his State, or  as U.S. Senator, it has revealed a Jeff Sessions who is much the same  as he has always been. It has revealed Jeff Sessions to be less  inclined to undergo the transformation that so many others before him  have undergone to put themselves and our Nation on the right side of  history.    I will close with this thought: If Senator Sessions is confirmed, it  is my sincere hope that our friend and our colleague will recognize the  awesome responsibility and the opportunity he has to serve not only the  people of Alabama, not only the people of the South or the Southeastern  part of our country, but Americans across our country of all races, all  colors, all creeds. In this body, it is often important that we vote  with our hopes rather than our fears, and unfortunately, tonight I am  not yet prepared to vote my hopes. But the words of a reporter writing  about President Johnson a few years ago give me some hope as we look  forward, and maybe they will give hope to the rest of us. Here is what  that reporter wrote about Lyndon Johnson:         Perhaps the simple explanation, which Johnson likely       understood better than most, was that there is no magic       formula through which people can emancipate themselves from       prejudice, no finish line that when crossed, awards a       person's soul with a shining medal of purity in matters of       race. All we can offer is a commitment to justice in word and       deed that must be honored but from which we will all       occasionally fall short.    And I would just add, and we do.   I hope these words I have just quoted resonate with our friend and  colleague, Senator Jeff Sessions. If they do, both he and our country  will be better for it.   With that, I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.
