 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the  life of Charlottean Scott Brooks.   Scott's life of work and service ended tragically and senselessly  early Monday morning of this week when he was murdered outside his  place of business in the NoDa area of Charlotte.   Brooks' Sandwich House is a Charlotte institution since 1973, run by  Scott and his twin brother, David. It is a modest place where you buy a  burger all the way and eat standing outside at a table. Really good.   Somehow, I had missed that hometown treasure until just 3 weeks ago  when a friend invited me there for lunch. Scott spotted me as we came  in and told the cashier our burgers were on the house--not because  Scott was a fan, but because he was a nice guy.   Scott was holding down the fort while David convalesced from an  injury. That is what brothers like Scott do.   I could not know then that Scott would be taken from us all just 17  days later.   I am grateful for that brief meeting and for the opportunity to  commemorate him to the history of our Nation. Scott's brother and his  wife and child should not be mourning him this day, yet we all are.   Scott Allen Brooks, rest in peace.                            ____________________
