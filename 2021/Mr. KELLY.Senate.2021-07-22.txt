 Mr. President, on July 19, 2021, I missed rollcall vote  No. 267 on confirmation of Tiffany P. Cunningham, of Illinois, to be  United States Circuit Judge for the Federal Circuit. Had I been in  attendance, I would have voted yes on her confirmation.                            ____________________
