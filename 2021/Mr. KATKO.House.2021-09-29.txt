 Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4094, the One-Stop Pilot Program Act of  2021 authorizes the Transportation Security Administration to establish  a pilot program to streamline international travel and enhance aviation  security.   Specifically, under this bill, international travelers from certified  last point of departure airports would not need to be rescreened upon  arrival in the United States for their domestic connecting flight.   H.R. 4094 will improve international aviation security since  participating LPD airports must elevate their level of security to that  of the United States in order to be certified. Given the desire and  competition among international airports to participate, the one-stop  security pilot will help to raise the global baseline of aviation  security.   The bill ensures robust oversight of the pilot program by requiring  TSA to brief and certify to Congress that security standards are  maintained at participating pilot airports. Additionally, the pilot  program will inform Congress and DHS as to whether a more permanent  one-stop program is practical and beneficial to U.S. aviation security.   One-stop screening would enable TSA to better utilize its screening  workforce and technology to help facilitate the increased travel volume  as we emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic.   Just this morning, the TSA administrator testified before the  Committee on Homeland Security about the security and efficiency  benefits that this pilot program will have on TSA's operations.   The pilot program will also provide international travelers with a  more seamless and efficient travel experience. Travelers will no longer  have to rush to be rescreened by TSA during their layover and will have  more time at the airport without fear of missing their connecting  flights.   The aviation industry will also realize efficiencies as a result of  this bill. Air carriers will potentially be able to shorten connection  times for travelers and streamline staffing at participating airports.  U.S. airports will also see benefits as connecting travelers will have  more time to dine and shop while on their layover. This is critically  important as the travel and tourism industry continues to struggle with  the effects of this brutal pandemic.   For these reasons, and many others, aviation and travel industry  stakeholders are very enthusiastic about this legislation, and I  appreciate their strong support.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record letters of support from Airlines  for America, the American Association of Airport Executives, and the  Airports Council International North America.                                           Airlines for America,                                      Washington, DC, June 29, 2021.      Ranking Member John Katko,      House Committee on Homeland Security,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Ranking Member Katko: I write to express Airlines for       America's (A4A) robust support for H.R. 4094, the ``One-Stop       Pilot Program Act of 2021.'' This bill would serve as a       critical tool for the Transportation Security Administration       (TSA), partner governments and the commercial aviation       industry to pilot innovative ways to increase security at       foreign last point of departure airports while increasing       efficiency of screening for passengers and baggage within the       United States.        This bill would authorize a pilot program at 10 or fewer       foreign last point of departure airports, permitting       passengers flying from these airports and their carry-on       baggage to continue to additional flights or flight segments       within the U.S. without additional security rescreening. U.S.       airlines have collaborated positively with the TSA on similar       initiatives for years, but unfortunately our collective       efforts have been stymied by outdated requirements in the       Aviation and Transportation Security Act.        By permitting the TSA to pilot a new concept in a safe and       controlled manner, it will be possible to demonstrate how       such security enhancement programs may be permanently and       broadly implemented. The bill is consistent with standards       and recommended practices set by the International Civil       Aviation Organization and puts the United States in a       position to lead the international community on modern       approaches to enhance aviation security.        Safety and security are always the top priorities of A4A       and our member airlines, and we are encouraged that this bill       maintains the high aviation security standards for flights       into and within the United States. Upon passage, we look       forward to continued collaboration with the TSA on all One-      Stop security efforts.        On behalf of the commercial U.S. aviation industry, A4A       strongly supports this legislation. Thank you for your       leadership on this issue.            Sincerely,                                                   Lauren Beyer,                          Vice President, Security and Facilitation,      Airlines for America.                                   ____                                             American Association of                                              Airport Executives,                                      Alexandria, VA, June 29, 2021.      Hon. John Katko,      Ranking Members, Committee on Homeland Security, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Ranking Member Katko: On behalf of the American       Association of Airport Executives (AAAE) and the thousands of       men and women across the country who manage and operate our       nation's airports, thank you for your continued leadership in       Congress on aviation security issues. I am writing to express       AAAE's support for the ``One Stop Pilot Program Act of 2021''       that you introduced earlier this week.        This legislation would permit the Transportation Security       Administration (TSA) to conduct a three-year pilot program at       up to 10 airports at which connecting passengers' and their       carry-on baggage would not need to be rescreened upon arrival       in the United States before connecting to another domestic       flight provided that the last point of departure airport has       a commensurate level of screening to the U.S. Some of AAAE's       airport members had been exploring this concept with TSA       prior to the COVID-19 pandemic as a way to eliminate       screening redundancy and improve passenger facilitation. We       appreciate the necessary changes your legislation would make       to permit this concept to be tested on a pilot basis.        Once international travel is allowed to fully resume, which       AAAE and our airport members are eagerly awaiting and working       to see implemented as quickly and safely as possible in       concert with the federal government, the One Stop Pilot       Program will provide additional passenger facilitation       solutions to make international travel more seamless and       secure.        We appreciate your efforts to advance this security       screening concept. Our member airports remain interested in       piloting this idea. AAAE stands ready to work with you to       advance this legislation.            Sincerely,                                                Stephanie K. Gupta,                                             Senior Vice President,      Security and Facilitation.                                   ____                                   Airports Council International,                                                      June 25, 2021.      Hon. John Katko,      Ranking Member, Committee on Homeland Security, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Ranking Member Katko: On behalf of Airports Council       International-North America, which represents local,       regional, and state governing bodies that own and operate       commercial airports throughout the United States, I want to       share our support of your new bill, H.R. 4094, the One-Stop       Pilot Program Act.        Airports welcome the introduction of this important       legislation to establish a pilot program at the U.S.       Department of Homeland Security that would allow passengers       and their baggage departing from approved foreign airports to       continue onto their connecting flights without having to go       through additional security screening. This one-stop security       pilot would create needed efficiencies by eliminating an       unnecessary and burdensome rescreening process for passengers       and baggage that were subject to a commensurate level of       screening at their departing airport. It also would allow TSA       to reallocate scarce resources to augment staffing at       checkpoint and checked baggage screening locations.        Thank you for your efforts to enhance aviation security and       the passenger experience at America's airports. I look       forward to  [[Page H5544]]       continuing to work with you on these important issues.            Sincerely,                                                 Kevin M. Burke,                                         President and CEO, Airports                              Council International--North America.     Mr. Speaker, lastly, I thank my friend, Representative  Stephanie Murphy from Florida, for her partnership on this bipartisan  bill, and I thank Chairman Thompson, my friend, for his commitment to  bringing it to the floor today.   Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to join me in supporting H.R. 4094.
