 Mr. President, I rise to recognize Shepherd Community  Center's 35 years of service to individuals and families on the near  eastside of Indianapolis, IN. Since 1985, this faith-based, inner-city  ministry has operated with the mission to ``break the cycle of poverty  on the near Eastside of Indianapolis by engaging and empowering the  community to cultivate healthy children, strong families, and vibrant  neighborhoods through a Christ-centered approach that meets the  physical, emotional, spiritual, and academic needs of our neighbors.''   Shepherd Community Center serves the near Eastside of Indianapolis,  where poverty rates in the area reach as high as 38.6 percent and 8 of  10 children rely on school as their primary source of food during the  week. Shepherd provides hope and support to its neighbors through a  unique and holistic approach Shepherd calls its Continuum of Care. The  Continuum of Care is a full set of programs that allows Shepherd to be  continuously engaged in the lives of neighborhood children, teens, and  their parents. It is designed to help area families overcome the  challenges they may be facing in all areas: physical, emotional,  spiritual, and academic.   Shepherd's approach has consistently yielded positive results, and  families in its programs have become stronger physically, emotionally,  spiritually, and financially. Shepherd's students also attain higher  academic achievement. In an area where only 33 percent of entering  freshmen graduate high school and only 75 percent of those who graduate  go on to college, nearly 90 percent of Shepherd's seniors graduate and  go on to college, job training, or the military.   Shepherd's history dates to the fall of 1984, when the Westside  Church of the Nazarene sent a group of volunteers to Central Nazarene  Church to serve a Thanksgiving meal. In February 1985, that simple meal  blossomed into an organization: Central Nazarene Mission. A few years  later, the name was changed to Shepherd Community Center. Reverend Dean  Cowles was the founding director and served in that role for Shepherd's  first 4 years. Reverend John Hay, Jr. served for the next few years.  Following Hay's departure, Cowles returned and served yet another 4  years. After a few years of transition, Reverend Jay Height was named  executive director in 1998 and continues to serve today.   And my friend Reverend Height has been a tireless champion for  families on the near Eastside every day since then. In a 35th  anniversary year when the COVID-19 pandemic compounded the challenges  facing families in the area, Reverend Height and the Shepherd Community  team met those challenges head on, and arm-in-arm with their neighbors.  In a recent article in the Indianapolis Star, Reverend Height said,  ``Hope is a precious commodity. When it's lost, the consequences for  human life are devastating.''   I agree, Reverend Height. And I know the countless families of  Indianapolis that Shepherd has served in its first 35 years are  eternally grateful that Shepherd has been a custodian of hope for our  capital city. On behalf of those families and the State of Indiana, I  congratulate you on the 35th anniversary of Shepherd Community Center,  I thank everyone who has worked and sacrificed in order to bless their  neighborhoods through the work of Shepherd and wish the Shepherd  Community Center all the best as it carries on that good and crucial  work.                            ____________________
