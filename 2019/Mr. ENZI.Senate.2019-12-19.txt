 Reserving the right to object.   Does that mean I won't get to give the comments before we vote? There  has to be some comments about the point of order. Looking at the clock,  the number of people waiting, it looks like I am being cut of that  time.   Would that be a correct interpretation?    Then I have no objection.    Madam President, I rise to raise a point of order on the  Further Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2020, which provides funding  for eight appropriations subcommittees and includes numerous tax and  healthcare provisions and other new legislation called  ``authorizations.'' That is code for bills that haven't been debated on  the Senate floor. These are Christmas presents for everyone, all put on  the Federal credit card, which is overspent already.   This legislation was unveiled Monday afternoon and totals more than  1,800 pages, and here we are on Thursday, with just hours to go before  a government shutdown, being asked to vote on a bill that has not been  subject to amendment or debate and that the Congressional Budget Office  tells us will increase deficits by more than $400 billion over the next  10 years. Actually, by the time you add in interest costs to this debt,  it is half a trillion in 10 years and $2.1 trillion on 20 years. That  is according to the Committee for Responsible Federal Budget, which  added in that interest. They added it up. So that will be half a  trillion dollars of new overspending in one vote, and what makes it so  expensive is that we are trying to do something here to buy everybody's  vote.   This bill completely bypassed regular order and violates nearly all  the Senate self-imposed budget rules with its billions of dollars in  giveaways and tax policy changes. We are legislating on funding bills.  Legislation is supposed to be scrutinized differently, especially if  they pay out real money.   I will remind my colleagues that our national debt stands at just  over $23 trillion, and the Congressional Budget Office tells us that  the Federal deficits are already on track to exceed $1 trillion this  year and every year thereafter. That is besides this $2.1 trillion add- on.   We should be talking about how to address the budgetary mess we are  in, not pressing the gas on an unsustainable fiscal trajectory, which  is exactly what this bill does. We are making promises that can't be  fulfilled.   Now, some people will mention the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, but I need  to emphasize and remind you that that boosted the economy. It created  jobs, it increased wages, and it is bringing in more revenue than ever  before--ever before. But we are spending it faster than it is coming  in. So it is not a revenue problem. It is a spending problem.   Now, rather than an aberration, busting has become commonplace. This  is the second time this week that I have come to the floor to raise a  point of order against legislation that violates the budget. But to be  fair, from a budget perspective, this bill is exponentially worse than  the Defense authorization bill we considered earlier this year. It is  at least 50 times worse.   I oppose this legislation. I oppose adding to the already massive  debt burden being placed on future generations.   The pending measure, the House amendment to the Senate amendment to  H.R. 1865, the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2020, would  cause a deficit increase of more than $5 billion in each of the four  consecutive 10-year periods beginning in fiscal year 2030. This  increase violates section 3101 of the 2016 budget resolution.  Therefore, I raise a point of order under section 3101(b) of S. Con.  Res. 11, the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2016.   I have been here long enough to know that you will now hear a list of  wonderful things that are on this bill. You will not hear how to pay  for all of these Christmas presents.  [[Page S7186]]    I yield the floor.    Mr. President, section 251 of the Balanced Budget and  Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, BBEDCA, establishes statutory  limits on discretionary spending and allows for various adjustments to  those limits. In addition, sections 302 and 314(a) of the Congressional  Budget Act of 1974 allow the chairman of the Budget Committee to  establish and make revisions to allocations, aggregates, and levels  consistent with those adjustments.   The Senate will soon consider two measures: the House amendment to  the Senate amendment to H.R. 1158, the Consolidated Appropriations Act,  2020, and the House amendment to the Senate amendment to H.R. 1865, the  Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020. These measures contain  spending that qualifies for cap adjustments under current law.   The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020 includes multiple instances  of cap adjustment eligible spending. The measure includes $70,855  million in spending designated as being for overseas contingency  operations, OCO, funding pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(A)(ii) of  BBEDCA. This budget authority, all of which falls into the revised  security category, would result in $40,336 million in outlays in fiscal  year 2020. The measure further includes $17,503 million in spending  designated for disaster relief pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(D) of  BBEDCA. This budget authority, all of which falls into the revised  nonsecurity category, would result in $984 million in outlays. The  measure also includes $1,771 million in revised security category  budget authority that is designated as an emergency pursuant to section  251(b)(2)(A)(i) of BBEDCA. CBO estimates that this budget authority, as  well as other emergency designated changes, would increase net outlays  by $914 million this fiscal year.   The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020, also includes $2,500  million in nonsecurity budget authority that is designated as being for  the periodic U.S. Census pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(G) of BBEDCA.  CBO estimates that this budget authority will result in $1,800 million  in outlays in fiscal year 2020. Earlier this year, I made an adjustment  to accommodate funding in this amount for this purpose and reaffirm  those funds for use for this measure.   The Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020 also includes  multiple instances of cap adjustment eligible spending. The measure  includes $8,645 million in spending designated as being for OCO funding  pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(A)(ii) of BBEDCA. This budget authority,  $645 million of which falls into the revised security category and  $8,000 million falls into the revised nonsecurity category, would  result in $2,327 million in outlays in fiscal year 2020. The measure  includes $1,842 million in spending designated for program integrity  pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(B), section 251(b)(2)(C), and section  251(b)(2)(E) of BBEDCA. This budget authority, all of which falls into  the revised nonsecurity category, would result in $1,481 million in  outlays. The measure also includes $6,764 million in revised  nonsecurity category budget authority that is designated as an  emergency pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(A)(i) of BBEDCA. CBO estimates  that this budget authority, as well as other emergency designated  changes, would increase net outlays by $1,705 million this fiscal year.   The Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020 also includes  $2,250 million in nonsecurity discretionary budget authority for  wildfire suppression operations pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(F) of  BBEDCA. This budget authority and its associated outlays of $2,250  million qualify for an adjustment under the law. Earlier this year, I  made an adjustment to accommodate funding in this amount for this  purpose and reaffirm those funds for use for this measure. As such, I  am revising the budget authority and outlay allocations to the  Committee on Appropriations by increasing revised nonsecurity budget  authority by $27,880 million, revised security budget authority by  $79,500 million, and general outlays by $47,747 million in fiscal year  2020. Further, I am increasing the budgetary aggregate for fiscal year  2020 by $107,126 million in budget authority and $47,534 million in  outlays.   I ask unanimous consent that this notice and the accompanying tables,  which provide details about the adjustment, be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                      REVISION TO BUDGETARY AGGREGATES  (Pursuant to Sections 311 and 314(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of                                   1974) ------------------------------------------------------------------------                  $s in millions                            2020 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Current Spending Aggregates:     Budget Authority...........................                3,708,996     Outlays....................................                3,685,541 Adjustments:     Budget Authority...........................                  107,126     Outlays....................................                   47,534 Revised Spending Aggregates:     Budget Authority...........................                3,816,122     Outlays....................................                3,733,075 ------------------------------------------------------------------------   [[Page S7196]]    REVISION TO SPENDING ALLOCATION TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS FOR                             FISCAL YEAR 2020  (Pursuant to Sections 302 and 314(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of                                   1974) ------------------------------------------------------------------------                  $s in millions                            2020 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Current Allocation:     Revised Security Discretionary Budget                        666,500      Authority.................................
