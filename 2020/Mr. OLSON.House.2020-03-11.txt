 Madam Speaker, I rise to invite the entire Congress and  all my fellow Texans, especially my neighbors in Texas 22, to the  biggest Texas-size birthday party of 2020.   This picture to my left is pure Brookwood. They are turning 35 years  old this year. Since 1985, citizens at Brookwood with mental and  physical challenges are taught real job skills. They are infused with  pride, self-worth, and Christian love.   Brookwood was started by Yvonne Streit. Her 1-year-old daughter,  Vicki, had severe brain damage. Yvonne had a mission. From her backyard  to churches to the current two campuses with 230 or more citizens,  Brookwood is making their citizens in Texas better every single day.   Their official birthday party is April 3 at 11 a.m. The catering is  done by the Brookwood Cafe. If you want a belly full of food and a  heart full of Christian love, come see us in Brookwood.                            ____________________
