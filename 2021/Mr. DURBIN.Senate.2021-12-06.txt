 Madam President, I learned this morning about the passing  of Senator Robert Dole. What an extraordinary person he was.   It was not my good fortune to serve with him in the U.S. Senate, but  as a Member of the House of Representatives, I knew his work.   (Ms. DUCKWORTH assumed the Chair.)   I can remember when we enacted the Americans with Disabilities Act.  Tom Harkin was our leader on the Democratic side. He had a member of  his family who suffered a disability, and Tom was always sensitive to  that. But Bob Dole's leadership on the other side, from the Republican  side, made a remarkable difference because we knew that Bob Dole was  not speaking about disability as some other person's experience but,  frankly, his own.   I don't know what measure of courage Bob Dole showed before he served  the United States in World War II, but we all knew that experience led  him to a battleground injury, which he carried the rest of his life. It  was amazing to me that he kept his public life so active despite the  limitations that he faced. His loss of use of one arm put him in a  position where he was compromised in many ways every single day. Yet he  soldiered on, literally, to serve his Nation, not only in the Armed  Forces but also in the U.S. Senate to pass legislation, major  legislation like the Americans with Disabilities Act. It is remarkable  that he lived as long as he did and faced the injuries that he did.   I would say, Madam President, you know better than most what we are  speaking of with Senator Dole's contribution to his country and the  battle he continued to wager the rest of his life.   I respect him so much and hope the Senate will just pause for a  moment to not only reflect on him, Elizabeth Dole, and his family but  also on the fact that his bipartisanship made the difference in the  lives of ordinary Americans. He was willing to sit down with the party  on the other side of the aisle, compromise, and be determined to get  things done. Shouldn't we do the same in his honor? I think we should.    I announce that the Senator from Oregon (Mr. Merkley),  the Senator from Oregon (Mr. Wyden) and the Senator from Arizona (Ms.  Sinema) are necessarily absent.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 3313         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.
