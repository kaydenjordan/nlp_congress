 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I  rise in support of the War Powers Resolution as an original cosponsor.  This is a grave and pivotal moment in American history, and we must be  greatly concerned for the security of our troops and the safety of the  American people.   We live in an era of hybrid warfare and high-intensity reaction. One  reckless military strike can incentivize countermeasures, not just in  the immediate region, but thousands of miles away by Iran's proxies.  Wise use of force matters.   Without congressional authorization, and in defiance of our  Constitution, this President ordered an unprecedented strike on Iran's  top generals.   There is no doubt Soleimani was a fierce enemy of liberty. However,  this Lone Ranger attack by the President risks all-out war, greater  instability in Iraq and Iran, losing the edge we have gained at such  great cost; and some of those names have been put on the Record today.   We must protect against further attacks on our servicemembers and  attacks on U.S. assets, wherever they might exist.    To those ends, the American people deserve full  transparency. The President must take steps to de-escalate this highly  volatile situation in a most ungovernable part of the world.   Let us rigorously pursue, with our allies, turning back Iran's  development of nuclear weapons. And let us do all we can to uphold our  beloved Constitution, put raging bulls back in their cages, and make  the American people safer.
