 Mr. Speaker, I would like to invite the entire  Texas delegation to be up here with me, and if you are a Member from a  district that has had a school shooting, would you please come stand  with us.   Mr. Speaker, on Friday morning, at 7:30, evil reared its ugly head in  a little community, what I call a salt-of-the-Earth community, Santa  Fe, Texas, and 10 people tragically lost their lives.   I would ask all Members to please stand.   We lost two teachers on that day: Cynthia Tisdale and Glenda Ann  Perkins. We lost students Kimberly  [[Page H4268]]  Vaughan, Shana Fisher, Angelique Ramirez, Christian Riley Garcia, Jared  Black, Sabika Sheikh, Christopher Jake Stone, and Aaron Kyle McLeod,  lives that should have never been ended.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to request a moment of silence.                            ____________________
