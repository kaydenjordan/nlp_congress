 Mr. Chair, I have a question for the chairman of the  MILCON Committee about the language in his committee report regarding  colorectal cancer screening in the VA.   Mr. Chairman, in his report, Mr. Dent encourages the VA to increase  colorectal cancer screening in the Department of Veterans Affairs. In  the other body, they have language that directs the VA to offer each  one of the seven approaches for screening that are currently approved  by the United States Preventive Services Task Force and are more  closely aligned with other Federal health programs.   Can I assume that the intention is the same and the efforts are aimed  at urging the VA to offer all of the approved methods of screening?    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for that clarification.
