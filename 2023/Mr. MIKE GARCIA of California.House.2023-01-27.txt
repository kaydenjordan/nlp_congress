 Mr. Speaker, it is with great sorrow  but also with great pride that I rise today to honor the life of one of  my constituents, a hero of America's Greatest Generation.   On December 6, 2022, Mr. Lou Moore, a veteran of World War II and a  truly valiant warrior who took the fight to the Nazis in Europe, passed  just shortly after turning 100 years old.   Today, he is with the Lord. I had the pleasure of presenting Lou with  the Congressional Gold Medal last year. While he was a man of small  physical stature, his heart, his love of country, and his passion for  this beautiful Nation's youth and its veterans were of mammoth  proportions.   My friend Lou cherished the marriage he had with his true love, his  wife, Nellie. While she passed away slightly before Lou, he always had  family in our district in the form of thousands of veterans throughout  our area. They loved him dearly.   Lou blessed us with his special gifts of patriotism and honor, and  God blessed us with Lou's presence and, now, has brought him home.   We are all grateful for the life of a truly great American, Mr. Lou  Moore.                            ____________________
