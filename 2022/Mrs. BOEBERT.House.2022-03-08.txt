 Mr. Speaker, I rise today having received a message  from the mother of a young American hero, Lance Corporal Kareem Nikoui,  who tragically and unnecessarily lost his life during the Biden  administration's catastrophic withdrawal from Afghanistan.   She encouraged me to publicly share her message, which in part read:         Mrs. Boebert, I am the mother of Lance Corporal Kareem       Nikoui, one of the 13 killed in Kabul. I wish more people had       the backbone that you have. When I heard you say, ``13 of       them,'' my heart dropped, my eyes filled with tears, and I       was so happy to hear about our 13 kids at that very moment.       You have no idea how much that meant to me.        We have been lied to over and over, and then we watch this       administration act as if it never happened. The pain of       losing my son is unbearable.        Just know when I heard you say, ``13 of them,'' it gave me       hope to help us get some type of justice about what this       corrupt administration has done and is still doing. Thank       you.    Mr. Speaker, I am happy to say it was impossible to ignore our 13  servicemembers, and they will continue to be honored and remembered,  despite their Commander in Chief intending to ignore them.                            ____________________
