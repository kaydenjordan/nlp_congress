 Mr. Speaker, the Democrats printed and spent  trillions of dollars we didn't have, and they unleashed the worst  inflation in 40 years. They waged war on capitalism and the energy  industry and produced an economic recession.   Now, they are doubling down on these foolish policies. The more that  some people invest in their mistakes, the less willing they are to  admit them.   They are adding 87,000 new IRS agents--that is larger than the entire  population of Flint, Michigan--in order to collect $200 billion in new  taxes, mostly from middle-class families and shopkeepers who don't have  the resources to contest expensive audits.   They are adding $300 billion in new corporate taxes, which will be  passed on to families as higher prices, lower wages, and lower returns.   All of this is to give away three-quarters of a trillion dollars more  of your earnings to their green energy cronies and other political  supporters. That averages about $6,000 per household.   Just as you cannot drink yourself sober, you cannot spend your way  out of inflation, or tax yourself out of recession, or borrow your way  out of debt. Yet, that is exactly what the Democrats claim they can do.  What makes them think socialism will work any better here than  everywhere else in the world that it has been tried?   This bill takes our country further into this dismal future, and only  more suffering and poverty will come of it.
