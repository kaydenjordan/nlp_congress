 Mr. Speaker, 51, that is how many days until our  official withdrawal from Afghanistan; 800, that is how many days it  takes to process a single special immigrant visa; 21,000, that is how  many of our Afghan allies put their lives on the line, not just for  their country, but for ours, who are at risk of being beaten, tortured,  beheaded, and slaughtered by the Taliban. And make no mistake, if they  can get their hands on our friends, that is what the Taliban will do.   So the math is clear. We are out of time. The stakes are clear. Our  reputation as a country, our ability to find allies in future  conflicts, the willingness of people all over the globe to work for  America because they trust us to uphold our own values, that is what is  on the line.   We have to pass the Allies Act. The administration needs to conduct a  full evacuation because we do not leave people behind. We are the  United States of America. Let's remind the world of that today.
