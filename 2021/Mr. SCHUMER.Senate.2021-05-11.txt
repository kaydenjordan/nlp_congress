 First, let me thank our chair of the Banking Committee,  someone who has fought against the abuses in the financial services  industry throughout his career, Senator Brown. Let me also thank  Senator Van Hollen, who, again, has been one of those leaders doing  great things to help people who are often taken advantage of.   Now, for millions of working Americans, one of the most dangerous  things that can happen is falling victim to predatory lenders.  Unscrupulous actors have always promised quick cash or credit to people  with unexpected expenses or financial difficulties, only to trap them  with crippling interest rates that can erase a person's life savings or  even claim their homes. They are in trouble. They reach out to the  lifeline, and the lifeline is a trap. Often they are trapped for years  and even some for their whole lives.   That is why more than 40 States have passed laws that prohibit this  behavior and placed limits on interest rates made by nonbank lenders.  It runs the gamut from liberal California to conservative Texas.   Inexplicably--inexplicably--the Trump administration decided to give  these predatory lenders a massive loophole to circumvent State law and  once again prey on low-income Americans. Under the Trump  administration's rule, so long as payday lenders found a bank to  provide the cash upfront and attach their name to the transaction,  interest rates in the triple digits were suddenly OK, even if the  States explicitly banned it.   It is despicable and so typical of the Trump administration not  caring about average folks at all and just listening to the special  interests. It had devastating consequences for working families and for  small businesses.   In New York, the owner of a southern food restaurant in Harlem took  out a $67,000 loan from a fraudulent lender to make renovations to  their restaurant. They fell behind on payments and tried to work with  their lender when COVID hit and realized that their loan had an APR of  268 percent. Rather than work toward a solution, the lender went to the  bank to try and foreclose on their property--their property in which  they had put blood and sweat and tears--stating that the Trump rule  gave them the grounds to do so. It mattered little that New York State  law had a 268-percent interest rate as blatantly illegal.   So today's vote is simple. It would revoke the Trump administration's  so-called true lender rule that permits predatory lenders to exploit  small businesses and working Americans. In the middle of a pandemic,  the last thing we should be doing is perpetrating a rule that makes it  easier for payday lenders to scam working people and business owners.   With today's vote, the Senate stands up for working families and  small businesses all across the country by repealing this terrible,  essentially Scrooge-like rule pushed by former President Trump and his  allies.   And one final point for those who say elections don't make a  difference. Just look at this. Here was a rule protecting people-- States protected people. The Trump administration comes in and rips  away those protections, leaving so many people bare and defenseless  because they were desperate; they need the money.   Elections occur. A new Democratic President, a Democratic Senate, and  this horrible, horrible rule change by the Trump administration is  undone. We go back to giving some help and protection to working  families and small business people.   This story could be repeated not just with CRAs but up and down the  line--up and down the line. Elections do make a difference, and today's  vote shows one of many examples.                             Vote on S.J. Res. 15    I yield the floor and, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that  all remaining time be yielded back.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Let me first commend my colleague from Ohio for the  excellent work, not only moving this forward but the vote counting that  he did, which worked with a little bit of margin of error.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session.    Mr. President, pursuant to S. Res. 27, the Finance  Committee being tied on the question of reporting, I move to discharge  the Senate Finance Committee from further consideration of the  nomination of Chiquita Brooks-LaSure, of Virginia, to be Administrator  of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.    Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, we  expect a vote on the motion to discharge to occur around noon tomorrow,  Wednesday, May 12.   I yield the floor.
