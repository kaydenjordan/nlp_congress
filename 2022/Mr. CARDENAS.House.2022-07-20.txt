 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor and congratulate a  tremendous community leader, a friend of mine, and a friend of the  community of Los Angeles and beyond, Irene Tovar, for being conferred  an honorary doctorate from California State University at Northridge,  otherwise known  [[Page H6886]]  as CSUN, for her decades of public service as an advocate for education  in the San Fernando Valley, throughout the State of California, and  across the country.   I think of a quote from Saint Francis of Assisi: ``Start by doing  what is necessary; and then do what is possible; and suddenly you are  doing the impossible.'' That is Irene Tovar.   Irene's story begins like many of ours: in search of the American  Dream. Her mother is from Salamanca, Guanajuato, Mexico, and her father  is from Jerez, Zacatecas, Mexico. Her parents met in southern  California, where later they married. They first settled in East Los  Angeles, where Irene, her sister, and her brother were born, and then  they moved to Pacoima and lived on Pinney Street.   Irene was a dedicated student and attended Pacoima Elementary School,  San Fernando High School, and San Fernando Valley State College, which  is now known as Cal State University Northridge.   While attending CSUN, Irene, who earned a bachelor's degree in social  science from the university in 1969, noticed that the dropout rate for  Latino students was disproportionately high, so she helped create an  organization to address the issue.   It grew into the Latin American Civic Association, known as LACA,  which administered the first Head Start program in the San Fernando  Valley. This organization helps thousands of working families access  quality childcare and education.   Alongside leaders such as Dr. Rudy Acuna, Irene began to advocate and  organize for the creation of the Equal Opportunity Program and the  Chicano Studies Department at California State University Northridge.   The Chicano Studies Department was established in 1969 with only 100  students. Now, it is one of the largest Chicano studies departments in  the country.   Her advocacy caught the attention of then-Governor Jerry Brown, who,  during his first tenure, appointed Irene to the State Personnel Board.  She was the first Mexican American and first person of color to sit on  the board.   She was instrumental in implementing policies and procedures that  removed artificial barriers in the California civil service system,  including differential pay and affirmative action. She also served as a  full-time member of the California Public Employment Relations Board, a  quasi-judicial body she joined in 1974.   Irene's passion for education and public service continues. She  currently serves as the CEO of LACA, which now focuses on providing  multifamily services and affordable housing.   Irene has played a key role in the history of the San Fernando Valley  as a founding member of the L.A. Mission College, board member of the  United Way, board member of the L.A. Urban Coalition, board member of  the CSUN Alumni Association, and many other organizations.   She currently serves as a commissioner on the City of Los Angeles  Human Relations Commission, whose mission is to promote intergroup  peace-building, equity, and human rights.   Irene, your service is unparalleled, and this doctorate is a symbol  of your sacrifice and hard work for the families of the San Fernando  Valley, the great State of California, and our country.   Congratulations, Irene, and I am proud to call you Dr. Irene Tovar.                     Honoring the Life of Rodrigo Garcia     Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of a  trailblazer who made a difference across this country.   Rodrigo ``Rod'' Garcia, founder of the Society of Hispanic  Professional Engineers, otherwise known as SHPE, was a man of deep  conviction and passion. Not only did he commit to his work as an  engineer, but he opened a door for so many, including myself, to follow  in his footsteps.   As one of the only handful of Hispanic engineers during the 1973 tech  boom, he could easily have gone on to a promising career in the  sciences. But when he saw a wrong, he set out to right that wrong.   In gathering a cohort of fellow Hispanic engineers, he was determined  to diversify the STEM industry across our country, and that is when  SHPE was born.   While Rod Garcia was an incredible man, his legacy in SHPE is equally  incredible. Now, the organization has grown into the largest Hispanic  STEM association nationwide, with 13,000 members and 286 chapters  across the country.   An engineer to his core, Mr. Garcia attributed the success of SHPE as  such: ``We were engineers. We drew up the plan. . . . To see it take  off the way it has, it is really special.'' And special it is.   SHPE's impact is only growing. In the 2021-2022 academic year, SHPE  awarded scholarships to over 200 students across the country,  distributing over $1.3 million.   Rod has passed on, and he will be sorely missed, but his reputation  and his memory will live on forever.                            ____________________     Mr. Chair, had I been present, I would have voted  ``yea'' on rollcall No. 379.
