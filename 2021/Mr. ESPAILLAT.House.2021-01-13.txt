 Madam Speaker, today I cast my vote for the second  time to impeach Donald J. Trump. He is unfit to hold office. He  summonsed and dispatched his mob to kidnap and hurt many of us. He is  unfit to hold office.   He summonsed and dispatched his mob to assassinate Vice President  Pence, to assassinate Speaker Pelosi. He is unfit to hold office.   He summonsed and dispatched a mob that waved the racist Confederate  flag and assaulted this Capitol, resulting in the death of five  Americans, including two Capitol Police officers. He is unfit to hold  office. We must impeach now.
