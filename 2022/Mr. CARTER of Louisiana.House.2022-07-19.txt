 Mr. Chair, I thank Chairwoman DeLauro very  much for the opportunity to speak.   Last year, Hurricane Ida swept through my State, leaving in its wake  a shocking, terrible path of destruction. This body saw the devastation  of this storm and saw fit to make an immediate downpayment so that the  recovery could begin in Louisiana as we assessed the incredible damage.   Implied in that downpayment was a commitment to come back and do more  when Louisiana determined its actual need. My State, and many people  here, are asking this body to keep its commitment.   Disaster knows no boundary. It can and will hit all of our districts  unexpectedly. I promise to be with you when it does. Today, I need this  body to stand with me and pass additional hurricane relief funding so  that the people of Louisiana can fully recover.   Mr. Chair, I urge the passage of en bloc No. 2.
