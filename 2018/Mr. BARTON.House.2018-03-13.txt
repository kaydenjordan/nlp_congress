 Mr. Speaker, I have listened to my friends on the  minority talk about the reasons they are opposing this bill, and a  normal piece of legislation that would have some merit didn't go  through regular order, things of this sort. But, Mr. Speaker, when the  house is burning down and you need the fire department, you don't ask  if they followed proper procedure to get somebody out there to put out  the fire.   My brother had liver cancer at the age of 44. He had tried every  conventional therapy known to modern medicine, and it wasn't working.  Now, he had a brother, myself, who was a subcommittee chairman of the  committee of jurisdiction over the FDA. I contacted the FDA, and we got  him in a special protocol for an investigational drug that was under  approval. It wasn't approved. And the doctors and the people at the FDA  told my brother and his family: If it works, it is going to really help  you. But if it doesn't, you are going to die sooner.   Well, he was going to die anyway, Mr. Speaker. So he signed the  informed consent and he took the drug and it didn't work, but he had  that last shot. Now, I don't know what this debate about false hope is.  When you have no hope, perhaps false hope is better than none at all.   All this bill does is let people who have no other hope for  conventional therapy, if a drug has at least passed stage one at the  FDA approval process, and their doctor thinks it will help them, if  they give an informed consent, they can try it.   Now, my friends on the Democratic side are correct that, most of the  time under the existing protocol, the FDA approves it without a  problem. But why should the FDA approve it if you are about to die  anyway? That is what this bill does. By the way, it passed the Senate  with unanimous consent. Now, that is a miracle in itself.   Let's pass it here in the House and give hope a chance for these  patients who are terminally ill and have no hope at all today.
