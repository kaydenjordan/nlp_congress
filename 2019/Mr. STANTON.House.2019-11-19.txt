 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the ongoing  efforts to secure our Nation's economy. In Arizona, that means giving  job creators, large and small, access to markets in Mexico and Canada.   Sadly, Arizona's recent trade history was shaped by State leaders who  damaged our relationship with Mexico with divisive, self-defeating  rhetoric and policies, such as SB 1070. That hurt our economy and cost  us jobs.   So, as Phoenix mayor, I worked overtime to rebuild those  relationships, leading 18 trade missions to Mexico and Canada. Our  business community helped me make the case for increasing trade, and we  saw results.   Since 2012, while the Nation's exports grew 0.1 percent, Phoenix's  exports grew 20 percent. In 2017, trade with Mexico and Canada produced  nearly $10 billion in exports statewide.   Simply put, trade with our North American allies is essential to  Arizona's economy. Now we have a real opportunity to improve these  relationships through the USMCA. A new trade agreement, with improved  labor standards, can provide certainty for small and medium-sized  businesses.   Trade with our North American allies provides paychecks to more than  230,000 Arizona workers, and it is Congress' duty to reassert its role  in U.S. trade policy.   I thank Speaker Pelosi, Chairman Neal, and the working group for  working so hard on getting this agreement done. I continue to be  encouraged by the progress being made on USMCA.                            ____________________
