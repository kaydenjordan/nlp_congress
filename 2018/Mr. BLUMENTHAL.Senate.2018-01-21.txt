 Mr. President, we have heard some highly partisan  [[Page S413]]  and passionate speeches on the floor of the Senate and a lot of finger- pointing. The American people are done with the blaming and the finger- pointing; they want the government to be reopened. All of us do too.  That is why a number of our colleagues are working hard and have been  involved--many of us, directly and indirectly--in promoting and  suggesting possible solutions, reaching across the aisle, working to  reach a consensus and to make sure the government is reopened.   The President has been absent--some would say absent without leave,  AWOL--from these negotiations. Ironically, he is the only one in  America who has referred to this as a ``good shutdown.'' It is a Trump  shutdown because the President has enabled--indeed, encouraged--it to  happen.   Across the aisle in the Senate, there are efforts to provide  leadership and to fill the gap that has been created by a President who  is AWOL in America. The lack of leadership is potentially tragic for  this country. He has thrived on chaos and confusion, personal invective  and insult.   The time is now for us in this body to fill that vacuum. We are  divided in our Nation in many ways, but we are united in support of our  military men and women. Two of my sons have served. And always in this  Chamber and throughout the country, there is support for them and their  families, who equally serve and sacrifice.   No speech on the floor here and no tweet by the President will change  that fundamental unity and bipartisan support for our military men and  women. That is why there was bipartisan support for rejecting a short- term, ``kick the can down the road'' patch in a continuing resolution.   A continuing resolution that flatlines funding for our national  defense, both military and nonmilitary, is against our national  interest. The most eloquent and persuasive voice on that topic is our  Secretary of Defense, General Mattis.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the September 8 letter be  printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                               Secretary of Defense,                                                        Pentagon,                                  Washington, DC, September 8, 2017.      Hon. John McCain,      Chairman, Committee on Armed Services,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing in response to your August       29, 2017 letter regarding the potential impacts of another       fiscal year under Continuing Resolution (CR) authority. I       appreciate and share your concern in this matter.        Long term CRs impact the readiness of our forces and their       equipment at a time when security threats are extraordinarily       high. The longer the CR, the greater the consequences for our       force. A CR, if required, avoids a government shutdown and       provides an opportunity for a longterm solution that lifts       the BCA caps.        In the long term, it is the budget caps mandated in the       Budget Control Act (BCA) that impose the greater threat to       the Department and to national security. BCA-level funding       reverses the gains we have made in readiness, and undermines       our efforts to increase lethality and grow the force. Without       relief from the BCA caps, our air, land, and sea fleets will       continue to erode. BCA caps obstruct our path to       modernization, and continue to narrow the technical       competitive advantage we presently maintain over our       adversaries.        The Service Secretaries and Chiefs have identified many of       their specific concerns about operating under a CR       (enclosed). I appreciate that you share our concerns, and       look forward to working with you in FY18 as we build a       solution to alleviate the BCA caps.        I have provided similar letters to the other Chairs and       Ranking Members of the House and Senate Committees on Armed       Services and Appropriations.      James N. Mattis.                                   ____        Impacts of a Continuing Resolution Authority in Fiscal Year 2018         This summary describes the most likely impacts of operating       under a Continuing Resolution (CR), if enacted for Fiscal       Year 2018 (FY18). The impacts of a CR depend in part on the       level of funding provided and the duration of the CR period.        The Military Departments and Defense Agencies are       justifiably concerned that under a CR, the Department cannot       reprogram FY18 funds until a full appropriation is enacted.       Inability to reprogram CR funds drastically reduces the       ability to respond to urgent requirements or to address       funding gaps that damage readiness.        During a CR, we remain committed to supporting the       warfighter. The Military Departments will realign or execute       CR and existing budgetary resources within the limits of       their authorities to fully support forward-deployed       operations, direct support activities, and urgent operations       of the Combatant Commands. Finding ways to fully fund such       essential activities while operating during a CR does not       make CRs any less disruptive or detrimental--in reality,       doing so imposes a great burden on DoD's foundational       capabilities, and immediately manifests in impacts on       training, readiness and maintenance, personnel, and       contracting.        Training: Impacts begin immediately, within the first 30       days of a CR. By 90 days, the lost training is unrecoverable       due to subsequent scheduled training events. These training       losses reduce the effectiveness of subsequent training events       in FY18 and in subsequent years.        Most major exercises and training events are scheduled for       the spring and summer, and presume individual and unit-level       training was completed. Training scheduled during the period       of the CR, however, must be re-scoped and scaled to       incorporate only mission essential tasks and objectives, so       units enter the major exercises less prepared.        For example, the scope of a Joint live fire field training       exercise (FTX) scheduled to execute in conjunction with       annual Marine Corps weapons certification events may have to       be reduced during a CR by limiting weapons crews to firing at       levels that firing tables specify as necessary to maintain       certification, thus forgoing the added training benefit of       firing weapon systems in a Joint operational context. Without       this experience, the Marines would then enter their major       exercises and training rotations without the benefit of       having practiced coordinating joint fires, or the experience       of firing in an operational environment.        Air Force must preserve core readiness training for       deployed or next-to-deploy units, at the cost of       institutional training and flying hours. Lack of funds to       stand-up two F-16 training squadrons, reduced aircraft       availability, and inability to grow the force (military and       civilian) will further reduce pilot production, leaving the       Air Force unable to train the number of pilots necessary for       continued readiness recovery. Cancellation of exercises will       further degrade pilot training and readiness.        Readiness and Maintenance: The impacts of a CR are felt       immediately, and grow exponentially over time. Although       maintenance impacts can be mitigated for some activities       operating under a 3-month CR, in areas such as Navy Ship       Depot Maintenance, funding shortfalls result in delays in       Naval vessel availability, which may affect subsequent       deployment rotations.        Under a CR, funding reductions will impact all major       activities not related to deployed forces, including: depot       maintenance, individual and collective training, and       munitions procurement. Failure to properly fund readiness       restoration initiatives in a stable and consistent manner       will impede the recovery of our readiness, which has just       begun to see tangible results, and may prove fatal in a       future conflict with major-power adversaries. Furthermore, a       ready force requires continued and stable investment in our       munitions inventory and a CR will not provide the Services       the necessary flexibility to procure and develop weapons, nor       build sufficient infrastructure to align with the       Department's readiness recovery efforts.        Navy will delay the induction of 11 ships, which will       exacerbate the planned ship maintenance in FY18, and will       slip ship availabilities into FY19, further impacting that       plan. FY18 Ship availabilities considered for schedule slip:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------               Ship                   Planned Start         Location ------------------------------------------------------------------------  KIDD DDG-100...................  19 Nov............

Virginia MAHAN DDG-72....................  19 Feb............  Virginia ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Under a 90-Day CR, all listed ship inductions will be delayed, as the   shipyards' capacity is not capable of fully ``catching-up'' lost work,   thus the entire schedule slips to the right. This means that even a   relatively short CR creates delays in ship depot maintenance, thus   deployment timelines, into subsequent years.         Under a 3 month CR, Army will defer supply transactions,       and then later have to pay more to get parts fabricated or       shipped quickly, in order to keep up with maintenance       timelines. Under a 6 month CR, Army will order parts from       sources outside the DoD supply system, just to keep up with       operational demand. These external transactions will cost       more and fail to leverage the efficiencies built into the       centralized supply system.        Under a CR, the Army will have about $400 million per month       less in their operating accounts. Beginning in a 3 month CR,       it will be forced to restrict home station training        Immediately under a CR, Army will postpone all non-critical       maintenance work orders until later in the year.        Within the first 3 months of CR, Navy will reduce flying       hours and steaming days for those units not deployed or next       to deploy. It will delay the replenishment of spares and       repair parts on supply shelves in our ships, submarines, and       aircraft carriers across the non-deployed Fleet.        The Military Departments will limit execution of       infrastructure funding by prioritizing life, health and       safety requirements. For the Air Force, this will affect 79       major installations worldwide and negatively impact aircraft       bed-downs and mission generation.  [[Page S414]]         The lack of a National Defense Authorization Act, the legal       requirement for specific appropriations for major military       construction projects, and new start restrictions within the       CR combine to mean that no new major military construction       projects can be initiated using CR funds, with an inevitable       delay in project schedules and potential increased costs. For       the Navy this will impact 37 projects; the Air Force has 16       projects; the Army has 38 projects.        Personnel: The uncertainty imposed during a 3-month CR       causes most hiring actions and recruitment to be curtailed,       and vacancies to then be re-announced once an appropriation       is enacted. This disruption leaves critical gaps in the       workforce skill set and causes unnecessary angst among       military and: civil servants, making the Government a far       less attractive option to the highest-skilled potential       candidates.        Both Congress and the President agree need exists to add       military personnel to meet critical skill gaps such as       pilots, maintainers, cyber experts, and nuclear trained       personnel. A CR will delay the accession process, with the       consequence that units and organizations will continue to       lack the full complement of personnel they need to be       effective.        Professional development and training for both military and       civilians will be delayed.        Non-critical travel, which includes PCS moves for civilians       and military members and their families, will be curtailed.       This often results in missed hiring opportunities as       potential employees pursue other options. It creates       unnecessary turmoil for families who had otherwise planned to       relocate, whose orders are delayed; and may then result in       missed schoolyear timing for dependent spouses and children.        Adverse outcomes for medical beneficiaries experiencing       potentially life threatening illnesses due to delays in       receiving the required treatment. Beneficiary health care is       an entitlement and there is no mechanism to slow down or       reduce the demand for services.        Payments to medical care providers for services rendered       for patients will be delayed. This results in a potential       reduction in future access to private sector health care for       DoD beneficiaries, as a result of providers discontinuing       services to patients paid by TRICARE.        Contracting: The impacts of a CR on DoD contracting efforts       are significant and begin within the first 30 days of each       CR. Every contract that has to be re-competed represents       additional work for the already-pressed DoD acquisition       workforce. In addition to these increased administrative       costs, new start rules and funding constraints carried       forward under each CR extension combine to increase the       likelihood that costs of material and labor in the contracts       themselves will also grow. To the vendors and manufacturers,       the Government becomes a less reliable, higher-risk customer.        As is the case in the private sector, DoD saves money by       buying in quantity. When we are forced to sever contracts and       renegotiate terms with each CR, our costs grow to offset the       increased risks and delays; we offer vendors less stability       and predictability, and pay accordingly.        Acquisition programs are forced to use incremental contract       actions to preserve efforts and schedules, which inevitably       results in higher program costs and schedule delays. Each       iteration of contract rework further taxes the DoD       Contracting community, doubling or tripling their workload       annually.        Under a CR, there are generally no new-starts, and no       production rate increases for acquisition programs with       budgetary program quantities of record.        In FYl8:        In the first 3 months under a CR, the Army has 18 new       starts and 8 production rate increases that would be       impacted. These include the Paladin Integration Management       Improvement, Interim Combat Service rifle, Multi-role Anti-      armor Anti-personnel Weapon System, Lightweight 30mm cannon       and the Armored Multi-purpose Vehicle. Rate increases are       planned for handguns, TOW2 missiles, M240L medium machine gun       and the Advanced Tactical Parachute system.        Beyond three months (4-12 months), the Army would have 24       additional new starts and 7 additional production rate       increases. The new starts include the Udairi Range Target       Lifters, Heavy Equipment Transporter System, and the Modular       Catastrophic Recovery System. Production rate increases       include modifications to Stinger and Avenger, Guided Multiple       Launch Rocket System, and the Reduced Range Practice Rocket.        The Navy has 7 procurement contracts that will be delayed       by a 6-month CR due to the new start restrictions. It also       has 12 planned production rate increases that will be       deferred and 3 research and development new starts.        The Air Force has a total of 6 new starts that would be       impacted by a 6-month CR. These include multiple F-15C and F-      16 upgrades and the Joint Space Operations Center Mission       system.        Funding limitations for all resarch and development will       result in the Services assessing the relative priorities of       their programs, resulting in providing only minimum       sustaining funding to the selected programs.     Mr. President, Secretary Mattis informed Congress:         Long term CRs impact the readiness of our forces and their       equipment at a time when security threats are extraordinarily       high. The longer the CR, the greater the consequences for our       force.    So my Republican colleagues should take no solace in the harmful CR-- whether it is 3 weeks or 4 weeks--that they are continuing to insist  that the U.S. Senate approve.   In fact, I believe we can fully fund our government today without  requiring the mass draconian deportation of children in March, without  abandoning our commitment to opioid treatment programs, without ending  the Children's Health Insurance Program, without forgoing community  health centers, and without forgoing pensions our veterans need. We can  do all of it. We must do all of it. The elements of consensus are  there. There is bipartisan support for every one of these programs.   Opioid treatment and addiction were supported in the Cures Act, as  well as other measures, by overwhelming bipartisan consensus. We all  support opioid treatment programs.   We support addressing the pension needs of veterans of this Nation  and their challenges. We cannot abandon them.   We support making sure there is disaster relief for Puerto Rico,  Texas, and Florida.   We support measures that will preserve the Children's Health  Insurance Program and the community health centers.   These measures should not be options, luxuries, or choices. We have  an obligation. We are a nation strong enough in the courage of our  convictions to do all of it and to meet the obligation.   It is a moral obligation and an economic obligation to provide a path  to citizenship for the Dreamers. We have a moral obligation because we  made a promise--great nations keep their promises--to those 800,000  young people brought to this country as infants and children without  any choice of their own. There is a bipartisan consensus to give them  that path to citizenship.   There is growing acceptance of the funding that the minority leader,  Senator Schumer, put on the table to build a wall, if that is what is  necessary to achieve a compromise. It is a compromise on our part, but  that is what an agreement is. Each side must give something.   There is bipartisan consensus for every one of these elements, and  every one of them should be part of a full budget. A full budget is  what is necessary.   Most Americans want their government open. Most Americans want  bipartisan agreement that will keep their friends--coworkers, neighbors  who were brought to this country as children--safe from arbitrary  seizure and deportation from the only home they have ever known. Most  Americans recognize that moral obligation, and most Americans recognize  the economic advantages. According to the Joint Committee on Taxation,  half a trillion dollars would be lost in economic activity and in  workforce contribution if there were these mass deportations.   Most Americans want us to face our national opioid addiction  epidemic. Americans want community health centers and a host of our  pressing priorities that were all pushed aside, delayed, and denied in  the mad dash by our Republican colleagues for a tax bill that benefits  mainly the rich.   The Republicans who have spoken today seem to imply we have to make a  choice. They want to falsely blame or frame this debate as if we must  choose between the Dreamers and our troops. That is a false choice. It  is an unnecessary and, in fact, irrelevant choice. There is no such  choice that has to be made. We can do both.   A great nation can be strong militarily and also be a nation that  keeps its promises. In fact, the two go together.   We are a nation of immigrants. Our strength is our diversity, and we  have made a promise to the Dreamers, and that promise is one that we  must keep.   The senior Senator from Missouri, Mrs. McCaskill, came to the floor  to pass a simple measure, one that seems to be a matter of common  sense. The Pay Our Military Act would have protected our military and  their families during this Trump shutdown, but Senator McConnell,  unfortunately, blocked that effort. Democrats are united in ensuring  that our troops and  [[Page S415]]  their families are spared any needless suffering or sacrifice during  the shutdown.   Today we are back to continue the fight for each and every American-- our troops, our children, our friends, our families--and we will be  there each and every day until we accomplish that task. That includes  the Pay Our Military Act. I still hope our Republican friends will  agree to it for even the short term.   We hope that the shutdown continues for a very short time. We all  hope it will end tonight, tomorrow, or as soon as possible. But even in  that short timeframe, military men and women should be guaranteed that  they are paid without question and without doubt.   Republicans are in charge of both Houses of Congress, and they have  the White House. They own this shutdown. It is a Trump shutdown. But  there is no satisfaction for anyone on this side of the aisle in that  essential truth.   They control the floor schedule. They control what bills will be  voted on and when. They control the schedule of our votes here.   They could have funded CHIP months before it expired in September. In  the State of Connecticut, those funds will expire shortly, as with many  other States. They could have funded community health centers long ago.   They could have enabled us to solve the Dreamer challenge months ago,  in fact, in September when the President first announced that he would  end the program.   We have been constrained in this debate by finger pointing, by  blaming, by the failure to move forward. We must now come together.   Today, we can no longer wait to solve the mounting problems facing  our Nation. Now is the moment to permanently fund health insurance for  9 million children in America. Now is the time to protect the Dreamers  from deportation. Now is the time to provide disaster relief for Puerto  Rico, Texas, and Florida. Now is the time for full funding for the  opioid programs.   Now is past time for the tweets and the reneging that have  characterized the White House response. We have an obligation to be the  responsible leaders in the absence of that leadership in the White  House.   We are here today, and all of us will be here until we solve this  problem. We can do it on a bipartisan basis.   Congress must do its job. The American people expect no less. They  deserve no less, and we owe them much more.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.
