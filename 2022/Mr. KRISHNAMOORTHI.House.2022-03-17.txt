 Madam Speaker, as the coauthor of the bipartisan  Strengthening Career and Technical Education in the 21st Century Act-- the largest reform of skills-based education in more than a dozen  years--I rise today to celebrate one institution that has become a  national exemplar.   I am honored to join Congressman August Pfluger from Texas in  recognizing Dr. Gregory Williams at Odessa College. Odessa College has  been named a top-10 community college by the Aspen Institute. Dr.  Williams has seen both enrollment as well as students with passing  grades increase year after year.   When we reformed CTE in 2018 and increased Federal funding by over 10  percent, we did so with educators like Dr. Williams in mind.   I commend Dr. Williams and Odessa College for their tremendous  success. I will continue fighting for robust funding for skills-based  and vocational education funding so that programs like Odessa's can  flourish in my State of Illinois as well as across the country.                            ____________________
