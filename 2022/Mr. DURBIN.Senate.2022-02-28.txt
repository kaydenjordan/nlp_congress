 Madam President, I want to begin my remarks by joining  Senator McConnell in expressing my condolences to our friend and  colleague Senator Dianne Feinstein on the passing of her husband and  partner Richard Blum.   Dick Blum was a trailblazer in the Senate family, one of the first  men to join the Senate Spouses club. He was proud of Senator  Feinstein's historic career in public service.   He was a success at business and invested his wealth in easing human  suffering--from the streets of San Francisco to some of the poorest  corners of the globe. He founded the American Himalayan Foundation to  assist the people of the Himalayas. He also founded the Blum Center for  Developing Economies at UC Berkeley to help teach students about  microlending, social enterprise, and other ways for poor people in  developing nations to lift themselves from poverty.   A story in today's Los Angeles Times contained an anecdote that  captured well Dick's good humor and generous spirit.   He said that in all the conversations he had over the years with  Buddhist friends in the Himalayas, no one had ever convinced him of the  likelihood of reincarnation. Maybe that is why he worked so hard to  achieve so much good in this one lifetime he was given. He did more to  ease human suffering than others might do in a dozen lifetime  opportunities.   To Senator Dianne Feinstein, their beloved daughters and  grandchildren, and all who knew and loved him, Loretta and I offer our  condolences.   Dick Blum's friendship was a gift, and his memory will be a blessing.                     Nomination of Ketanji Brown Jackson    Madam President, on another note, there was a historic announcement  last Friday when President Joe Biden announced Judge Ketanji Brown  Jackson as his choice to serve as Associate Justice of the Supreme  Court. I am going to speak about her nomination at length tomorrow, but  a few words now.    She is an extraordinary person. To become the first African-American  woman nominated to serve on the Supreme Court, you have to be the  best--and she has proven throughout her life that she is.   She was a clerk to the retiring Justice Stephen Breyer, whose seat  she now aspires to. She worked in the practice of law in so many  different aspects and then on three different occasions came before  this U.S. Senate for approval, advise and consent. On all three  occasions, she emerged with bipartisan support, and we certainly hope  to see that revisited again.   She has authored some 500 different opinions, so there will be no  mystery about her jurisprudence or her judicial philosophy. She has  also been a person who has come before our committee as recently as  last year when she was approved by the committee in June to serve on  the DC Circuit Court.   I think she is an exceptional choice, and I want to make sure that  the hearing that is given to her is respectful, fair, and professional.  I have reached out to Senator Grassley, my friend and the ranking  member on the committee, to work toward that goal, and I hope all  members of the committee will join us.                                   Ukraine    Madam President, on a separate topic, I just returned from the Munich  Security Conference and a visit to our NATO allies in Poland and  Lithuania. On the latter part of that trip, I was joined by Senator  Chris Coons of Delaware and Senator Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire.   Many here in this Chamber have heard me talk about my connection with  my mother's birth in Lithuania and the fact that I have cared about  that country in a special way ever since I have served in Congress.   Life was bleak and oppressive for the Lithuanian people and all the  others in Eastern Europe living under the boot heel of the Russian  czar. Countries such as Poland, which saw such devastation during World  War II, found themselves suffering decades of communist dictatorship  following the war. So it was no surprise that when the Soviet Union  finally collapsed, these nations were determined to join the community  of democracies and NATO. In fact, the Baltic States of Lithuania,  Latvia, and Estonia helped lead this historic path to freedom.   I remember so many aspects of it. In the shivering cold winter of  1991, millions of people joined hands to form a human chain, connecting  all three nations in the Baltic area. They called for change. Then in  January 1991, the Soviets sent their tanks into Lithuania and Latvia  and other places. The net result was deadly. Those Soviet tanks killed  13 innocent people, and hundreds were injured in Lithuania. What were  they asking for? Freedom. A chance to vote for their own future. Well,  soon, the Baltic States stepped out even further and courageously  declared independence from the Soviet Union. They wanted to reclaim  their freedom.   I remember visiting Lithuania in those days, seeing sandbags stacked  up outside the Parliament, which they called the Seimas, and schoolkids  who were taking a break from class to come pray the Rosary in front of  those barricades, light a couple candles--basically to be there for  their country at that moment of testing.   If this sounds familiar with what we are hearing in Ukraine today, it  is.   Those earlier days of independence had many brave souls coming  forward with nothing but determination. Their small ``arsenal of  freedom,'' as they called it, which they brought me in the backdoor to  show me, consisted of a broom closet with about 8 or 10 rifles in it.  They were ready to stare down the Soviets if necessary.   I was so honored on this trip recently to visit with one of the  champions of the restoration of freedom and Lithuania's Vytautas  Landsbergis. Dr. Landsbergis is a music professor and was a leader of  their revolution back to freedom in Lithuania. At 95 years of age, he  remains a fierce champion of democracy, as he was in those early days  confronting the Soviets.   I also met with former Lithuanian President Valdas Adamkus, who left  Lithuania for Chicago as a teenager and returned decades later to serve  two terms as President and shepherd his nation, Lithuania, into the  European Union and NATO.   I visited military bases in both Poland and Lithuania, where I met  U.S. troops supporting the NATO mission to protect the young  democracies from Russian aggression. Among the servicemembers were  several from my State of Illinois--from Latham, IL, which is near  Decatur; Montgomery, IL, near Aurora; and Kankakee. They came and told  stories of their service in the Regular Army and how they were now  working in Lithuania to prepare their armies for any possible battles  in the future. It has been a wonderful, strong relationship.   In Poland, when you mention you are from Illinois, virtually every  military officer says they have been our friends for a long time, and  they have been because for over 20 years, the Illinois National Guard  has been a direct contact with the Polish military forces, modernizing  them and preparing them for any challenges that might come.  [[Page S820]]    Eastern European allies know the Russian threat far better than we  do. Look at these maps of Russian troop movements in and around Ukraine  and the borders of our NATO allies. As you can see here, Russia, Kyiv,  Kharkiv, Mariupol, they are in the news virtually on a constant basis.   You can see those troop movements, hundreds of thousands of troops  that are moving from the Russian front into Ukraine these days. With  the Russian troops now flooding into Belarus in the area of the far  corner here, they are essentially taking over that country too.   Nations on the other side--Poland you can see on that map--Poland,  Lithuania, and Latvia understand that the threat today is very real for  them. They share a 60-mile border that connects the Russian territory  of Kaliningrad with Belarus. And the Suwalki gap is one that they are  very concerned about keeping peaceful. It is a real threat, and they  worry that the Russians are going to take this opportunity in Ukraine  to extend their forces into Poland and into Lithuania and into Latvia.   Poland in particular is already generously hosting hundreds of  thousands of Ukrainian refugees pouring across the border. It is an  inspiration to me to see this country of Poland reach out to accept  these Ukrainian refugees. The United States has to step into this  picture with humanitarian assistance for Poland and all the other  countries, Moldova, Romania, and others taking in Ukrainian refugees.  We have to help them feed, clothe, and shelter these people during this  period of invasion by the Russians.   Russia is unleashing a brutal war of choice against a free nation  that wants to choose its own path, the path of democracy, and the  result is sickening.   This shows what is going on in the subways in Ukrainian cities.  People are bringing their children to escape the bombing that Putin is  initiating above. We have many millions of people in that country in  peril, and some are taking their kids and trying to escape to a safe  place like Poland.   There has been terrible destruction that has gone on there as well.  We have seen it on television right in the--this lady was in front of  her own home at the time a rocket attacked it on February 25.   This is a picture which I saw in this morning's Washington Post. It  is a most touching scene. You can barely see this father down here,  covered in blood, bringing his daughter to this paramedic. The  paramedic really tried to perform CPR on this little girl who was  injured in the shelling by Putin and his troops. Unfortunately, she did  not survive. That is the reality of what Vladimir Putin is doing today.  The American people know it, and the strength and courage of the people  in Ukraine resisting these advances is an example to the world.   We are seeing demonstrations of support across all of the world, the  people of Ukraine. The Eiffel Tower, Empire State Building--I have to  move some of these charts around. This one was especially impressive,  the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin. Look at the crowds supporting the  people of Ukraine.   It isn't lost on us because we have a wonderful Ukrainian community  in Chicago. Here they are at the church on Chicago Avenue just this  last weekend, and they have been coming back on a regular basis. I was  there on Friday. I spoke to many of these same people about the  situation which they are facing in Ukraine. They would come up to me  afterwards and say they have been on the telephone with members of  their family who are frightened for their lives, didn't know if they  could survive this aggression by Vladimir Putin.   When you think about what he has done, sadly, he has failed on so  many fronts. How could he get so many things so wrong?   He has unified NATO and support for NATO in a way which was  unimaginable just a few years ago. NATO stands unified now in defense  of Ukraine and in confronting the aggression of Vladimir Putin.   He has also unified the European Union. Countries like Sweden and  Switzerland, which famously have been neutral in most of these  conflicts, are now openly supporting the European Union's efforts to  put pressure on Vladimir Putin--sanctions that will stop him from this  aggression in Ukraine.   He has certainly, in the process, destroyed the reputation of his  country as a reliable partner in the future. The Germans had entered  into an agreement for a gas pipeline. Many of us questioned it from the  start, but that was their decision--Nord Stream 2, drawing natural gas  from Russia into Germany. Well, that pipeline is closed down now.  Chancellor Scholz has announced he is looking for other services, such  as LNG, to replace the gas resources which were supposed to be sent in  from Russia for a long time to come. It is going to lead to our energy  independence in Europe--independence certainly from the unpredictable  and unimaginable Vladimir Putin.    I remember not so many years ago--30 years, as a matter of fact--when  countries like the Baltics and Poland were finally given an opportunity  for freedom. There were extraordinary examples of courage in each of  those countries. I was lucky to be there to witness some of it. But  what we are seeing now today in Ukraine is exceptional. The military  experts thought they would last a matter of hours. Now, it is days, and  maybe it is weeks. I hope it is months and even longer because they  have the courage to stand up. Ordinary citizens who are showing up at  recruiting offices for homeland defense are being given Kalashnikovs  and other weapons sent out to stop the Russians. You can see that they  are inspiring the world, as they should. It is a reminder to all of us  that Vladimir Putin and his brand of aggression has been seen so many  times in history. Someone like him or Lukashenka in Belarus think they  are so powerful that they are above accountability, but that is not the  case. We have got to make certain, as we go forward, that we stand with  the people of Ukraine; that they know we are their friends; that we  aspire to the same values.   And I want to thank President Biden for his leadership. I am going to  be calling on him with many others. The first thing that I am going to  do is send a letter, which will be headed out this evening, signed by  colleagues on both sides of the aisle. What we are asking the President  to do--and it is within his authority--is to grant temporary protected  status to Ukrainians now on visas in the United States. Some of them  are tourists; some of them are students; and some are on work visas,  but oftentimes, those visas expire, and they are supposed to return  home to their own countries at the moment of expiration. If there are  circumstances in those home countries, the President has the authority  to give temporary protected status to allow them to stay in the United  States.   The Senators who are joining me in this letter will ask President  Biden to extend temporary protected status to the people of Ukraine who  are on visas in the United States and are present in our country. That,  to me, is a way to give him them some peace of mind. We certainly  wouldn't want them to return to that war scene that we have seen over  and over broadcast on television.   And there is more to do, whether it is humanitarian assistance in  countries like Poland or where it is lethal aid to help the insurgents  in Ukraine defend their country, the United States needs to be there.    I announce that the Senator from California (Mrs.  Feinstein), the Senator from New Mexico (Mr. Lujan), and the Senator  from Georgia (Mr. Warnock) are necessarily absent.    I announce that the Senator from California (Mrs.  Feinstein), the Senator from New Mexico (Mr. Lujan), and the Senator  from Georgia (Mr. Warnock) are necessarily absent.    Madam President, 49 years ago, the Supreme Court issued  its landmark decision in Roe v. Wade. By an overwhelming, 7-2 vote, the  Justices declared that a woman's choice to have an abortion is a  constitutionally protected right.   For nearly five decades, the Supreme Court's holding in Roe v. Wade  has ensured that millions of Americans can access their essential,  reproductive healthcare rights. But today, Roe v. Wade is hanging by a  thin thread. A majority of the current conservative Court appears  poised to overturn Roe at the first opportunity. It is up to Congress  to safeguard the protections guaranteed under Roe v. Wade by passing  the Women's Health Protection Act, also known as WHPA.   For decades, abortion opponents have waged a relentless assault on  women's right to choose. And for decades, the Supreme Court--even with  conservative majorities--has protected the core principles of Roe. But  the tides are turning rapidly.   In December, the Justices heard oral arguments in the case of a  Mississippi law banning nearly all abortions after 15 weeks of  pregnancy. Because the Mississippi law is clearly unconstitutional  under Roe and its progeny, it was blocked by lower courts. But this  Supreme Court, with its far-right majority, granted review anyway. And  in their questioning, several conservative Justices seemed ready to  overturn Roe.   This threat to women's health and freedom is unprecedented. In the  words of U.S. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, who argued before  the Supreme Court on behalf of the Federal Government: ``The Court has  never revoked a right that is so fundamental to so many Americans and  so central to their ability to participate fully and equally in  society.''   Even without the threat from the Supreme Court, the right of women to  control their reproductive health and lives is under attack. Last year,  lawmakers in 47 States introduced more than 560 laws imposing new  restrictions on reproductive rights.   In the face of this unprecedented assault on reproductive rights,  Congress must step up and pass WHPA. WHPA would protect the right to  access reproductive healthcare, free from medically unnecessary  restrictions, no matter where you live.   I commend Senator Blumenthal--the lead sponsor--and all of my  colleagues who support this important and necessary measure, and I hope  we will have bipartisan support in passing it.   (At the request of Mr. Schumer, the following statement was ordered  to be printed in the Record.)                            ____________________
