 Mr. President, I also want to wish Woody a happy  birthday as well.   I just join my colleagues today to commemorate and honor some of the  Nation's most admirable warfighters in the Second World War, and I so  appreciate my colleagues bringing their personal stories to the floor  today. This is something that all Americans should cherish--the stories  of these heroes. We have very few of these brave heroes still among us  today, and it is so important that they receive every ounce of  recognition that we can give them for their selflessness and  extraordinary heroism.   I am pleased to be a cosponsor of Senator Manchin's legislation to  provide a merited celebration and commemoration of the last living  World War II Medal of Honor recipient, Woody Williams, who recently  celebrated his 98th birthday.   Medal of Honor recipients like Mr. Williams demonstrated a courageous  and noble commitment to our Nation, and their exemplary actions deserve  all the praise that we can give them.   I am proud to represent a State that has several World War II Medal  of Honor recipients of its own, in Mississippi: Van Thomas Barfoot of  Edinburg, Robert T. Henry of Greenville, James Daniel Slaton of  Gulfport, Louis Hugh Wilson of Brandon, and Jack Harold Lucas of  Hattiesburg, whom I still remain friends with his family today.   From Germany to Japan, these men served our Nation without hesitation  in the height of the Second World War, defending our Nation, our  allies, and the very principles of freedom. It fills my heart with  great pride to call these late veterans my fellow Mississippians. The  tributes we offer today for Mr. Williams in truth stand for our deep  appreciation for all of those who fought in World War II.   I thank my colleagues for their great work on this important  recognition and the opportunity to be a part of this.   Thank you, Mr. President.   I yield the floor.
