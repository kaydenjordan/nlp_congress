 Madam Speaker, I appreciate my friend from  Massachusetts setting the record straight. The war powers activity, the  authorization  [[Page H85]]  of military force has been an issue that a number of us have been  concerned with, Republican and Democrat, going back to the Clinton  administration and activity in the Balkans, but what my friend from  Massachusetts pointed out is that this reckless act by the President of  the United States actually makes us less safe.   With one act, he has been able to unite the opposition in Iran.  Remember, they were demonstrating in the streets against the regime.  And I have heard from friends of mine who have deep roots in Iran that  this has probably set back the cause of reform years, if not decades,  in Iran.   We are less safe, not more.   I strongly urge the approval of this resolution as a start to rein in  the President's worst impulses, but we must also put in additional  checks, by passing Representative Khanna's legislation to ensure no  funds are used for an unauthorized war with Iran and Representative  Lee's legislation to repeal the 2002 AUMF.    Madam Speaker, this is an opportunity for us to get  it right. And to take our friend, Mr. Cole's, word, we can move this  forward. I see this as a beginning, and we can build on it, but rein in  this administration.   Send a strong signal. Approve this resolution.
