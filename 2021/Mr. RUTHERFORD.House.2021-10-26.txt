 Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak against the  amnesty provisions included in the Democrat reconciliation bill.   The situation at the border is a complete and total crisis. Many  folks look at what is happening there and they think it is incompetence  by the Biden-Harris administration but, Madam Speaker, that is not  true. Yes, there is a lot of incompetency in the Biden-Harris  administration, but the southern border is not a failed policy. It is  the policy.   The Democrats want illegal aliens to come to America as part of the  socialist plan. In fact, the Democrat reconciliation bill is a plan  that would give amnesty to over 8 million illegal aliens--over 8  million. There is no provision to actually secure the southern border  or to fix the problem at the source.   This blanket amnesty for over 8 million illegal aliens rewards law- breakers, empowers cartels, and encourages more people to make a very  dangerous journey to our border. Amnesty for over 8 million illegal  aliens is an outrageous proposal and must be defeated.                Congratulations to Fight Crime: Invest In Kids     Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate an  organization, Fight Crime: Invest In Kids. It is a tremendous  organization that 25 years ago understood that if you are going to  fight crime in a community you have to fight crime with what I used to  call the entire PIE: prevention, intervention, and enforcement.   And Fight Crime: Invest In Kids has been doing this for 25 years now,  and I want to congratulate them on the untold number of young lives  that they have saved and that they have kept out of a life of crime.   Congratulations to Fight Crime: Invest In Kids.                            ____________________     I thank my good friend from New York for his kind  words.   Madam Speaker, I rise today to discuss something that affects far too  many of our veterans around the country. Every year in America,  thousands of young men and women, they raise their right hands and take  that oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States  against all enemies, foreign and domestic.   They take this oath with the full knowledge of the risks associated  with military service. They may be shipped off to a dangerous place.  They may be required to have courage under fire. And like scores of  American heroes who have paid the ultimate sacrifice throughout our  history, they may even lay down their lives as well.   Madam Speaker, what these men and women did not sign up for is the  torment that follows too many after their service is complete. In fact,  for some, the toughest battle that they will face comes after they  leave the military.   Over the last 2 years, Americans have weathered the COVID-19  pandemic. But I tell you, there is another pandemic raging in our  veteran community. Every single day, over 20 veterans take their  lives--every single day.   Since 9/11, we have lost four times as many veterans and Active Duty  servicemembers to suicide than we have to combat--four times more to  suicide than combat. This pandemic may not get the front-page attention  in the media, but for those battling PTSD, TBI, and other forms of  service-connected trauma, it is personal, and it is real.   We owe not only a debt of gratitude to those who have served but also  a commitment that we are there for them throughout their lives. That is  why I am proud to support the PFC Joseph P. Dwyer Peer Support Program  Act because I know it works.   This bipartisan legislation expands an already proven, successful  peer-to-peer support program for veterans suffering from PTSD and TBI.  This program, as I said, has already been proven to be effective  therapy across the State of New York. It is time to bring this to  veterans in every corner of the United States to save those lives.   I want to thank my good friend, Congressman Lee Zeldin, for filing  this bill, this very important bill.   Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this bill and  continue to fight for those who have so bravely fought for us.    I would, too. I will tell the gentleman, listening to  him speak, it reminds me that this is not even just about those  servicemembers. We talk about the 20 to 23 number that take their lives  every day. But there are thousands of family members and friends who  are affected by those deaths. So this is not only for our  servicemembers. It is also for all of their families and friends and  loved ones. I thank the gentleman for this bill.     I will tell the gentleman, it is proven in New York.  It is actually proven in northeast Florida. We have a peer-to-peer  program that is called Fire Watch, which has been incredibly successful  just recently.   That is why I was excited to see this bill because I know from Fire  Watch, and I know from the results that you all have had in the great  State of New York, just how important this is to saving lives.
