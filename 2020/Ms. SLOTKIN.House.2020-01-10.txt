 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of my amendment to  the PFAS Action Act, which would require the Administrator of the  Environmental Protection Agency, in consultation with other relevant  government agencies, to report to Congress on efforts to identify  viable alternatives to PFAS firefighting foam and other related  equipment containing PFAS.   PFAS contamination hits particularly close to home for me and my  constituents. We in Michigan are confronting widespread PFAS  contamination in our water, chemicals that we know are linked to cancer  and other diseases.   This past summer, I toured Strawberry Lake, part of Livingston  County's beautiful chain of lakes in my district, where foam resulting  from PFAS buildup is visible in plain sight.   I held a forum focused on PFAS contamination in Pinckney, Michigan, a  community that has been under a ``do not eat fish'' advisory for over a  year and a ``do not touch foam'' advisory for many months. The more  than 200 attendees expressed deep concern about the impact of PFAS  contamination on their health, safety, and livelihoods, and had simple  questions about how to know whether their water is safe to drink, eat  fish from, or even touch.   In September, I met with Brighton Fire Chief Michael O'Brien and fire  chiefs from across Livingston County and discussed their concerns about  exposure to firefighting foam that contains high concentrations of  PFAS.   PFAS presents alarming health risks. According to the CDC, exposure  to PFAS can affect growth, learning, and behavior in infants and older  children; lower a woman's chance of getting pregnant; increase the risk  of cancer; and impact the immune system. In  [[Page H159]]  fact, one of my constituents, who spent his career as an auto mechanic  and was exposed to PFAS-contaminated materials on a daily basis, is now  connecting his diagnosis of MS, or an autoimmune disease, to his  exposure to PFAS at work.   In Michigan, the high levels of PFAS have been detected in 34 sites,  including at Diamond Chrome Plating in my district.   In addition, these chemicals have been found at some level in  municipal drinking water serving more than 2 million people across the  State.   PFAS has been detected in 54 Michigan schools, including 5 schools in  my district.   Last summer, the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services  issued an emergency ``do not eat'' advisory regarding all fish from  sections of the Huron River in my district after fish from Kent Lake  were discovered to contain very high levels of PFAS.   Let me be clear: I believe that access to clean water out of your tap  is a right and not a privilege.                                time  1000    I believe that environmental security is homeland security. If it is  threatening the safety and security of your family and preservation of  your way of life, that is homeland security.   When Michigan families can't be confident that the water they are  giving their children to drink won't make them sick or give them a  learning disability; when they can no longer fish the rivers or hunt in  the areas they have hunted for years with their families, that is a  threat to our security, to our way of life.   It doesn't matter if you are a Democrat, or a Republican, or an  Independent, if you are going to hand your child a glass of water, you  should be confident it won't cause cancer or other lifelong health  issues. That is your family, and that is their safety.   My amendment would simply require the EPA to report to Congress on  efforts to identify viable alternatives to products and equipment  containing PFAS, including firefighting foam used on our military  bases.   The PFAS Action Act of 2019 does a great deal to meet the threat of  PFAS contamination with robust legislation that responds to it. And my  amendment will hold Federal agencies accountable for finding viable  alternatives to prevent further PFAS contamination.   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have no speakers and I am prepared to close  after the gentleman closes.    Mr. Chair, I ask for the bill to be supported, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
