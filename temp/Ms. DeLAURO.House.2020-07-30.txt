 Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak on a portion of the bill  for Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies.   To start, let me commend my dear friend, the chair of the full  Appropriations Committee, Congresswoman Nita Lowey, who is a path  breaker and a change maker. Nita Lowey has made this Nation and the  world a far better place because of the commitments that she has to the  issues that come before this subcommittee: quality education, after  school programs, and protections for working men and women.   Under her leadership, appropriations proceeded despite, and in  response to, this virus and the disparities that it  [[Page H4117]]  has exposed. She is a force. She leaves a legacy of excellence and of  innovation, and, as I have said before on a number of occasions, I will  miss my friend. I will miss her in the Halls, and I will miss her in  committee, but our friendship carries on.   Also, I want to say thank you to Ranking Member Cole for his  friendship and for his gracious, collaborative spirit in which we work  together on the Labor-HHS bill, which we have for the last several  years in producing the bill. While we have differences of opinion on  issues, there is no difference of opinion on the shared values that we  have in providing opportunity and creating opportunity for the people  of this country. So I thank the gentleman very, very much.   For 2021, the Labor-HHS bill includes $196.5 billion in overall  funding. It is an increase of $2.4 billion above the 2020 enacted  level, $20.8 billion above the President's 2021 budget request.   The bill supports some of our Nation's most critical programs from  early Head Start, Social Security, CDC, and NIH. They touch individuals  and families throughout their lives and help to create that opportunity  to allow America to realize its values and its promise.   The Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies  Subcommittee also continues to be central to our response to COVID-19.  We are at the center of this health and economic crisis and the serious  racial and economic disparities that it has exposed.   Since March, we have appropriated $280 billion in emergency funding  for education, for health, and for working people throughout the  pandemic. We add $300 billion more in the HEROES bill: $197 billion in  health, $100 billion in education, and $3.1 billion in labor.   Today we seek to build on those emergency and supplemental packages  so that we can be making it safe for our economy to reopen.   Our Members recognize the importance of this bill. The subcommittee  received more than 15,000 requests for today's bill, and I am proud to  say that we were able to fill so many of them either in total or in  part, and that is from both sides of the aisle.   Let me provide a brief overview.   Together, we are making investments for the Nation for health,  education, good-paying safe and secure jobs, and to address the  disparities that have been exposed by this virus:   For health, $96 billion for programs at the U.S. Department of Health  and Human Services, an increase in $1.5 billion above 2020. That is a  $500 million increase for the NIH and a $230 million increase for the  CDC.   For families, children, and seniors, we provide $150 million more for  Head Start, $100 million more for childcare, $25 million more for  preschool development grants, and $25 million more for the Low Income  Home Energy Assistance Program.   For education, a $716 million increase from 2020. That includes $254  million for title 1 education for the disadvantaged, $194 million more  for IDEA State grants for special education, $150 more for a maximum  Pell grant, and $50 million more for minority-serving higher education  institutions.   As the school year approaches, while the White House chooses to make  that a political battle to threaten schools and teachers, instead of  beating them down, we are lifting them up to invest in them so that  they can meet the education and the life challenges that face them.   For working Americans, this bill provides an increase for the  Department of Labor of $254 million, $12.7 billion in total.   When unemployment remains at alarming high levels, we are investing  in job opportunity and worker protection with $50 million for more  workforce innovation and opportunity grants.    Mr. Speaker, there is $12 million more for Job Corps and  a $15 million increase for worker protection programs.   We plan future investments for our public health agencies in an  emergency, $24.4 billion; for the CDC, $9 billion; NIH, $5 billion; for  BARDA, $4.5 billion.   Mr. Speaker, we are going to look at ensuring oversight on these  dollars so that the scientists are in charge and not the politicians.                                time  1115     Mr. Speaker, it is time for us to move boldly, swiftly.  Let's defeat the virus and the racial disparities it has exposed in  health, education, and the economy. We can and must do so by passing  the bill before us, and I urge my colleagues to invest in our  constituents, invest in beating this virus, and closing those gaps it  has exposed. We need to vote ``yes'' on this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I will miss my colleagues, Mr. Visclosky, Mr. Serrano,  Mr. Graves, Mrs. Roby, and Mr. Hurd. It has been an honor to serve with  them. And to our staff in the majority: Brad Allen, Jared Bass,  Jennifer Cama, Robin Juliano, Jackie Kilroy, Laurie Mignone, Stephen  Steigleder, and Philip Tizzani. And my personal staff: Letty Mederos,  Liz Albertine, and Caitlin Peruccio. I thank Ranking Member Granger,  and to Shalanda Young and to Chris Bigelow for all of the help you  provided us during this period of time.    Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Madam Speaker, I would just say to the gentleman, I hope  he had the same concern about what happens to our children and  grandchildren as he may have supported the unbelievable--what is it?-- $2 trillion in tax cuts for the wealthiest 1 percent of the people in  this Nation.   Again, I rise in opposition to the amendment. It would cut funding  for important programs and services that provide for working families  in this country. Many of these programs are already underfunded; they  fail to meet the existing need.   For instance, the amendment would cut Head Start by $538 million,  leading to thousands of children losing access to high-quality early  learning programs, and that would be on the backs of today where we  don't have an administration that wants to do anything about the loss  of childcare in this country. They would cut the Childcare and  Development Block Grant by almost $300 million at a time when childcare  is in crisis. More than half of childcare programs could close if we do  not provide emergency funding.   Just yesterday, this House passed two emergency bills to bring much- needed relief to childcare providers, and yet this amendment would cut  funding for childcare.   It would cut the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, LIHEAP, a  bipartisan priority, by $188 million.   How about senior nutrition, which it would cut, including Meals on  Wheels, by almost $50 million, resulting in 10 million fewer home- delivered or prepackaged meals for low-income seniors.   Think about it. Think about that.   It would cut biomedical research at the National Institutes of Health  by $2.3 billion, resulting in a reduction of nearly 2,500 new research  grants.   It would cut title 1 funding for our public schools by $828 million,  reducing needed resources for 25 million low-income students.   It would cut special education grants to States by $648 million. That  would reduce support to provide services for 7.4 million students with  disabilities, curtailing their ability to succeed.   It would cut Federal financial aid programs, Pell grants, the SEOG  program, and the Work-Study Program by $1.2 billion for students and  for families in need.   It would cut funding for job training programs by $185 million,  resulting in fewer supports for Americans who are seeking better  opportunities for themselves and for their families.   It would cut funding by $122 million meant to help States manage and  administer unemployment insurance claims and benefits for struggling  Americans.   Today, people are not even sure if their unemployment benefits are  going to be cut off tomorrow unless the Senate would move and pass the  HEROES bill, where we extend unemployment benefits. But, no, this  amendment would cut $122 million, again, cutting the unemployment  insurance program.   This is about values. Budgets are about values, and $135 billion that  is in the CARES bill has gone to or was prepared to go to 43,000  taxpayers at $1.6 million as a tax rebate going back to 2018, 2019 when  no one had even heard of the coronavirus. But that is okay. That is  okay. We can pass that. We can do something about that because of whom  it benefits.   Think about whom we need to benefit in this institution and what our  responsibilities are. Our responsibilities are to the working families  and the essential workers today who are on the front lines trying to  just be able to get by and also to save themselves, their health, and  their families.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, let me thank the gentlewoman for her  passion, her concern, her courage, and her leadership on this issue.   There really isn't much more to say. I thank her for standing up for  women and for health.   I am a survivor of ovarian cancer. The gentlewoman is tough. She is a  warrior. She represents those who are suffering in pain every single  day, when nearly 1 in 10 women are affected by this condition.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and  support women's health research. It is imperative that women are able  to survive endometriosis.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of Congressman Foster's amendment,  and was fascinated listening to the bipartisan support for this effort.  This brings down the skyrocketing cost of healthcare, a universal  interoperable patient identifier, reducing avoidable administrative  errors as has been pointed out, and that is being further exacerbated  by COVID-19 today.   So we learned during this pandemic that accurate identification of  patients is one of the most difficult operational issues in the field.  Field hospitals, temporary testing sites are gathering demographic  information of patients, but correctly matching that result after they  return from labs is time-intensive, sometimes inaccurate, and it is a  burden for the healthcare system.   I also would make one point, and I have expressed this to my  colleague, Mr. Foster. We have to do this in a way that protects the  sensitivity of an individual's medical information and that person's  right to privacy cannot be compromised. So we need to be firm, clear on  that principle. I think it can be developed in a way that doesn't  compromise right-to-privacy.    Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.
