 Mr. Speaker, I would like to take a moment to send my love  and prayers to the victims and the family members of those who were  hurt in Nevada.   I would also like to plead to the American people today to be good to  one another. We have enough people out there outside of our country  trying to hurt us. We have enough natural disasters trying to tear down  our homes and tear up our lives that we don't have to do that to each  other.   I rise today as an American, as a wife, and mainly as a mother to  address some of the double standards that we have in this country. As a  member of the Select Panel on Infant Lives, I learned that Federal law  increases criminal penalties for crimes involving pregnant women. These  laws give protections to the mother and her unborn child--rightfully  so.   However, this begs the question: When does the unborn have a right to  protection just like their mother?   Obviously, this is an important issue.   Why is abortion not considered murder and killing a pregnant woman a  double homicide?   Martin Luther King, Jr., said this about the civil rights movement:  ``The Negro cannot win as long as he is willing to sacrifice the lives  of his children for comfort and safety.'' How can the dream survive if  we murder our children?   Each human life should be protected under the rule of law. Each life  that feels pain should be free from being tortured.   I cannot believe that we are here on the floor of the House, the  people's House, continuing to plead and advocate for life. I am asking  that we support H.R. 36 and help provide these protections for our  unborn.
