 Mr. Speaker, last night we watched the President and  the House Republicans scramble to achieve political points at the  expense of the American people, working through the night. Imagine if  they worked this hard on a jobs bills or a bill that raised family  incomes or a bill to rebuild our infrastructure. But instead they are  trying to pass a tax cut for the rich disguised as a healthcare bill, a  bill that will require us to provide big, gigantic tax cuts.   To do that, they impose higher costs on families, higher premiums,  higher deductibles. They strip 24 million hardworking Americans from  health care, including 60,000 Rhode Islanders. They impose a crushing  age tax. They steal from Medicare, and they will destroy nearly 2  million jobs, all so they can give the wealthiest Americans and the  most powerful special interests a big, huge tax cut.   Shame on President Trump. Shame on the Republicans.   This is wrong for our country. We can do better than this. We need to  protect access to health care, not rob millions of Americans from  health care.  [[Page H2388]]        Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro).   Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, the healthcare proposal proposed by  President Trump and Speaker Ryan raises premiums and deductibles. It  imposes an age tax on older Americans, making their health care  unaffordable. It throws millions--24 million--Americans off of their  insurance. It shifts the cost of health care to the States, and it  covers less and less people.                                time  1015    It raises people's fears and insecurities about what this will do if  they get sick. It ends maternity care. It is quite outrageous when it  tells you that you can't go for emergency services any longer. It would  allow insurance companies to, once again, reimpose lifetime limits and  annual caps. It allows insurance companies to charge women 48 percent  more for the same insurance that any man would pay for.   So why would you be for this? Why? Who benefits? Who benefits?   We are going to provide 400 of the richest families in this Nation  with a $7 million tax cut every year. Those are not my words. Take a  look at what Families USA says. Take a look at what the Center on  Budget and Policy Priorities says about that.   Working people and older Americans are going to pay for a tax cut for  the richest people in this Nation. Older Americans are going to be hit  the hardest. Not only are they going to get an age tax, but they are  going to shift $170 billion out of the Medicare trust fund--a lifeline  for older Americans.   Do you know what? It makes me believe that this is the case: What  does the GOP stand for? Get Old People.   That is what this bill does. That is what people are going to vote  ``yes'' for today. Let me just say this: We have an obligation. We have  an obligation to the people of this country to vote ``no'' today on  this misrepresented bill.
