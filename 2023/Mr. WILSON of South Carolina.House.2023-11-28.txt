 Madam Speaker, I was grateful last  weekend as chairman of the Commission for Security and Cooperation in  Europe to chair the American delegation for the Fall Meeting in  Yerevan, Armenia.   Parliamentarians from nearly 50 countries were present with sessions  led by OSCE Parliamentary Assembly president Pia Kauma of Finland.   Armenian Head of Delegation Sargis Khandanyan was a very successful  host for the warm Armenian welcome. Sessions featured active  participation of many productive points of view on corruption as a  fundamental threat and respect for all people affected by conflict.   There was wide recognition the civilized world is sadly in conflict  as it did not choose of dictators with rule of gun invading democracies  with rule of law as war criminal Putin has invaded Ukraine and Iran  puppet Hamas invading Israel.   It was impressive the dynamic economy of Armenia, 9 time zones and  6,441 miles from Washington. It was encouraging to meet National  Assembly Deputy Ruben Rubinyan serving as special envoy on a  normalization with Turkiye, America's valued NATO ally.   God bless Armenia. God bless America.                            ____________________
