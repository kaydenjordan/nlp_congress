 Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Ending  the Diagnostic Odyssey Act.'' This legislation gives States the option  of providing whole genome sequencing (WGS) clinical services through  edicaid for children with a disease that is suspected to have a genetic  cause, at an enhanced Federal matching rate for three years. I am  pleased to be joined by Senators Kelly and Menendez.   Children with rare diseases will spend on average five to seven years  on a diagnostic odyssey, and 30 percent of  [[Page S4047]]  those children will not survive beyond the age of five years old. The  average patient sees seven different physicians in that time. The wait  to find a cause--never mind a cure--can be excruciating. Parents try to  project a calm and reassuring presence for their child while facing a  whirlwind of doctor appointments, hospital visits, and unanswered  questions.   Undeniably, we are making progress in both accelerating research  funding for rare diseases as well as in the development of diagnostics.  In 2014, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) launched a program  called the Undiagnosed Disease Network (UDN). In its first 20 months,  the UDN accepted 601 participants undiagnosed by traditional medical  practices. Of those who completed their UDN evaluation during this  time, 35% were given a diagnosis. Many of these diagnoses were rare  genetic diseases including 31 previously unknown syndromes.   In May 2019, the Director of the National Institutes of Health, Dr.  Francis Collins, wrote a blog post on how whole genome sequencing-- combined with artificial intelligence (AI)--can now be used to diagnose  genetic diseases in seriously ill babies in fewer than 24 hours. Dr.  Collins writes ``I would submit that there is no other technology in  the history of planet Earth that has experienced this degree of  progress in speed and affordability.''   For parents of children with an undiagnosed illness, answers cannot  come soon enough. There are approximately 7,000 rare diseases known  today. Approximately 80 percent of rare diseases are genetic, and about  one-half of all rare diseases affect children. For example, Alstrom  syndrome is an extremely rare and complex genetic disorder.  Approximately 1200 affected individuals have been identified worldwide,  which makes a obtaining a correct diagnosis challenging.  Characteristics of Alstrom syndrome include vision disturbances,  sensorineural hearing impairment, cardiomyopathy, obesity, kidney  dysfunction, and diabetes. Robin Marshall, Executive Director of the  Alstrom Syndrome International, located in Mount Desert Island, Maine,  has said that ``Whole Genome Sequencing has changed the lives of those  we represent by enabling earlier and more accurate diagnosis, fostering  more timely and appropriate medical care, and unlocking a host of  social services to combat the educational and psycho-social  complications that our children confront.''   By giving states an incentive to provide whole genome sequencing for  eligible children through Medicaid, my legislation will ensure that  more children and their families can obtain the right diagnosis and  treatment from the start. The ``Ending the Diagnostic Odyssey Act'' has  the support of more than one hundred patient advocacy organizations,  including Alstrom Syndrome International, the Genetic Alliance, the  Personalized Medicine Coalition, and many others. I urge my colleagues  to support this legislation.                                  ______                                         By Mr. THUNE (for himself, Mr. Blumenthal, Mr. Moran, Mrs.          Blackburn, Mr. Warner, and Mr. Schatz):   S. 2024. A bill to require that internet platforms give users the  option to engage with a platform without being manipulated by  algorithms driven by user-specific data; to the Committee on Commerce,  Science, and Transportation.
