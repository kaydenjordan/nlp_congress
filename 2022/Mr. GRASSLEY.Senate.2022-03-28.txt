 Madam President, today, Senator Johnson and I begin a  series of speeches on our investigations into the Biden family's  financial deals. We will make these presentations with two themes.   First, we will refute and we will dismantle the talking points that  the liberal media and our Democratic colleagues pushed onto the  American people. Their talking points said that our investigations over  the years advanced and spread Russian disinformation. On November 29,  2021; May 11, 2021; March 18, 2021; December 14, 2020; December 10,  2020; October 19, 2020; and September 29, 2020, I came to this Senate  floor to rebut those false charges.   Now--or at least then--the liberal media and my Democratic colleagues  ought to be ashamed of themselves for the outright lies that they  peddled about our investigative work. As a result, Senator Johnson and  I did what any good investigator would do: We gathered even more  records to prove all these people wrong, which brings me to the second  theme.    Senator Johnson and I will produce new records to show additional  connections between the Biden family and the communist Chinese regime.  Before we get to those records, I am going to discuss the background of  our investigation.   We started this investigation last Congress. Then, I was chairman of  the Finance Committee, and at that time, Senator Johnson was chairman  of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.   It began in August 2019. I started at that time an inquiry into a  transaction involving Hunter Biden that was reviewed by the Federal  Government's Committee on Foreign Investment.   On September 23, 2020, Senator Johnson and I released our report. On  November 18, 2020, we released our supplement to that report. Those  reports were based in large part on Obama administration government  records and also almost a dozen transcribed interviews of government  officials.   In both reports, Senator Johnson and I made financial information  public that hadn't ever been known before. Our report exposed extensive  financial relationships between Hunter and James Biden and Chinese  nationals connected to the communist regime. More precisely, these were  Chinese nationals connected to the Chinese Government's military and  intelligence service.   One of those individuals was a person by the name of Patrick Ho.  According to reports, Hunter Biden said of Patrick Ho:         I have another New York Times reporter calling about my       representation of Patrick Ho--    Then Hunter Biden says the f-word--       [denoting] the spy chief of China who started the company       that my partner, who is worth $323 billion, founded and is       now missing.    We will get into more detail with respect to Patrick Ho in future  speeches. We will do the same with Gongwen Dong, another close  associate of Hunter Biden's who was connected to the communist regime.   Now, Hunter Biden's reference to ``my partner'' is an apparent  reference to Ye Jianming. Ye had connections to the People's Liberation  Army. Ye had a company called CEFC, which had multiple variations.  Today and in future speeches, Senator Johnson and I will simply refer  to that company as CEFC.   Documents show that CEFC's corporate mission was ``to expand  cooperation in the international energy economy and contribute to  national development.'' Now, let me emphasize that word ``national'' in  that quote, ``national development.'' CEFC existed for the communist  state. Indeed, records show that CEFC is dedicating itself to serving  China's national energy strategy, developing national strategic  reserves for oil, and ``partnering with centrally-administered and  state-owned enterprises.''   Records prepared by one of Hunter and James Biden's business  associates, James Gilliar, say the following about this company, CEFC:         At the time, China was hungry for crude, but its state-      backed companies were having difficulty closing some deals       abroad. The optics of China's state-backed giants marching       into a country to buy and extract oil weren't great for       central Asian politicians. This paved the way for private       firms like CEFC, which can strike oil deals in Europe and the       Middle East where Chinese State Owned Enterprises could bring       political liabilities.    Documents also show that CEFC ``is building an energy storage and  logistics system in Europe'' to connect China, Europe, and the Middle  East. You may ask, why? Plainly, to serve ``China's ambitions to have  overseas storage locations connected with world markets.''   The document further states that CEFC's investment bank division has  investments in the energy sector ``which are in tandem with the  government's 4 trillion dollar One Belt One Road foreign investment  program.''   Then CEFC operated under the guise of a private company but was for  all intents and purposes an arm of the Chinese Government.   Hunter Biden and James Biden served as the perfect vehicle by which  the communist Chinese Government could gain inroads here in the United  States through CEFC and its affiliates.   And these inroads were focused on Chinese advancement into the global  and U.S. energy sector. Hunter and James Biden were more than happy to  go along, of course, for the right price.   So now let's turn to the first poster, which shows bank records that  haven't been made public before now. This is a portion of a document  that we--meaning Senator Johnson and I--will release in full.   The topic of this poster shows a wire transaction on August 4, 2017,  from CEFC to Wells Fargo Clearing Services for $100,000.   Now, look at the bottom of the poster. This is the underlying data of  this transaction. It states:         Further credit to OWASCO.    OWASCO is Hunter Biden's firm.   Now, there is no middleman in this transaction. This is $100,000 from  what is, effectively, an arm of the communist Chinese Government direct  to Hunter Biden.   So a second question, a question to the liberal media and my  Democratic colleagues, who accused us, over the last 2 years, of  distributing Russian disinformation: Is this official bank document  Russian disinformation?   Now, beyond this document, in future speeches, Senator Johnson and I  will show you more transfers between and among such companies as CEFC,  Northern International Capital, Hudson West Three, Hunter Biden's  OWASCO, and James Biden's Lion Hall Group.   In doing so, please keep in mind the players in this game: Hunter  Biden, James Biden, Ye Jianming, Gongwen Dong, Mervyn Yan, and Patrick  Ho, to name a few. All of these individuals mixed and mingled with  related corporate entities over a period of years and with respect to  millions of dollars.   Now, the next poster, those connections are illustrated by this  second poster which I made public last November. It is an original bank  record with one typographical error and all. Here  [[Page S1797]]  you have Hunter Biden, Gongwen Dong, and Mervyn Yan executing an  assignment and assumption agreement together.   Now, a third question to those who accuse us of disseminating Russian  disinformation, so especially to the liberal media who are the ones who  ought to be policing our government system to make sure that everything  is done honest--they shouldn't have to have Members of Congress giving  all this information out--but is this official record Russian  disinformation?   In our next speeches, we will show you more records that haven't been  seen before, records that undeniably show strong links between the  Biden family and communist China.   Today is just a small taste. I would like to note one thing before  Senator Johnson takes over. He is going to describe to you the  ridiculous attacks that we received, claiming that our reports were  Russian disinformation.   On March 16 of this year, the New York Times unwittingly  substantiated our reports by reporting on Hunter Biden's connection to  foreign corporations and his potential criminal exposure.   So what Senator Johnson and I made public last Congress is now a  prevailing fact pattern that even the liberal media can't ignore any  longer and falsely label ``Russian disinformation.''   I will turn it over to Senator Johnson to provide additional examples  of the media's attack last Congress.   I yield the floor.
