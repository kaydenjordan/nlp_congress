 Mr. President, today, I rise to recognize and honor the  extraordinary courage of Noblesville West Middle School teacher Jason  Seaman. Jason's actions on May 25 to protect his classroom of students  during a shooting at the school in Noblesville, IN, exemplified his  selflessness, dedication to his job, and the deep commitment he has to  his students, the school, and the entire community.   Jason graduated in 2007 from Mahomet-Seymour High School in Mahomet,  IL, where he was a star athlete. He went on to play college football at  Southern Illinois University and earned a degree in elementary  education. Prior to teaching at Noblesville West, Jason was an  instructional assistant at Harrison Parkway Elementary School in  Fishers, IN. In 2014, he was hired at Noblesville West, where he  currently teaches science to seventh graders and coaches football and  track. Jason is described by his fellow teachers as a devoted  colleague.   On the morning of Friday, May 25, just after 9 A.M., an armed student  entered Jason's classroom and opened  [[Page S4841]]  fire. Jason intervened, distracting the assailant with a basketball and  tackling him. In the process, Jason was injured. According to news  reports, he was shot three times: in the abdomen, hip, and forearm.  Jason underwent surgery and was released a day later from the hospital.  In the aftermath of the shooting, instead of seeking attention, Jason  focused on others; he thanked first responders for their actions, his  students for their support, and turned his attention to the other  victim, encouraging others to help the family of student Ella Whistler,  who was critically injured, by donating to help cover her medical  expenses. In addressing the shooting, Jason revealed a lot about his  character in the way he talked about it. In brief public remarks, he  said, in part, ``I want to make it clear that my actions on that day in  my mind were the only acceptable actions I could have done given the  circumstances. I deeply care for our students and their well-being.  That is why I did what I did that day.''   Because of Jason's heroic actions, witnesses say that more students  were not hurt, and he helped to save an unknown number of students'  lives. Jason's courage and commitment to his students represent the  very best of Hoosier values.   Jason set an example for others and has been rightfully recognized as  the hero he truly is. Let us strive to emulate the example this man has  set for us and honor his dedication to his students and community. On  behalf of Hoosiers, we all owe an enormous debt of gratitude to this  exceptional man.                            ____________________
