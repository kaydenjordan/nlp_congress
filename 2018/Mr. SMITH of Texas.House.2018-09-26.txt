 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Shuster for  yielding, and I congratulate him on successfully advancing a 5-year FAA  reauthorization.   H.R. 302 includes the Science Committee's research and development  title, the FLIGHT R&D Act. Title 7 includes our priority that 70  percent of annual FAA research and development funding be for safety  research, up from less than 60 percent today. It establishes a new FAA  Associate Administrator for Research and Development.  [[Page H9036]]  And it includes the Geospatial Data Act.   Another provision provides for specified aircraft operations of space  support vehicles licensed under the U.S. space code. Another  establishes a DOT Office of Spaceports and a national spaceport policy  report.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the chairman's work on this bill. I  strongly support it.
