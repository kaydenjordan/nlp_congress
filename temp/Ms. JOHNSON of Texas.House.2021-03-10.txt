 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of  The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021.   The legislation will provide much needed relief to both individuals  and communities.   The COVID-19 pandemic will leave an indelible scar on our nation.   It will also be remembered as a time of remarkable achievement.   I rise today specifically to talk about the achievements of  scientists and engineers across the nation who jumped into action from  the earliest days of the pandemic.   Biologists, physicists, computer scientists, engineers, social  scientists . . . there were few fields that did not contribute.   The vaccines would not have been possible without expertise from many  fields.   While they achieved so much, many scientific and technological  questions remain that will be essential to our long-term recovery.   I am proud that this legislation includes $750 million in funding  through the National Science Foundation and the National Institute of  Standards and Technology for additional research related to COVID-19.   I also acknowledge that this is not enough, and I will continue to  advocate for research recovery funding to ensure we do not suffer  irreversible loss to our science and innovation capacity.
