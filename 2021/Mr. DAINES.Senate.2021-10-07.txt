 Mr. President, first of all, I want to thank the Senator  from Utah for his courtesy.   Thank you, Senator Lee.                      Unanimous Consent Request--S. 2196     Mr. President, Americans across the country, people  around the world, and myself believe that in this room, they know that  President Biden is failing at our southern border. That is not a  secret. We have had months of record-shattering numbers of illegal  immigrants crossing our southern border.   We have had unfathomable amounts of illegal drugs produced by Mexican  cartels--meth, fentanyl, heroin--coming into our country. It is making  its way across that southern border and into States like my home State  of Montana.   Many of you have probably heard me say that Montana is a northern  border State with a southern border crisis. Well, that is true. The  crisis at our southern border, created by President Biden, is out of  control, and we all know we must do something to change the status quo  to protect our families and our communities.   But what I am here to talk about today is how President Biden is also  failing at our northern border--the border between the United States  and Canada. While our southern border remains wide open to illegal  drugs, illegal immigrants--many potentially COVID-positive or  unvaccinated--our northern border remains closed because of President  Biden.   The hypocrisy here is stunning. It is infuriating. It is  unexplainable. There is no reason or rationale behind President Biden's  decision. It can't be because of COVID-19 or because of vaccination  rates. Canadians are over 80  [[Page S6989]]  percent vaccinated--80 percent. Haitians, on the other hand, coming  across the southern border, have less than a 1-percent COVID  vaccination rate. So if COVID-19 and the vaccination rates were the  issue, then why did President Trudeau lift his restrictions and start  allowing Americans to travel to Canada on August 9? It makes no sense.   President Biden is prohibiting Canadians from traveling into the  United States. They can't come into Montana.   Who is paying the price for President Biden's hypocrisy? Montanans  are paying the price. Montana families and Montana businesses are  paying the price. Montana border communities and northern border  communities across the country are paying the price. President Biden's  inexplicable policies are hurting Montana's economy, destroying jobs,  shuttering businesses, and hurting our families.   In fact, let me give you an example. Great Falls, MT, which proudly  calls Malmstrom Air Force Base its home, reported that they have seen a  20- to 25-percent decrease in revenue due to the continued border  closure. This is, sadly, the story we are hearing from many communities  and business owners across Montana as Canadians are no longer able to  come visit our beautiful State.   This has been going on for far too long. Since the President will not  do the right thing, to use some good old-fashioned Montana commonsense  to listen to Montanans and open our northern border, I have introduced  a bill to do just that.   And, by the way, I have seen some of my colleagues across the aisle  join me in calling on this administration to reopen the northern  border, and I am grateful for that, but actions speak louder than  words.   Today, we have the opportunity to stop putting the power in the hands  of President Biden to make the right decision here--he hasn't made it-- because we know that won't happen. Today, we can pass my bill, called  the Restoring the Northern Border Travel Act, and require the Biden  administration to reopen the northern border. Let's help revitalize  Montana. How about the other northern border States? Let's put an end  to this irrational closure and this hypocrisy. A wide open southern  border and a closed northern border, it doesn't make any sense.    So I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me in  passing my bill.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on Homeland  Security and Governmental Affairs be discharged from further  consideration of S. 2196 and the Senate proceed to its immediate  consideration. I further ask that the bill be considered read a third  time and passed and that the motion to reconsider be considered made  and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I am grateful for the support the Senator  from Delaware has offered here. The reason I am down here asking for  the unanimous consent this evening is to provide a sense of urgency to  try to get this done now.   President Trudeau opened up the Canadian border on August 9, and  President Biden has kept the border shut down to Canadians coming in  during that entire time. It doesn't make sense. COVID is a concern. We  agree on that. However, it should not be a concern at the U.S.-Canadian  border, with Canadians having an 80-percent vaccination rate.   Canada began letting fully vaccinated Americans cross the border 2  months ago. Canada has a higher vaccination rate than the United  States. I find it a bit hypocritical to talk about the concern about  vaccination rates and relating that to the northern border and, at the  same time, the southern border is wide open with vaccination rates, for  example, of Haitians of less than 1 percent.   So anyway, we want to get this resolved. We are seeing businesses and  families suffer in northern border States. This administration  continues to have a wide open southern border policy while keeping the  northern border closed. Montana can't figure that one out. Many of us  who live in northern border States see the same thing. The hypocrisy  has to end. The travel at the U.S.-Canadian border needs to be restored  immediately.   I yield the floor.
