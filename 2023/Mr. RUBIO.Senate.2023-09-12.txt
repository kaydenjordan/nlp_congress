 Mr. President, I recognize Kevin P. Burns as he  retires from a distinguished 52-year career in the U.S. Air Force as an  Active-Duty pilot and later as a civil servant at Eglin Air Force Base  in Florida.   Kevin graduated from the U.S. Air Force Academy in 1975 and served  honorably as an Active-Duty pilot until 2002. As a fighter pilot during  the Cold War, he was deployed to Iceland where he intercepted and  escorted Soviet bombers away from U.S. bases. He later served as a test  pilot and flew more  [[Page S4383]]  than 65 different aircraft, including F-15s, F-16s, F-4s, and A-l0s as  well as other developmental aircraft. His last flight was in a B-52  Stratofortress out of Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana in June  2022.   Kevin retired from Active Duty in October 2002, after serving as the  vice wing commander of the 46th Test Wing at Eglin Air Force Base.  Following Active Duty, Kevin continued his service to our great country  as a civilian, leading the development of policy, products, and  standards for the Air Force's 53rd Test Management Group, the U.S. Air  Force's largest operational test wing, at Eglin Air Force Base.   Kevin's work over the decades has had an immeasurable impact on  America's national security. His dedication to the mission and tireless  efforts have contributed to the safety of all Americans.   I extend my best wishes to Kevin and his family on his retirement and  thank him for his service.                            ____________________
