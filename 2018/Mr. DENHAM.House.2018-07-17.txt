 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk, amendment  No. 26.    Mr. Chairman, California continues to suffer devastating  water shortages and inadequate clean drinking water. We must build new  water storage.   My amendment would simply transfer $2 million into the Water  Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act administrative expenses  account from the Department of the Interior Office of the Secretary  account.   The base text of this bill has $3 million less for WIFIA  administration than was provided for the fiscal year '18 and provides a  $10 million increase for the Office of the Secretary account.   The WIFIA program is a vital program for water infrastructure. The  program was established in the water resources 2014 bill and has been  accepting loan applications for clean and drinking water projects.   Water storage projects and flood risk reduction infrastructure  projects are eligible under section 3905 of 33 U.S.C. 52, but EPA has  yet to establish a process for administering such loans.   The additional administrative resources in the amendment would allow  [[Page H6450]]  the WIFIA office to more quickly pursue financing of Bureau of  Reclamation and Army Corps of Engineers projects.   It took 4 years--until April 2018--for WIFIA to issue its first loan  for a wastewater project. This is an unacceptable timeframe for  establishing an essential water financing program when the American  Society of Civil Engineers scored our water infrastructure as a D grade  last year.   The administration's infrastructure principles document recommends  expanding WIFIA authorities to water storage projects which is the  lifeblood of California's Central Valley and other reclamation States.  We can't wait another 4 years for WIFIA to issue loans for these  projects.   The Army Corps and EPA expect to execute a memorandum of  understanding for financing projects very soon which will further  strain WIFIA administrative resources. Additionally, the Senate has  included a deadline for Reclamation and EPA to reach an MOU in their  water resources bill.   Mr. Chairman, this is good policy which mirrors my New WATER Act,  H.R. 434. This amendment is necessary for properly and effectively  carrying out both MOUs.   In closing, California continues to suffer devastating water  shortages and inadequate clean drinking water. Areas of California's  Central Valley have not only had bad quality water, but some towns have  no water at all. We must build new storage. This bill helps us to move  that forward and expedite the process.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  2200
