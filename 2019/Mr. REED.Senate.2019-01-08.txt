 Mr. President, today I am once again introducing, along  with my colleagues Senator Whitehouse, Senator Blumenthal, and Senator  Murphy, legislation to designate river segments within the Wood- Pawcatuck watershed as part of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers  System.   Following more than three years of intense study, this legislation  would formally recognize the recreational, natural, and historical  qualities of portions of the Beaver, Chipuxet, Green Fall-Ashaway,  Pawcatuck, Queen-Usquepaugh, Shunock, and Wood Rivers that flow through  Rhode Island and Connecticut while providing access to Federal  resources and promoting strong partnerships for their restoration and  protection.   The Wood-Pawcatuck watershed is a National treasure that not only  holds natural and scenic value, but also is an important economic  driver for the area. Indeed, the 12 local river communities experience  direct economic benefits from their proximity to these rivers through  increased recreation and tourism. The watershed provides many  opportunities for visitors to explore history and experience nature,  including viewing early industrial mill ruins, trout fishing, bird  watching, and kayaking.   I have long been a supporter of protecting and restoring these  special rivers, which is why I sponsored the Wood-Pawcatuck Watershed  Protection Act in 2013. The process that was initiated by that law has  been a critical tool for bringing together stakeholders from Rhode  Island and Connecticut including representatives from State agencies,  local governments, and conservation groups in order to develop a  collaborative path forward. The resulting Stewardship Plan, which has  been formally adopted by the study committee and is supported by all  twelve local river communities, builds upon currently existing efforts  to preserve and manage the river ecosystems while also considering what  steps will need to be taken collectively in the future in order to  protect them.   I would like to commend Representatives Langevin, Cicilline, and  Courtney for again introducing companion legislation. In October 2018  we commemorated the 50th anniversary of the landmark Wild and Scenic  Rivers Act, and I am proud that after all these years we are continuing  our work to protect such extraordinary places. I look forward to  working with all of my colleagues to pass this legislation so that we  can preserve the rivers of the Wood-Pawcatuck watershed for the  enjoyment of current and future generations.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I am once again introducing, along  with my colleagues Senator Whitehouse, Senator Blumenthal, and Senator  Murphy, legislation to designate river segments within the Wood- Pawcatuck watershed as part of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers  System.
