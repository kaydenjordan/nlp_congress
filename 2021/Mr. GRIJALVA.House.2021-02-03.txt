 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the budget  resolution and reality that is before us today. This resolution  provides relief to the American people that has been needed and  required for over a year.   I want to thank Speaker Pelosi, leader Hoyer, whip Clyburn and, of  course, Chairman Yarmuth for the fine work he and his committee did in  preparing this resolution to respond to the urgency before the American  people.   As we have seen in the Natural Resources Committee, the effects of  the pandemic, COVID-19, have been devastating to many populations  across this country. It has particularly and severely impacted  indigenous people and Tribes across this country disproportionately,  four times higher than the national average in people that have been  infected, and the mortality rate is reflected in the same way.   This resolution provides $20 billion for Tribal Governments, $5.8  billion for Indian Health Service, $900 million to assist Tribal  Governments to develop culturally and linguistically appropriate  programs for their communities, and provides adequate and necessary  funding to Indian Health Service and providing a level of equity to the  question of relief that has to be central in everything we do.   In addition, at the recommendation of the House Natural Resources  Committee, to ensure that we can deal with a pandemic in the making,  the package contains funding for tools to limit dangerous wildlife  trade and monitor wildlife-borne diseases at home and abroad.   I urge a ``yes'' vote, and I thank the chairman for the time and his  hard work.
