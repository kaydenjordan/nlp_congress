 Mr. Speaker, America has always been the land of  opportunity, but I am hearing, as I travel my district, a renewed sense  of optimism that is exciting. Our economy is stronger. Families have  more money in their paychecks. Workers are seeing bonuses and better  wages. Unemployment is at historic lows. Job openings are at historic  highs, and confidence is soaring.   As a direct result of our tax cuts, about 90 percent of our workers  are  [[Page H6635]]  keeping more of what they make. The average tax cut this year in my  district was over $900. Like a constituent who commented on my Facebook  wall put it: ``Any time that the American taxpayer has more money in  their pocket, it's a good thing.'' Mr. Speaker, I couldn't agree more.   Businesses and workers are seeing tremendous benefits, too. With the  tax savings, businesses all across the country are expanding and hiring  more people. In my district, a local brewery can now purchase new  equipment and raise wages. A local manufacturer told me she plans to  expand operations and bring on new employees.   Working with the Trump administration, I will continue to work to  build on this progress so that more people can achieve their American  Dream.                            ____________________
