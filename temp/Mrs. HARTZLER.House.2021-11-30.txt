 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for holding this  Special Order tonight so that we can recognize the book that means so  much to many of us and certainly our Nation, and that is the Bible. We  are blessed to live in a nation that is founded on the truths of the  Bible.   Many people don't know this, but of the 56 men who signed the  Declaration of Independence, nearly half held seminary or Bible school  degrees. These Founders had a very deep religious conviction and faith  in Jesus Christ, and it was based on the Bible.   The following quotes from our Founding Fathers provide a window into  the strong moral and spiritual convictions which helped form the  foundations of our nation and our government.   George Washington, our first President said: ``While we are zealously  performing the duties of good citizens and soldiers, we certainly ought  not to be inattentive to the higher duties of religion. To the  distinguished character of patriot, it should be our highest glory to  add the more distinguished character of Christian.'' That was George  Washington.   John Quincy Adams was our sixth President, and he said:         In the chain of human events, the birthday of the Nation is       indissolubly linked with the birthday of the Savior. The       Declaration of Independence laid the cornerstone of human       government upon the first precepts of Christianity.    That is very clearly saying that our Nation was founded on  Christianity and the Bible.   And our fourth President, James Madison, recorded 10 different  references to Scripture at the Constitutional Convention, which was the  pivotal event in our Nation's history that codified our freedom and our  God-given rights. So, our Founders quoted Scripture.   Like the Constitution that it inspired, the Bible is timeless and  impacts us still today. The Bible is the inspired Word of God.   I started reading the Bible every day at age 13. I went to Youth for  Christ camp and learned that this was a great opportunity to have God  be able to speak to you every day and to start your day.   It has been a source of encouragement when I was down, a source of  guidance when I needed direction, and a source of comfort during life's  struggles. The Bible speaks to every situation that people encounter,  and it shows the path to blessings.   Psalm 33:12 is really relevant today. It says: ``Blessed is the  nation whose God is the Lord.'' Powerful for us to remember that.   Psalm 1 says:         Blessed is the one who does not walk in step with the       wicked or stand in the way that sinners take or sit in the       company of mockers, but whose delight is in the law of the       Lord and who meditates on it day and night. That person is       like a tree planted by the streams of water which shields its       fruit and season and whose leaf does not wither. Whatever       they do prospers.    Good words. But the Bible also tells us the good news that we  celebrate this season.   Luke 2 says:         But the angel said to them, ``Do not be afraid. I bring you       good news that will cause great joy for all the people. Today       in the town of David a savior has been born to you. He is the       Messiah, the Lord.''    And the greatest news of all is summarized in John 3:16-17:         For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only       Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have       eternal life. For God did not send His Son into the world to       condemn it but to save the world through him.    So as we commemorate this National Bible Week, I would encourage all  of us to pick up that Bible, dust it off, or download an app on your  phone, read it, and receive the blessing it contains for us as  individuals and as a nation.
