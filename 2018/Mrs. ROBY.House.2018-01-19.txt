 Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 694, I call up  the bill (H.R. 4712) to amend title 18, United States Code, to prohibit  a health care practitioner from failing to exercise the proper degree  of care in the case of a child who survives an abortion or attempted  abortion, and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 4712.    Madam Speaker, the pro-life movement in Washington today  is so exciting. Forty-five years ago this month, the Supreme Court of  the United States ruled in Roe v. Wade to make abortion legal and  available nationwide.   While many abortion activists celebrate this anniversary, it  represents a particularly somber occasion for those of us who advocate  for life at all stages. Every year since this ruling, the pro-life  community has gathered in Washington to march in peaceful protest, and  that is exactly what brought thousands of passionate individuals here  today.   I would like to extend a very sincere thank-you to each and every  person who made this trip today to participate in the March for Life.  For those individuals, their dedication to the pro-life movement is  inspiring, and I and many of my colleagues stand with them.   I would especially like to recognize all of the individuals from my  home State of Alabama who made the 12- to 13-hour trip. I am proud to  have people like these Alabamians and others here to represent our  great State and our Nation in this pro-life movement.   I believe it is only fitting that we take action today here in the  House of Representatives to defend the defenseless as thousands of  Americans are here to speak for those who cannot speak for themselves.  I am proud to stand here today as a cosponsor of the legislation that  we are considering, H.R. 4712, the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors  Protection Act.   I would also like to thank my colleague from Tennessee, Marsha  Blackburn, for her leadership on this legislation.   At this point, I don't think that it is a secret that I am  unapologetically pro-life, and I believe that our laws and our policies  should assign the utmost importance to every life at every stage. I  have been proud to stand here on the House floor many times in defense  of the unborn, but this time we aren't even talking about unborn  children. We are here to talk about those who have already been born.   The Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act is pretty simple. It  states that, if a baby is born alive after a failed abortion, he or she  must be given the same exact medical care that would be given to any  other baby.   I know we will continue to play politics about when life begins and  argue about the point at which the law should step in to protect it.  And while I understand that not everyone agrees with my strong pro-life  stance, I cannot fathom how any person could be opposed to legislation  that protects babies who are so alive that you can look them in the  eye.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Missouri (Mrs. Hartzler).    Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte), who is the chairman of the Judiciary  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  North Carolina (Ms. Foxx).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Tennessee (Mrs. Black).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Smith), who has served a long time as the chairman of the  Pro-Life Caucus    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I would just like to point out that it is not  currently Federal law, or the law in all 50 States, that a baby born  alive after a failed abortion receive medical treatment instead of  being left on the floor to die. That is why we are here today, to  require under Federal law nationwide that a baby born alive after a  failed abortion receives medical care and isn't left on the floor or in  a trash can to die.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from North Carolina  (Mr. Budd).    Madam Speaker, I yield the gentleman from North Carolina  an additional 30 seconds.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  South Dakota (Mrs. Noem).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Mitchell).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Farenthold), who is also a member of the Judiciary  Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Rothfus).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Alabama (Mr. Aderholt).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Indiana (Mr. Banks).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  South Carolina (Mr. Norman).    Madam Speaker, it is my honor to yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs. Blackburn), the lead sponsor of this  important bill, who has been such a fierce advocate for the unborn.                                time  1030     Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Of course, like so many of my colleagues, I support this measure, but  it feels really strange standing here today in defense of living,  breathing children, to have to make a case that a baby who survives an  abortion and is born into this world should be treated just like a baby  born any other way, but, unfortunately, we must.   There is currently no law mandating that a baby born alive after a  failed abortion receive medical treatment instead of being left to die.  That is why we are here, to require, under Federal law nationwide, that  a baby born alive after an abortion attempt receives the  [[Page H569]]  same care that any other baby would receive.   So finally my question, Madam Speaker, to those who would oppose such  a measure is this: How is the life of one baby any different or less  valuable than the life of another baby? How does anyone justify that?   I know that, as Members of Congress, part of our job is to debate  with each other about issues facing our Nation. I take that job  responsibility very seriously. I just don't believe this particular  issue is up for debate.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4712. I yield  back the balance of my time.
