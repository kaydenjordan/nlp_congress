 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to H.R.  4468. This legislation is misguided and will take us backward in  combating climate change and air pollution.   If I may offer some brief history from my home State, for much of the  mid-20th century, California was plagued by smog. Thankfully, the Clean  Air Act allowed California to establish stronger vehicle emission  standards than those at the Federal level. Standards like those in my  home State empowered the auto industry to produce better, cleaner cars,  which expanded American manufacturing and reduced our reliance on  foreign oil.   These standards were a win for consumers, for our domestic auto  industry, and for meeting our air quality and climate goals. However,  H.R. 4468 would erase the decades of progress we have made by blocking  EPA from reducing air and climate pollution.   In fact, the only party that would benefit from rolling back EPA's  efforts to slash air pollution is the fossil fuel industry.   This bill isn't based in science, and it fails to recognize the  climate impacts our constituents are already feeling.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill.
