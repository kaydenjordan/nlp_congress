 Mr. Speaker, as I said last night before the Rules  Committee, I don't disagree with this legislation. Every day I hear  from my constituents, gasoline prices are way too high. They have got  to choose between paying for groceries and filling up their gas tank. I  agree, we should ease the burden on American taxpayers. However, I  disagree that this is the right way to do it.   Just last year, the Inflation Reduction Act made historic investments  in home energy rebates, tax credits, clean energy vehicles, land and  water conservation, and grants for greenhouse gas reduction.   This legislation, in contrast, does not make any new investments. It  simply walks back all the progress we have made before we can see the  results of those investments.   That is why I introduced last night an amendment to simply say that  any future investments in gas and oil be equaled in clean energy  investments.   Why? Because we want to make sure we keep America on the world stage  as leaders in energy production.   Sadly, my colleagues across the aisle will not be bringing up my  amendment for a vote this week.
