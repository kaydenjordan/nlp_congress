 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Louisiana for  yielding.   I often brag to my congressional colleagues that I hope one day  America could be like the Third District of Texas. It is a truly  magnificent county, Collin County. One of the many factors that has led  to the success of our community is the hardworking police officers who  undoubtedly have played a significant role.   This National Police Week, we remember those officers who have made  the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty.   I am proud to recognize the Collin County police officers who risk  their own lives and well-being to make our  [[Page H2261]]  communities some of the very safest in the Nation. In fact, the cities  of Frisco, McKinney, and Plano, all located in Collin County, were  named three of the top 10 safest cities in America.   This is a true testament to how well members of our community,  families, neighbors, small business owners, nonprofits, and local  officials collaborate with police departments to ensure Collin County  remains one of the very best places in America to live, work, and raise  a family.   Let this National Police Week serve as a reminder that, in times of  disaster or crisis, police officers are the ones who run toward the  danger. Our brave officers go above and beyond to protect our  communities, and I can never thank them enough.
