 Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the bipartisan  Strengthening Research in Adult Education Act with my colleague,  Senator Young. We are in urgent need of identifying and disseminating  innovative and effective methods for supporting adult learners. Our  legislation will ensure that there is a strong research base to improve  the teaching provided for, and the learning of, adults seeking to  advance their literacy, numeracy, and digital literacy skills.   The most recent data from the Program for the International  Assessment of Adult Competencies show an urgent need for action in  adult education with an estimated 19 percent of adults ages 16-65 in  the United States performing at the lowest levels of literacy; twenty- nine percent at the lowest levels of numeracy; and 24 percent at the  lowest levels of digital problem solving. This is a dire situation.  These are essential skills for postsecondary education and the  workplace. Beyond their value in the labor market, these skills are  also correlated with health and civic participation, making adult  education critically important to the health and well-being of our  people, our economy, and our democracy.   In Rhode Island, it is estimated that nearly 82,000 working age  adults have less than a high school education. Over 55,000 have limited  English proficiency. Yet, we are reaching just over 5,000 through the  current adult education program. Clearly, we need more resources and  innovative, research-based ways to reach more people.   The Strengthening Research in Adult Education Act will support the  key reforms to adult education in the Workforce Innovation and  Opportunity Act by ensuring that adult education is included in our  national education research priorities. Specifically, the Strengthening  Research in Adult Education Act will amend the Education Sciences  Reform Act to require the Institute for Education Sciences and the  National Center for Education Statistics to collect data and carry out  research on: successful State and local adult education and literacy  activities, the characteristics and academic achievement of adult  learners, and access to and opportunity for adult education, including  digital literacy skills development, in communities across the Nation.  It will also ensure that the Institute of Education Sciences draws on  the expertise of adult educators when developing policies and  priorities. Finally, the legislation would require that at least one  research center would focus on adult education.   These straightforward amendments to the Education Sciences Reform Act  will go a long way to strengthening the research base that will support  the improvement of adult education across the country. I was pleased to  work with the adult education community, and particularly, the  Coalition of Adult Basic Educators and the National Coalition for  Literacy in developing this legislation. I urge my colleagues to  support the Strengthening Research in Adult Education Act and to work  with me to ensure that its provisions are included in the  reauthorization of the Education Sciences Reform Act.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the bipartisan  Strengthening Research in Adult Education Act with my colleague,  Senator Young.
