 MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, there is no  democracy if women do not have control over their own bodies, including  reproductive healthcare.   Twenty-seven days ago, an extremist majority on the Supreme Court  fulfilled the Republican Party's decades-old goal of overturning Roe v.  Wade. Next on the chopping block is marriage equality and  contraception.   Make no mistake, these rightwing extremists are not pro-life but pro- government controlling the bodies of women and girls. Their goal is to  ban abortion in this country.   Today, the House will pass Congresswoman Manning's Right to  Contraception Act, which would codify the right to access birth control  into Federal law. I urge my colleagues in the Senate to pass this bill  immediately so that people have the freedom to make their own decisions  about their futures.   We will not go back. Pass this bill. It is fundamental to democracy.                                time  1045     MALONEY, Mr. NADLER, and Mrs.  BOEBERT changed their vote from ``yea'' to ``nay.''
