 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I rise to override the President's  veto of S.J. Res. 68, which requires the removal of U.S. troops from  hostilities against Iran that Congress may not have authorized.   It seems like ages ago that we were truly on the brink of a  potentially devastating, costly, and unnecessary war against Iran, but  it was actually just a few months ago.   Make no mistake--even as Iranians have suffered the worst outbreak of  COVID-19 in the Middle East, we have witnessed Iran continue its  support for terrorism, harassment of American naval vessels, and  general malfeasance throughout the region. Indeed, it now seems that  Iran may be principally responsible for driving the spread of COVID-19  throughout the region. I don't think there is any question about Iran's  malign activity.   More to the point of the legislation at hand, I shed no tears for  Qassem Soleimani, who left a legacy of terrorism, bloodshed, and  American deaths. However, this body has a constitutional responsibility  and prerogative to declare war, to make the decision about whether to  send our sons and daughters into battlefields. We have the  responsibility to ensure that the Executive is effectively deploying  every diplomatic tool it can before rushing recklessly into battle,  particularly one without clearly defined outcomes or clarity of  purpose. We must exercise our check over the Executive, particularly  when it comes to the life and death of Americans.   Yet this administration continues to test the strength of our system  of checks and balances. We saw it with this strike against Soleimani.  Then it played out several times last year regarding congressional  prerogatives on arms sales.   This is not the first time the President has faced a vote to override  his veto. Last year, the House and the Senate made overwhelmingly clear  that we had concerns about sales of certain weapons to Saudi Arabia  following its disastrous campaign in Yemen and the murder of Jamal  Khashoggi.   As the administration seeks to sell more weapons overseas, the  Congress will continue to assert our prerogative when it comes to  foreign policy and war-making. So, as I did earlier this year, I stand  in strong support of S.J. Res 68. This body must assert its  constitutional and congressional prerogative.   Of course, the President has the right to take action to defend  against imminent threats to the homeland and to Americans abroad. No  one disputes that--no one. While the President has the right to take  action to protect Americans from truly imminent threats and dangers,  and we must stand in support of our allies and partners, it is our  responsibility to ensure that he is taking the right actions to protect  Americans and our interests.   The President does not have the authority to undertake any kind of  military action he likes, nor does he have the prerogative to sell  weapons to any country he likes absent congressional consultation and  approval. Unfortunately, as has become a pattern with this  administration, the legal rational it has offered for these attacks  stretches the bounds of credulity.   Following a number of briefings from the administration, I found no  compelling evidence as to what was the imminent threat or the clear and  present danger to Americans. In fact, following the death of Soleimani,  we saw even more attacks on American assets and interests.   Just a few weeks ago, Iran was harassing our ships in the Arabian  Gulf, and Iran also claims to have launched a military satellite into  orbit. It does not sound like the administration's actions have  meaningfully ``restored deterrence'' of any kind against Iranian malign  activity.   Additionally, let me reiterate that the idea that somehow the  administration has the authority under the 2002 AUMF to attack  Soleimani simply because he was in Iraq is completely ludicrous. As  someone who voted against the war in Iraq when I was in the House of  Representatives during the debate over whether to authorize military  action, I can assure you that it was not its intention of that 2002  authorization for the use of military force, and it does not comport  with the history, the use, or the plain reading of the text.   Colleagues, I urge you to stand up for our congressional  prerogatives, our congressional responsibilities, and our  constitutional responsibilities, and to make clear to the President  that we are a coequal branch of government that will hold the Executive  accountable.   I want to thank Senator Kaine for his dedication to this issue and to  defending our constitutional rights.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, freedom of the press is a fundamental  human right, a foundational pillar of democracy, and an indispensable  check on authoritarian overreach. Over the past months, as we have  collectively come to appreciate a new understanding of ``essential  workers,'' we have witnessed once again how essential the work  journalists do is to maintaining our democracy. From Wuhan, China, to  conflict zones in Venezuela, to cities and towns in the United States,  journalists are risking their lives to report, investigate, and keep  people informed on the COVID-19 pandemic. Unfortunately, responses to  this global crisis have also reminds us that press freedom is under  assault across the globe, including in the United States. Fearful of  negative coverage of their capacity to protect their citizens and  address a global health crisis, autocrats and other governmental  figures around the world have focused their attention on concealing  information. As journalists fight to advance truth and objectivity  under dire circumstances, far too many governments have responded with  verbal attacks and prison sentences. Today, we applaud the work and the  courage of all those involved in bringing stories from around the world  to our fingertips.   Amidst the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic, countries across the  world from Algeria to Zimbabwe have imposed restrictions and threatened  journalists for their work. As they do when credible, reliable, and  timely information is an essential commodity, journalists have  persisted.   In China, in an effort to educate his community and the world about  its potential threat, Chen Qiushi documented the impacts of the COVID- 19 outbreak in Wuhan, China, in dozens of videos online. On February 6,  2020, Chen's family and friends lost contact with him, and he is  presumed to have been disappeared by the CCP.   In Niger, journalist Kaka Touda Mamne Goni reported on a suspected  COVID-19 case, was arrested by police on March 5, 2020, and faces up to  3 years in prison on charges of ``dissemination of data likely to  disturb the public order.''   In Venezuela, a group of masked police agents detained freelance  journalist Darvinson Rojas on March 21, 2020, and interrogated Rojas  about his reporting on COVID-19 cases in the state of Miranda. Rojas  remains in detention.   While the COVID-19 pandemic has spurred new restrictions and  harassment, these stories of abuse and resilience are nothing new in  the field of journalism. Since 1992, the Committee to Project  Journalists has reported 1,369 journalists killed around the world,  including at least 25 killed in 2019. Last year also represented the  14th year in a row that Freedom House has noted a global decline in  press freedom. As of April 20, 2020, at least 299 journalists were  imprisoned for their work worldwide.   Of course, the global decline in press freedom and access is not  limited to foreign lands. In the United States, the COVID-19 pandemic  has accelerated the struggle of local news organizations to stay  afloat. The shuttering of local print publications has left rural  populations and marginalized communities without critical sources of  information and has chipped away at the foundation of the U.S. free  press.   From the White House, President Trump continues to target journalists  and the media, referring to journalism as ``an evil propaganda  machine'' and the free press as the ``enemy of the people.'' Most  recently and severely, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the Trump  administration restricted most on-the-record access to administration  officials and reportedly instructed all officials, including scientific  and medical experts, to have public statements cleared through Vice  President Pence.   This episode is unfortunately the latest in an ongoing saga.  Countries around the world have followed President Trump's lead in  attacking journalism as ``fake news.'' Between January 2017 and May  2019, at least 26 countries have enacted or introduced laws restricting  access and media in the name of ``fake news.'' In attacking the media,  President Trump not only undermines the hard-hitting work journalists  in the United States do to hold our leaders accountable and keep the  public informed, but provides foreign leaders with the permission and  vocabulary to do the same.   In spite of the unprecedented assault on the free press, journalists  continue to take significant risks in the pursuit of truth and  transparency. In January 2020, the International Consortium of  Investigative Journalists revealed how Isabel dos Santos amassed one of  Africa's largest fortunes in Angola, one of the world's poorest  countries, through embezzlement and corruption using a network of  companies and subsidiaries. In May 2019, Caixin journalists reported on  business and government actions that resulted in the 2019 Jiangsu  Tianjiayi Chemical Plant explosion in China that killed 78 people and  injured over 600. Journalists have also continued to report on the  situation of Uyghurs and other minorities held in detention centers in  China's Xinjiang region, including new revelations from hundreds of  pages of leaked CCP documents published by the New York Times in  November 2019.   I join the international community in honoring and defending the  brave journalists seeking to report on the truth and tell the stories  that deserve to be told. Over 200 years ago, our Founding Fathers had  the foresight to recognize the importance of a free press to a  democracy, enshrining it in our First Amendment. Today, that importance  cannot be overstated. Recognizing that societies where informed  citizens can hold their governments accountable are more stable,  secure, and prosperous, we have a responsibility to stand up for the  fundamental rights of freedom of expression and a free press.   This week, I introduced a resolution commemorating World Press  Freedom Day. The resolution highlights increasing threats to freedoms  of the press and expression worldwide, especially amid the COVID-19  pandemic, reaffirms the centrality of a free and independent press to  the health of democracy, and reiterates freedom of the press as a  priority of the United States in promoting democracy, human rights, and  good governance. On this World Press Freedom Day, I call on the Trump  administration and our world leaders to recommit to advancing press  freedom, protecting journalists, and embracing the important role they  play in a healthy and secure society.    Mr. President, today I rise to introduce a resolution  with Senator Risch, as well as other colleagues, to thank countless  State Department career officials for their extensive efforts to bring  home over 78,000 United States citizens and legal permanent residents  during the COVID-19 pandemic. This pandemic caused an unprecedented  disruption in global travel, leaving tens of thousands of United States  citizens and legal permanent residents stranded overseas with no direct  way to return to the United States. While we will have ample  opportunity in the future to examine and better understand the  decisions made by senior leadership at the Department of State at the  onset of the COVID-19 crisis that could have allowed the United States  to more effectively respond to this pandemic, including to identify and  mitigate repatriation challenges, I will note that once the Department  recognized the enormity of the repatriation crisis, it's career  professionals sprung into action and, characteristically, rose to meet  the challenge and serve their nation with distinction.   Staying true to the Department's most fundamental mission, to protect  U.S. citizens abroad, State Department officers, family members, and  local employees faced great personal risk and long hours to assist U.S.  citizens during a time of dire need and stress. For that, my colleagues  and I are tremendously grateful. We commend the extraordinary work done  by the Repatriation Task Force, embassy and consulate staff around the  world, and the United States Transportation Command. Their efforts  resulted in the repatriation of over 78,000 Americans on 833 flights  originating from 128 countries and territories in just an 18-week  period. I would also like to extend my deepest thanks to Principal  Deputy Assistant Secretary Ian Brownlee and Deputy Assistant Secretary  Hugo Yon for their exemplary leadership of and contribution to the  Repatriation Task Force, as well as to Wendy Kennedy for her work with  the Bureau of Legislative Affairs. Furthermore, I would like to thank  Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary Julie Chung, Deputy Assistant  Secretary Kevin O'Reilly, Consul General Dana Deree (Honduras), Consul  General William Bent (El Salvador), Consul General John Barrett  (Recife), Deputy Chief of Mission Denison Offutt (Lima), Director for  Central America Affairs Marta Youth, and Country Consular Coordinator  Alexander Delorey (Quito) for their leadership in facilitating the  repatriation of thousands of Americans citizens from countries in the  Western hemisphere. I recognize that in calling out these individuals  who were especially helpful to me and to my office that I run the risk  of not naming the tens, if not hundreds of others who worked just as  hard and contributed just as much; they have my thanks as well.   I, along with my colleagues, are profoundly grateful to the  Department of State personnel who have worked tirelessly these past few  months, who have served the United States above and beyond the call of  duty, and who have helped their fellow citizen in a time of dire need.  I urge the Department to continue its good work and to remain ready to  bring home American citizens and legal permanent residents as the  COVID-19 pandemic persists.                            ____________________
