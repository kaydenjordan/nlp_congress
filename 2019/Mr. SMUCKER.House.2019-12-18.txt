 Madam Speaker, I rise today to ask my colleagues on the  other side of the aisle: How much is the trust of the American people  worth?   When the American people are dissatisfied with their government, the  primary tool that the Constitution gives them to make a change is their  vote. On November 8, 2016, Americans from every part of this Nation  packed the polls to elect Donald J. Trump to be the President of the  United States. The country wanted a disruptor, a fighter, a dealmaker,  a President who would put America first.   Sadly, on that very same day, Democrats had no plan or interest in  honoring the vote of the American people. They were going to attempt,  from day one, to delegitimize this President and, ultimately, remove  him from office.   Right after the President was sworn in, The Washington Post wrote:  ``The campaign to impeach President Trump has begun.'' Even before he  took office, a Politico article headline read: ``Could Trump Be  Impeached Shortly After He Takes Office?''   House Democrats have been planning for this day since January 2017.  It is clear that facts have never mattered to the House Democrats. They  never planned to work with the President. Instead, they intended only  to fulfill their divisive partisan agenda.   Again, I ask, how much is the trust of the American people worth?  Because after the vote today, for what you think is a short-term  partisan gain, you can be sure that the American people will have lost  their trust in our institution; they will have lost their trust in  Congress; and most importantly, they will have lost trust that their  vote counts.
