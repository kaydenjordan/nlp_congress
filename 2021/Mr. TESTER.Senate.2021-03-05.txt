 Mr. President, I would like to call up amendment No. 1197  and ask that it be reported by number.    I ask unanimous consent for 4 minutes of debate, equally  divided.    Senator Hoeven will speak for 1 minute. I will speak for  1 minute, and I would ask that I be notified when I run of out of my  minute.   Mr. President, this is the most important vote of the night. It is  2:41, so pay attention here.   The Keystone Pipeline would create good-paying jobs and bring much  needed revenue to rural counties in Eastern Montana. These counties  have been hard-hit by the pandemic. They have also been hard-hit by  trade wars that have impacted our agricultural community. So they need  the tax base, and this XL Pipeline would give them the tax base.   Look, there is no doubt the pipeline needs to be built responsibly  with American steel to the highest safety standards to respect private  property rights and to include significant consultation with Native  American Tribes. But the fact is, we have many pipelines to go across  the border between Canada and the United States. This is just one.   I would ask you to support this amendment.   Senator Hoeven.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator  Manchin be added to this amendment.    Mr. President, in accordance with section 904 of the  Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and the waiver provisions of all  applicable budget resolutions, I move to waive all applicable sections  of that act and applicable budget resolutions for the purpose of  amendment No. 1197, and I would ask for the yeas and nays.                          Vote on Amendment No. 1197     Mr. President, I rise, and unfortunately I have to speak  against this amendment from my good friend Jerry Moran. But here is the  deal. If you talk to the veterans, they like VA care, but there are  some cases where community care is very, very important for them to  have, either for personal reasons or maybe it is because it is closer  to where they live. So community care is also very, very important.   Here is the problem I have with Ranking Member Moran's amendment.  This bill sets it at a cap of $4 billion. OK. They go over that, they  have to come to us and ask for permission to go over that. Under this  amendment, they can spend any amount on care, up to $5 billion and even  more if they so choose, without our permission. I want Jerry Moran and  myself and others to be able to say: Hey, what are you spending that  money on? Is it really being spent to the best advantage? By the way,  that is not only for community care; that is for VA care too. So I  would like to leave that as a cap instead of a floor. That is why I  oppose this amendment.
