 Mr. President, I came to the floor to talk about the  border one more time, but I was intrigued by the rhetorical questions  my friend from Illinois has asked the Speaker.   I have got a question for President Biden: When you say that you are  not going to negotiate on the debt ceiling, does that mean that the  Federal Government is going to continue to rack up more and more debt  on top of the $30 trillion that we already owe, particularly during  inflationary times when interest rates on that debt basically are  eating up more and more of our discretionary budget?   To me, if the answer is yes, I am going to refuse to negotiate as we  continue to rack up more and more debt, about two-thirds of which is on  autopilot, as the Presiding Officer knows--it is mandatory spending.  That is a supremely irresponsible position to take.   President Biden, when he was in the Senate, was known as a dealmaker,  and as I said yesterday, during 2011, he negotiated with Senator  McConnell the Budget Control Act, which was probably the most recent  response, sort of a mixed bag as it was, to try to control Federal  spending. It was a noble effort, although it did not succeed.   So I know our friends on the Democratic side would like to sort of  add to Mr. McCarthy's challenges. We have got 6 months, perhaps,  between now and the time the extraordinary measures the Treasury  Department is going to be using to make sure we don't actually breach  that debt limit, but I would suggest that the time would be better  used, rather than sort of to add gasoline to the fire, to actually try  to solve the problem. And the problem--the debt limit--is real. It  needs to be addressed by two people: Speaker McCarthy and the President  of the United States. Because anything the Senate were to pass with 60  votes, which would be required, would certainly be dead on arrival in  the House of Representatives.   And so as a practical matter, while we are going to be very  interested and engaged in the debate and discussion, that is where the  decision is going to have to be made sometime between now and the time  extraordinary measures are exhausted, perhaps as early as June.   But in the meantime, for the President of the United States, who  represents not just Democrats, who represents all Americans--all 330  million-plus of us--to say: I am not negotiating, even though he has  got a track record as a Senator and as a Vice President of negotiating  hard things like this, to me, is an irresponsible answer, and I hope he  will reconsider.                            ____________________     Now, Mr. President, to talk about what I came here to  talk about--talk about the border.   I live in a border State. We have 1,200 miles of border with Mexico.  We have, as a country, 2,000 miles of border with Mexico. And we are  seeing numbers of people showing up at the border that we have never  seen before--millions of people since President Biden was sworn in as  President on January 20, 2021, millions of people showing up, many of  whom are claiming asylum and seeking to immigrate permanently into the  United States under the asylum laws. Because the administration has a  policy of releasing those individuals into the interior of the United  States to await a future immigration court hearing, which may be years  in the future because of backlog, many of those individuals do not show  up at their immigration court hearing but simply are willing to play  the odds that they can just melt into the Great American heartland and  not be returned or repatriated to their country of origin or actually  have to appear at an asylum hearing.   We know that, statistically, the number of people who actually do  show up for an asylum hearing in front of an immigration judge, only  roughly 90 percent of them fail to meet the very stringent requirement  for asylum, which is basically a credible fear of persecution based on  some classification: race, sex, ethnic origin, or the like. That is a  very narrow test, and it certainly does not include fear of poverty or  even violence in your home country. Yet the policy of the Biden  administration to basically create open borders and place individuals  who show up and claim asylum--these are not people trying to run away  from the Border Patrol, by the way. These are people who are turning  themselves in because they know they can play the system, and they will  be able to make their way into the United States without any  consequences--certainly, no legal consequences.   I am sure those of my colleagues who have visited the border--and we  had a bipartisan group just a couple weeks ago who did visit again both  Yuma, AZ, and El Paso. But as my colleagues can attest, there is no  data, there is no image there, frankly, or no words to adequately  convey the complexity of what is happening at the border today. To  understand, you have to see and hear for yourself.   Several years ago, I traveled to Brooks County, which is a little  county in South Texas, where I visited a ranch that the Border Patrol  had a rescue beacon in the middle of.   And just to explain, the Border Patrol does a lot of humanitarian  rescues because, as you can imagine, people coming from Central  America, up across the land bridge into Mexico, up to the United  States, many of them show up dehydrated, suffering from exposure, and  some of them, frankly, die on the trip. But the Border Patrol, while  they have the responsibility of enforcing our immigration laws at the  border and interdicting illegal drugs,  [[Page S85]]  they also rescue migrants who are in distress. And what these rescue  beacons are, out in the middle of nowhere, frankly--what they are are  large poles with a light on top that allows migrants who are sick,  injured, or otherwise in distress to contact law enforcement for help  and immediately get access to first aid, water, food, whatever they  need. There is a sign at the bottom of these rescue beacons that  instructs the migrants to press a red button for help and to remain in  the area.   Well, when I first went to Brooks County, which is where this-- Falfurrias is probably the largest inland port where the Border Patrol  has a checkpoint in Brooks County. I was surprised to see the rescue  beacons not written in just English, not just written in Spanish but in  Mandarin. Mandarin. This is Brooks County, TX, a rural county 70 or so  miles from the U.S.-Mexico border, and the rescue beacon is in Chinese,  the Chinese language. This is a factoid about the border crisis that  doesn't get nearly the attention that it deserves. What this tells me  and what I have learned subsequently is that migrants aren't just  coming from Mexico. They are not just coming from Central America. They  are literally coming from all around the world.   Now, when I hear, for example, Vice President Harris or the President  of the United States or Secretary of State Blinken talk about the  migration crisis, they want to talk about root causes. And I think,  although that is a little bit vague, I think what they are talking  about is they view migration as an economic crisis: people living in  their home country who are seeking a better life, which we all  certainly understand, or fleeing violence--they want to talk about root  causes.   But I think what they don't understand or certainly aren't  articulating is the fact that this is far broader than a regional  problem concentrated in Mexico and Central America. I think the fact  that these rescue beacons have been, for many years, written in  English, Spanish, and Mandarin is evidence of the fact that this is a  far larger problem but one that the administration has simply not  acknowledged.   A couple of weeks ago, I traveled with a bipartisan delegation of  colleagues to El Paso, TX, which is the westernmost point in my State.  Actually, just a bit of trivia, the city of El Paso is closer to the  Pacific Ocean than it is to the eastern tip of Texas, to give you an  idea of the scope of what we are talking about. It is a big place.   But we traveled to El Paso, TX, which is an urban area, but we also  went to Yuma, AZ, which, if you look on the map, is the southwestern  portion of Arizona, another border State, just right up against  California. But it is an agricultural community. I think it is fair to  say--I am not disparaging it--it is kind of a sleepy little  agricultural town.   We met a number of people in El Paso and Yuma whom I want to mention.  In El Paso, we went out on a night patrol with the Border Patrol. They  got on their horses, and they rode over this large area where there is  a lot of traffic. And then we were informed that they had detained two  migrants. And so we walked over there to sort of see what was going on,  and the Border Patrol said: Well, these two are from China. El Paso,  TX, two Chinese migrants trying to make their way across the border. As  a matter of fact, one of the Border Patrol Agents had to use an app on  the phone, I think it is called Google Translate, in order to  communicate with these migrants.    Then, when we went to one of the detention facilities or processing  facilities, actually--not actually detention--we met a family from  Uzbekistan while touring the Border Patrol Central Processing Center in  El Paso--not in Mexico, not Central America, but Uzbekistan. You can  look that up on the map. It is not a part of the region that the  President, the Secretary of State, and Vice President are talking about  when they are talking about root causes of illegal immigration.   But when we went to Yuma, the little sleepy agricultural town on the  border of Mexico and the United States, the Acting Border Patrol Chief  told us that one of the unusual features of a number of the migrants  who came across Yuma were they came from 176 different countries, and  they spoke more than 200 languages.   And you might ask: How in the world is that possible? Well, Senator  Kelly, one of the Arizona Senators, said: Well, there is an airport  right across the border in Mexico, at the northern border, in a city  called Mexicali. Again, if you look at your map of Mexico, you will see  that Mexicali is a pretty large urban area right there on the Arizona  border. And people fly into there. Of course, they have to pay human  smugglers, criminal organizations that are a network that smuggle human  beings for money from anywhere in the world to that airport, and then  they walk across or walk up to the Yuma Border Patrol and claim asylum.   They noted that many of them are apparently well-to-do. Somebody  mentioned Gucci luggage. I don't know whether Gucci makes luggage or  not, but you get the idea. These are the not the sort of mental  pictures that I think many people have of migrants who are seeking a  better life, necessarily, fleeing poverty, I should say, or fleeing  violence.   So the reason I mention this is because the reality of what is  happening on the ground along the border undercuts the rhetoric we hear  from the administration about how to solve this problem.   The White House has pushed a narrative that the only way to fix the  border crisis is to fix the ``root causes'' of migration, meaning the  economic and security concerns that cause people to come here. It has  honed in on the Northern Triangle, including El Salvador, Guatemala,  and Honduras, as the primary region of concern.   The administration's border czar, Vice President Harris, even led the  development of the ``root causes strategy.'' The problem is the data  shows that this is not the region driving illegal migration.   Last month, Customs and Border Protection encountered more than a  quarter of a million migrants at the southern border. Fewer than 33,000  of those 250,000 were from Northern Triangle countries--33,000 out of  the 250,000 were from Northern Triangle countries. So these are the  three countries that the administration is focused on.   It reminds me of the story of people who look through a soda straw at  a problem. Well, they can look down the soda straw, and they can see  what is happening there, but they don't see what is happening around  it, and they lose any sense of context or the complete picture. That is  what the administration is doing when they are looking at the border  and the humanitarian and national security crisis occurring there on a  daily basis and in my State's backyard.   As a matter of fact, these three countries represent only about 13  percent of the migrants encountered at the southern border in December.  Mexican nationals, the large country right on our southern border-- Mexico is not driving the numbers either. Only 19 percent of the border  encounters in December were Mexican nationals.   So where are all these men and women and children coming from? Well,  you can take a global map, a map of the world, and you can take a dart  and throw the dart at the map and you are likely to hit a place where  these migrants are coming from. Last year, across the entire border,  Customs and Border Protection encountered migrants from 174 different  countries. People from every corner of the globe are traveling through  Mexico and crossing America's southern border.   There is no question that the conditions in Mexico and the Northern  Triangle are contributing, but they are only a small fraction of the  problem. People around the world see the Biden administration catching  and releasing migrants by the thousands on a daily basis. They see the  yearslong wait for asylum cases to be adjudicated. They see the lack of  any interior enforcement by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and as  they look at this picture, they realize that if they can make it across  the southern border, they are likely to be able to stay in the United  States for years, if not a lifetime.   Despite what the administration may think, this is not just a  regional problem; it is a global phenomenon, run by transnational  criminal organizations. That ought to concern all of us.   Last year, CBP encountered migrants from 174 different countries. If  the administration wants to fix the ``root  [[Page S86]]  causes'' of this crisis, are they going to fix the world? You can see  why their misconception, their misunderstanding, their erroneous  narrative of what the problem is doesn't help solve the problem.   It is time for the Biden administration to acknowledge the reality of  the situation and look at solutions that are realistic and effective.  In order to get this crisis under control, we have to move quickly on a  bipartisan basis to insist on the enforcement of our immigration laws  when people attempt to enter our country other than through legal  means. That is the only viable path forward, and the sooner the  administration understands that, the better off we will all be.   I yield the floor.
