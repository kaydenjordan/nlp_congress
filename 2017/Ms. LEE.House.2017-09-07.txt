 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the 800,000  DREAMers in our Nation, 200,000 in my State of California.   Now, these DREAMers are students, entrepreneurs, volunteers, and  neighbors. They go to school, they work, and they pay taxes. They are  young men and women like my constituent, Karem, a DREAMer who recently  graduated from the University of California at Berkeley.   Karem now works as a paralegal, helping people like herself navigate  our complicated immigration system. Karem came to America when she was  only 3 years old.   In a message to my office, she wrote: ``The United States is all I've  ever known.''   I have to tell you, she is as American as I am. Forcing Karem or any  hardworking DREAMer out of this country or back into the shadows is  heartless and un-American. This is her home.   Deporting DREAMers from the only country they have ever known is an  extreme betrayal of our values. We care about family values. Ending  DACA breaks families up.   Let me be clear: Now President Trump has turned his back on these  innocent young people. Now it is up to Congress to have the courage to  do the right thing. I call on Speaker Ryan to bring up the bipartisan  and bicameral Dream Act now.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, first, let me thank our ranking member for  yielding and, really, for her tireless advocacy on behalf of all  Americans.   I rise in strong opposition to this rule and the underlying bill, the  so-called Make America Secure and Prosperous Appropriations Act.   Mr. Speaker, let's make one thing clear: this bill breaks  Republicans' promise to get back to regular order, while blocking the  majority of amendments to be considered on the floor. Also, as an  African-American woman, I can't help but see how these cuts impact  communities of color.   It may be easy to think of budgets in terms of dollar signs and  decimal points, but the disturbing truth is that the decisions we make  here affect lives. If we are honest, many of these decisions in this  bill disproportionately affect Black and Brown lives.   For instance, the bill eliminates the Teen Pregnancy Prevention  Initiative, the Racial and Ethnic Approaches to Communities Health  Program--just eliminates it--and Title X family planning, which many  women of color and men rely on. It eliminates the Health and Career  Opportunities Program, which provides training and grants for health  careers for minority-serving institutions, and it eliminates the  Minority AIDS Initiative, just to name a few. These are just under the  Health and Human Services provision.   This bill cuts $3 billion from the Pell Grant Surplus Program, $190  million in 21st Century Community Schools, and eliminates the  comprehensive literacy program. All of these are critical education  programs that predominantly help people and students of color.   I am also disappointed that this bill divests in our workforce,  especially for communities of color, by eliminating the proven  apprenticeship programs and cutting millions of our Nation's job  training programs, including reintegration of ex-offenders--again,  majority African-American and Latino ex-offenders--reentering into  society. This budget cuts millions from that.   It refuses to make in order Congressman Bobby Scott's amendment to  strike the prohibition against using Federal funds for transportation  to desegregate public schools. We are talking, still, about  desegregating public schools in 2017.   What is worse, I offered an amendment in Rules to combat these  devastating cuts to communities of color, and Republicans refused to  make them in order. I offered an amendment that would have prohibited  funds from being used to implement the policy memo that Attorney  General Sessions has presented that rolls back the failed War on Drugs  and reinstates the harshest sentences for low-level drug offenses, the  majority of whom--guess what--are African Americans.   I offered another amendment that would have expressed the sense of  Congress that race-conscious admissions policies, which are designed to  achieve a more diverse student body, which allows for the use of race  as one factor, only one factor, in admissions--these policies, we have  to remember, are beneficial to all students. So the Department of  Justice should not take action to limit these benefits.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding another  minute.   Mr. Speaker, we should not be trying to limit students of color  access to education, which the Justice Department is trying to do.  Affirmative action is critical to mitigating discriminatory practices  that prevent students of color from being admitted into the schools of  their choice. Attorney General Sessions needs to back off of this. I  tried to do this through an amendment to send that message. Of course,  that amendment was not made in order.   Congress can help, though, renew their faith in minority communities,  and the minority communities can renew their faith in Congress by not  accepting this Trump agenda and support clear policies that demonstrate  to people of color that our lives also matter in America.  Unfortunately, this spending bill does just the opposite.   So I hope the Members will understand the message that we are sending  to communities of color. I just mentioned a few of the cuts that have  been put into this bill. I hope that we work to rectify the problems  with it.   It is past time to get back to regular order. It is past time to move  each bill individually, also. It is past time to make strong  investments in the American people, which include people of color. It  is past time to help grow the economy and to create good-paying jobs  for everyone.   So, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the rule and  ``no'' on the underlying bill. There is simply too much at stake.    Mr. Chairman, I want to thank our ranking member for  yielding, but also I just want to thank her for her tireless leadership  on our subcommittee and full committee. You truly are a champion for  all Americans, especially women and girls not only in our own country  but all around the world. So it is really too bad we have to stand here  and even debate this again, but thank you again for your leadership.   I am proud to speak in support of our ranking member's amendment to  strike two poison pill riders in this bill.   Now, my colleagues and I have offered amendments to strike these  ideological--that is what they are--provisions both in the full  Appropriations Committee and again during the Rules Committee. It is  outrageous, quite frankly, that the majority refuse to allow these  amendments to even come to the floor for a debate.   Now, I have fought long and hard against the global gag rule, which  denies family planning funding to organizations who want to help women  plan their families. We have been fighting this now for at least,  myself, two decades.   This cruel policy is really a political football putting lives at  risk just to score a few cheap political points. President Trump and  this Republican majority have taken this extreme policy to the limits,  expanded it to all global health funding.   Let me be clear. This policy will cost lives. This administration's  actions have consequences, and, sadly, it is the most vulnerable women  and girls who will pay the price. The expanded global gag rule also  undermines our longstanding bipartisan foreign aid priorities like  fighting gender-based violence and ending AIDS.   On top of that, this bill includes a prohibition of funding for  UNFPA, again, based on pure ideology. UNFPA works in some of the most  dangerous  [[Page H7125]]  places, giving care to those who need it the most. They treat victims  of sexual violence and provide menstrual hygiene services and maternity  care in humanitarian crisis settings.   I visited many times UNFPA projects all around the world, and I have  seen firsthand the tremendous impacts these programs have on the lives  of those they serve. Defunding these programs truly will kill women.   I urge my colleagues to reject these harmful riders, reject this  bill, and get back to regular order. It is time to stop trying to push  through these really untenable bills that really are very dangerous to  women and girls throughout the world and babies.
