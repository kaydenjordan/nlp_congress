 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1623) to amend the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to  provide for the treatment of payments for child care and other personal  use services as an authorized campaign expenditure, and for other  purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1623         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS; PURPOSE.         (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Help       America Run Act''.        (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:        (1) Everyday Americans experience barriers to entry before       they can consider running for office to serve their       communities.        (2) Current law states that campaign funds cannot be spent       on everyday expenses that would exist whether or not a       candidate were running for office, like rent and food. While       the law seems neutral, its actual effect is to privilege the       independently wealthy who want to run, because given the       demands of running for office, candidates who must work to       pay for childcare or to afford health insurance are       effectively being left out of the process, even if they have       sufficient support to mount a viable campaign.        (3) Thus current practice favors those prospective       candidates who do not need to rely on a regular paycheck to       make ends meet. The consequence is that everyday Americans       who have firsthand knowledge of the importance of stable       childcare, a safety net, or great public schools are less       likely to get a seat at the table. This governance by the few       is antithetical to the democratic experiment, but most       importantly, when lawmakers do not share the concerns of       everyday Americans, their policies reflect that.        (4) These circumstances have contributed to a Congress that       does not always reflect everyday Americans. The New York       Times reported in 2019 that fewer than 5 percent of       representatives cite blue-collar or service jobs in their       biographies. A 2015 survey by the Center for Responsive       Politics showed that the median net worth of lawmakers was       just over $1 million in 2013, or 18 times the wealth of the       typical American household.        (5) These circumstances have also contributed to a       governing body that does not reflect the nation it serves.       For instance, women are 51% of the American population. Yet       even with a record number of women serving in the One Hundred       Sixteenth Congress, the Pew Research Center notes that more       than three out of four Members of this Congress are male. The       Center for American Women And Politics found that one third       of women legislators surveyed had been actively discouraged       from running for office, often by political professionals.       This type of discouragement, combined with the prohibitions       on using campaign funds for domestic needs like childcare,       burdens that still fall disproportionately on American women,       particularly disadvantages working mothers. These barriers       may explain why only 10 women in history have given birth       while serving in Congress, in spite of the prevalence of       working parents in other professions. Yet working mothers and       fathers are best positioned to create policy that reflects       the lived experience of most Americans.        (6) Working mothers, those caring for their elderly       parents, and young professionals who rely on their jobs for       health insurance should have the freedom to run to serve the       people of the United States. Their networks and net worth are       simply not the best indicators of their strength as       prospective public servants. In fact, helping ordinary       Americans to run may create better policy for all Americans.        (c) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to ensure that       all Americans who are otherwise qualified to serve this       Nation are able to run for office, regardless of their       economic status. By expanding permissible uses of campaign       funds and providing modest assurance that testing a run for       office will not  [[Page H8577]]       cost one's livelihood, the Help America Run Act will       facilitate the candidacy of representatives who more       accurately reflect the experiences, challenges, and ideals of       everyday Americans.       SEC. 2. TREATMENT OF PAYMENTS FOR CHILD CARE AND OTHER                     PERSONAL USE SERVICES AS AUTHORIZED CAMPAIGN                     EXPENDITURE.         (a) Personal Use Services as Authorized Campaign       Expenditure.--Section 313 of the Federal Election Campaign       Act of 1971 (52 U.S.C. 30114) is amended by adding at the end       the following new subsection:        ``(d) Treatment of Payments for Child Care and Other       Personal Use Services as Authorized Campaign Expenditure.--        ``(1) Authorized expenditures.--For purposes of subsection       (a), the payment by an authorized committee of a candidate       for any of the personal use services described in paragraph       (3) shall be treated as an authorized expenditure if the       services are necessary to enable the participation of the       candidate in campaign-connected activities.        ``(2) Limitations.--        ``(A) Limit on total amount of payments.--The total amount       of payments made by an authorized committee of a candidate       for personal use services described in paragraph (3) may not       exceed the limit which is applicable under any law, rule, or       regulation on the amount of payments which may be made by the       committee for the salary of the candidate (without regard to       whether or not the committee makes payments to the candidate       for that purpose).        ``(B) Corresponding reduction in amount of salary paid to       candidate.--To the extent that an authorized committee of a       candidate makes payments for the salary of the candidate, any       limit on the amount of such payments which is applicable       under any law, rule, or regulation shall be reduced by the       amount of any payments made to or on behalf of the candidate       for personal use services described in paragraph (3), other       than personal use services described in subparagraph (D) of       such paragraph.        ``(C) Exclusion of candidates who are officeholders.--      Paragraph (1) does not apply with respect to an authorized       committee of a candidate who is a holder of Federal office.        ``(3) Personal use services described.--The personal use       services described in this paragraph are as follows:        ``(A) Child care services.        ``(B) Elder care services.        ``(C) Services similar to the services described in       subparagraph (A) or subparagraph (B) which are provided on       behalf of any dependent who is a qualifying relative under       section 152 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.        ``(D) Health insurance premiums.''.        (b) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section       shall take effect on the date of the enactment of this Act.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in support of H.R. 1623. This measure is important. The Help  America Run Act will amend the Federal Election Campaign Act with  commonsense reforms to help everyday Americans run for office.   Current law does not directly address whether people who choose to  run for office can use their campaign funds to cover the cost of  childcare. This has led several individuals to have to appeal to the  Federal Election Commission for evaluations on a case-by-case basis and  creates a burden for candidates with school-aged children.   This bill addresses that barrier and other family-related barriers  for candidates who have experiences like most everyday Americans.   The Help American Run Act makes running for office easier for working  mothers and fathers who need sitters for their small kids. It would  support established professionals caring for an aging parent and help  cover children's health insurance on the campaign trail.   I know it would help moms like Katie Porter, the sponsor of this  bill. She is championing this cause today as the very first single  mother of young children ever to serve in the U.S. Congress.   These Americans caring for their kids and their parents intimately  know the dread of opening those envelopes full of prescription drug  bills. They know what it is like to weigh the risk of running for  office to serve the Nation against the risk of losing their children's  health insurance coverage.   It is precisely those everyday Americans that I want to see join us  at the decisionmaking table. Those who have firsthand knowledge of what  it means to have stable childcare, good schools, and secure healthcare  are exactly the people I want making decisions on both sides of this  aisle. It makes our country profoundly richer to have those with the  diversity of economic experiences in these Chambers. I know that  firsthand.   As the daughter of a truck driver and a cafeteria cook, I worked on  the night shift at the Eastman Kodak plant in Palo Alto to get ready  for college. Those experiences shaped me into the person and Member I  am today, and I believe coming from a family like mine shouldn't  disqualify you. In fact, it makes you a better policy maker who  understands what our constituents are really facing.   The fact is that diversity of experience leads to better policy. In  2019, the New York Times reported that fewer than 5 percent of  Representatives cite blue-collar or service jobs in their biographies.   A 2015 survey by the Center for Responsive Politics showed that the  median net worth for lawmakers was just over $1 million in 2013, or 18  times the wealth of the typical American household. One could see how  Americans feel Congress might be out of touch.   This bill is a step to building trust in Congress as by and for the  people. The bill would help advance economic diversity and other types  of diversity, too.   Even with the record number of women serving in the 116th Congress,  only 1 in 4 Congresspeople are women. This isn't because women don't  want to run.   The Center for American Women and Politics found that one-third of  women legislators surveyed had been actively discouraged from running  for office, often by political professionals. This type of  discouragement, combined with the existing prohibitions on using  campaign funds for domestic needs like childcare, burdens that still  fall disproportionately on American women, particularly disadvantages  working parents.   Running for office should not be limited to the wealthy or those who  have no familial responsibilities. That is anathema to the democratic  experiment, and it makes for bad policy.   This bill is a simple, cost-free, commonsense measure to make  America's representatives look more like the everyday Americans we are  here to represent. For that reason, I am proud to support it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Porter), the author of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Listening to my colleague, the ranking member, reminded me of when I  ran for Congress the very first time. My children were in elementary  school. Really, the high point of every day was going to the elementary  school, Horace Mann Elementary in downtown San Jose, and standing with  the other mothers while we said the Pledge of Allegiance, the flag  outside.    I think, for parents, being a parent gives you a viewpoint that is  helpful when you come to the Congress of the United States. You don't  forget what regular people are going through at home when you are a  parent.  [[Page H8579]]    I also remember my first day in Congress. My mother had passed away  several years before, but my dad was still alive, a retired beer truck  driver. He had never been on an airplane in his life. We got him on a  plane, and we had a friend sit next to him. He was sitting in that  gallery, watching his daughter become a Member of the United States  Congress.   I think for those of us who came from humble roots, we never forget  where we came from, and it informs our perspective on where the country  should go.   I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Porter), the author of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   I think the gentlewoman has made a very good point that this is  discretionary on the part of the candidate, but it is a point that we  also need to make: This has nothing to do with taxpayers funds. This is  no money from the government, no money from the taxpayers. This is a  candidate, where a candidate has raised funds and how they spend their  campaign funds.   I know that there had been some confusion among some earlier in the  day that was unfortunate and has now been corrected. This is only a  matter of a campaign expenditure. Really, childcare has to be as  important as pizza, to me, at least more important, but that is up for  a candidate to decide.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, one thing that we neglected to point out is that, in  addition to a childcare option, if a candidate, and it is generally a  female candidate, is caring for elderly parents, this could also be  used for eldercare while going to a campaign event. That is also both  son's and daughter's care for aging parents, but, oftentimes, it is the  daughters who end up providing the eldercare.   If someone is running for Congress and is providing for that  eldercare, they obviously can't go to the campaign event with someone  who is bedridden or in need of constant attention. This would allow for  that very important possibility, just as childcare is.   Unless the author wishes a further comment, I would urge adoption of  this amendment with bipartisan support, and I yield back the balance of  my time.                                time  1630     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to  the resolution (H. Res. 107) establishing the Congressional Gold Star  Family Fellowship Program for the placement in offices of Members of  the House of Representatives of children, spouses, and siblings of  members of the Armed Forces who are hostile casualties or who have died  from a training-related injury, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 107         Resolved,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This resolution may be cited as the ``SFC Sean Cooley and       SPC Christopher Horton Congressional Gold Star Family       Fellowship Program Act''.       SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD STAR FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM.         (a) Establishment.--There is established in the House of       Representatives the Congressional Gold Star Family Fellowship       Program (hereafter in this resolution referred to as the       ``Program'') under which, under the direction of the Chief       Administrative Officer of the House of Representatives, an       eligible individual may serve a 12-month fellowship in the       office of a Member of the House of Representatives (including       a Delegate or Resident Commissioner to the Congress).        (b) Exclusion of Appointees for Purposes of Limit on Number       of Employees in Member Offices.--Any individual serving a       fellowship under the Program in the office of a Member shall       not be included in the determination of the number of       employees employed by the Member under section 104(a) of the       House of Representatives Administrative Reform Technical       Corrections Act (2 U.S.C. 5321(a)).        (c) Placement in Member Offices in District of Columbia or       Congressional District of Member.--An individual may serve a       fellowship under the Program at the Member's office in the       District of Columbia or the Member's office in the       congressional district the Member represents.        (d) Eligible Individual Defined.--In this section, the term       ``eligible individual'' means the child (including a       stepchild), spouse, or sibling of--        (1) a person who dies in the line of duty while serving as       a member of the Armed Forces (including the reserve       components and the National Guard), regardless of the duty       status of the member while serving, unless such death was the       result of the willful misconduct of the member; or        (2) a veteran who dies from a service-connected disability       (as defined in section 101 of title 38, United States Code)       during the 4-year period beginning on the date of the last       discharge or release of the veteran from the Armed Forces.        (e) Regulations.--The Program shall be carried out in       accordance with regulations promulgated by the Committee on       House Administration.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   This resolution establishes the Congressional Gold Star Family  Fellowship Program, which will provide fellowships in congressional  offices for immediate family members of the Armed Forces who have given  their lives in service to this country.   Members of the Armed Forces do not serve by themselves. They are  supported by children, spouses, siblings, and others who often go  months or longer without seeing their loved one while that loved one is  deployed.   It is incumbent on all Americans, but particularly those of us who  have the privilege of serving in Congress, to support military  families, and none more so than our Gold Star families.   Gold Star families have experienced the worst type of heartbreak,  sacrifice, and loss, and they deserve our unwavering recognition,  compassion, and support. The Congressional Gold Star Family Fellowship  Program is one small way for us in Congress to provide that support.   This program will offer an opportunity for members of Gold Star  families to gain firsthand experience in Congress through a yearlong  fellowship in a congressional office. These fellowships can take place  either here in Washington or back home in a district office and will  allow Gold Star families to both participate in and learn about the  democracy their loved one gave the ultimate sacrifice to protect.   Nothing can ever fill the void left by the loss of a loved one who  was killed serving the Nation, but we in Congress should be doing  everything we can to help lift up those who have suffered this  unfathomable loss.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to support the establishment of this program.  I urge my colleagues to support this resolution, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am glad that the ranking member has mentioned the  Wounded Warrior Program that, I believe, has been enormously  successful.   Practically every week, I am signing little termination letters. And  why? Because these wounded warriors have gotten jobs, promotions,  permanent positions, exactly what we wanted.   So not only will this help the families, Gold Star families, gain  insight  [[Page H8581]]  into the workings of the United States Congress, but it will also be a  platform for them to, if they wish, expand their employment  opportunities, just as our Wounded Warrior Program has done so.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the author of the bill. I thank the ranking  member for moving this forward. I am glad that this is bipartisan, as  well the prior bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, like Mr. Davis, I do believe that this fellowship will  provide a rewarding experience for the families who decide to  participate, whether it is in Washington, to participate and observe in  the making of legislation, or whether it is in our district offices,  going to bat for veterans, standing up for people who need help from a  congressional office. It is very rewarding, but also very educational.  And I know that it will be a rewarding experience for those families  who participate.   I thank the author of the bill, Mr. Kelly, for his persistence in  getting this done and making adjustments as input came in so that we  can have consensus and proceed on this.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I think this has been an excellent debate  highlighting the bipartisan support for this fellowship, a bipartisan  gratitude to those who served and those who gave their lives for this  country and for the families they left behind. There is no honor big  enough that we could possibly give to them, but this fellowship is a  token. It is a token that is important, and it is something that we  have done in a bipartisan way.   Mr. Speaker, I hope that every Member of this body will be supportive  of it, and I yield back the balance of my time.
