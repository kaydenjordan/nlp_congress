 Mr. President, I want to thank Chairman Leahy for his  excellent remarks.   Let me simply say, to move forward without amendments surrenders the  constitutional obligations Senators have to the American people. This  issue is important, it is complicated, and the American people deserve  to have an opportunity for some real amendments to make sure that, at  the end of the day, we have policies that keep our people safe and  protect our liberties.   I see my friend from Kentucky. He is joined by his colleague from  Utah Senator Lee, Senator Leahy, and me.   Our bipartisan coalition is dedicated to essentially one mission: We  think the country deserves a Senate that is very tough on terrorists.  We don't take a backseat to anybody in terms of fighting terrorists.  What we are opposed to is an end run on our sacred Constitution.   Right now, with the changes in communication systems around the world  and communication systems increasingly becoming globally  interconnected, we have more and more law-abiding Americans swept up in  searches under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. We want to  fight terrorists, but the law allows the government to target  foreigners to acquire foreign intelligence information, which basically  means anything related to the conduct of foreign affairs.   So let's talk about who could get swept up in these searches and who  the people are whom Senator Paul, Senator Lee, Senator Leahy, myself,  and colleagues on both sides of the aisle sought to protect as law- abiding Americans--we think they ought to have their constitutional  rights. The kinds of people who could be swept up in these  communications and have their emails or texts or their data searched  without a warrant--it could be American businesspeople talking to  foreign contacts. It could be first-, second-, or third-generation  American immigrants talking to family and friends who are still  overseas; American journalists covering foreign stories; U.S.  servicemembers talking to foreign friends they made while they were  deployed; American teachers and researchers seeking information from  foreigners.   How many Americans get swept up? We don't know. And we don't know-- not because of a lack of effort. We have been trying for 6 years to get  the government to provide even an estimate. On a number of these  issues, my concern is to ensure that we have both safety and liberty,  but we have actually gone backward.   In an open hearing of the Intelligence Committee, when the Director  of National Intelligence, Dan Coats--our former colleague--was asked  about whether the government could collect, in effect, wholly domestic,  personal data here in the United States, we couldn't even get a  straight answer with respect to whether the government, under the  Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, could collect wholly domestic  communications. We couldn't even get a straight answer to that.   What we need is the opportunity to have a real debate. We have a  number of amendments that go right to the heart of what these issues  are all about, particularly the government conducting repeated,  warrantless searches of Americans, even if those Americans aren't the  subject of any investigation, and the government then can read those  private communications.   Finally, I want to put this whole issue in context. Every year, the  CIA and the NSA conduct thousands of warrantless searches of 702 data  on Americans, and that is just for content. They conduct tens of  thousands of warrantless searches for communication records. The FBI is  conducting these searches so frequently that they don't even count. But  this bill might have some marginal effect on only one of those  searches. So the House bill is not just fake reform; it is a setback.   The last point I would make is that we finally made some headway with  respect to collection of communications that are neither to nor from a  foreign target but are simply about a foreign target. I went after this  issue for years, this question of abuse of what is called ``abouts''  collection. Finally, the government realized it was going too far, and  they put limits on it. Now it looks as though they want to get back in  the business, and the other body--the House--basically creates a path  to going back to ``abouts'' collection, which even the government has  admitted has been abused.   There is an opportunity, if we vote, to allow some amendments, to  come up with policies that will allow Americans to look at the Senate  and say: We didn't go backward. We went forward. We protected law- abiding Americans, but we made it clear that we were going to be  relentless in our search for terrorists.   I know I have a little bit more time, but I see my colleague and  partner Senator Paul on the floor.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to  2 minutes.    Mr. President, I thank my colleagues. I will be very  brief.   Colleagues, what we are debating is whether the Senate will be the  Senate. If you vote in favor of this, you are voting for cloture, there  will be no amendments then. We would have the opportunity, if we vote  against cloture, for improving this bill.   I want to emphasize that if we take a short time to improve this  bill, as Senator Lee, Senator Leahy, and Senator Paul want to do, this  program continues to operate. It is not in any way going to harm our  ability to fight terrorism. This program would stand.   I urge my colleagues to vote to carry out our constitutional  obligation as Senators, to have real debate and vote against cloture.   I yield.                                Cloture Motion
