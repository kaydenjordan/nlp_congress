 Mr. Speaker, at this time I rise to take this Special  Order hour on behalf of the Congressional Black Caucus.   It is with great honor that I rise as coanchor for the next 60  minutes. We have a chance to speak directly to the American people on  the issues of great importance to the Congressional Black Caucus,  Congress, and the constituents we represent, as well as all Americans.   This evening, myself and coanchor Marc Veasey will discuss two  topics: wealth care over healthcare and the contributions of Caribbean  Americans.   On the matter of healthcare, Senate Republicans have finally released  their draft version of the House-passed American Health Care Act, and  it is clear why they kept it behind closed doors all this time. The  bill is worse than the one that was passed in the House, with deeper  cuts to Medicaid  [[Page H5170]]  and a ban on Planned Parenthood funding for 1 year.   Just like the bill that passed the House, this proposal will likely  strip coverage for millions of Americans and do nothing to address  affordability. This bill is just as mean and heartless as the one the  Republicans jammed through the House.   As bad as it already was, Senate Republicans have made TrumpCare even  more devastating to Americans on Medicaid, and those include veterans,  middle class seniors with long-term care needs, vulnerable children,  and pregnant women. No, it is not just minority Black people who are on  Medicaid.   TrumpCare's Medicaid cuts will have an especially severe impact in  rural America, shutting rural hospitals, an important source of good- paying jobs. TrumpCare fundamentally means higher health costs,  millions of hardworking Americans losing healthcare coverage, gutting  key protections, a crushing age tax, and stealing from Medicare.   Republicans shut the American people out of writing TrumpCare. And if  TrumpCare passes, the American people will be shut out of affordable  healthcare, too. Now, after crafting this monstrosity in secret, the  GOP wants to rush it to the floor before the American people see the  damage it will do, abandoning any pretense of respect for the  democratic process.   Democrats in Congress and across the country will continue to fight  with all our strength to protect seniors and hardworking families from  TrumpCare's assault on their healthcare.   June, as we know, is Caribbean American Heritage Month, and we will  later hear from Members of Congress related to that.   At this time, I yield to the gentleman from Fort Worth, Texas (Mr.  Veasey), my co-chair, an advocate for his constituents and for all  Americans. He sits on the Armed Services Committee and is here to  discuss the effect that this bill will have not only on his  constituents, but to the people that we care deeply about.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for those words. We  were discussing the Medicaid expansion and the fact that it is going to  disappear after 2023.   The other thing that is going to be removed from this bill is the  Prevention and Public Health Fund which presently has billions of  dollars that are supportive to the CDC. What is this money used for?  [[Page H5171]]    This money is used for preventative block grants that go to all  places, like my district, the Virgin Islands, that deal with chronic  conditions such as heart disease and hypertension, provide maternal and  child care, support public laboratories and research, and maintain  vital statistics. Those moneys would be gone if this bill passes.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to Mr. Scott, my esteemed colleague from  Richmond and Hampton Roads in Virginia, who is the ranking member of  the Education and the Workforce Committee, to talk about the issues and  how he sees this is important, not only to his constituents, but to  America as well.   I thank the gentleman for being here this evening and giving us his  thoughts.    Mr. Speaker, it is their loss.    I know the gentleman is still working for them though.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman so much for those  thoughts and reflections that we should have about this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Houston, Texas (Ms.  Jackson Lee). She has been an advocate for Americans, has spoken, and  done so eloquently, related to her work on the Judiciary Committee, as  well as Homeland Security, and I am eager to hear what the gentlewoman  has to say about healthcare. And as well, of course, as a fellow  Caribbean American, I would wish her and her family a Happy Caribbean  American Heritage Month, which was, of course, offered by our  colleague, Barbara Lee, in 2005.    I thank the gentlewoman so much for that information,  for much of the testimonies that you have given for the record.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include any extraneous material on the subject of this Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, at this time, it gives me great pleasure  to yield to Congresswoman Barbara Lee, who not only represents  California in the area of Berkeley as well as Oakland, but is also  someone who is a real progressive fighter for the American people,  cares passionately about healthcare.   But on this evening when we are also talking about Caribbean American  Heritage Month, I have to tell you that, in June of 2005, the House  unanimously adopted H. Con. Res. 71, which was sponsored and ushered  through by Congresswoman Barbara Lee with other Members, which was  recognizing the significance of Caribbean people and their descendants  in the history and culture of the United States. On February 14, 2006,  the resolution similarly passed the Senate, culminating a 2-year  bipartisan, bicameral effort that was issued by President George Bush  on June 6, 2006.   Since the declaration, the White House has issued annual  proclamations recognizing June as Caribbean American Heritage Month,  and it gives those of us of Caribbean-American heritage great honor and  a real opportunity to extol and let other Americans know about the  contributions, the issues that are important to us.   I thank Congresswoman Lee for bringing that forward and for ushering  that through. It is really, I feel, quite often that we get subsumed,  that the experiences of Caribbean Americans often get glossed over, and  I want to thank her for affording us the opportunity to have this month  to be able to talk among ourselves and among other Americans about the  things that we have done.   I yield to the gentlewoman from California to discuss healthcare as  well as Caribbean American Heritage Month.    It says a lot for what we can accomplish.    I thank the gentlewoman for that information and for  her passionate words.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Wisconsin (Ms. Moore),  who is an advocate for people throughout this country, not just  Wisconsin, and who is a poet along with being a great Congresswoman.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time I have  remaining.    Mr. Speaker, it is with enormous, not just gratitude,  but great pride, actually, to yield to someone who, to me, is one of my  big sisters here, who is the champion in the House, the foundation for  those of us within the Caribbean Caucus who are Caribbean Americans  here in the Congress. She represents probably one of the largest  Caribbean constituencies in the United States, that being part of  Brooklyn, New York, which I tell everybody is the largest Caribbean  island in the world.                                time  2015    Congresswoman Yvette Clarke is a great member on the Committee on  Energy and Commerce. She is one of the co-chairs of the Congressional  Caribbean Caucus, and she is a passionate progressive advocate for  healthcare and for all care for Americans and for those who have been  forgotten.   I am so glad and so grateful for the gentlewoman's continued efforts  to raise the level of awareness on issues related to the Caribbean  Basin, of Caribbean Americans here in the United States, and the  African diaspora as a whole, that we are not a monolithic group, that  we have a richness and a variety within even Americans who are of  Caribbean descent here in America. And that needs to be celebrated and  discussed, and the achievements and how we all, as a mosaic, make  America great by being part of different cultures.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Clarke)  this evening to discuss healthcare and Caribbean American Heritage  Month.    Mr. Speaker, I find it very interesting for myself that  we have Congresswoman Yvette Clarke and the next Member to come up is  also from New York. Both of them have been Representatives of districts  that I have lived in and that my family lives in. They represent what I  think of when I think of my parents who live now in Congressman Meeks'  district, and my mother who was partly raised in Congresswoman Clarke's  district. My parents represent most Caribbean Americans who come to  this country--people who come here with not much, who are willing to  work hard, who believe that the sacrifice toward education and support  of their families and helping others to come and find good, stable jobs  and create middle class is what America is about.   We have contributed so much, and we can talk about so many of the  Caribbean Americans who have done amazing things in this country. But  it is those individuals who we do not talk about--our parents, our  families--who come to this country, who provided the stability for  others. It is why we are so concerned about the temporary protective  status of Haitians--the 50,000 Haitians who are hardworking Haitians in  this country, who are being sent back, who are now here working hard  and sending so much money back that is the backbone of the economy of  Haiti, who we cannot let go back because that country will collapse  with them, leaving this country, and being good citizens--as much as  they can be citizens--yearning for the American Dream.   Mr. Speaker, Mr. Meeks represents Queens, which is one of the  backbones of Caribbean Americans. He is my parents' Congressman. The  gentleman has been so good to the people that he represents as well as  all the American people. The gentleman sits on the Committee on  Financial Services. He also  [[Page H5177]]  sits as a member on the Foreign Affairs Committee, where he advocates  and speaks for those individuals who cannot speak for themselves.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Meeks).    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time I have  left.    I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Evans),  and I will close out after that.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 8 o'clock and 39 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Tuesday, June 27, 2017, at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
