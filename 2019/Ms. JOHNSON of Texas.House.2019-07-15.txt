 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address the issue  of stagnant wages for African Americans and, as a result, the lack of  economic opportunities.   We have seen a recent epidemic of the working poor--hardworking  Americans who each day are forced to choose between food, shelter,  clothing or health care for themselves and their families. In the past  40 years, minimum wage increases have not kept pace with inflation,  causing millions of families to struggle with stagnant wages while the  cost of goods and services continue to rise. The current minimum wage  in my home state of Texas is only $7.25 an hour, and even lower for  workers in the service industry, who instead rely heavily on customer  tips for take-home pay.   The African American community, which makes up a significant portion  of the minimum-wage workforce, is disproportionately affected by lower  wages. According to the Economic Policy Institute, 38.1% of all black  workers would receive higher pay as a result of an increased wage,  therefore opening up new economic opportunities.   We must act quickly to ensure that any American willing to work 40  hours a week can afford basic necessities, that is why I am proud to  cosponsor H.R. 582, the Raise the Wage Act. This bill would lift  millions of Americans out of poverty by gradually increasing the  minimum wage over a period of five years to $15.   Mr. Speaker, the growing racial wealth gap in our country can no  longer go unnoticed. We now have an opportunity to take concrete steps  to help close the gap.                            ____________________
