 Mr. Speaker, the House is losing many fine Members at the  end of this session, and I wish them all well. There is one retiring  Member I want to say a few words about today.   That Member is my good friend, Louie Gohmert.   Louie and I came to Congress in the 109th in the year 2005 in a  relatively small class. But that class had five fine Texans, three of  whom have already retired.   Louie Gohmert has been a great friend and an extremely dedicated  patriot and Representative. He has been actually a great friend to all  people in this body. He is kind and gentle. He is very serious also  about the work that is done here.   I know he has often been frustrated by the actions of both the House  and Senate, but he has continued to work diligently to make our country  and, indeed, the entire world better.   The highest compliment I think I can pay him is that he is a good man  who has always sought to do good.   Our country has been blessed by Louie Gohmert throughout his life,  and I am sure he will continue to do good.   Mr. Speaker, I will miss Louie, but will pray that God will continue  to bless him, Kathy, and his daughters.                            ____________________
