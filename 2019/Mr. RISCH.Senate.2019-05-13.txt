The estimated cost is $3.0       billion.        This proposed sale will support the foreign policy and       national security of the United States by helping to improve       the security of a friendly country that continues to be an       important force for political and economic progress in the       Middle East. Qatar is host to the U.S. Central Command forces       and serves as a critical forward-deployed location in the       region. The acquisition of these helicopters will allow for       integration with U.S. forces for training exercises, which       contributes to regional security and interoperability.        The proposed sale of the AH-64E Apache helicopters will       supplement the Qatar Emiri Air Force's previous procurement       of twenty-four (24) AH-64Es, which are capable of meeting its       requirements for close air support, armed reconnaissance, and       anti-tank warfare missions. The helicopters will provide a       long-term defensive and offensive capability to the Qatar       peninsula as well as enhance the protection of key oil and       gas infrastructure and platforms. Qatar will have no       difficulty absorbing these helicopters into its armed forces.        The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not       alter the basic military balance in the region.        The prime contractors will be The Boeing Company, Mesa,       Arizona; Lockheed Martin Corporation, Orlando, Florida;       General Electric, Cincinnati, Ohio; Lockheed Martin Mission       Systems and Sensors, Owego, New York; Longbow Limited       Liability Corporation, Orlando, Florida; Thales Corporation,       Paris, France; and Raytheon Corporation. There are no known       offset agreements proposed in connection with this potential       sale.        Implementation of this proposed sale will require the       assignment of three (3) U.S. Government and five (5)       contractor representatives to Qatar to support delivery of       the Apache helicopters and provide support and equipment       familiarization. In addition, Qatar has expressed an interest       in expanding their planned Technical Assistance Fielding Team       for additional in-country pilot and maintenance training to       support this additional quantity of aircraft. To support the       requirement a team of twenty (20) personnel (up to three       military team members and 17 contractors) would be deployed       to Qatar for approximately three years.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.

The missile has an operational semi-active laser seeker that       can search for and lock-on to laser designated targets for       pilot training, but it does not have a warhead or propulsion       section and cannot be launched.        12. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain       knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements, the       information could be used to develop countermeasures that       might reduce weapon system effectiveness or be used in the       development of a system with similar or advanced       capabilities.        13. A determination has been made that Qatar can provide       substantially the same degree of protection for the sensitive       technology being released as the U.S. Government. This sale       is necessary in furtherance of the U.S. foreign policy and       national security objectives outlined in the Policy       Justification.        14. All defense articles and services listed in this       transmittal are authorized for release and export to the       Government of Qatar.                            ____________________     Mr. President, as a member and former chairman of  the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, it is my  privilege to recognize an Idaho small business that exemplifies  creativity, hard work, and dedication to improving their community. The  small business I am honoring today is a shining example of the many  Idaho businesses that are led by innovative individuals who are not  afraid to harness creativity to bring new and inventive ideas to  market. In honor of the U.S. Small Business Administration's National  Small Business Week, it is my pleasure to name PEET Shoe Dryer, Inc.,  of St. Maries, ID, as the Senate Small Business of the Day.   Founded in 1968 in the heart of one of the most beautiful locales in  the United States, PEET Shoe Dryer has been a supporter of American  outdoor enthusiasts for the last 50 years. Searching for a quicker way  to dry his boots after hiking, founder Gene Peet designed the original  shoe dryer for his own personal use. Soon, however, his friends and  family began requesting shoe dryers for themselves. Realizing the  demand for his new invention, Gene opened PEET Shoe Dryer.   Starting from humble beginnings, Gene and his son Blair began  building their shoe dryers in the kitchen of their family home. Gene's  first customers were loggers and hunters in the local St. Maries area,  who depend on having dry and comfortable shoes for their workday. Not  having enough money for advertising, Gene simply relied on the quality  of his product and satisfaction of his customers to help spread the  word for his new invention; and as word spread, Gene's enterprise  quickly grew into a thriving business.   Today, PEET Shoe Dryer, now run by Gene's son Blair Peet, continues  to succeed. They have improved the manufacturing of their boot and shoe  dryers, as well as expanded their offerings. Serving millions of  customers over the years, PEET Shoe Dryer has never compromised on its  commitment to quality and service.   Having grown from a small, word-of-mouth business to a successful  international exporter, PEET Shoe Dryer is an outstanding example of  the American dream. It is with great pleasure that I extend my  congratulations to the Peet family and all of the employees at PEET  Shoe Dryer, Incorporated, for being named the Senate Small Business of  the Day. I wish them well as they continue serving the people of Idaho  and look forward to watching their continued growth and  success.                            ____________________
