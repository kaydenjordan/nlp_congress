 Mr. President, years ago--talking like 15, maybe 18  years ago--I was speaking in a town in Oklahoma, and my daughter wanted  to go with me, which was great. So we took off. I had reserved a hotel.  And so we get there. We were going to stay overnight. And I was  speaking somewhere the next morning.   We arrive at the hotel late that evening. When I got there and  checked in, I knew initially we were in trouble. You have that feeling  when you pull up to the hotel and you think this may not work. Pull up,  check in, but there is no one at the desk. And then it just gets harder  as we get to our room. It is dark. Lots of light bulbs are out in the  pathway to get to our room to check in. And, actually, when I shut the  door and the two of us came in, I shut the door behind us, and the  crack underneath the door was so large I could physically see the patio  and the balcony and everything outside. And it was so loud because it  was right next to the highway. I thought, We are in trouble. This is  just not going work. So we ended up packing everything up and just  going to search and find another place and thinking there is no way we  will both be able to sleep.   Why do I tell you this silly story? Well, when we were traveling and  heading there, we anticipated one thing, and then when we got there and  got to the hotel, it ended up being different.   I have to tell you, this past weekend, when I read through the 99  pages of the debt ceiling bill, I would read through a section of it,  and I would get to the end of that section and be surprised at the  ``except for'' at the tail end of each section. It is not what I  expected when I read through the document, page after page.   I have to tell you, we are a nation that leads the world. We have the  world's largest economy. We are to be responsible in how we handle our  budget in the process. We are to get it right because we are the United  States of America.   And I have been concerned for quite a while with the trajectory of  our spending. And it challenges us as a nation to be able to change the  trajectory of our spending because we have to start working back to  balance. We can't get to balance in a year. It is going to take a long  time to get there, but we have to get started in this process.   And my frustration has been that sometimes we seem to start and then  we stop again and then we start and then we stop again.   In the several years that I have been here in the U.S. Congress, I  voted for some debt ceiling increases because they changed the  trajectory, and I voted against some because they were status quo or  they didn't. I had higher expectations for this one.   Now, initially, when it came out, it was, this is going to save $2  trillion. And then it slowly got downgraded to it is going to save $1.5  trillion. Then, when we read the fine print and everybody was talking  about how much it was going to save, I got to the fine print and found  out, actually, it increases spending 3.3 percent next year, and the  year after that it increases spending 1 percent again.   It actually doesn't decrease spending at all. It increases spending,  both this year and next year. But then it has the promise of the next 8  years after that--it will only grow 1 percent a year after that every  single year, except that is not an agreement this Congress can make.  This Congress can only vote on things for this particular session of  Congress. We can't commit the next Congress to actions of this  Congress. Each Congress stands on its own. And everyone knows that.   It sounds good to say it is going to save these trillions of dollars  in the next 8 years, except each Congress will actually vote on a  budget for the next 8 years, and there is no commitment from future  Congresses by this one to do that.   In fact, I have been here long enough to be able to see agreements  being made for what a future Congress will do that didn't actually  happen.   And so the $1.5 trillion in savings is only a decrease of the  increase of how much we were ``planning to spend but actually hadn't  budgeted'' because as many people may know, there is not a budget set  for the next year of what we were going to spend. So CBO just assumed  we were going to increase at least by inflation and any amount less  than inflation is suddenly savings when there was no budget that was  actually set.   So my first big surprise was, it actually doesn't reduce spending; it  actually increases spending.   The next big surprise came when I started looking at how even some of  the ``savings'' are actually managed. There is a supplemental piece  that is in this or a piece that is set aside where it takes what they  call rescissions--I am not going to get into budget gobbledygook that  is tough for us all to be able to process. But there is about $22  billion that is taken out of items that were COVID spending that are  not going to be spent and pulls it over into the Department of Commerce  and leaves it there in the Department of Commerce amount and says we  will decide later how to spend it.   Now, I ask the obvious question: Isn't this supposed to go to deficit  reduction?   And the answer came back: Well, a few billion went to deficit  reduction, but $22 billion actually went over into the Department of  Commerce's budget and is being parked there, and they will have other  opportunities to be able to spend those dollars in the future.   That is not really a savings on the rescission. There is permitting  reform in this, which I am grateful for. Quite frankly, there is  bipartisan support for permitting reform in many areas because we can't  get lithium and cobalt. We can't move solar and wind power because of  permitting, just like we can't move natural gas and hydrogen and  CO2 because of permitting issues. We have to do major  reforms in those areas to be able to make sure we can actually produce  more energy for the future of our country.   So when I saw the permitting issues, then I thought, good, we need to  get started on some of these permitting issues--except when I read  through it, there seems to be a lot of exceptions to it.  [[Page S1872]]    For instance, there is a 2-year commitment to say, if you are doing  the more strict environmental impact statement, you have to get it done  in 2 years--well, unless the administration declares it complex, and  then they have a lot more time; in fact, an infinite amount of time.   It limits you to 150 pages for an environmental impact statement,  which is good; that actually brings the paper down--unless the  administration declares it complex, and then it is a whole lot more. It  limits the number of pages even, unless it is the appendix. If the  administration declares actually these can go in the appendix, then  there is actually no cap, no limit for that.   It also says that, in this time period piece, that if you get to 2  years from the environmental impact statement and if they don't achieve  that--I asked a logical question: If an administration and an Agency  doesn't get it done in 2 years, what happens?   The answer is: Well, you have to sue the Federal Government and that  Agency to make them do it. And then it has to go through the court  system, which, as this body knows, will take 2 or 3 years. If the court  finds in favor, then the court can then declare the Agency has another  90 days to be able to get it resolved--unless it is considered complex,  and then they have unlimited time.   So the permitting piece, as I read through it, I thought, why are  there all these exceptions that are out there that give it an out for  every single portion of it?   There is a section of the bill that talks about what is called  administrative pay-go. That is a rule that has existed in some  administrations before where they will say that if you are going to add  a cost to America through an administrative action, you have to look  somewhere else to decrease the cost, because by the Constitution, only  this Congress can actually increase spending; that is not something the  administration has the constitutional authority to do. That is a  reasonable rule.   It puts in this administrative pay-go to say, if spending is going to  increase based on a regulation, it has to decrease somewhere else. That  sounds great--until I get to the very end of it, and it literally says:  unless the Director of the Office of Management and Budget considers  the additional spending necessary. No restrictions.   If it is considered necessary, then they have an unlimited amount  that they can do. Even that restriction actually goes away on January  1, 20 days before President Biden's term ends, so it is not even all  the way through the last 3 weeks. Even that restriction goes away. And  I can't figure out why, suddenly, it gives 3 weeks of home base without  a restriction like that. And why, if we are going to put a restriction  in there, why end it in 2 years anyway? If it is a good idea, it should  be a good idea for every President, not just for this one. Why would  there be, suddenly, an out clause in it?   There is a 1-percent sequester that is across the board if  appropriations are not done.   Now, I have to tell you, I worked with Senator Maggie Hassan on the  other side of the aisle to resolve a way to end government shutdowns  and actually do appropriations. We should do all 12 appropriation  bills. The Senator who is chairwoman of Appropriations is on the floor  right now. She and I have had these conversations. She has committed to  doing all 12 appropriations bills. So am I. We can bring back regular  order and actually go through the process.   We don't all agree on everything here in the body. Welcome to  America, where 320 million Americans don't agree on everything. OK,  well, let's talk it all out. Let's have the debate. Let's have the vote  and go from there. We haven't had that ability in years.   Senator Maggie Hassan and I have a bill dealing with ending  government shutdowns and pushing us towards doing the 12 appropriations  bills. That is not a bipartisan bill. Frankly, it is a nonpartisan  bill. I don't find anyone here who doesn't actually want to get us back  to regular order. So we are trying to find a logical way to be able to  do it.   But the way this bill sets up the sequestration to put this towards  those 12 appropriation bills, it says that if appropriation bills are  not done by April 1 next year, there is a 1-percent, across-the-board  cut that will happen in the current year spending in the last 5 months  of the year.   That is a pretty big spending. Except it really only hits defense  because the way it is set up is nondefense will actually go up and  defense will actually be cut by 1 percent from last year's amount.   What in the world? Why would it be structured that way?   No. 1, why would we set up a sequestration piece at all as an  incentive? No. 2, why would it be designed in a shape where it hits  defense and not nondefense in the way it is actually set up? And, No.  3, when there were other options, like Senator Hassan and I, through  our proposal to deal with ending government shutdowns and to get to  actual appropriations, why wouldn't we do something like that that is  nonpartisan, that is simple and straightforward to be able to do?   The student loan suspension. There has been much publicity on the  right about, well, this ends the student loan suspensions, except it  ends it on July 30, when President Biden already says he is ending it  on August 30. In fact, CBO looked at it and said this doesn't save any  money at all because it was already going away. It doesn't really  change anything. It literally moves it forward a month but doesn't  change a thing.   Then there is a work requirement process. I have to tell you: I am a  big believer in work requirements. Not everybody here in this body is  on that. I think work is dignity. I think work encourages families and  brings dignity to a family and an individual unlike anything else that  a family can bring. I think it is great for kids to grow up in a  community where the adults around them work and set that example, and  they build on that. There is just a unique dignity in work.   Quite frankly, some of that just comes from what I have seen, and  some of that comes from my faith, because when I look at even  scripture, there was work in the Garden before the fall. Work is not a  consequence of the fall. Work is a gift from God that gives us purpose  and meaning and helps us set the next example. Anything we can do as a  culture to encourage a culture of work, I think, is beneficial to  people in families.   I understand full well there are those who are disabled, those that  have kids. There are situations where it can't be done. I completely  respect that. But in this particular bill, the incentives for work  requirements has a little caveat stuck in the back of it that says all  of this applies to these States and they can't take all these waivers  where they pull away work requirements--they can't do those things  unless Secretary Becerra--the Secretary of HHS--declares that that  State is doing good work to try anyway. There are no restrictions on  it. It just says solely that if Secretary Becerra decides that, it gets  waived.    So as I look at the bill, I see a lot of good intentions in the bill,  but I see a whole lot of exceptions. And I see a whole lot of ability  for the administration to waive that, waive that, waive that, waive  that. That undercuts the purpose of the bill.   Quite frankly, as a Congress, I wish that we could sit down across  the aisle and we could have dialogue to say: What is Congress's  responsibility? What are the policies that are wise policies? And not  hand authority to the White House--Republican or Democratic--and say:  Which is good policy that we need to put in place and do those things?  One day, we will get back to that, but that day wasn't today. And that  is frustrating for me.   I am going to oppose this bill today, but I want us to be able to  keep working because we still have work to do, as one side knows as  well. I know Congress is focused on this today, rightfully so. The  American people expect us to get this resolved.                             Tulsa Race Massacre    Mr. President, can I just tell you a little heartbeat issue for me?  It is June 1. That may not mean a lot of things to a lot of people, but  for those of us from Oklahoma, today is the 102nd anniversary of the  worst race massacre in American history.   It happened in Tulsa, OK, May 31, overnight, to June 1. And 102 years  ago today, Greenwood was a smoking heap of rubble after an all-night  violence  [[Page S1873]]  and massacre on hundreds of Black Americans in North Tulsa.   It is a stain on our Nation. It is a stain on our State.   And 102 years later, I hope we still pause and remember as a State  and we continue to learn the lessons and continue to be able to work  towards being a more perfect union.   Today, the Greenwood Rising museum is open. Folks are coming in and  out, talking about what happened 102 years ago. Folks at the John Hope  Franklin Center for Reconciliation are engaging in conversation. There  are community groups all over North Tulsa, meeting with people just to  be able to talk and to say: What have we learned 102 years later? How  can we still be better as a Nation still?   We learned a lot. We have grown a lot. But it is unfinished business  for us.   So on June 1, I remind us as a body, there was a massacre 102 years  ago today. We shouldn't ignore this moment to remember how we take  tragedy to triumph.   I yield the floor.
