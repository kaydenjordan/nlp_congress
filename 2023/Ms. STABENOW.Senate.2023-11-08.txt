 Madam President, first, I will speak more tomorrow  about Brandy McMillion, whom we just forwarded to a final confirmation  vote tomorrow. She is an extraordinary nominee for the district court  in Michigan, and I so appreciate the bipartisan support today.                                 S.J. Res. 38    At this moment, Madam President, I rise in opposition to S.J. Res.  38.   The result of passing this resolution is actually the opposite of  what the sponsor is going to say. It reminds me a lot of last week when  we were debating school meals and when what was argued was exactly the  opposite of what it would do. This is one of those similar kinds of  situations. So let me just explain this.   Last Congress, we worked hard to pass the Infrastructure Investment  and Jobs Act despite the opposition from the senior Senator from  Florida, who is authoring this resolution, by the way. From fixing our  roads and bridges and airports and railways to expanding high-speed  internet and creating jobs, this was a great bill with a great  bipartisan effort. We are now seeing the profound effects of this  historic law in every corner of the country.   The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act included my Make It in  America Act, which created, for the first time, a Made in America  Office. This office is charged with reviewing waivers that have been  around for a long time, toughening them up, requiring more  transparency, in that any waiver be put on a website for businesses and  workers and taxpayers to be able to see, and it ensured complying with  other ``Buy America'' laws.   So, as we are going forward on electric vehicles and electric vehicle  charging, we have the administration now looking at waivers. We have a  longstanding waiver called the Manufactured Products General Waiver.  This  [[Page S5417]]  blanket waiver has been in effect since 1983, and it has allowed  foreign manufactured products to be used by the Federal Highway  Administration.   Our administration, the Biden administration, doesn't want to see  that continue. So it put in place a short-term waiver. It took EV  chargers out of that and put in place a short-term waiver until next  July and said: We will give you a little bit of time, but then you are  going to have to have American companies that are making EV chargers if  we are going to buy them with Federal taxpayer dollars.   So it was very significant in expanding ``Buy America'' policies.  Now, you will somehow hear the opposite. This is expanding ``Buy  America'' policies by basically saying: Instead of a permanent waiver,  we will give you until July 1, 2024, to ensure that new chargers can  meet ``Buy America'' requirements, and we can move forward with  American-made products. So the key is temporary. This is temporary.   Therefore, this resolution would actually weaken ``Buy America''  requirements. The resolution would result in EV chargers not needing to  meet any U.S. manufacturing or any ``Buy America'' content requirements  far in the future. This would significantly set back American jobs and  American manufacturing. If you want American taxpayer dollars to be  required to purchase American-made products, including EV chargers, you  need to vote no on this resolution, and I urge my colleagues to do  that.   I am so pleased to be here with another wonderful champion on this  issue, Senator Tammy Baldwin from Wisconsin, who has really championed  this effort in a very, very effective way.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for up to 1  minute.    Madam President, I just want to make clear, as the  person who authored the Make It in America Act in the infrastructure  bill--which my colleague from Florida did not support--that we have a  Made in America Office now, and I am so appreciative of what the Biden  administration is doing to make sure that we are not giving waivers  unless absolutely necessary.   We had a general manufacturing waiver for years--years and years and  years. What they have done is taken the EV chargers out of that and  said: OK, we will give you until July of next year. We will phase out  any kind of a waiver because we want these American made. We want these  American made.   And so the effect of voting for this resolution is to forever have EV  chargers as part of the waiver, where they never have to be American  made. They can always be Chinese made.   We want them American made, and I urge a ``no'' vote on this  resolution.   The joint resolution was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading  and was read a third time.                             Vote on S.J. Res. 38
