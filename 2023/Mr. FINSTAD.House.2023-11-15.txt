 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember U.S. Army Sergeant  Cade Wolfe of Mankato, Minnesota, who was tragically lost in a  helicopter crash in the eastern Mediterranean Sea during a routine air  refueling mission last Friday.   Cade knew early on that he wanted to serve his country. He was raised  in a proud, patriotic family with a mom and dad who served in the Army  and a brother who would also go on to serve. For Cade, serving in  uniform wasn't just a calling. It was a family tradition.   After he graduated from Mankato East High School, Cade enlisted in  the Army as a helicopter repairman before going on to serve in Army  Special Operations Forces, providing helicopter support.   Cade died doing what he loved, serving the country that he loved with  fellow soldiers that he loved. He was truly one of southern Minnesota's  bravest heroes.   Last Friday's accident is a sobering reminder to all of us that our  servicemen and -women put their lives on the line every day to keep us  safe.   While Cade's remains have yet to be recovered, I am continuing to  pray for his wife, Danielle, his parents, his brother, and all those  across Minnesota's First District who knew and loved Sergeant Wolfe.   Mr. Speaker, his sacrifice will never be forgotten.                            ____________________
