 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3285, the  ``21st Century President Act''--an insightful, common-sense measure, of  which I am an original cosponsor.   In considering this bill, I think back to 1970 when Representative  Shirley Chisolm, speaking on the need to ratify the Equal Rights  Amendment, asked: ``Why is it acceptable for women to be secretaries,  librarians, and teachers, but totally unacceptable for them to be  managers, administrators, doctors, lawyers, and Members of Congress?''  At that time, it was almost unthinkable that a woman could be elected  President of the United States.   Although we have yet to ratify the ERA, our country has made great  strides in the struggle for gender equality since then--from the  groundbreaking presidential primary campaign of Representative Chisolm  in 1972; to the first-of-its-kind vice presidential nomination of  Geraldine Ferraro; to the 18 million cracks in the glass ceiling made  by Hillary Clinton; and the historic election of President Joe Biden  and Vice President Kamala Harris, which began with a field that  included six women and one member of the LGBTQ community.   Given the diversity of candidates for the presidency in recent years  and the more inclusive times in which we live, our laws should evolve  to reflect this societal progress.   That is why H.R. 3285 amends section 879 of title 18 to do away with  the assumption that the president is male and his spouse female by  removing gendered terms such as ``wife'' or ``widow.''   I hope we can all agree that ``immediate family'' means much more  today than the 1982 law provides and that the spouse of our President  should be protected regardless of gender.   Indeed, we have come very far in the pursuit of gender equality since  this statute was enacted. Yet H.R. 3285 makes clear there is still much  work to be done.   As we approach the 50th anniversary of the enactment of Title IX,  women's rights are once again under threat and the push for genuine  gender equality-has been renewed.   Each of us must remain vigilant and ensure that equality of rights  under the law are neither denied nor abridged by the United States or  by any state on account of gender in any manner.   I thank the gentleman from Wisconsin, Representative Mark Pocan, for  his efforts to bring us into the 21st century and for recognizing the  importance of ensuring the safety and security of those who may come  from the wide, vast diversity of America to serve as President.   I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this bill and hope we  can pass it by voice vote as we did in the 116th Congress.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6538, the  ``Active Shooter Alert Act of 2022.''   In recent weeks, months, and years, we have mourned the loss of life  resulting from an ever-increasing number of active shooter incidents  where perpetrators committed mass shootings in multiple locations.   Communities in every corner of this country have been subjected to  the fear and uncertainty created by active shooters in their midst.   Last year, there were 61 active shooter incidents in the United  States. Approximately 27 of those incidents involved an active shooter  moving from one location to another.   For instance, 8 people were killed roughly 30 miles apart at three  spas in the metro Atlanta area last year. The gunman was later  apprehended some 150 miles south of Atlanta.   And we are all still reeling from the gruesome murder of 19 fourth  graders and two teachers in Uvalde, Texas that began when the  perpetrator shot his grandmother in the home they shared.   He then drove away, crashing his vehicle outside Robb Elementary. He  encountered several people before entering the school and committing  unspeakable acts on those helpless children and teachers.   While the actions of these individuals and other active shooters are  unacceptable and require Congress to enact measures to put an end to  such evil acts, we must also be prepared if these situations occur, and  do all we can to help law enforcement save more lives.   Law enforcement's response to an active shooter is a dynamic  situation--oftentimes chaotic--that involves many variables, requires  swift, consequential decision-making, and places great strain on law  enforcement command staff and their officers on the ground.   Their goal is to save the lives of victims and prevent others from  unknowingly entering the area or walking into the line of fire--at all  times focusing on containing, neutralizing, and apprehending the  shooter.   Centers of higher learning and primary education, businesses, local  jurisdictions, and law enforcement agencies have already implemented  some systems to alert students, employees, patrons, and community  members of the presence of an active shooter, and to help manage the  response, and provide updates about the ongoing crisis via text message  and/or social media.   Many of these systems face low enrollment and messaging delays that  sometimes contribute to confusion around the incident. In the case of  social media--insufficient account visibility means fewer people are  made aware of an existing threat to their safety.   Recently here in Washington, D.C. a sniper-style attacker set a rifle  on a tripod and fired randomly at passersby walking below his window.   D.C. Metro Police used their Twitter account to warn people to avoid  the area and shelter in place. But the tweets, or posts, received  minimal attention during the actual attack.   An Active Shooter Alert might have saved the life of the woman who  unknowingly walked directly into the line of fire of the Buffalo  shooter in the Tops parking lot.   Law enforcement needs a reliable method of communication to rapidly  notify as many people as possible within the vicinity of an ongoing  active shooter incident; provide instructions to avoid the area or  shelter in place; and announce when the area has been restored to  safety.   H.R. 6538, the Active Shooter Alert Act of 2022, would authorize the  Department of Justice to coordinate the creation of an Active Shooter  Alert Network, enabling law enforcement to send active shooter alerts  within their communities using the same system that issues AMBER  Alerts, severe storm and extreme weather events warnings, and other  emergency situations.   That system--the Integrated Public Alert and Warning System can send  alerts to mobile devices in locally targeted areas down to 1/10th of a  mile.   This legislation would ensure that an advisory panel--comprised of  law enforcement officers, public safety experts, and emergency response  officials experienced in responding to active shooter situations--has  input in the development of best practices for issuing alerts  effectively.   DOJ by way of an appointed Active Shooter Alert Coordinator would be  responsible for establishing the advisory panel; establishing and  promoting adoption of the best practices; and coordinating with FEMA,  the Department of Transportation, and the FCC on using the Integrated  Public Alert and Warning System to issue alerts for the network and to  provide a report to Congress on the effectiveness of the network.   Although this system would be available to law enforcement agencies  to use on a voluntary basis, I expect that many agencies would elect to  participate based on the numerous endorsements previously mentioned by  the Chairman.   I thank ACAL Subcommittee Chairman Cicilline for his leadership on  this lifesaving, bipartisan legislation that I am proud to cosponsor  along with Representatives Deutch, Spartz, Upton, Thompson, Meijer, and  Mace.   I ask my colleagues to support this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I rise to assert the sovereignty of the  United States of America, to applaud the bipartisan commitment to the  Ukrainians who are fighting for democracy, and to acknowledge Alex  Drueke and Andy Huynh, who are fighting as volunteers in the Ukrainian  Army and have now been captured by the enemy.   The enemy wants to call them a name that I refuse to say on the floor  of the House. They are, in fact, volunteers, and they should be subject  to the international obligations that Russia must adhere to and must  look at the conventions that may be relevant. Their lives must be  protected. They are soldiers who desired to fight for democracy.   I am proud of them, as I am of the Americans who are held around the  world falsely, in particular Paul Whelan and Brittney Griner, who are  held as hostages in Russia. They are wrongly held, and I ask that we  pursue this as Americans and the American Government to help release  Brittney Griner, release Paul Whelan, stop the false judicial system  and legal system of Russia, and bring our Americans home.   We should not leave Alex Drueke and Andy Huynh on the battlefield. We  need to protect them as a sovereign nation.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege to rise as the  anchor of the CBC Special Order addressing Caribbean American Heritage  Month and to welcome my colleagues to the floor to be able to engage in  a very important and provocative discussion.   Let me just say that last weekend, in fact, yesterday, was the  national holiday, the Juneteenth independence day. All over America  this commemoration brought about knowledge, understanding, jubilation,  and honor. So we are delighted to be on the floor today to, in fact,  provide an opportunity to expand and to talk about the heritage of so  many in this Nation.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include any extraneous material on the subject of this Special Order.    It is my privilege now to, first of all, thank the  Honorable Joyce Beatty, who is the chairwoman of the Congressional  Black Caucus, for her continued efforts to ensure that the American  people know our message and our power, know the work that we are doing,  know the success that we are having, and also give us an opportunity to  articulate the historical record of African Americans and those who  have heritages from elsewhere.   I also take a moment to congratulate her for receiving the Juneteenth  honors in Washington, D.C. last Thursday from the Juneteenth  Foundation. It was a privilege not only to be with her and to  acknowledge many others who received those honors but to be there on  such a special night. She was well-deserving.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs. Beatty), who  is the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairwoman Beatty for laying  the framework of how enriched the Congressional Black Caucus is with  the vast diversity of Members who have these enormous connections and  heritage and to honor the leader of this legislation making June  Caribbean American Heritage Month and to be astute enough to continue  her work as the chair of the State, Foreign Operations, and Related  Programs Subcommittee on Appropriations. She has been a lifeline to the  Caribbean and astute on many issues from immigration to disasters to  the issues of dealing with democracy and humanity.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her leadership. Might I add  that she also has a strong heritage in Texas and was a very powerful  contributor to our celebration of Juneteenth in Texas. Along with her  relatives she was at the Ashton Villa site where General Granger came  to announce the freedom of the slaves. She did that during Juneteenth  in Texas. We were glad to have her.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairwoman for capturing so  well the unfinished business as it relates to the Caribbean and  overall, and I thank her for being the leader of the resolution to  establish Caribbean American Heritage Month that we now are able to  commemorate year after year.    It is appropriate that the gentlewoman is the chair of the State,  Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Subcommittee because she can  have a very large voice on the changing of our treatment of the  Caribbean, along with the leadership of our chair of the CBC and CBC  members. I thank the gentlewoman so much for that.   Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege, of course, to now yield to the  gentlewoman who hails from Brooklyn that has such a sizable  representation of Caribbean Americans. She is a senior member and vice  chair of the Energy and Commerce Committee and the founder of and  collaborator with the Caribbean-American Caucus here in the United  States Congress, and she has worked on a number of immigration issues  that really impact our brothers and sisters in the Caribbean.   I must say that, just a few years ago, I think we were shuttling  during the Christmas holiday--it seems like it was near the Christmas  holiday--from the Hill to the World Bank, trying to work on redoing the  treatment that they were giving to Jamaica. I thank the gentlewoman for  that leadership. I was pleased to join her in that effort, and we were  successful.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Clarke),  and I better say Brooklyn, New York.    I thank the gentlewoman from Brooklyn, New York.  What a powerful display of the richness of the Caribbean, the family  connections, her pride for this wonderful opportunity to speak about  the people in the Caribbean. I am very grateful to you for relating  both your familial connections but your predecessor.   So we all have stakeholders in Shirley Chisholm. I guess my pride is  as a very young person having introduced her at a church program and  then as a lawyer at a lawyer's program, those moments were very  special; working in her district for, you might remember her, Carol  Bellamy, and getting to know and be around her during that time.   I am delighted to make mention at this point of Representative Jamaal  Bowman, who will be presenting his statement into the Record, a very  strong, new Member who has exhibited such leadership. He will be one of  those that will submit statements into the Record along with  Representative Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick. She will likewise present  her statement into the Record.   I will proceed now to make my concluding remarks as I celebrate  Caribbean American Heritage Month. I thank Congresswoman Barbara Lee  for H. Con. Res. 71. I think it was introduced at that time in 2006,  and she has done that every single year. She has made the Congressional  Black Caucus better for being worldly enough to acknowledge the  connection.   I will build on what you have said, Congresswoman Lee. As a member of  the Homeland Security Committee, we considered the Caribbean, just a  few years back, after 9/11 as the third border of the United States,  and it had key importance for the role it played in the security of the  United States.   We have not continued that. And I believe as we look to reenhancing  our communications and collaboration with the Caribbean, it is to  recognize the important role that they are in securing America and  securing the Caribbean and the work that they have done with our  military, but also our drug enforcement, in a way that protects them  and protects the United States.   Millions have emigrated from the Caribbean to the United States since  our Nation's founding. Congress should continue to recognize the  important contributions of Caribbean Americans to our Nation's history  and their role in our Nation's future. Those were the words from that  legislation and from Barbara Lee as this bill was introduced.   Today, we celebrate the vibrancy and diversity of the Caribbean- American communities as well as the strong ties reinforced between the  United States and our Caribbean neighbors.   We certainly recognize Cuba and know that there are immigration  policies that apply to Cuba.   I think at this point, I want to make that sure that all of us in the  Congressional Black Caucus continue to work on the issues dealing with  Haiti, in particular: The natural disasters, the issues of democracy,  the fact that they are a strong and resilient people, that they have  many, many needs, but we also want fairness.   As the former ranking member on the Subcommittee on Immigration,  Citizenship, and Border Safety, working with the Caribbean Caucus, we  are looking forward to the administration working on humanitarian  parole on some of the persons here of Haitian decent, so there is a  balance and a fairness of their immigration status with others.   These are things that we, in the Congressional Black Caucus, are  looking to work on as we cite the very strong ties that we have.   Shirley Chisholm certainly represents sort of an iconic figure. Most  persons see her from Brooklyn. I remember her saying as she was  appointed to the Committee on Agriculture, a tree does grow in  Brooklyn.   She was not going to let herself be denied the status of importance,  Mr. Speaker, when this urban member was appointed to the Committee on  Agriculture as a point of, you better sit here. She made much out of  that and was a great leader on food stamps and other issues dealing  with the urban community.   We might not know that W.E.B. Du Bois, a prominent African American,  the first to earn a Ph.D. from Harvard. And, of course, Vice President  Kamala Harris, the First African American of Jamaican heritage to serve  as Vice President of the United States. Supreme Court Justice Sonia  Sotomayor, a Latina of Puerto Rican heritage and the first to serve in  the United States Supreme Court.   We have noted Alexander Hamilton, the first Secretary of the  Treasury. James Weldon Johnson, the writer of Lift Every Voice and  Sing, and a key figure of the Harlem renaissance. I can assure you that  he was very prominent. This song was very prominent during the  Juneteenth celebrations.   Gloria Estefan, one of the best-selling female artists of all time  from Cuba with the hit songs ``Conga'' and ``Rhythm is Gonna Get You.''   Then a name that we might not be familiar with: Bad Bunny, Spotify's  most streamed artist and album globally of 2020, and the first time a  non-English language music artist topped the year-end list.   The history, however, of the Caribbean is many. It is filled with  natural resources, natural beauty. It is, along with CARICOM, a perfect  partner to the United States.   In addition, I too want to applaud President Joe Biden and Vice  President Kamala Harris at the Summit of the Americas. We understand,  as we were participating as Members of Congress with Speaker Pelosi,  that there was an outstanding meeting that went on with CARICOM to re- cement the relationship between the Caribbean and the United States.   That is important because, as I said, natural resources, natural  beauty, a third border against terrorists and against other aspects of  danger to the United States, but a partner so that the Caribbean is  secure as well as the United States. A bastion of democracy.   That is why we must continue to fight for Haiti as it restores  itself, rebuilds itself. We met with the Haitian president there to try  to find a pathway for that country to restore itself. As indicated, we  can be on the front line working with our Members of Congress, both  Democratic and Republican.    I believe that there are a number of codels that have recently gone  to the Caribbean, including one led by the chairwoman of the Committee  on Financial Services, Maxine Waters, who, in fact, is a member and co- chair of the Caribbean caucus.   But as we study the history, let us realize there is much more  synergism than one might imagine, because as we celebrated Juneteenth,  it is important for America to remember that slaves were also in the  Caribbean.   It was a tragic experience. Over 40 percent of all Africans who were  enslaved were sent to the Caribbean islands; estimated at 5 million  enslaved Africans beginning as early as the 16th century.   Within the Caribbean, the death rates of enslaved populations were  extremely high. It was very hot, and there were a lot of insects, if I  might say, that took a toll on many, but they kept on surviving. Untold  numbers, however, suffered from inhumane working conditions.   However, the rise of abolitionist movements, coupled with anti- slavery sentiment, and several military and political crises, sowed the  seeds for prohibition against slavery in the Caribbean countries.   In fact, I believe Haiti was one of the first free countries,  securing independence from France at a very, very early stage.  [[Page H5730]]    We honor Caribbean heroes who rebelled against slavery which led to  official emancipation in anglophone countries in 1823. Major revolts  shocked the world: The Tacky's Rebellion in the 1760s in Jamaica; the  Haitian Revolution; Fedon's Revolution in the 1790s in Grenada; the  Barbados slave revolt in 1860; and the slave revolt in Jamaica led by  Sam Sharpe.   What a unique difference and experience, but yet there was slavery.  Emancipation was achieved because of the movements and the legal  efforts within respective Caribbean countries.   Those revolts inspired the abolitionists in the United States. The  parallel histories of Caribbean countries and the United States are  rooted in oppression and the ongoing struggle for lasting true  liberation, justice, equality, and freedom.   What is good about this discussion is to reflect on the fact that  those enslaved Africans that were in the Caribbean, now, their  descendants are the heads of state of all the Caribbean countries and  our leaders in the CARICOM.   This is an important partnership for the United States, and it is one  that we must utilize and teach our children. We embrace them as our  ancestors who suffered in hopes that future generations would not;  supporting their children so that a time would come when freedom would  reign.   We now have the responsibility as we deal with the Caribbean to  reflect on the Caribbean immigrants who have come here to the United  States. It has already been noted how they have achieved and succeeded.   We mentioned members of our caucus who are Members of the United  States Congress who have that heritage. Since 1820, people of the  Caribbean descent have immigrated to the United States.   We want to make sure that the process is fair. We want to make sure  that these individuals are not deported randomly.   As I said, we hope to have a response to the Haitians as to the  Cubans, those who come from Cuba and have the wet foot, dry foot effort  that are not Haitians. We see them being deported from the Mexican-U.S.  border. That is not fair.   We have had a relationship with Haiti for centuries. Haiti fought  alongside of Americans in the Revolutionary War. They came to be at our  side.   Since 2000, the population increased 26 percent to 3.7 million  Caribbean-Americans in 2010 and grew another 18 percent to 4.4 million  in 2017. Today, there are 13.4 million Americans of that heritage;  always hardworking, ready to serve, ready to serve in the United States  military, and often found at the front line of aid here in this  country.   The fight reached its apex with the Haitian Revolution in 1804. As I  indicated, the fight did not end with Britain's Slave Trade Act of 1807  that sought abolish the British slave trade.   The point of my comments is to make sure everyone knew that they were  always fighting for justice, they were fighting for equality, and their  history is worth studying.   I do want to draw to our attention the connection of H.R. 40, the  commission to study slavery and develop reparation proposals.  Juneteenth: Healing, restorative, repair as well. Know the story.   I can tell you, across America, I heard one colleague, if I might,  from Chicago who said there were so many moments of celebration.   Our majority leader indicated in his own home State, there was one  event, Mr. Speaker, that had 6,000 people celebrating Juneteenth. It  warms my heart. It was a decade-long fight, and here we are today,  really in the eye-opening experience of Juneteenth.   I had the privilege of speaking at the Ashton Villa, the place where  General Granger came to make that announcement of the No. 3 order. And  to have, as well, the statue of Al Edwards, a State representative who  was the first probably in the Nation to drive a State holiday in the  State of Texas. He achieved that more than 20 years ago.   Being trained up under that kind of leadership, it was instilled in  me that we should have a national holiday, a national Independence Day  on the Juneteenth basis. I am so excited about the overwhelming  support, unanimous in the Senate, 415 votes in the House, if anyone can  imagine.   So, as we talk about these issues, I want the world to see and the  Nation to see that over this weekend, the Juneteenth events all over  the Nation reflected people coming together from many different  backgrounds.   There was a degree of excitement. There were children there, families  there, and our celebrations were focused around peace and unity, and  they were focused around prayer.    That is what we did in Houston, Texas, at the historic--historic-- Antioch Baptist Church founded in 1866 by Jack Yates. Can you imagine,  only 1 year after the Emancipation Proclamation that was issued in  1865, after 2\1/2\ years when the South did not pay any attention to  Abe Lincoln's order, President Lincoln's order, that he had to dispatch  this general, a West Point grad, a hero on the battlefield, to announce  in Texas--I can remember the words. It seems like they are loud in my  ears.   To the people of Texas, I now declare that the slaves are free, and  they are free to be able to achieve property, they are no longer  property, and they are citizens of the United States.   Slavery had not been abolished, but he indicated that the slaves were  free and that they could maintain themselves as employer and employee.  I would venture to say that even with that pronouncement, most of them,  uneducated, had ever heard the words employer and employee. It was  master and slave.   The one thing they knew, they were not staying. They were leaving and  going up the trail, the Emancipation Trail, into the areas of La Marque  in Texas and in Houston, a place called Freedmen's Town and  Independence Heights.   They were going under the leadership of Jack Yates, when they got to  Houston, who bought in 1872 the first park ever bought in Texas. It was  bought by freed slaves, and it was a place where the emancipation  Juneteenth celebrations would go for decades and decades and decades.   That history should allow us to pass with ease the commission H.R. 40  that has been percolating now since 1989 and the commission to study  slavery and develop reparation proposals. It was modeled after the  Civil Liberties Act that was passed in 1988 and signed by Ronald  Reagan.   We championed that for the Japanese Americans. It was based on the  internment that had happened wrongly of Japanese-Americans, patriots  who love the country, who were rounded up, belongings left, take what  you can take, properties left to their own devices, if you will, and  held in an internment camp.                                time  2100    To this day, the Japanese-American association is a strong advocate  for H.R. 40 because of the friendship and collaboration and the work we  did, in particular the late John Conyers, who worked with them and then  introduced H.R. 40, the Commission to Study and Develop Reparation  Proposals for African Americans Act.   I would imagine most people would wonder where that name came from.  It came from General Sherman, who wanted to give 40 acres and a mule to  the freed slaves. Unfortunately, this is what happens. Elections count,  and the next President after the assassination of President Abraham  Lincoln did not hold to that commitment.   With that in mind, just know that we have built this Nation on that  labor; built this Nation on making cotton king; providing resources to  the enriched South, the landed South; creating the Wall Street banks,  if you will; and providing an economic engine that propelled this small  country into a growing international force.   Mr. Speaker, I think that H.R. 40 is a perfect complement because one  of the things it does is it gets a study just to look at the landscape  of how slavery impacted this Nation and how it impacted the people, how  it impacted New England, the Midwest, California, the South, the Deep  South, and the southeastern region where African Americans began to  move all across this Nation.   Interestingly enough, California, of course, has already implemented  this bill, H.R. 40, and a task force is now working to do enormous  work. I refer everyone to a Harvard University medical study that  indicated that if reparations had been given preceding COVID-  [[Page H5731]]  19, that horrible pandemic would not have so lopsidedly impacted the  African-American community.   Let me be very clear that this idea of reparations is a sense of  looking systemically at what would be the solutions. The commission is  to be able to hear from people across America and to be able to  recommend and to engage with people from all backgrounds, not just one  background, not just African Americans. I am excited about that  dialogue. I think it will be a powerful dialogue.   As we celebrated Juneteenth, as we had this memorial service at the  Antioch Baptist Church, what an emotional time we had with song and  words and dance and prayer. People left there saying that they were  more inspired than they have ever been before to bring us together. It  was a diverse audience of people who came even from out of town to do  something that was part of my vision that on Juneteenth, and that was  happy Father's Day, we would take a moment to honor slaves who were  born, who lived and died as a slave and never knew freedom, to give  them the honor that they never got.   As I reflect on how this Nation was built by immigrants and how it  was built by the ancestors of African Americans today, I do want to  continue to emphasize the Members of Congress who have this wonderful  heritage and to honor the late Shirley Chisholm, who both became the  first African-American woman in the United States Congress and as well  became the first African-American person to run for President.   As I do so, let me cite my relatives, Sybil Gooden, Willie Gooden,  they excelled as leaders coming from the Caribbean; the Lockets; the  Rashfords; and, of course, my grandparents, Olive Clarke Jackson and  Albert Jackson, who worked on the Panama Canal. It was so powerful to  go to the Panama Canal and see his name written there. It was an  emotional experience. Eric Jackson, Allen Jackson, Charles Jackson all  served in World War II; Ezra Jackson, my father; and his older brothers  who served in World War II. Elaine Oliver and Ollie Oliver, both of  those individuals came and made great strides. Their son served in the  United States Air Force. An outstanding daughter, Elaine Oliver, worked  for me. Of course, Eric Holder, Colin Powell, Patrick Gaspard, Harry  Belafonte, many others, our outstanding communications director.   Tonight, we have had a storytelling night of truth. We have had a  great celebration of Caribbean American Month, and we have told the  history and story of the powerful connection between the Caribbean and  the United States of America. That should be a moment of celebration,  friendship, unity, heritage, knowledge.   I am delighted to have anchored the Congressional Black Caucus  Special Order hour on the Caribbean American Heritage Month, and I  thank the chairwoman and the officers of the Congressional Black Caucus  and all of our members for continuing to tell the truth.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   Mrs. CHERFILUS-McCORMICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise to express my sincere  gratitude to those who came before me who made it possible for us to  honor Caribbean Heritage Month in the United States Congress. Today, we  celebrate the 16th year anniversary.   June is Caribbean Heritage month, where we celebrate the  extraordinary contribution of people of Caribbean ancestry. According  to the U.S. Census, almost 13.4 million Caribbean Americans live in the  U.S. In Florida's 20th Congressional District, the two largest groups  are Haitians and Jamaicans.   These are cab drivers, doctors, lawyers, engineers, teachers, and  nurses, who, without, our economy cannot thrive. Immigrants found one  quarter (25 percent) of new U.S. businesses.   Despite our contributions, we see the mistreatment of Black and Brown  migrants who are merely seeking refuge in the U.S. due to political  persecution and insecurity.   Since my arrival at the United States Congress, I have called out the  Administration for its disparate treatment of Black migrants. We have  all seen the influx of Haitian migrants at the Florida shores and the  U.S. Mexico border. Many of these migrants are merely seeking refuge  and cannot return to their native country due to fear of persecution  and immense violence.   I wanted to see the treatment of migrants in detention centers, so I  visited the Broward Transitional Center, where I spoke with migrants  from Central America, Haiti, and other parts of the world to better  understand their journey. I was devastated. My Congressional colleagues  and I have since written letters to the Administration to not use  private facilities for any detention, including the detention of  undocumented immigrants.   Unfortunately, the Administration regularly sends pregnant women,  babies, and children to Haiti and other parts of the region without the  right to due process or undergo a credible fear interview to determine  their eligibility for asylum. As of today, more than 300 flights have  landed in Haiti. This Trump-Era public health authority cannot continue  to be used as an excuse to turn away and repatriate migrants. It is  illegal and unconscionable to repatriate Haitians under these  circumstances.   While the Biden Administration did listen to our plea to rescind  Title 42, there is now a legal battle. I pray that the upcoming court's  ruling will not continue to violate U.S. asylum law and evade U.S.  treaty obligations by blocking and returning asylum seekers to places  where their lives and safety are in peril.   We have also called on the Administration to invite families to apply  for the Haitian Family Reunification Parole Program, which the  Administration announced during the Summit of the Americas that the  program would no longer exist only on paper. I have demanded that the  Administration also enforces provisions in the Immigration  Naturalization Act (INA) and provide Humanitarian Parole to Haitian  nationals at the U.S.-Mexico border.   Last month, I requested more than 300 million dollars from the House  Appropriations Committee to provide pro bono legal services to  immigrants from the Republic of Haiti, Jamaica, Guatemala, Honduras,  and nationals from other parts of Central America.   While there's a great need for comprehensive immigration reform, and  the House has passed the Dream and Promise Act, which would create a  pathway to citizenship for millions of DACA and TPS recipients, the  Senate has failed to vote on the legislation.   In the interim, I understand the economic challenges impacting  countries in the Caribbean and Latin America, which is why I co- introduced the Opportunities in Americas Act.   This legislation also represents my unwavering commitment to my  constituents from the Caribbean and Latin America, many of whom  frequently engage in commerce in the region and need policies that  support their expansion and foster business growth. Low-interest loans  are vital to promote innovation and competition and eliminate barriers  that prevent businesses from developing.   I remain committed to working with the Caribbean community and  congressional colleagues to create a more fair and just immigration  system and draft robust legislation that can yield economic prosperity  across the Caribbean and the diaspora.                            ____________________
