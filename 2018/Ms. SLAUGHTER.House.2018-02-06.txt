 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume. I thank my friend for yielding me the customary 30 minutes.   Mr. Speaker, I am sorry I can't support this continuing resolution  today.   The great government of the United States of America that has been  called ``the last best hope of man'' cannot be funded in tranches of  maybe 2 weeks to 3 weeks. This is the fifth continuing resolution that  we have done since the 30th of September. That is an atrocity. I mean,  I can't think of any legislative body anywhere totally unable to do its  job. And as sorry as I am to say it because of my great respect and  affection for my fellow Members, I don't believe that this majority is  capable of governing.   We are 2 days before the shutdown of the government of the United  States, before it closes for business. Late last night, about 10 p.m.,  they finally released the details of this short-term spending bill. And  we will be back here as soon as this one expires doing yet another one.   We are 5 months into the fiscal year, and this is the majority's  fifth continuing resolution. We are virtually in the same position  today as we were on September 8, December 7, December 21, and January  18 when this Chamber passed the prior continuing resolutions.   The majority isn't learning from any of this. They just keep  repeating those mistakes. Like the bill before it, the proposal was  written by and for the majority.   Let me repeat. The Democrats had virtually no say in this.   And once again, it ignores many of the priorities that we all agree  need to be addressed: providing additional disaster relief after a  storm season that saw historic wildfires, hurricanes, and mudslides;  three rail wrecks in 2 weeks with fatalities, certainly proving to us,  if we didn't know it already, that our neglect of the railroads, the  bridges, the infrastructure in the United States is a mess. Saving  America's endangered pensions is also a priority, and extending  additional health access for our veterans certainly is not just a  priority, but an obligation.                                time  1515    What is included here is woefully inadequate. This bill pays for  extending community health centers--which is very important to me, let  me hasten to add--by eviscerating funding for one of the most important  parts of the Affordable Care Act that helps keep people well: the  Prevention Fund. This fund focuses on children's health by expanding  access to lifesaving vaccines and reducing the risk of lead poisoning,  among many other things. The majority is paying for opening the centers  by gutting the Prevention Fund while we are experiencing the worst flu  epidemic in nearly a decade.   Now, I have heard a lot of talk about prioritizing the national  defense. We don't take a back seat on our side to anybody who loves and  respects the people who defend us, who every day--an all-volunteer  military--stands on the line for us.   But we also believe that this bill does not raise the Budget Control  Act sequester level of spending caps for nondefense. That is a shame,  and it is also the Budget Control Act.   Mr. Speaker, one-third of the nondefense domestic budget that we are  trying to get parity for goes to national security, part of our  defense: to our veterans, to homeland security, the State Department,  the Justice Department, and counterterrorism initiatives.   Refusing to equally raise the defense and nondefense caps is  irresponsible. Secretary of Defense General Mattis has said: No enemy  is more harmful than unpredictable funding from Congress.   But it isn't just defense that has had undependable funding. Not a  single agency of the Federal Government knows from one week to another  whether they will be funded or what they can do. We have cut down on  almost everything that they can do, including travel to places that  they absolutely need to be. It is pretty awful.   We have had the warnings, yet here we are today with a fifth short- term continuing resolution. The majority has 238 seats in the Chamber,  but it only holds 51 seats in the Senate. They have the ability to  draft a partisan agenda, and routinely do.   And we just saw that spectacle coming from the Intelligence Committee  in the House, when a memo, governed by the majority--and one was acted  on and put out for the public--but we are waiting and hoping that the  one for the minority will be given the approval by the President of the  United States.   But for anything, including this bill, to have a chance of getting 60  votes in the Senate and becoming law, you have to involve the  Democrats. They don't have enough over there. Fifty-one is not 60. This  is simple math.   The minority leader in the Senate has said this proposal is a  nonstarter. He added that moving forward with this plan would  ``jeopardize the positive discussions going on right now about the  budget, immigration, disaster aid, and more.'' So we know, standing  here today, that we are wasting our time.   We should finally bring an end to the continuing resolutions and the  failed my-way-or-the-highway approach to governing. That is the only  way the majority can fulfill what Speaker Ryan pledged when he took the  gavel and said: ``Only a fully functioning House can truly represent  the people. And If there were ever a time for us to step up, this would  be that time.''   Mr. Speaker, the American people and the world have watched for  months as the greatest democracy ever devised has been defined by its  dysfunction. If ever there was one, this is the time for the majority  to step up.   I am very much concerned, Mr. Speaker, that we are reaching the  tipping point. That the dysfunction and chaos displayed not just with  the actions of the stock market in the past 3 days, but our inability  to really know whether or not we are going to keep the lights on has  cost us dearly with respect to the rest of the world. And I need to  point out as well, just a few minutes ago, the President of the United  States thought that a government shutdown would be a good idea.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, President Trump said to reporters earlier today that if  Congress can't reach a deal on immigration: ``I'd love to see a  shutdown if we can't get this stuff taken care of. If we have to shut  it down because the Democrats don't want safety . . . let's shut it  down.''   We are also the people who were accused last week at the State of the  Union--because we didn't show great enthusiasm for his speech--that we  were treasonous. It is really pretty frightening to me, Mr. Speaker,  what is going on here, and I can't avoid talking about it. I said  earlier in the Rules Committee that I think we are reaching a tipping  point, and I honestly do believe that.   But this isn't the first time that President Trump encouraged a  government shutdown, which would be devastating. The last one we had  was for 16 days and took $24 billion out of this economy. This is  remarkable and, I think, pretty sad.   The President keeps injecting uncertainty into what already is a  chaotic process from the majority. No one in this Chamber is against  safety. We are asking them to take action on the bipartisan priorities  that have languished while they passed tax cuts for millionaires.   In 2016, during an interview with CBS This Morning, President Trump  said: ``I'm the king of debt. I'm great with debt. Nobody knows the  debt better than me.''   Well, Mr. Speaker, according to this article from The Washington Post  from February 3: ``The U.S. Treasury expects to borrow $955 billion  this fiscal year. . . . It's the highest amount of borrowing in 6  years, and a big jump from the $519 billion the Federal Government  borrowed last year.''   He is definitely the king of debt.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the article from The Washington  Post titled: ``The U.S. Government is set to borrow nearly $1 trillion  this year, an 84 percent jump from last year.''               [From the Washington Post, February 3, 2018.]   The U.S. Government Is Set To Borrow Nearly $1 Trillion This Year, an                       84 Percent Jump From Last Year                             (By Heather Long)         It was another crazy news week, so it's understandable if       you missed a small but important announcement from the       Treasury Department: The federal government is on track to       borrow nearly $1 trillion this fiscal year--Trump's first       full year in charge of the budget.        That's almost double what the government borrowed in fiscal       2017.        Here are the exact figures: The U.S. Treasury expects to       borrow $955 billion this fiscal year, according to documents       released Wednesday. It's the highest amount of borrowing in       six years, and a big jump from the $519 billion the federal       government borrowed last year.        Treasury mainly attributed, the increase to the ``fiscal       outlook.'' The Congressional Budget Office was more blunt. In       a report this week, the CBO said tax receipts are going to be       lower because of the new tax law.        The uptick in borrowing is yet another complication in the       heated debates in Congress over whether to spend more money       on infrastructure, the military, disaster relief and other       domestic programs. The deficit is already up significantly,       even before Congress allots more money to any of these areas.        ``We're addicted to debt,'' says Marc Goldwein, senior       policy director at Committee for a Responsible Federal       Budget. He blames both parties for the situation.        What's particularly jarring is this is the first time       borrowing has jumped this much (as a share of GDP) in a non-      recession time since Ronald Reagan was president, says Ernie       Tedeschi, a former senior adviser to the U.S. Treasury who is       now head of fiscal analysis at Evercore ISI. Under Reagan,       borrowing spiked because of a buildup in the military,       something Trump is advocating again.        Trump didn't mention the debt--or the ongoing budget       deficits--in his State of the Union address. The absence of       any mention of the national debt was frustrating for Goldwein       and others who warn that America has a major economic problem       looming.        ``It is terrible. Those deficits and the debt that keeps       rising is a serious problem, not only in the long run, but       right now,'' Harvard economist Martin Feldstein, a former       Reagan adviser, told Bloomberg News.        The White House got a taste this week of just how       problematic this debt situation could get. Investors are       concerned about all the additional borrowing and the       likelihood of higher inflation, which is why the interest       rates on U.S. government bonds hit the highest level since       2014. That, in turn, partly drove the worst weekly sell-off       in the stock market in two years.        The belief in Washington and on Wall Street has long been       that the U.S. government could just keep issuing debt because       people around the world are eager to buy up this safe-haven       asset. But there may be a limit to how much the market wants,       especially if inflation starts rising and investors prefer to       ditch bonds for higher-returning stocks.        ``Some of my Wall Street clients are starting to talk       recession in 2019 because of these issues. Fiscal policy is       just out of control,'' says Peter Davis, a former tax       economist in Congress who now runs Davis Capital Investment       Ideas.        The Federal Reserve was also buying a lot of U.S. Treasury       debt since the crisis, helping to beef up demand. But the Fed       recently decided to stop doing that now that the economy has       improved. It's another wrinkle as Treasury has to look for       new buyers.        Tedeschi, the former Treasury adviser to the Obama       administration, calls it ``concerning, but not a crisis.''       Still, he says it's a ``big risk'' to plan on borrowing so       much in the coming years.        Trump's Treasury forecasts borrowing more than $1 trillion       in 2019 and more than $1.1 trillion in 2020. Before taking       office, Trump described himself as the ``king of debt,''       although he campaigned on reducing the national debt.        The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget predicts the       U.S. deficit will hit $1 trillion by 2019 and stay there for       a while. The latest borrowing figure--$955 billion--released       this week was determined from a survey of bond market       participants, who tend to be even faster to react to the       changing policy landscape and change their forecasts.        Both parties claim they want to be ``fiscally       responsible,'' but Goldwein says they both pass legislation       that adds to the debt.  [[Page H824]]       Politicians argue this is the last time they'll pass a bill       that makes the deficit worse, but so far, they just keep       going.        The latest example of largesse is the GOP tax bill. It's       expected to add $1 trillion or more to the debt, according to       nonpartisan analysis from the Joint Committee on Taxation       (and yes, that's after accounting for some increased economic       growth).        But even before that, Goldwein points to the 2015 extension       of many tax cuts and the 2014 delays in Medicare       reimbursement cuts.        ``Every time you feed your addiction, you grow your       addiction,'' says Goldwein.        There doesn't seem to be any appetite for budgetary       restraint in Washington, but the market may force Congress's       hand.     Mr. Speaker, we did hear in the State of the Union  that we will be asking for $1.5 trillion for infrastructure. Given the  $1.5 trillion that we have already started borrowing for to give the  top 1 percent a great tax cut that would be permanent, I am not sure  anybody will finance that request. And, frankly, taking on that amount  of debt would mean that almost everything else that we do in the  country would take a back seat, or even further behind than back.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an  amendment to the rule to bring up H.R. 3440, the Dream Act. This  bipartisan, bicameral legislation would help hundreds of thousands of  young people who are American in every way except on paper.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of the  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentlewoman from New York?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Mrs. Napolitano) to discuss our proposal.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds to say that I  would not come to the floor if I were in the majority and lecture the  minority when the majority runs the House, the Senate, and the White  House and accuse us of shutting down the House or not producing the  votes. We don't have enough votes in the first place. That is why we  are the minority.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Doggett), the distinguished ranking member of the Ways and  Means Subcommittee on Tax Policy.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Texas an  additional 1 minute.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Texas an  additional 1 minute.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Texas an  additional 1 minute.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).   Ms. JACKSON LEE. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding me time.   Mr. Speaker, I associate myself, and I think it is important for my  colleagues and the American people to know, that this body, this  government, this Congress, is controlled by one party: the Presidency,  the House, and the Senate. Just a few minutes ago, the President of the  United States called for a shutdown. I am shocked. I am not calling for  anything but relief.   I am delighted that the gentleman from Dallas was able to craft a  support system for infusion therapy, but it goes to show you who  controls this place. I don't know what Democrat could get any additions  to this particular CR. It is not an appropriation. It is not an  authorization bill.   I am just on the floor begging for what my colleagues, both  Republicans and Democrats from Texas, have been asking for but my  Republican House has not been able to produce, or the Senate. When I  say that, we have not been able to produce a disaster supplemental bill  that is going to respond to the needs of those who are still suffering.   Harris County covers 1,778 square miles. It can fit New York City,  Philadelphia, Boston, Chicago, Seattle, Austin, and Dallas, with room  still to spare; 41,500 square miles of land mass impacted by Hurricane  Harvey and the subsequent flooding that covered an area larger than the  States of Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and  Vermont, combined. This is not puffery. It is to show you the depth of  devastation.   Hurricane Harvey dropped 21 trillion gallons of water on Texas and  Louisiana, most of it on the Houston metroplex. 51.88 inches of rain  fell near Cedar Bayou, and at the peak, on September 1, one-third of  Houston was underwater.   Our headlines: Hurricane Harvey Recovery Goes Ignored in Washington  Yet Again; Republicans Controlling Every Phase of Government; After  Harvey, Houstonians Eye Long Road to Recovery; After Harvey,  Houstonians Have Long Road; Houses Down on the Ground; Long Road to  Recovery; Senior Citizens Suffering; Suffering from Health Conditions.   And you can see, here is the basic point: There is no reason why  Republicans joining with Democrats cannot, one, have an $81 billion  supplemental that goes up. It is not enough. But it is the  administration that has cut into our very life by giving us a skinny  disaster aid supplemental. I am looking for the Senate to plus it up  because this is not enough.   In this bill, if you want to know why we are voting ``no,'' it  doesn't exist. Where is the disaster emergency supplemental money that  is needed?    I left my office with six members of local officials in my office.  They were telling me about the depression of so many in Texas who do  not have the resources. They don't have the housing money. The  infrastructure money has not come. Mold is there. They have bad health.   And these are examples of their situation. This is what the rescues  look like. This is, of course, what the water looked like. And this  gentleman was walking in the water.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman from Texas an  additional 2 minutes.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. This is a house that is evidenced by those impacted  by the hurricane. This is a house of someone who is still waiting for  that house to be rebuilt.   Finally, the city council, wanting to be responsive--and I thank  them--has lifted the permitting to allow trailers. Our people are  begging now for trailers. Most people don't beg for trailers. We are  begging for trailers in urban Houston because people have nowhere to  live.   This is a disgrace. I am not making this personal, but we flooded on  August 27. It is now, today, February 6. There is no reason why this  Republican administration has not been able to work. And all these  additional addendums on this CR should have been done in a bipartisan  effort.   We support infusion therapy. We support federally qualified health  clinics. But you are taking money from prevention. We support CHIP, but  you are taking money from prevention and other things. This is not the  way to do, one, spending; it is not the way to provide for national  security; it is not the way to provide for the Environmental Protection  Agency, the Department of State, Department of Justice, law  enforcement. We are not doing any of that.                                time  1600    And then there are 140,000 DREAMers in my State. Some of them are  impacted by Hurricane Harvey. And let me make mention of the Virgin  Islands, Puerto Rico, Florida, and California. I am not in any way  diminishing their pain. They are likewise suffering.   So if the American people want to know what the ``noes'' are about,  the ``noes'' are because those who are in charge are not doing  anything.   By the way, DREAMers are part of those who sought to rescue many who  were stranded in Houston. We lost a DREAMer who traveled all the way  from Dallas to provide rescue and he died. He died because he loved  this country. He died because he loved his neighbors.   Yet we cannot get that fixed, but we cannot help our neighbors get  the dollars that they need. If you want to know why there is a ``no''  vote, it is because it is long overdue for our friends to do the real  work that needs to be done, and to do disaster supplemental funding and  do it right.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record two articles from the Houston  Chronicle.                [From the Houston Chronicle, Oct. 26, 2017]  Houston ISD Schools With Most Displaced Students After Hurricane Harvey                              (By Shelby Webb)         More than 1300 Houston ISD students are displaced or       homeless after Hurricane Harvey, according to records the       district submitted to the Texas Education Agency.        That number is likely to change after the TEA changed how       districts should categorize displaced students and as Houston       ISD shores up its own internal estimates. But initial data       shows four of the 10 schools with the largest numbers of       displaced students are located in Southwest Houston, three in       Meyerland alone.        Two magnet schools--Carnegie Vanguard High School and Lamar       High School--also saw large numbers of their students       affected by Harvey's floods.        Houston ISD Superintendent Richard Carranza required that       all teachers go through crisis and trauma training during the       first semester of the year to better help students who are       dealing with Harvey-related fears and losses.        Across the Houston area, more than 10,700 students have       been displaced by Hurricane Harvey, according to data       reported to the TEA and given to the Chronicle by 16 local       school districts. But that number does not include estimates       for how many students are displaced in some of the area's       largest school districts, including the Cypress-Fairbanks,       Spring and Pearland ISDs.        Katy ISD had the most students affected by the storm with       2,862. Tiny Stafford MSD had the least, with 32 students       displaced by the storm.                                   ____                  [From the Houston Chronicle, Dec. 6, 2017]             Top Health Official Views Harvey Recovery Efforts                            (By Mike Hixenbaugh)         Dr. Brenda Fitzgerald, the head of the federal Centers for       Disease Control and Prevention, spent most of the day       receiving briefings from officials at Harris County Public       Health, which has been on the front lines helping residents       cope following the historic flooding.        Later, Fitzgerald visited a mobile wellness unit in Galena       Park, where county health  [[Page H828]]       workers provided residents of the flood-ravaged community in       southeast Harris County with free immunizations, cleaning       supplies, bug spray, canned food and other services.        Now Playing: Level of help to expect for Harvey flood       recovery        Harris County dispatched the mobile health units to more 3o       locations in the weeks following the hurricane, part of a       broader effort to help residents care for themselves in the       midst of the devastation. Fitzgerald said she's been       monitoring the county's efforts closely and wanted to see       them firsthand.        ``I wanted to come and see how it's going,'' Fitzgerald       said, ``and also to see what else we can do to make sure       Houston recovers totally.''        Although Harvey's true toll on public health is still being       calculated, Fitzgerald said the CDC is committed to providing       Texas with whatever resources are needed to grapple with the       aftermath.        The visit comes days after the Kaiser Family Foundation       released a sweeping survey that found 17 percent of those who       had houses damaged or suffered income loss reported that       someone in their household has developed a new or worsening       health condition.        Chronic respiratory ailments resulting from mold and       stress-related mental health struggles are of particular       concern after flooding, health officials said, as well as the       threat of mosquito-borne illnesses and other infectious       diseases.        Fitzgerald said she was impressed by the resiliency of       residents and public health workers she met, some of whom       manned mobile health clinics just days after losing their       homes to flooding.        ``The work goes on,'' Fitzgerald said.    Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in opposition to Rules Committee Print  115-58, legislation extending the Continuing Resolution now in effect  for an additional five weeks, or until March 23, 2018.   But before I proceed further, I want to note--and Americans needs to  know--that this is not a spending bill; it is instead an affirmation of  the House Republicans' inability to govern.   This is the fifth time House Republicans have chosen to kick the can  down the road rather than work with Democrats to come to a necessary  bipartisan agreement to lift the Budget Control Act (BCA) spending  caps, giving appropriators the direction they need for full-year  funding bills.   The reason given for passing each of the prior Continuing Resolutions  was that the extra time was needed to reach a comprehensive agreement  to fund government operations in a fair and balanced way.   Yet, even with the extra time, House Republicans made no progress  during any of the previous extensions.   This should not be surprising; the House GOP is carrying the water  for the president, who a few months ago said ``we need a big beautiful  shutdown.''   Mr. Speaker, I cannot support a CR that does not include full funding  for disaster recovery, extends additional health access for veterans,  provides funding to combat the opioid epidemic, and protects pensions.   Most important, it is outrageous that House Republicans would bring  to the floor and request support for a fifth CR extension that does not  address and resolve the crisis the Republican Administration has  inflicted on 800,000 Dreamers and their families, including 124,000  Dreamers in my home state of Texas.   Instead of acting responsibly to address these issues and fund the  government for the remainder of the fiscal year, House Republicans  continue wasting time.   This is not appropriations; this is a stop-gap funding measure to  save ourselves from collapse.   Although the funding bill before us makes a feeble attempt to address  numerous expired or expiring health priorities, it fails to reauthorize  several key programs including the Maternal Infant and Early Childhood  Home Visiting (MIECHV) and Health Professional Opportunity Grant (HPOG)  programs.   Just as bad, this legislation is paid for the package with partisan  offsets, such as cuts to the Prevention and Public Health Fund before  ending the Prevention and Public Health Fund in 2027.   Mr. Speaker, another reason that this bill should be passed in its  present form is that it includes the same Department of Defense  appropriations bill that the House passed on January 30, 2018, which  increases defense spending by $73 billion more than the $549 billion  allowed under the current BCA defense cap and provides $75 billion in  additional discretionary funding designated for Overseas Contingency  Operations (OCO).   As a consequence, if this bill becomes law it would eliminate any  chance for a bipartisan budget cap agreement for this year.   For months, Democrats have sought an agreement on the discretionary  spending caps that provides parity for both defense and non-defense  appropriations bills, both of which are critical to our nation's  security.   Rather than negotiate a cap agreement that would pave the way for a  defense appropriations bill to become law, Republicans are placing a  bill on the floor that will exempt itself from the BCA defense cap's  sequestration.   This bill is the fifth example of Republicans rejecting bipartisan  compromise.   Mr. Speaker, despite controlling the House, Senate, and the White  House, Republicans have not funded the government for the entire year,  even though we are already four months into the fiscal year.   Democrats, meanwhile, have done the work with which we were tasked.   I am a member of the Budget committee and we Democrats proposed a  budget that:   1. Respected the needs of all Americans, including those who serve  bravely in the Department of Defense;   2. Honored the sacrifice of our heroes in uniform;   3. Protected programs like CHIP, made investments in infrastructure  and ensured that Americans have access to quality healthcare.   Because Republicans refuse to work with Democrats and compromise on  how to provide relief from the BCA's sequester level spending caps,  they are lurching from CR to CR--degrading the readiness of our  military and preventing government agencies from properly serving the  American people.   This is not a responsible way to govern; therefore, I cannot support  this bill, especially when there still remains millions of Americans  still coping with the devastating effects of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma,  and Maria in Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands,  and wildfires in California.   The nine-county Houston metro area impacted by Hurricane Harvey  covers 9,444 square miles, an area larger than five states, including  New Hampshire, New Jersey and Connecticut.   Harris County covers 1,778 square miles, enough space to fit New York  City, Philadelphia, Boston, Chicago, Seattle, Austin and Dallas, with  room still to spare.   There was over 41,500 square miles of land mass impacted by Hurricane  Harvey and the subsequent flooding that covered an area larger than the  States of Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and  Vermont combined.   Hurricane Harvey dropped 21 trillion gallons of water on Texas and  Louisiana, most of it on the Houston Metroplex and the 51.88 inches of  rain that fell near Cedar Bayou is the highest total ever recorded for  a single U.S. weather event.   At its peak on September 1, 2017, one-third of Houston was  underwater.   At the peak on August 31, there were 34,575 evacuees in shelters  across Texas.   Hurricane Harvey is the largest housing disaster to strike the U.S.  in our nation's history.   Hurricane Harvey damaged 203,000 homes, of which 12,700 were  destroyed.   Mr. Speaker, people are living in homes with mold.   As recently as this past November, nearly 19,000 hotel rooms in over  1,500 hotels were still occupied by persons displaced by Hurricane  Harvey.   Thousands of others with severe damage to their homes are living with  family or friends.   889,425 people have registered for assistance with the Federal  Emergency Management Agency.   As of December 5, 2017, more than 632,000 individuals or households  in metro Houston had submitted valid registrations for FEMA's  Individual and Households Program (IHP) and 249,259 registrations were  approved for $1.0 billion in assistance.   And because of Republican unwillingness to compromise or govern  competently, disaster victims in my congressional district and all  across the affected areas are still waiting for the disaster funding  assistance they desperately need.   House Republicans need to work across the aisle with Democrats and  get our work done--including. upholding the long-standing precedent of  agreeing to parity when providing relief from sequester caps.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I have heard the majority speak with great urgency today  about the need to pass the continuing resolution. But where was this  urgency from the majority for the last 5 months of this fiscal year?   They were so consumed with providing tax breaks to the wealthy and  corporations that they ignored virtually everything else.   This was a bill that was sold as a middle class tax cut. But 83  percent of the tax cuts go to the wealthiest 1 percent; and for  corporations, the tax breaks are permanent. For individuals, they are  sunsetted.   Speaker Ryan, over the weekend, promoted the fact that a secretary in  Pennsylvania received an extra $1.50 a week under the tax scam. That is  $78 a year for her. You can see what the middle class actually got.   But compare that with the wealthy. One analysis found that the Koch  brothers and their corporate empire could save between $1 billion and  $1.4 billion combined in income taxes every year as a result of the tax  law. It is important to remember that this is a permanent cut.   It was a bill written for the rich to help the rich. It spends money  we don't have, while adding $1.5 trillion to the deficit. That is such  a staggering amount that the Congressional Budget Office said last week  that because of this tax bill, our government now is expected to run  out of money sooner than anticipated.   The deadline to raise the debt ceiling has now been moved from early  April to mid-March. Only during the Second World War was our debt as a  percentage of gross domestic product higher than it is today. I hope we  can forever end the myth that the majority is the party of fiscal  discipline. The situation we are in today is a direct result of the  majority prioritizing the wealthy over doing the most basic functions  of keeping the government running.   And now, after ignoring Democrats as this bill was drafted, they  expect us to fall in line and support a flawed proposal. That is not  how it works. If they want our support, they need to work with us. And  Democrats have been clear: We cannot afford to keep kicking the can  down the road. It is past time for a long-term bill that addresses  urgent national priorities.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on the previous question, on the  rule, and the bill.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore.
