 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise in support of the Economic Growth,  Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, which passed the Senate  yesterday. This bipartisan bill protects and boosts the U.S. economy. I  commend Chairman Crapo, members of the Banking Committee, and my  colleagues on both sides of the aisle for the hard work in getting this  particular bill proposal across the finish line.   Making the rules simpler and fairer for small and midsized financial  institutions is a commonsense idea that has garnered broad bipartisan  support. That is because, done right, it helps hardworking Americans  who aspire to invent things, start businesses, and manufacture goods  and services--exactly the kind of entrepreneurship and growth America  needs more of.   There are plenty of people with different viewpoints on how to  improve the financial system. Some, however, say that almost any  modification to the 849-page Dodd-Frank Act equates to a bonfire  financial regulation, a gift to Wall Street, and so on. I think we need  to cut through such patronizing, derisive mudslinging, and instead  focus on commonsense solutions for the American people.   Let me tell you a plain truth: The bill the Senate passed yesterday  is the result of sensible debate, reasonable compromise, and hard  policy choices. Without compromising the safety and soundness of our  financial system, it provides regulatory relief to small and midsized  banks, credit unions, and financial institutions--the kind most  familiar on Main Street in my home State of Utah.   Our constituents deserve regulatory relief. Between 2010 and 2016,  compliance with Dodd-Frank cost $36 billion and required 73 million  paperwork hours. Dodd-Frank alone enacted more than five times as many  restrictions as any other law passed by the Obama administration and  more than 22,000 pages of regulations.   With their vast resources, large banks could stomach these  regulations mainly through automation, but smaller banks could not.  Saddled with extra compliance requirements and no material benefit to  resilience, many buckled under the weight of these burdensome  regulations.   Consider that there are 1,736 fewer community banks today than when  Dodd-Frank was signed into law. Since 2010, the number of FDIC-insured  commercial banks in Utah dropped from 53 to 42. In a similar timespan,  the number of NCUA-insured credit unions in my home State fell from 94  to 66. Over the past decade, the percentage of small business and  commercial loans dropped more than 15 percent.   Indeed, 8 years since the passage of Dodd-Frank, it is high time for  Congress to reflect and make adjustments, as necessary, to improve our  financial  [[Page S1762]]  regulatory system. Let's focus on resilience and efficiency. This bill  does just that.   I would like to briefly highlight three reforms in the bill that  benefit our national and local economies. First, the bill provides  relief and flexibility to small financial institutions. More small bank  holding companies will be able to raise capital, which will help bank  lending opportunities for families, businesses, and startups. This  policy was based on a bipartisan bill, the Community Bank Relief Act,  that I introduced along with Senators King, Nelson, and Perdue. It is  common sense to know that Utah's community banks are different from  Wall Street banks, but too often regulations treat them the same.   Second, the bill increases the bank asset threshold for enhanced  standards from $50 billion to $250 billion. I have long supported  raising or recalibrating the asset threshold. It makes little sense  that regional banks undergo stress tests and capital reviews similar to  some of the largest, most complex global financial institutions.  Similar to the unrealistic expectations put on community banks, this  one-size-fits-all approach negatively affected regional banks.   Third, the bill eases the regulatory burden on 5,000 community banks  that make up about 98 percent of financial institutions. For small  banks and credit unions, this legislation provides relief from some of  the requirements from the qualified mortgage rule, allowing them to  devote more resources to serving their members rather than spending  hours complying with regulatory overreach.   In today's era of extreme partisanship, this bill is a breath of  fresh air. What the Senate has been able to accomplish this week is  based on practical, consensus-led policy choices. While there remain  other reforms that could relieve stress of burdensome regulations, this  bill is a much needed start, which is why I wholeheartedly support this  legislation.   Members on both sides of the aisle agree that the broad scope of  Dodd-Frank created some harmful, unintended consequences. Let's make  the rules simpler and fairer, as appropriate but not at the expense of  safety. This bipartisan bill does just that, and the American people  would be better off because of it.   I yield the floor.    I thank my colleague.                          Confirmation of Gregg Doud
