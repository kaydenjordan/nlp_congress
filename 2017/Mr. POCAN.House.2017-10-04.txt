 Mr. Chair, I would like to thank the gentleman from  Arizona, also, for his leadership within the caucus.    I am proud to rise in support of the Congressional Progressive  Caucus' budget alternative. This is a practical, progressive vision for  our country by providing solutions to counter the Republican cuts to  vital programs and tax breaks for the wealthy.   Let me contrast the House GOP budget with the Progressive Caucus  budget.   First, in healthcare, the Republican budget embraces TrumpCare by  incorporating the House-passed American Health Care Act, which cuts at  least 20 million people from their care. This includes up to $1  trillion in cuts to Medicaid, threatening care for seniors in nursing  homes, children, and struggling families. It makes $500 billion in cuts  to Medicare, ending the Medicare guarantee and shifting cost risk on to  seniors.   The Congressional Progressive Caucus budget defends and strengthens  the Affordable Care Act. It lowers prescription drug costs and expands  access to mental healthcare and addiction treatment.   We invest in workers. The GOP plan slashes investments in workers and  programs to help more Americans get back to work, programs like  apprenticeships and job training. And yet the people's budget would  create 2.4 million jobs over its first 3 years and raise wages for  American workers.   The Republican budget, their $5.4 trillion in spending cuts means  less funding for roads and bridges and schools. Our budget puts a $2  trillion investment into strengthening our Nation's infrastructure.   The Republican budget drastically cuts Federal funding, which could  undermine our ability to respond to disasters. The people's budget  provides $200 billion in emergency disaster funds to rebuild  communities devastated by hurricanes.   The Republican budget guts our public education system with cuts that  could devastate schools and further disinvest in public universities.  The Progressive Caucus budget makes debt-free college a reality and  provides for the refinancing of student loans. It expands access to  pre-K education and provides childcare for all families.   Let's get real. The reason we are debating the budget this week:  Republicans can't wait to get started on their tax breaks for the  wealthy. The Republican tax plan should be called the Trump Family Tax  Plan because it enriches the wealthy on the backs of the middle class.   The Progressive Caucus gets it right. Not one more penny in tax  breaks for corporations and the wealthiest Americans. The Progressive  Caucus budget ensures that the top 1 percent pay their fair share in  taxes, we close corporate loopholes, and we expand the earned income  tax credit and the child tax credit for working families.   We must reject the Trump Family tax cut and invest in our roads and  bridges, our schools, our healthcare, and our workers. Progressives are  proposing bold policy solutions as clear alternatives to the cruel  budget cuts Republicans are proposing.   The people's budget is an investment in the American people, and I  urge you to support the Progressive Caucus people's budget.   Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, my friend reminds me of a story when  Ronald Reagan was pushing his tax reductions a generation ago that  produced the biggest expansion in our Nation's history. He was  approached one day by a working class fellow on a stop that the  President was making, and the man looks at him and says: Mr. President,  the Democrats say that you Republicans want to cut taxes on the rich.  Is that right?   Reagan says: Well, that is what they say.   And the man says: Well, you go ahead and do that, Mr. President,  because a poor person never gave me a job.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  Woodall).                                time  1815
