 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize  the remarkable and extraordinary life of Ira Lipman.   Ira was not only a loyal friend, but he was a humanitarian, a  successful businessman, and a widely respected leader by all. Ira was  committed to the city of Memphis and inspired others to make his  hometown a better place to live.   He founded his company, Guardsmark, in the city of Memphis, which  grew into the Nation's largest privately held security company. He was  recognized as a national leader on all security matters.   Ira also championed the creation of the Memphis Shelby County Crime  Commission, which, for more than 20 years, has brought together leaders  in business, government, and law enforcement to address the city's  crime issues.   Ira's generosity, his wisdom, and his courage were unparalleled, and  I am lucky to have been able to call him a friend. Frankly, the world  was a better place with Ira in it.   Ira leaves behind his beloved wife of 49 years, Barbara, as well as  three sons.   Indeed, Ira may have rested his head at night on his pillow in New  York City, but his heart and his soul lived in Memphis.                            ____________________
