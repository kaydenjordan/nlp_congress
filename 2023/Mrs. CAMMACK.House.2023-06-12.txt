 Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 662) to amend the Disaster Relief Supplemental  Appropriations  [[Page H2804]]  Act, 2023 to improve disaster relief funding for agricultural  producers, and for other purposes, as amended.

SEC. 3. EMERGENCY DESIGNATION.         (a) In General.--This Act and the amendments made by this       Act are designated as an emergency requirement pursuant to       section 4(g) of the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 (2       U.S.C. 933(g)).        (b) Designation in Senate.--In the Senate, this Act and the       amendment made by this section are designated as an emergency       requirement pursuant to section 4001(a)(1) of S. Con. Res. 14       (117th Congress), the concurrent resolution on the budget for       fiscal year 2022.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, this bill, led by my colleagues Representatives Scott  Franklin and Debbie Wasserman Schultz, both of the Sunshine State as  well, has the support of the entire Florida delegation, which is very  urgently calling, on behalf of the citrus producers in our State, to  pass this bill.   Hurricane Ian impacted more than 375,000 acres of citrus groves,  costing nearly $675 million in damages to the industry. More than 90  percent of all Florida citrus production was impacted by tropical  storms in 2022. I will repeat that because I think it bears repeating:  More than 90 percent of all Florida citrus produce was impacted by  tropical storms in 2022.                                time  1715    In December of last year, Congress appropriated $3.7 billion, with a  b, to address agricultural losses from hurricanes and other natural  disasters. However, to date, no citrus grower has received any of the  agricultural disaster relief funds. None.   When speaking to Secretary Vilsack, Secretary of the USDA, during a  recent Ag Committee hearing, the Secretary stated that they, being  USDA, needed this authority from Congress, and if we give USDA the  authority, they will do everything that they can to get these funds to  those who need it most.   The exact quote from Secretary Vilsack was:         If you, Congress, direct us, USDA, and give us the power to       do so, we will do everything we can to get the resources to       the people who need it as quickly as we can.    This bill would allow the Secretary of Agriculture to create a  program within USDA to support specialty crops, including citrus,  damaged by natural disasters. In 2017, this relief model was  successfully used to help growers recover from Hurricane Irma. The  Block Grant Assistance Act would provide that exact same flexibility to  the Secretary to help Florida citrus growers recover from Hurricane  Ian.   In 2018, Congress gave USDA the authority to issue block grants to  States to assist with recovery efforts after Hurricane Irma. In  conjunction with the USDA Farm Service Agency, the FSA, the Florida  Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, and the Florida  Division of Emergency Management, the Florida Citrus Recovery Block  Grant Program was created to support citrus growers impacted by  Hurricane Irma. The CRBG program was widely successful in aiding the  Florida citrus industry. Unfortunately, for our citrus producers, the  language in the fiscal year `23 omnibus bill did not provide Secretary  Vilsack the direct authority to disburse the appropriated disaster  funds via block grant.   Citrus is a crucial part of the Florida economy. The industry has  more than 400,000 acres of citrus groves across the State. The industry  contributes $6.8 billion to the economy each year and supports over  33,000 jobs. Citrus growers have had no shortage of challenges over the  past several decades, from citrus greening to natural disasters, high  input costs, labor concerns, and beyond. However, our State growers  have continued to remain resilient. This bill would help our citrus  growers recover from Hurricane Ian by allowing the Secretary to  efficiently deploy the funds that have already been appropriated by  Congress.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the distinguished gentleman from Florida ( Madam Speaker, I urge adoption of this bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
