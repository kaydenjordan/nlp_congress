 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Indiana (Mr.  Banks), my colleague, for organizing this Special Order.   Madam Speaker, when my father was a child, he sold newspapers on the  streets in Oklahoma City. He was 6, 7, and 8 years old. He would tell  me stories that they would show up every morning and fight over the  best corners because they knew they could sell the most newspapers.  That was when we were in the middle of a depression.   We are not in a depression today--yet. But yet, we still have  fighting over those same corners.   Today, instead of fighting over the sale of newspapers, they are  fighting over the sale of drugs, and these are illegal drugs that are  coming across our border.                                time  2000    Most people don't realize how potent fentanyl is. Let me give you an  example. One grain, one single grain of fentanyl can kill a grown man.  You can take two packs of sweetener that you sweeten your drink with;  that is enough to kill every member of Congress, House and Senate, to  give you some idea of how potent these drugs are. Could you imagine a  50-pound backpack of it coming across our open borders?   My personal observation is these intercity killings are primarily  against minority communities. Where is the outrage for these children  which are our responsibility? They are our responsibility, not another  person's responsibility. Our communities are being flooded with illegal  drugs being brought in from the left and the right, across our southern  borders. My Democrat colleagues remain silent.   Madam Speaker, I truly believe President Biden cares about the lives  that are being lost due to illegal drugs and the violence that is being  claimed due to these illegal drugs. But where is he? Why is the  President not being the leader that he was elected to be? We need a  President that is a leader and that will step out there.   We have had a full year to address this simple issue. This simple  issue is the illegal drugs. No one seems to be paying attention. I  promise you it affects every family. Every family in America that has a  family member or friend that has been affected by this fentanyl needs  to hear this because we can stop it. We can do it.   This is an American issue that all communities should be in an uproar  about. There are simple, commonsense solutions to fix this problem. I  am asking, no, I am begging President Biden to sit down at the table  and work across the aisle. Let's secure our southern border and stop  the flow of these illegal drugs into our community that are killing,  killing our kids.   Let's build a wall now instead of stopping the wall. Let's build a  wall now and finally put safety and security back into America. First  and foremost, our responsibility is the safety of the citizens of this  country.   Mr. President, please hear my plea. Now is the time to take action.  We need an American leader.
