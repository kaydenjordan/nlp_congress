 Mr. President, recently the Supreme Court righted a  historic injustice, and it was clearly written in the opinion by  Justice Alito. It said this is to return the power to the people,  return the power to the people's elected representatives, instead of  nine men back in 1973 in black robes to decide this very important  issue.   It said the people should decide the right parameters to protect moms  and their babies from the violence of abortion. And rather than use  this opportunity to protect life, very soon, the Senate Democrats will  try to pass a very extreme--extreme--abortion bill.   Remember how extreme our colleagues have become on the other side of  the aisle on the issue of abortion. They want to codify the ability to  abort babies up until the moment of birth.   In fact, we have seen my colleagues across the aisle reject trying to  protect babies that are born alive as a result of an abortion. It is  chilling. This bill that is going to be presented does nothing to help  pregnant moms in crisis or their unborn babies.   This bill, just even looking at it, which has been hastily put  together in the last 48 hours, this bill would give fly-in abortionists  free rein to commit abortion on demand up to the moment of birth and  even--it seems--to perform them within a State with strong pro-life  laws.   This bill also protects the greed, frankly, of woke corporations, who  see that it is cheaper to pay for an abortion and abortion tourism than  maternity leave for their employees.   We must reject this radical legislation that will endanger pregnant  mothers and endanger their babies.   I yield the floor.
