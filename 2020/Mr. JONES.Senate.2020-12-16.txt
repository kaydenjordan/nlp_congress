 Mr. President, it is with sadness and humility that I ask  this body to pause for a moment to remember and honor a great American  and a citizen of my home State, CSM Bennie G. Adkins, who died of  complications related to the COVID-19 virus on April 17, 2020. He was  laid to rest with full military honors this morning after a funeral  service in the chapel at Arlington National Cemetery.   Command Sergeant Major Adkins, known to friends and family as  ``Bennie,'' received the Medal of Honor at a White House ceremony on  September 15, 2014, for acts of heroism during the Vietnam war.  Although Bennie was recommended for the Medal of Honor at the time, he  was instead given the next highest award, the Distinguished Service  Cross. In 2002, the Army began reviewing Distinguished Service Cross  awards for possible upgrades, and finally, 48 years later, President  Obama bestowed a well-deserved Medal of Honor upon Bennie Adkins.   As we know, the Medal of Honor is the Nation's highest medal for  valor in combat. According to a statute passed in 1918, the President  is authorized to present this award to ``each person who, while an  officer or enlisted man of the Army, shall hereafter, in action  involving actual conflict with an enemy, distinguish himself  conspicuously by gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life  above and beyond the call of duty.'' Other legislation authorizes the  award within the other military departments as well.   In the history of this country, the Medal of Honor has been awarded  to 3,507 individuals. Fewer than 70 of those recipients are still alive  today.   I point this out because I believe that when these heroes leave  Active Duty and come home to live among us in our communities, their  very presence in our midst lifts us all up. They inspire and embolden  countless other acts of courage and sacrifice, both great and small,  many of which we have seen in the recent weeks and months our Nation  and our world have been battling the very virus that took Bennie  Adkins' life.   So it is with gratitude and a deep sense of loss that we remember  this extraordinary man.   The facts of the events that led to Bennie Adkins' recognition bear  mention. However, as President Obama said when presenting Bennie with  the Medal, ``I have to be honest, in a battle and daring escape that  lasted four days, Bennie performed so many acts of bravery we actually  don't have time to talk about all of them.'' I will, therefore, attempt  to summarize, combining information from the citation that accompanied  the award, media accounts of the events, and quotes from Bennie's  memoir.   When Camp A Shau was attacked by a large Viet Cong force early on  March 9, 1966, then-Sergeant First Class Adkins rushed through intense  hostile fire to man a mortar position. Although wounded himself by  incoming fire, Bennie briefly relinquished his mortar to a comrade and  ran through exploding mortar rounds in order to drag several wounded  Americans to safety. During the battle, Bennie later recalled, bullets  hit and killed one man he was carrying on his back. At another point,  Adkins, a former baseball catcher, caught a North Vietnamese hand  grenade in midair and flung it back at the enemy.   Over the course of 4 days, Bennie repeatedly exposed himself to  hostile fire while rescuing and helping evacuate his fellow soldiers,  retrieving additional munitions, and repelling repeated waves of  attacking enemy soldiers. Bennie suffered 18 wounds--including to an  eye and his torso--but managed to kill an estimated 135 to 175 enemy  troops.   Because of his efforts to carry a wounded soldier to an extraction  point rather than leave him behind, Bennie and his group were unable to  reach the last evacuation helicopter. Running extremely low on  ammunition, he returned to the mortar pit, gathered additional  ammunition, and ran through intense fire back to the communications  bunker. After being ordered to evacuate the camp, Adkins and the  remaining small group destroyed all signal equipment and classified  documents, then fought their way out of the camp and into the jungle,  where they evaded the pursuing North Vietnamese Army for 2 days.   Their escape was aided by the sawed-off shotgun Bennie carried as a  sidearm and by the unexpected intervention of an Indonesian tiger.  Trapped in the jungle, the group's radio damaged in the battle, Adkins  managed to rig his shotgun as an antenna, enabling him to communicate  their location to friendly forces. As the group endured a second night  in the jungle waiting for help to arrive, the tiger, which had been  hunting nearby, frightened off the enemy, giving Adkins and the others  an opportunity to create a makeshift landing pad for a rescue  helicopter the next morning.   The Medal of Honor citation concludes, ``Sergeant First Class Adkins'  extraordinary heroism in close combat against a numerically superior  hostile force was in keeping with the highest traditions of the  military service and reflects great credit upon himself, his unit, and  the United States Army.''   Extraordinary indeed.   Remarkable as those details are, the facts of Bennie's postservice  life are equally worthy of note.   Bennie and his wife Mary were married for more than 60 years--until  she passed away in 2019. They don't give medals for that, but I know  from observing my own parents' 60-plus years together that, no matter  who the couple are, that kind of dedication, loyalty, and commitment  are special.   After 20 years of service in the Army, Bennie retired and went back  to school. He earned three degrees from Troy University--a bachelor's  in finance and two master's degrees--and opened his own accounting firm  in Auburn. Then, Bennie began deploying his  [[Page S7536]]  charisma, his wit, his way with people, and his resources to help  others pursue their goals through education.   For several years, Bennie taught night classes at Alabama's Southern  Union Junior College and Auburn University, as well as GED classes at  the local jail. Later, he established The Bennie Adkins Foundation,  which to date has provided about 50 educational scholarships to  noncommissioned Special Forces officers.   Bennie's dedication to the service of his country and to his fellow  Americans never waned. For many years he traveled extensively, in what  he described as his fourth career, ``trying to instill patriotism in  our young people.'' And according to President Obama in 2014, ``the  first thing you need to know is when Bennie and I met in the Oval  Office, he asked if he could sign back up. His lovely wife was not  amused.''   I know that for Bennie's family and his community, this is a loss  impossible to describe or to measure. My wife Louise joins me in  sending our sincerest condolences to Bennie's daughter Mary Ann Adkins  Blake (David), to his sons Michael Adkins (Christine), and Keith Adkins  (Jaime), and to his many grandchildren and great-grandchildren.   To paraphrase his Medal of Honor citation, Bennie Adkins'  extraordinary life reflects great credit upon himself, his family, and  his country. May he rest in peace, and may God bless the United States  of America.                            ____________________
