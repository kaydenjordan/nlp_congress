 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1  minute in morning business.    Mr. President, I want to speak about a Native American  tradition in the State of Iowa. It is about the Meskwaki Nation--the  only federally recognized Tribe in Iowa.   This year, many important annual community events have been canceled  due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Each year, the Meskwaki Powwow serves as  an opportunity to bring the Meskwaki Tribe together with fellow Iowans  to share, learn, and honor the Meskwakis' unique contributions to our  State. This gathering is important to preserving the Meskwakis'  heritage and sharing it with the next generation.   In light of the cancellation, the Meskwakis are posting a number of  educational resources on their Facebook page, at Meskwaki Nation, to  honor the Meskwaki Annual Powwow week. I encourage Iowans to visit and  learn.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, every day we can see that this public  health crisis is also an economic crisis. During the shutdowns, some  employers shuttered completely, and others were forced to lay off  workers. Tens of millions of jobs were saved thanks to the Paycheck  Protection Program and other CARES Act provisions, but millions of  other Americans lost their jobs and remain unemployed.   While job numbers have improved since the more dire days of March and  April, there are still many Americans facing unemployment. Talks are  continuing to determine how best to modify and extend a Federal  supplement to State unemployment insurance programs, but those talks  are going miserably slowly.   These State programs and the extra Federal aid have been important  safety nets for folks who have lost their income, but they are only a  piece of what we can and should do and what a bill before the U.S.  Senate lays out. It is called the HEALS Act, put forth by our leader.   As the leader said yesterday, we know that these programs shouldn't  pay someone more to stay home than essential workers are making by  working hard. We also know that most people would prefer to have a  reliable job and avoid layoff entirely. That is why Republicans, as  part of the HEALS Act, have put forward several additional proposals to  help already unemployed Americans and prevent others  [[Page S5234]]  from getting laid off in the first place. That is why these talks ought  to speed up, so we can get some of these other things in place as well  as the unemployment issues that we are talking about.   We extend and significantly expand the employee retention tax credit  that was included in the CARES Act so that employers can keep more  people on the payroll instead of laying them off. It supports  businesses that hire more workers as the economy continues to improve.   We expand the work opportunity tax credit to support employers who  are helping those currently receiving unemployment insurance find a  new, safe, and steady job. Bringing in new employees and expanding the  workforce can be complicated, especially in times of a pandemic. Both  employers and employees want to maintain safe working environments. It  is important for employers to have the resources to keep their  workplaces clean and their employees protected. Republicans then  proposed a new tax credit for these expenses, like additional cleaning  expenses, personal protective gear, and even office reconfigurations  that keep employees and customers safe.   The HEALS Act also provides for another round of economic impact  payments. An average family of four would receive $3,400 to help cover  expenses. These payments will help any family or any individual who has  had to deal with layoffs and are in addition to any unemployment  benefits they may receive.   These tax provisions serve as a complement to the unemployment  insurance program that is being negotiated right now, with no evidence  of progress. There ought to be progress. These programs do set up an  extra layer of protection for workers and those already out of work.   Together, these proposals provide a responsible approach to help  employers reopen businesses so that employees can safely and  effectively return to work to continue fueling the Nation's economic  recovery.   Why can't we get these important issues resolved for the American  people, particularly for the American people who are hurting? And they  are hurting because we were faced with a virus pandemic. As a result of  the virus pandemic, the government, for the first time in 240 years,  shut down the economy of the United States, and then immediately, in  the middle of March, after that happened, we made a point of passing  the CARES Act to open up the economy, to give people confidence that  what the government did that was bad for the economy and for people and  hurting people, unemployed--that we were going to take a lead in  getting them back. And we are still in this situation. We shouldn't be  debating as long as we are to get these issues taken care of.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I am here to join my colleague from  Iowa, Senator Ernst, in this effort.   We ought to get this unanimous consent request accomplished, and we  ought to get this bill passed because it is unjustified that we don't  get the cooperation that it takes to keep a person who has committed a  felony from the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States.   I joined Senator Ernst in reintroducing Sarah's Law on January 31 of  last year, and that was the third anniversary of Sarah Root's death.  Sarah was from Council Bluffs, IA, and as my  [[Page S5235]]  colleague said, Sarah was tragically killed in Omaha, NE, on the very  night of her graduation. An illegal alien struck and killed her while  he was driving drunk. He was three times over the legal limit of the  amount of alcohol you can have in your blood to be a safe driver.   It is a travesty that the previous administration refused to take  Sarah's killer into custody. He was not considered a priority. Can you  imagine that? Her killer then disappeared. Obviously, being a smart  person who is in violation of the law, he is not going to be seen. So  he remains at large. I have said before that Sarah's senseless death is  a tragic reminder of the serious improvements that we need in border  security and in interior immigration enforcement in our United States  of America.   It is outrageous that many innocent Americans have been seriously  injured and, in some cases, killed as a result of the actions of  criminal illegal aliens.   It is even more outrageous that criminal illegal aliens, like the one  who killed Sarah Root, are not subject to mandatory immigration  detention. Sarah's Law would amend the Immigration and Nationality Act  to require the mandatory detention of an illegal alien who is charged  with a crime resulting in the death or serious bodily injury of another  person.   This bill is common sense. A lot of times, common sense doesn't  prevail in Washington, DC, and the long time to get this very important  legislation passed is evidence of the lack of common sense. This bill  is long overdue.   I am proud to be a cosponsor of the bill and to support Senator  Ernst's unanimous consent request. I gladly thank her for her  leadership in this area.   I yield the floor
