 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to oppose the inclusion of  $1.6 billion that would be a waste of taxpayer money on this useless  wall. The funds will go towards an unnecessary wall along the Southern  border. This wall that the President promised voters that Mexico would  pay for is now being put on the taxpayers' backs.   $1.6 billion can be used for better things. It can pay for thousands  of jobs in the U.S. and workforce development programs and  apprenticeships.   And one other thing: agents protecting our border don't even want it.  They do not see themselves as defenders of a wall.   Mr. President, please come back to reality. This is not ``Game of  Thrones.''   This administration needs to stop demonizing people outside of our  borders. We need to fix our immigration system, and we can do it in a  humane and pragmatic and effective way, and in a way that will  supercharge our economy and actually create American jobs.
