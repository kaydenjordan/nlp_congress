 Today, I rise for Dr. Erica of New York. This is her  story.   Dr. Erica's patient was raped by an unknown assailant. The patient's  emotions surrounding the pregnancy were extremely complex. She  desperately wanted to have a child but felt guilt, shame, and isolation  after being raped.   She ultimately decided to continue the pregnancy. She believed it  would help her grieve and grasp onto something positive after such a  traumatic experience.   But then the patient went in for a scan at 20 weeks and was  devastated to learn that the fetus had multiple lethal anomalies. This  patient had to face yet another agonizing decision. Ultimately, she  decided to end the pregnancy.   Thankfully, Dr. Erica was able to help this patient through the most  difficult time in her life. I want to share her words: ``As a  physician, it is my job to guide the patient through the risks,  benefits, and alternatives of all options available to her. It is not  my job to place judgment on patients that only serve to punish women  who are already suffering, and it certainly is not the job of the  legislature to interfere with the patient-physician relationship.''   On behalf of Dr. Erica and the women she helps, I urge my colleagues  to vote ``no.'' We must support every woman's right to make  reproduction choices for herself.
