 Mr. President, today the Senate voted on the  nomination of Steve Dettelbach to be the Director of the Bureau of  Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives--ATF. I commend President  Biden for nominating Steve, who I know will excel as ATF Director at a  time when enforcement of our country's gun laws is so critical.   As gun violence continues to plague our country and as mass shootings  become more and more common, it is  [[Page S3236]]  hard not to feel paralyzed by the endless tragedy. But we must take  action. I am proud to reflect on this body's efforts to pass the  Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, which was signed into law by  President Biden last month.   But we must do more, and we must continue to do all that we can to  prevent these senseless tragedies from occurring in the first place.  That is why this confirmation vote today was so crucial. The ATF is  charged with enforcing our Nation's gun laws, but the Agency has been  without a Senate-confirmed Director since 2015. How can that be? In a  time when firearms have become the leading cause of death among  children in our country, how can we expect the ATF to fully function  without a permanent Director? Finally, thankfully, that changes today.   I know Steve personally, and I can attest not only to his strong work  ethic, but to his extraordinary set of skills and professional  experiences that will no doubt serve him well as ATF Director. Steve  served on my Judiciary Committee staff as a detailee from the  Department of Justice, a role requiring time-sensitive evaluations of a  wide range of issues relating to criminal justice and law enforcement.  I am grateful for his wise counsel during his 2 years on my staff, and  I have taken a great deal of personal pride in observing all of his  achievements and leadership roles he has held since that time.   Steve has spent more than two decades as a prosecutor within the  Justice Department, and was confirmed unanimously by the Senate to  serve as U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Ohio, a position he  held from 2009 to 2016. Over the course of his 30-year career, Steve  has demonstrated that he is a dedicated, principled, law enforcement  official who is highly qualified to take on this position. With the  passage of the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, the Congress proved  that it is not so paralyzed that it cannot take reasonable--rational-- steps to confront the scourge of gun violence. The Senate can further  prove that today by confirming Steve Dettelbach to lead the ATF. There  could be no one more qualified for this position.   I regret that personal matters kept me from casting my vote in favor  of Steve's confirmation today, but my enthusiastic support for his  confirmation remains steadfast. I look forward to continuing that  support by doing all that I can to ensure that Steve and the ATF have  the resources they need to enforce our Nation's gun laws and protect  our communities.   It is no easy task, but I know Steve is ready. And I stand ready to  support him, and I urge all other Senators to do the same  today.                            ____________________
