 Madam President, I rise supporting my colleague's  proposal.   This proposal provides disaster supplemental assistance relief for  Southwest and Southeast Louisiana; it extends the National Flood  Insurance Program; it funds the government; and it restores funding for  Israel's Iron Dome.   We are 3 days away from a government shutdown for one reason:  Democrats control Washington.   A clean vote on disaster relief and a continuing resolution to fund  the government--legislation filed by Senators McConnell and Shelby-- passes today with overwhelming bipartisan support. We know that. But my  Democratic colleagues are holding this critical funding set not just to  fund the government but funding set to benefit victims of disasters in  my State and elsewhere hostage to fund their planned tax-and-spend  extravaganza.   Disaster victims need disaster relief. It is 1 month since Hurricane  Ida, 6 months from unprecedented ice storms, 12 months since Hurricanes  Laura and Delta wreaked havoc on Southwest Louisiana. Disaster  assistance is long overdue. This bill gets it done.   And while we are recovering from 2-years' worth of storms, we can't  allow the National Flood Insurance Program to expire. Many  policyholders, especially in Louisiana, are still recovering from  hurricane damage. Government shouldn't pull the rug of insurance from  beneath them. It is critical the program is extended so homeowners are  covered if there is another storm. This proposal extends NFIP. It also  provides disaster relief.   The proposal is good for Louisiana. It is good for the country. I  urge my colleagues to support this proposal.   With that, I yield.
