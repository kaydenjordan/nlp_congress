 Mr. President, I have on a red sweater this morning in  the hopes that Christmas is not too far away for all of us, including  the Members of Congress. With that in mind, let me give everyone an  update on where we are.   Yesterday, the Democratic leader and I reached a procedural agreement  to create space for ongoing negotiations over government funding. To  provide flexibility as the White House and Senate Democrats continue  their discussions, the Senate already officially proceeded to the  House-passed funding legislation--so that is pending--but we did so  with an understanding that no further votes will occur until the  President and Senate Democrats have reached an agreement to resolve  this.   Let me say that again. We pushed the pause button until the  President, from whom we will need a signature, and Senate Democrats,  from whom we will need votes, reach an agreement--no procedural votes,  no test votes, just a meaningful vote on a bipartisan agreement  whenever that is reached, and it is my hope that it is reached sooner  rather than later.   It is no mystery why securing our Nation's borders is such a major  priority for Republicans here in the Senate and Republicans over in the  House and for President Trump. Any look at the plain facts leads to one  simple conclusion: The crisis of security at our southern border is  real.   Over the past year, Customs and Border Protection's records of  apprehensions and interdictions at our southern border are literally  staggering--800 known gang members, a 50-percent increase over last  year, nearly 7,000 individuals with criminal histories, including  weapons trafficking and violent offenses, more than double the levels  of fentanyl, along with other illicit substances.   So the report card is quite clear. America's borders are in crisis.  These facts I have stated are not partisan facts. They aren't  ideological. They are just facts--just facts. They don't describe the  Republican Party's version of events or the President's version of  events. They describe reality.   So one would think that securing our homeland, controlling our  borders, and protecting the American people would be bipartisan  priorities--uncontroversial, commonsense, bipartisan priorities--a core  duty of any nation's government.   And here is the interesting thing. Until very, very recently, that  seemed to be the case. Back in 2006, Democrats were perfectly happy to  support hundreds--hundreds--of miles of physical barriers along the  border. Twenty-six Democrats voted for the bill, including then-Senator  Obama and then-Senator Clinton and my good friend the current  Democratic leader from New York, but what about more recently? Earlier  this very year--this year, Mr. President--the Democratic leader offered  $25 billion for physical barriers in his negotiations with the  President, which is five times as much as the White House is reasonably  requesting right now. That was just earlier this year.   Republicans in the House and in the Senate believe the House's  provision for $5 billion in border funding plus additional disaster  funding were completely reasonable. I was glad to vote  [[Page S8022]]  to advance that legislation yesterday. My colleagues and I are proud to  stand with the American people on this subject for the safety of  American families and the health and security of our communities, but  this time--this time--Democrats have rejected that reasonable request.  They have refused to meet President Trump half way and provide even  one-fifth of the resources for the border they were willing to provide  just a few months ago.   There is no bright line of principle that separates hundreds of miles  of physical barriers in 2006 from new physical barriers in 2018. There  is no major philosophical shift that made $25 billion for border  security worthwhile just a few months ago but makes a far more modest  investment of $5 billion immoral and unacceptable today.   No, Democrats haven't rejected the President's request and invited  this partial government shutdown because of some principled objections  they just discovered in the last few weeks. It is not some principled  discovery they just made in the last few weeks. They brought this about  because they are under a lot of pressure--we all know this--from their  far left and feel compelled to disagree with the President on almost  anything and certainly this.   So that is where we are, but we don't need to be here for long. In  order to get us out of this mess, a negotiated solution will need to  check these boxes. It is really very simple. It will need the support  of 60 Senators, which will obviously include a number of Democrats. It  will need to pass the House. And it will need a Presidential signature.  That is how we make a law in this situation. Sixty 60 votes in the  Senate, a majority of the House, and President Trump's signature are  what is needed. That is what will end this regrettable episode, reopen  the lapsed portions of the Federal Government, and produce the  investment in border security that our Nation really needs.   So I am glad that productive discussions are continuing at this hour  between my friend the Democratic leader, the Democratic leader in the  House, and the White House. When those negotiations produce a solution  that is acceptable to all of those parties, it will receive a vote here  on the Senate floor.                            ____________________     I suggest the absence of a quorum.
