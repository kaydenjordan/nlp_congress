 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Senate proceed to legislative session for a period of morning business,  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Madam President, I come to the floor today having just  spent Thanksgiving Day with our troops serving in Afghanistan. It was  an incredible honor to join President Trump in a surprise visit to the  soldiers stationed at Bagram Air Force Base. We served Thanksgiving  dinner to our dedicated servicemembers. Those are the individuals who  serve us every day. Our troops were absolutely thrilled to receive the  thanks of our grateful Nation directly delivered from the Commander in  Chief. They know President Trump has their back.   The photo shows a number of members of the Wyoming National Guard,  the 2-300th, the Cowboy Calvary. My  [[Page S6844]]  father-in-law, Bob Brown from Thermopolis, WY, was a member of this  group when he served in Korea.   It was such a privilege to introduce the President to some of my home  State's Wyoming National Guard members. He actually had two of them up  on the stage with him. They are doing a tremendous job on behalf of  Wyoming's largest deployment overseas right now in about a decade. We  told all of our servicemembers how grateful the Nation is for their  service and their sacrifice and their dedication.   Meanwhile, here in Washington, the Democrats continue to block the  bills that we need to have passed to keep our Nation secure.  Incredibly, they are blocking both the Defense authorization and the  Defense funding bills. The whole funding of our national defense  expires in 2 weeks, but still the Democrats continue to waste time-- precious legislative time--on their partisan, obsessive approach to  impeachment.   Their holiday season impeachment is hurting the American people, and  especially, it is hurting our military. The defense funding measure  includes a well-earned and well-deserved pay raise for the troops. The  President told the troops about that on Thanksgiving evening after  serving dinner and after eating with them. It makes you wonder why on  Earth Democrats would block the pay raise right before Christmas. It is  amazing. They seem to be blocking all of the things that need to be  done for our country to move ahead. The truth is, they are so focused  on giftwrapping an impeachment process for the far left that they have  left the rest of us in this country out in the cold.   Besides that, they are slow-walking so many of the pro-worker and  pro-farmer USMCA trade deals that are so critical for our Nation. It  certainly means a lot for the breadbasket of America. It means so much  for us in the Rocky Mountain West. They are preventing us from lowering  drug costs.   Above all, people expect us to support our troops. One thing after  another after another, the Democrats continue to obstruct. The  Republicans are fighting to fully fund the military.   Democrats are in the process of waging war against the Commander in  Chief. Remember, both parties came to the table, and they completed a  bipartisan budget deal this past summer. The Democrats went back on  their word. In doing so, they broke faith with the troops and with all  Americans. Democrats--they filibuster, they impeach, and they neglect  the troops.   Really, they are hurting the American people, not the President. The  President is busy doing his job. This week, he attended NATO's 70th  anniversary summit and is also meeting with the U.N. Security Council  members. U.S. forces, meanwhile, are facing heightened threats with  last year's funding levels.   While necessary, the stopgap spending resolution we have right now is  taking a toll on the military, and here is why. The short-term funding  means that a $22 billion cut has occurred from the summer's bipartisan  budget deal. It is harming military readiness. It is harming the  training of our troops. It has delayed and suspended weapons systems  and programs. Now, that hasn't stopped the House Democrats and the  Senate Democrats from blocking the full-year defense measures. They  continue to obstruct.   Republicans need Democratic support to pass these bills. These need  to be bipartisan bills. The National Defense Authorization Act has a  long history of strong bipartisan support. Yet House Democrats continue  to delay final passage.   Let's not forget, our troops in harm's way are far away from home  this holiday season. They are on the frontlines. They are defending our  freedoms. They sacrifice 365 days a year. They do it to protect our  Nation. U.S. servicemembers never complain and never quit, and  Republicans won't quit supporting them.   Democrats remain too obsessed with impeachment to finish important  business. The question is, Why are Democrats fast-tracking impeachment  and filibustering defense legislation? Their partisan impeachment  production is choreographed down to the final curtain call. It is  simply a costly, chaotic waste of time. I believe most Americans know  it. That is certainly what I hear in Wyoming.   Democrats turn out to be the party of no--no positive ideas, no  positive vision, no positive agenda for America. All they want to do is  focus on impeachment. Some ran on it, and others didn't. Whether or not  they ran on it, that is what they are doing, and they are neglecting  the American people and the wishes and desires of American families for  jobs; for a strong and healthy economy, a growing economy; for  infrastructure, roads and bridges; for all of the things that are  important; for lowering the cost of medical care and lowering the cost  of drugs. They are ignoring it all, and certainly they are ignoring  national security.   It is time for the Democrats to stop stonewalling. It is time to pass  the Defense bills. It is time to give our troops the raise they have  earned and deserve. Let's send the right message to our troops as well  as to our adversaries. It is time to pass these Defense bills now.                            ____________________     Madam President, I also come to the floor today to talk  about another issue, and that is that there is a climate conference  meeting right now in Europe, the United Nations climate conference.  Earlier this week, House Speaker Pelosi and 14 other Democrats traveled  to Europe for the conference. To me, they went there to undermine the  President and to push their radical Green New Deal.   They told the international group that the United States is committed  to the Paris climate deal. That is just not true. Secretary of State  Pompeo said that the Paris climate deal imposed an unfair economic  burden on American workers, on American businesses, and on American  taxpayers. President Trump began formally withdrawing from the Paris  climate deal last month.   It may appeal to Democrats' liberal elite to talk about climate in  Europe. Republicans, however, are going to stay focused on the work  ahead of us at home. We have a packed year-end agenda here in Congress.  Americans expect us to continue the progress we have made on jobs and  on the economy--incredible success. This means passing better trade  deals, funding the government, improving our roads--the things we were  elected to do. The Speaker is nowhere to be found--certainly not on  this continent. Rather than pass American priorities, the Speaker is  sidelined in Spain.   Republican pro-growth policies have led to a worker boom. Wages are  up, and unemployment is down. Wages are up to a 50-year high.  Unemployment is down to a 50-year low. I mean, think about that. As a  result of Republican tax cuts and regulatory relief and unleashing the  American energy, right now, today, we have the lowest African-American  unemployment in history. People have more take-home pay, more money in  their pockets, and costs are lower because of the regulatory relief.  And we have seen this with shopping over the Thanksgiving weekend in  terms of people feeling that confidence in the economy and in their  futures.   Democrats' message is more regulation and higher costs, which lead to  fewer jobs. It is not going to work at home, and it is certainly not  going to work in Wyoming. Maybe they think it will work in Europe.   But just to clear up any confusion, President Trump has gotten us out  of the Paris Agreement. Republicans' pro-growth agenda has us producing  and exporting more energy at home, and we are seeing millions of new  jobs.   Republicans are going to stay clear-eyed and focused on the economy.  We are going to continue to deliver real results, tangible results,  results that people can understand and see and hold on to. We need to  do that for the people who elected us, and we will continue to do it.   I yield the floor.
