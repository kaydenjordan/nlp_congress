 Madam Speaker, I keep hearing from my Republican  friends about work requirements, work requirements, work requirements.   Speaker McCarthy said--get this--people are getting paid to sit at  home on the couch. Okay. Let's talk about work requirements.   I have good news for my GOP friends. In 1996, you all demanded the  work requirements that are still in place today.  [[Page H2511]]    Now, maybe if Speaker McCarthy weren't so busy auctioning off his  used Chapstick for $100,000, he would know working families in this  country are struggling and need help.   Maybe if he weren't so busy giving speeches to Wall Street bankers,  he would know most people on food assistance are children, seniors, and  people with disabilities.   Maybe if he spoke to an able-bodied adult on food assistance, he  would know they aren't sitting on the couch. They are out working. They  just make so little, they qualify for a measly $6-a-day benefit they  use to buy food.    Republicans are going after food assistance so they can give another  tax break to billionaires. It is a disgrace. It is a shame.   Speaker McCarthy should try living on SNAP for a week before screwing  over poor people.                            ____________________
