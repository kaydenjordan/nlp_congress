 Mr. Speaker, the House will not be in session on July  6, so I am taking a moment now to commemorate the 6 months since the  attack on our democracy. It happened right here at the United States  Capitol. Right here outside these doors where we are standing today.   I thank the U.S. Capitol Police, the D.C. Metropolitan Police, the  National Guard, and all the Federal police agencies that responded on  January 6, 2021.   Six months later we have not forgotten your bravery, we have not  forgotten your sacrifice, and we thank you.                            ____________________
