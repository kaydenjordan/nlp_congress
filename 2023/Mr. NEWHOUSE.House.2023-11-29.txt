 Mr. Chair, the Biden administration has failed to  secure our border and has allowed historic levels of illegal migrant  crossings. Now, they have decided to house migrants on America's public  lands. This is simply unacceptable.   Our national parks should serve as areas of recreation for Americans  to enjoy. Instead, our lands are being used as a backup plan for  housing migrants because of a failure to secure the border and a  refusal to work with Congress to find commonsense solutions.   As chairman of the Western Caucus and as a member of the Homeland  Security Subcommittee on Appropriations, I am proud to support this  legislation to ensure America's public lands serve the American people,  their interests, and to prevent the misuse of our national parks.
