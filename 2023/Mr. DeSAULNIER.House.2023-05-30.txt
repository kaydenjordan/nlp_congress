 Mr. Speaker, I regret that I was unable to vote  today, as I was unavoidably detained. Had I been present, I would have  voted ``yea'' on rollcall No. 238, H.R. 2792; ``yea'' on rollcall No.  239, H.R. 2795; and ``yea'' on rollcall No. 240, H.R. 2796.                             PERSONAL EXPLANATION
