 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize  Westlake, Ohio, resident Colonel Guion ``Guy'' Bluford, who received  the Ohio Distinguished Service Medal last week.   Guy became the first African American astronaut to travel into space  in 1983. He earned the Ohio Distinguished Service Medal, the highest  noncombat decoration for service awarded by the State, for his  commitment and dedication throughout his historic career in aviation.   Before joining NASA, Bluford flew over 144 combat missions with the  United States Air Force in South Vietnam. He later went on to earn his  master's and doctorate degree with aerospace engineering at the Air  Force Institute of Technology at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in  Dayton, Ohio.   We are proud and eternally grateful for Bluford's military service  and dedication to space exploration. As NASA looks to expand mankind's  horizons in space, his life achievements and aviation accomplishments  serve as an inspiration to future generations.                            ____________________
