 Mr. Speaker, let me first thank the gentlewoman from the  Virgin Islands, who has demonstrated great leadership in leading these  CBC Special Order hours. It is not an easy task, but she has done  remarkable work in terms of finding topics that are important to our  communities and our Nation.  [[Page H6203]]    As the gentlewoman stated, Mr. Speaker, this month we marked 6 months  of the Trump Presidency and 6 months of congressional Republican  inaction.   Republicans made promise after promise to the American people. The  President called himself the ultimate dealmaker. I wonder if we are  witnessing the first Manchurian President. Instead of the promise of  jobs, infrastructure, and a new and improved healthcare plan, we get  chaos and seemingly never-ending controversies.   Where is the Republican agenda? Where are their accomplishments?  Where are all those wins?   Let's take a look at the numbers. President Trump has a job approval  rating of 36 percent, the lowest of any President ever at this point in  their Presidency. Republicans can point to zero legislative  accomplishments. The President has no plan to lower healthcare costs,  no jobs bills, no infrastructure bills, no tax reform, and no clean  budget. These simply are the facts.   Instead of doing what is right for the American people, it appears  that Republicans are more occupied with taking away healthcare from  millions of our constituents to give tax cuts to the wealthy, or  defending the administration's most recent controversy.    This week, we will vote on a dishonest security spending package that  will force American taxpayers to pay for the President's border wall.  Who is going to pay for it? It looks like the American people.   During his campaign and the rhetoric that we heard up until this  point, Mexico was going to pay for the wall. Now, here we are, with our  Republican colleagues supporting an effort that says that the American  people will pay for the wall. Well, we will get the money from Mexico  later. Yeah, all right.   As a member of the Homeland Security Committee, I am alarmed by  President Trump's and the congressional Republicans' determination to  further break down our alliances and ignorance of matters related to  the security of this Nation.   Instead of funding the border wall, we should focus on building  strong transportation and infrastructure systems that will create good- paying jobs and lay a foundation for a strong economy. Instead, we are  weakening America. Let's build America with a strong infrastructure  bill and adequate training and apprenticeship programs that will  benefit our constituents.   Make it in America is something I heard last week, which sounds  magnificent, if we could do it. But if you are going to be the leader  of this country and make such pronouncements, you have to live by what  you are talking about.   Make it in America is to strive to make sure that we do everything in  America. We hear of two buildings Trump erected in Chicago that used  Chinese steel or steel from outside the United States. If you look at  his ties, his shirts, his suits, the soap in his hotels, nothing is  made in America. Who are we trying to kid with this? There is nothing.   Maybe his daughter. Well, no, her shoes aren't made in America. Her  dresses are not made in America. Who are we kidding? Who are we  fooling?   The American people have to open their eyes and see the sham that is  going on. How this President says one thing and does absolutely the  opposite is an atrocity. Make it in America? He stood up there in front  of the American people and said that, with the suit, shirt, and tie  that he had on? Absolutely unconscionable.   Where are the jobs? I am going to be the best job creator you have  ever seen. When? You are going to win so much, you are going to get  tired of winning. When? The American people deserve better.   The American people deserve better than a Congress that cares more  about pushing an agenda that puts wealthcare in front of healthcare.  The American people deserve better than a Congress that will pass  legislation that will harm our environment, contaminate our air, and  pollute our waterways.   The American people deserve better than a Congress that continues to  ignore important issues that disproportionately affect African-American  communities, such as criminal justice reform, gun violence prevention,  and voting rights.   While this administration and congressional Republicans turn their  backs on the American workers, we will continue to demand real action  to create jobs, raise wages, and create a brighter future for American  families.    Will the gentlewoman yield?    Will the gentlewoman yield?    Will the gentlewoman yield?    Will the gentlewoman yield?    Will the gentlewoman yield?    Will the gentlewoman yield?    Will the gentlewoman yield?    Will the gentlewoman yield?    Will the gentlewoman yield?    Will the gentlewoman yield?    Will the gentlewoman yield?    Will the gentlewoman yield?    Mr. Speaker, to the gentlewoman's point, I believe there  was a document that was created to give to the President on those  issues, and we are still waiting to hear back from the administration  in reference to anything that was in that document.   We don't need photo ops. We don't need to go to the White House and  be trucked up there and lollygag and use us for whatever they deem  proper for them. We need help for the American people. We need an  administration that is going to look at these issues, be serious about  them, and continue to move this country forward, as it was in the  previous 8 years.                                time  2000
