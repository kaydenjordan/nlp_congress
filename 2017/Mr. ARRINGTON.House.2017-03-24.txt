 Mr. Speaker, ObamaCare's disastrous effects over the  last several years have wreaked havoc on our small businesses, broken  the backs of middle and working class families, and have had a  disproportionately negative impact on rural America. Those are the  folks who I represent in west Texas.   While the current bill before us is far from perfect--and let's be  honest, there is no such thing as perfect legislation--it reverses  course and takes us in the right direction. It repeals the mandates and  restores freedom to individuals and markets.   It repeals about $1 trillion of taxes. It reduces deficit spending by  over $100 billion, making it the largest entitlement reform since the  1960s. It rolls back regulations, gives maximum flexibility to States,  and begins to defederalize health care.   For 7 years now, Republicans have promised the American people that  if we were given control of the Presidency and the House and the  Senate, then we would repeal and replace ObamaCare. And now that we are  given the opportunity to govern and to keep our promises and to deliver  results for the American people, we can't let perfect be the enemy of  good.   The debate is now closing. We have two choices. We either pass a good  but imperfect bill, or we leave ObamaCare in place. That is an  unacceptable alternative.   As leaders, we have a moral obligation to do something, to not stand  idly by while the people suffer under a system that is failing them.   If we are going to restore the greatness of America and transfer  power back to the people, we need more than policy solutions, even  perfect policy solutions. We need the political will and the courage to  lead.   This is a rescue mission, Mr. Speaker, and it isn't without risk; but  I have faith in the President and his team. I have faith in our States  and the free markets, and, above all, Mr. Speaker, I have faith in the  American people.
