 Madam Speaker, today is a solemn day in  America, a day that none of us hoped for when we came to Congress, but  the events of today are something that each of us swore that we were  prepared to execute in defense of the Constitution of the United States  against all enemies, foreign and domestic.    This is the oath that binds the men and women of the 116th Congress,  as our democracy implores we defend her.   A clear and present threat to American democracy is what brings us  here. The architect, a President who asked that a foreign nation  interfere in our election: this was our Founding Fathers' greatest  fear.   I cast this solemn vote for the many individuals in my district who  entrusted me to be their voice in Congress. They entrusted me to uphold  our Constitution for them.   I vote ``yes'' for Sarah in Chicago, Doug in Kankakee, Diane in  Flossmoor; ``yes'' for Kathy in Momence, Kathryn in Crete, and Jimmy in  Park Forest.   The facts are simple. The path forward is clear. Impeachment is not  an option, it is an obligation, because no one is above the law.
