 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to welcome my constituent,  Hector Barajas, home. Mr. Barajas enlisted in the Army in 1995, served  nobly for 6 years, and was honorably discharged in 2001.   Hector was not a U.S. citizen. Despite being a veteran, he was  deported in 2002 and separated from his family, despite his years of  service and sacrifice for our country.   Soon after his deportation, Mr. Barajas became a leader and role  model for other deported veterans, establishing a safe house in  Tijuana, Mexico, called the Deported Veterans Support House, or ``The  Bunker,'' as they like to call it.   Meanwhile, he continued to pursue his dream of returning legally to  the United States and becoming a U.S. citizen. His dream has finally  come true. On April 13, Mr. Barajas will return to Compton, California,  as a United States citizen. Upon his return, let's work together to  bring home our veterans.   Welcome home, Hector, and thank you for your service.                            ____________________
