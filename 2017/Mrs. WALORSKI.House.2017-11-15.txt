 Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for all of his  work.   Madam Speaker, I can't tell you how grateful I am to cast a vote to  move our Tax Code one step closer to its first overhaul in 31 years.   We know the Tax Code is broken. The American people know the Tax Code  is broken. They are reminded every time they look at their paycheck.  The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will deliver progrowth tax reform to the  families, farmers, manufacturers, and workers in my district.  [[Page H9354]]    For families, we are delivering tax cuts so that hardworking Hoosiers  can keep more of their hard-earned money. We are enhancing the child  tax credit, preserving the Adoption tax credit, encouraging retirement  savings, and streamlining 15 different education tax incentives.   We are delivering a Tax Code so simple that most Americans can file  taxes on a postcard. In my district, 80 percent of filers already take  the standard deduction. They will be able to keep even more of their  money, because the standard deduction is doubled, and most itemizers  will now be able to save time, money, and stress by taking the double  standard deduction instead.   No one is ever excited to file their taxes, but I am all for a  simpler, quicker process that makes it much more pain-free.   H.R. 1 helps job creators grow. Small businesses get a lower rate and  more simplicity. Family businesses passed down for generations won't  have to worry about the estate tax anymore, and America will be a more  attractive place to do business.   Our antiquated Tax Code keeps investment in jobs out. This bill  incentivizes companies to bring profits back, to locate facilities  here, and to grow American jobs and raise wages.   Madam Speaker, I was so proud to vote for this bill in the Ways and  Means Committee, and I am proud to be a part of this House that is  delivering yet another crucial step toward tax cuts, simplicity, and  fairness.   Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this bill.
