 Mr. President, I want to bring to the attention of all  Senators the winners of the 2018 Goldman Environmental Prize, the  world's largest and most prestigious award for grassroots environmental  activism.   Richard N. Goldman, 1920-2010, and his wife Rhoda H. Goldman, 1924- 1996, established the prize in 1989. They had devoted much of their  lives to environmental protection, and they conceived of the prize in  order to recognize ordinary individuals working at the grassroots level  who protect and enhance the Earth's environment.   As the Goldman Prize website states, ``It views `grassroots' leaders  as those involved in local efforts, where positive change is created  through community or citizen participation in the issues that affect  them. Through recognizing these individual leaders, the Prize seeks to  inspire other ordinary people to take extraordinary actions to protect  the natural world.'' The award ceremony, held annually in both San  Francisco and Washington, DC, is one of the year's most inspiring  events.   Since Richard and Rhoda Goldman passed away, their three children  have continued the prize. In doing so, they have honored courageous  individuals from Africa, Asia, Europe, islands and island nations,  North America, and South and Central America who have struggled for  years, often against overwhelming odds, to protect endangered  ecosystems and species, combat destructive development projects,  promote sustainable environmental and energy policies, and obtain  environmental justice.   Recipients of the prize are often from isolated rural communities or  impoverished urban neighborhoods who have in common a lack of prior  experience in activism, politics, or the law, but what they also share  is that, when the forests, farmland, water, and air that their  children, families, and communities depend on for their health and  survival were faced with potentially existential threats, they took  great personal risks to challenge those responsible, whether private  industry, criminal networks, governments, or a combination of all  three.   Their struggles, beginning with one or a handful of concerned  individuals, grew to encompass whole communities and in some instances  ignited national movements. What first seemed like tilting at windmills  was eventually, through dogged and brave perseverance, shown to be  possible, often after exposing lies, unbridled greed, and corruption on  the part of large corporations and their accomplices at the highest  levels of government.   By doing so, they have reminded us of the grave perils our planet  faces today, that a single individual--regardless of his or her station  in life--when moved to act can transform cynicism and despair into  activism and change and that each of us has a responsibility to follow  their example.   This year's prize winners, who deserve our admiration and thanks, are  as follows: Europe, Claire Nouvian of France; South and Central  America, Francia Marquez of Colombia; islands and island nations, Manny  Calonzo of the Philippines; Africa, Makoma Lekalakala and Liz McDaid of  South Africa; Asia, Khanh Nguy Thi of Vietnam; and North America,  LeeAnne Walters of Flint, MI.   I urge all Senators to go to the Goldman Environmental Prize website  and read the inspiring stories of these extraordinary, ordinary  individuals. The people of their countries are rightfully proud of them  and grateful for what they have done to protect the health of their  communities and of future generations. Their governments should  likewise afford them the respect and recognition they deserve.   I commend the Goldman siblings for carrying on their parents'  generous legacy and educating all of us about these role models for the  world.                            ____________________
