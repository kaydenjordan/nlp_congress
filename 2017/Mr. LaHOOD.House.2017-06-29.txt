 Mr. Speaker, on January 29, 2017, U.S. Navy Chief Special  Warfare Operator William ``Ryan'' Owens was killed during a raid in  Yemen. At the age of 36, he gave the ultimate sacrifice in order to  protect our great Nation. He is survived by his wife and three young  children.   This week I introduced a bill which would rename the Chillicothe,  Illinois, post office in honor of Ryan's life and service as a Navy  SEAL. My office and I worked closely with the U.S. Postal Service, the  U.S. Navy Congressional Liaison Office, Central Illinois Gold Star  Families, and, most importantly, Ryan's family. All of us were  determined to make sure we got this right. His wife ultimately made the  decision to name the post office after Ryan in Chillicothe, a town in  my district, where Ryan graduated high school.   This effort has the backing and bipartisan support of the entire  Illinois delegation, and it is our hope that the post office will  forever remind the community of their hometown hero and his commitment  to serving our country.   While we can never fully repay Chief Owens and his family for the  sacrifices he made, renaming the post office in his honor is a small  effort to thank him for his service and his dedication to protecting  America.   He and his family are forever in our hearts and prayers.                            ____________________
