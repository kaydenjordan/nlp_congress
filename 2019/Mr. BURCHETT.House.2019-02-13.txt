 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the career of  one of my district's most notable journalistic figures, Charlie Daniel.  He spent the last six decades as a political cartoonist in Knoxville  and retired this year.   He is a marine, like my brother-in-law, Cliff Worsham, and my father,  and he served his country admirably. His retirement is a loss to our  community.   I have never known a time when you couldn't open the Knoxville News  Sentinel to see Charlie's latest cartoon taking one politician or  another to task. Quite often, Mr. Speaker, it was me, because Charlie  and I didn't always get along or see eye to eye, and I have forgiven  him for his transgressions.   Mr. Speaker, he was and is one of the best. I have been made fun of  by people all over the world, but my friend Charlie is my favorite. His  cartoons were razor sharp while still being respectful.   Comic artists that I grew up looking at, like Steve Ditko, Frank  Frazetta, Neal Adams, and Joe Kubert, are probably more famous but  never were as creative as Charlie is. He is a Tennessee Journalism Hall  of Fame inductee and has been recognized by the National Cartoonists  Society.   Mr. Speaker, I am honored to call him my dear friend, and I know I  speak for many in east Tennessee when I say that the morning paper  isn't the same without him.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Indiana for  yielding to me.   I rise to join my colleagues in advocating for the unborn. This  country was founded to preserve our inalienable rights: life, liberty,  and the pursuit of happiness. Abortion, the murder of innocent  children, cannot coexist with our fundamental beliefs. Late-term  abortion is particularly brutal. It includes tearing limbs from bodies  and stopping beating hearts.   Only seven countries, including China and North Korea, have legalized  this practice. The United States, Mr. Speaker, should not be in that  same category as known human rights abusers.   Proponents of abortion claim pro-life policy is an attack on women's  rights, but doctors have determined late-term abortions, Mr. Speaker,  endanger the mother more than giving birth. The best way to protect  women's rights is to protect life.   I close with a little story. Before my mama left this Earth to meet  her savior, she was in and out of consciousness, Mr. Speaker. At one  point, she had talked to her father, who had passed away long before  her, and her brother, who had passed away in the Second World War, and  my daddy, who had gone before her just a couple years prior.    She was looking off into the corner, and I said: What are you looking  at, mama?   She said: Baby, I am looking at all those sweet little babies up  there.   Mr. Speaker, I firmly believe that my mother was looking at some  babies that had been murdered.   I urge my colleagues to stand with me to protect the unborn. By doing  so, we defend the inalienable rights of all Americans.
