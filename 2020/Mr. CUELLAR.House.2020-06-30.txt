 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Lipinski for yielding to  me.   Mr. Speaker, my amendment is very simple. What it does, it directs  funding for road crossings at international bridges.   An area like my hometown in Laredo, which is the largest inland port,  handles more trucks than any other place across the country, handles  more trains than any other place across the country. In fact, it is the  number one truck crossing and rail crossing in the country. In fact, 60  percent of all the trade between the U.S. and Mexico comes through one  port, and that is the Port of Laredo.   This grant money is going to be important to make sure that we help  fix those grade crossings at international crossings because, again,  when a train stops in the middle of a street for hours and hours and  hours, that creates traffic congestion. We have to make sure that we  allow trade to go through but at the same time not stop the people  going to school, work, or going on an emergency basis.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to pass this amendment and ask for  approval of this bill.
