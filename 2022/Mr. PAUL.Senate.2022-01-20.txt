 Mr. President, as ranking member of the Senate  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week, I  recognize an outstanding Kentucky small business that exemplifies the  American entrepreneurial spirit. This week, it is my privilege to  recognize the small business, Powell Valley Millwork of Clay City, KY,  as the Senate Small Business of the Week.   Twenty-seven years ago Jim Thornberry and his son Jimmy left the  mining industry behind in search of a new venture. Shortly thereafter,  Powell Valley Millwork was founded. The Thornberry's started their mill  with the desire to harvest a tangible product within a sustainable  industry, and that mission has stayed at the heart of their business  throughout their decades of growth and success.   The talent and substance of Powell Valley Millwork draws directly  from our State, with the mill focusing on only one species of lumber:  poplar. As  [[Page S381]]  the State tree of Kentucky, poplar is an abundant resource within  Appalachia, which makes their location in rural Clay City a prime spot  for their operation. Often referred to as ``the painter's wood,''  poplar is known for its clear grain, smooth milling, and paint-taking  qualities. The versatile and fine nature of the wood allows Powell  Valley Millwork to supply consumers with a wide variety of interior- trim products, such as stretcher bars, door and window jambs, stair  parts, cabinetry components, primed finger-joint interior trim, and  more. In creating all these products, the Powell Valley millworkers  make sure nothing goes to waste. Poplar can be safely used as animal  bedding which means the mill's offcuts, those that are not already  being used to fuel the company's wood drying kilns, are turned into  shavings. These shavings are then bagged and shipped out by the truck  load to be sold in a wide variety of retail outlets.   This Powell County mill maintains their technology at a topnotch  standard. In 2019 the owners invested in a new addition to the team: a  sophisticated scanning rough mill line from Eagle Machinery & Supply,  Inc. The new rough mill line is able to process 65,000 board feet of  lumber in a single 8-hour shift with only six people required to  operate it. The joint project between Powell and Eagle, both family  companies, demonstrates that U.S. machinery manufacturers can  successfully compete with Europeans in providing world-class technology  to the North American wood processing industry.   The Thornberrys keep their eye on efficiency and progress, opening up  ownership of the company to experts outside the family, including Brian  Lambert, Powell Valley Mill's General manager, and Dale Budke, the  mill's operations manager. As fellow owners of the company, these  gentleman provide the expertise necessary for navigating the growing  Kentucky lumber industry. In 2019 Powell Valley Millwork acquired the  Metrie Poplar manufacturing facility in nearby Jeffersonville, KY. With  a new 125,000-square-foot location only 12 miles from their original  facility, the two locations utilize their natural synergies to support  the needs of a diverse customer base across North America in full truck  and railroad quantities.   Powell Valley Millwork is a testament to the ingenuity and  resourcefulness of Kentuckians. Drawing from our beautiful natural  resources and employing over 200 local men and women, this business  illustrates some of the best qualities Kentucky has to offer--fine  craftsmanship and dedicated hard work. Powell Valley Millwork is a  decades-old dream the Thornberrys had when they left the mining  industry, a dream that has grown beyond what they had imagined. Small  businesses like Powell Valley are the core of small towns across  Kentucky, and like the poplars they use in their mill, their roots grow  deep to help our communities flourish. Congratulations to the  Thornberrys and the entire Powell Valley team. I wish them the best of  luck and look forward to watching their continued growth and success in  Kentucky.                            ____________________
