 Madam Chair, Americans depend on their oceans. In  Lowcountry, the ocean drives our tourism economy and is integral to who  we are, which is why we need bold action to protect our coastal  communities from the growing threats of sea level rise and storms,  increasing both in frequency and severity.   H.R. 729 is an important step in this direction and will empower  coastal communities to better prepare for and respond to our rapidly  changing coastlines. It will promote development of climate-resilient  shorelines that protect our coasts from storms and improve fish and  wildlife habitats. It will shore up working waterfronts, which face  their own challenges caused by a changing environment.   H.R. 729 will be a lifeline to our coastal communities at a time when  they need it most, and I urge all my colleagues to join me in  supporting this critical legislation.
