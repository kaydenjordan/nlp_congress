 . . The       President's Executive order is a threat to our       Constitution. Rather than protecting our national       security, it stigmatizes those who would lawfully       immigrate to our State.

On       behalf of the Commonwealth, my office is challenging the       immigration ban to hold this administration accountable       for its un-American, discriminatory, and reckless       decision-making.    In 2013, Senator Sessions voted against reauthorizing the Violence  Against Women Act, a bill that expanded protections and services  provided to victims of sexual assault and domestic violence.

This is what it  said: ``They are mothers, daughters, sisters, fathers, sons, and  brothers.''   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Majority leader.   Mr. McCONNELL.

I call the Senator to order under the provisions of rule XIX.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.
