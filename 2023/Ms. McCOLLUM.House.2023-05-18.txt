 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H. Con. Res. 40.   I want to start by thanking law enforcement for all the work they do  to keep our communities safe. Officers consistently put their lives on  the line. Each year during National Police Week, I place a poster  outside of my office honoring Minnesota's fallen law enforcement  officers.   In my work as an appropriator, you know that I strongly support  funding for Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) grants and  Byrne JAG Justice Assistance grants. These are funds that directly  support local law enforcement. Law enforcement entities were  prioritized in my FY22, FY23, and FY24 Community Project Funding  requests, with $4,500,000 secured for Ramsey and Washington County law  enforcement projects that are improving public safety in my home  district.   Unfortunately, the House Republican majority's resolution does not  simply express support for our law enforcement. It also includes  language explicitly polarizing and misleading in nature, referring only  to ``left-wing'' extremists but failing to acknowledge the right-wing  extremist violence that has proliferated in recent years. For example,  the attack on our U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021, that resulted in the  deaths of five U.S. Capitol Police officers and lasting injuries for  many more.   It is unfortunate that with this resolution, which should be focused  on highlighting the important work law enforcement officers do every  day, Republicans chose to use rhetoric to score political points with  their base.
