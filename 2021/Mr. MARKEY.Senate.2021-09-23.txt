 Mr. President, I would like to speak in support of Ms.  Monica Medina's nomination to be Assistant Secretary of State for the  Bureau of Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific  Affairs.   I have known Monica for more than 30 years and can say without a  shred of doubt that she is the most qualified and competent candidate  to fill this position. She has worked for decades across multiple  administrations on issues of environmental law and policy. She  understands well the interconnected world we live in and knows that  21st-century U.S. foreign policy goes not simply beyond the water's  edge but to the seas and the skies and the sands of the world, where  universal threats and their solutions lie.   Monica is a proven public servant through and through. Over the  years, she has fought for what matters most. For example, during her  time at the Defense Department, she worked to end discriminatory  practices against women in the military, to provide them with  opportunities that were previously closed to them simply because of  their gender.   After her time at DOD, she continued the track record of fighting for  what is most important by calling out the connection between illegal  wildlife trafficking and organized criminal networks, confronting  illegal fishing that is too often tied to global piracy and human  rights violations.   Her expertise in globe-spanning threats to our national security is  exactly why former Secretary of Defense  [[Page S6661]]  Leon Panetta and the Center for Strategic and International Studies  have turned to her as an expert and adviser, because she knows that we  can't protect ourselves at home without a robust strategy abroad.   Throughout her career, she has proven to be a pragmatic and  solutions-focused public servant by working across the aisle and with  stakeholders from different States and industries in the United States  to find ways to protect our oceans and our ocean economy.   After the Deepwater Horizon oilspill, Monica collaborated with five  Republican Governors of affected States to get $1 billion in  restoration funds from oil company BP so that States could quickly stop  rebounding from the disaster.   Her work at NOAA was praised by groups like the Seafood Harvesters of  America, who support her experience and legacy of protecting our oceans  and the workers and communities that depend upon them.   Louis Pasteur once said:         Science knows no country, because knowledge belongs to       humanity, and is the torch which illuminates the world.       Science is the highest personification of the nation because       that nation will remain the first which carries the furthest       the works of thought and intelligence.    Monica Medina has dedicated her career to promoting America's  excellence in these two realms--the tools of science and the values of  humanity--because it is there where America's promise to the world can  be found.   I want to reiterate very strongly that she has served every mission,  she has fulfilled every goal that she has been given, and every  discussion that she has ever had has always resulted in people holding  us in the highest regard by the key stakeholders in every issue she has  touched. I want to reiterate my strong support for her nomination and  hope my colleagues will join me in confirming her for this important  position.   I yield the floor.
