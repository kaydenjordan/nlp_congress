 Madam Speaker, I rise today to wish a very happy 70th  birthday to Billy Joel, a resident of the greatest congressional  district in America, the First Congressional District of New York.   He has sung about Allentown; he has sung about Vienna; but he never  forgot where he came from. It is important, whether you are in  politics, music, or business, to never forget where you come from.   He would sing songs about our bays, our beaches, our boaters, our  fishermen, our restaurants, our media. He is someone who, to this very  day, looks at Long Island as his home.   He has a concert tonight celebrating his 70th birthday with so many  fans.   From everyone who lives in the First Congressional District, for all  of Long Island, a very happy 70th birthday to a very special person.   Happy birthday to Billy Joel.
