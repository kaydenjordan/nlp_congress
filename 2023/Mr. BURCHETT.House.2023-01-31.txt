 Mr. Speaker, I believe it is the Volunteer State. The  Butternut State, I never heard that.   Dadgummit, Mr. Speaker, here I am again bringing attention to yet  another example of our woke telecom companies targeting conservative  speech. I am very glad though that they did not censor my good friend  Mr. Buck's new book ``Crushed,'' which is actually on the best seller  list, I have heard. I am fired up about that, brother.   DIRECTV, of course, is co-owned by AT&T and TPG, and they have taken  ``Newsmax'' off the air as we have heard.   DIRECTV says this was purely a business decision, but nobody believes  that, Mr. Speaker. Big media corporations don't exactly have the best  record of protecting conservative speech.   Last year, Democrats in Congress wrote letters to AT&T and other  telecom companies demanding they deplatform ``Newsmax''--which is  really just a fancy way of saying we are going to deny your First  Amendment rights, Mr. Speaker--along with ``Fox News'' and ``One  America News'' because of so-called disinformation.   After these letters were sent, DIRECTV dropped ``One America News,''  and now it appears to be doing the same thing to ``Newsmax.''   This fits a disturbing pattern, Mr. Speaker, of these woke  corporations using their market dominance to censor conservative  networks to appease Washington politicians and further their demands on  woketopia.   After receiving lots of criticism from the American people about this  decision, DIRECTV announced it would launch a new conservative network.  That is great, but it is still not an excuse for deplatforming another  popular network, Mr. Speaker.   Our country was built on freedom of speech, and Americans benefit  from having access to a wide range of viewpoints, not just the ones  approved by the liberal Democrats.    Mr. Speaker, one day they will be coming after the liberal media, and  then it will be too dadgum late.
