 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, first, because I don't get the chance to do this very  often, this is the Joint Economic Committee. We are basically here to  talk about the economic impact of this piece of legislation. I am  joyful to have Mr. Beyer as my opposite. He is someone who I truly  respect intellectually. If he suggests you read a book, grab it.   But this is one of those occasions where, having sat through the  Committee on the Budget's testimony discussion, I am both frustrated  and a little heartbroken on the number of things that were said that  actually weren't mathematically true or policy true or accurate. I am  hoping that those of us on the Joint Economic Committee can actually  raise the level of this argument and this discourse to being  hyperfactual because we need to get this right.   Do understand that a $1.9 trillion bill, if you do the interest, is  $2.4 trillion to $2.5 trillion. So we need to start getting our  understanding of the types of dollars we are talking about.   Mr. Speaker, I don't intend to stand here and just do a bunch of  responses, but here's the quarterly from the Census Bureau about State  and local revenues and resources: A 17.7 percent increase in receipts.   Now, your State might not be that, but 17.7 percent from the Census  Bureau, their latest document.   And if you have one of the municipalities that is hurting, that has a  shortfall, there is still $58 billion sitting in the account that  hasn't been spent, yet we are talking about adding another $1.9  trillion in spending.   Until we also take a moment and understand the almost $1 trillion  still sitting in the accounts that haven't been released or spent, part  of this argument we are having today is absolutely absurd.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, just a couple points. There is still  $280 billion sitting in the payroll protection account. There is still  $239 billion sitting in the health spending account. I am someone who,  on a personal level--and I believe our Republican side of the Joint  Economic Committee--believes we need to probably spend more, but it  needs to be properly targeted so we get the impact.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California  (Mrs. Kim).    Mr. Speaker, I would like to say that Congresswoman  Beatty has a great mask. It is wonderfully sparkly.   I did want to share one thing very, very quickly. This is our CBO  projection of where we are at right now. With the moneys that have  already been authorized right now, by the end of this year, we will be  close to a 4 percent GDP growth. So last quarter wasn't anywhere where  we wanted it. The quarter before that was miserable. But you have to  understand that this is where we are at.   We keep hearing our fellow Members make comments, saying the  economists said, ``Go big.'' But if you actually listen to their second  line, multiple economists said, ``Go big, but go targeted.''   This document isn't targeted. It is all over the board.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Kansas (Mr.  Estes).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Once again--and I am probably going to keep making this point over,  and over, and over--I care deeply and am desperately concerned  particularly for the poor and the working poor in this country. And  this document, if we are going to be honest about it, does not target  their suffering.   I will show a couple of boards here where, once again, we are going  to be sending stunning amounts of money to places that it is just going  to sit in a bank account. It is going to go to places where it is not  actually creating that velocity, that multiplier effect of helping  those who are suffering.   And do understand--this is important--there is still $172 billion  sitting in the disaster loan accounts. There is another $172 billion  still sitting in the unemployment insurance accounts from things we  have already done together.   In that case, it is not completely--I don't want to use the word  ``disingenuous''--but some of the things we are saying here that, yes,  there is a crisis out there, and, yes, there is actually money sitting  in the accounts. Get that damn money out of those accounts to where the  suffering is.    And with that I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Pfluger).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, maybe I am going to break protocol, but I am finding  that this will be the second time I think I have complimented someone  on the Democratic side. Triggers make a lot of sense in this type of  mechanism when you have, functionally, $1 trillion still sitting in the  accounts, and we are seeing projections from CBO saying, functionally,  by the fourth quarter--I am sorry, I didn't have a chance to print this  large--but by the fourth quarter, unemployment--look, I am one of those  who believes full employment is always the ultimate goal--but  unemployment will be back to where basically we were in 2015-2016.   Can we do better? Absolutely. But to do better, it is going to  require thoughtful, targeted, well-designed spending, of our resources,  our statutes. And one of the reasons I talk about that is there is  something very unique going on. And I hope our chairman of the Joint  Economic Committee will actually think about this because we haven't  figured out how to turn this one into being partisan yet. I am sure we  will figure it out.   But right now, this is the sort of thing we should be talking about.  There is this crazy renaissance going on in this country of people  starting new businesses, filing new LLCs, starting new concerns.   Now, it may be because of the tragedy of the business they have right  now which has been crushed by the shutdowns and the virus, but there  are a remarkable number of new concerns beginning.   Wouldn't it be both elegant, but also very powerful, as we watch  unemployment, to find ways to access capital; access to streamlined  permitting, licensing; crazy things like allowing someone to do a  microbusiness out of public housing, things that actually have impact.   And it turns out, those aren't the sort of things you find in a $1.9  trillion--functionally $2.5 trillion if you are going to be honest  about the real cost--spending package. And I understand this is a piece  of legislation that if you actually look at it, it is just line, after  line, after line, after line of numbers.   If this passes--which it probably will, you know, the Democrats are  in the majority--the ethical, moral obligations we have heard from  multiple speakers here that a budget is your values, is the value the  fact you can spend stunning amounts of money even when there is $1  trillion still sitting in the bank unspent, or is the value that you  are going to do it in a way where we impact the working poor; where we  impact those who are truly suffering, and not crushing someone like my  5-year-old daughter who is the one who is ultimately going to be paying  this back.    So if we are going to make the moral argument, I hope we think about  the whole, shall we say, continuum of what we do here, what is moral,  what is right.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, in many ways we are all saying the same  thing. It is just, once again, trying to make the argument, if we do  this smartly and well-targeted, we can do it for a dramatically more  efficient cost and actually help more of the poor that we know are  suffering, more of the people who have been crushed, more of the small  businesses.   And a simple example, Opportunity Insights has predicted that, with a  $2,000 check to functionally every household that makes less than  $46,000, only $420, functionally, of what they receive will get spent.  The rest goes in the bank. Maybe that is a good thing. Maybe that is  the audience you want to target. But when you start doing the same  thing to populations, and for some reason they use $78,000, only $105  gets spent. So think of that.   Mr. Speaker, increase the check another $1,400, a population that  makes $78,000 or more, they are only spending $105. The rest is going  in the bank account. Maybe that is wonderful, but that is not what we  are debating. We are trying to create a multiplier effect of some  stimulus in our society to get the economy going so we see those GDP  numbers go up; the unemployment go down; and we get back to the miracle  we were at in 2018 and 2019, where income and equality actually shrank  for the first time in 2 years, where food insecurity shrank for the  first time in decades and decades and decades, where the working poor  actually were doing better than they had in decades and decades and  decades.   How do we get back to, functionally, what was the miracle of 2018 and  2019?   And my argument is, the model that we are reading in this resolution,  isn't it. It doesn't get you there. If we truly have the same goal, I  desperately hope our friends on the left and those of us on the right,  who actually want to look at this almost like an economist of a laser  beam, are saying: Let's find those who are hurting and find out how to  get the resources that are already appropriated and get those to them,  and then appropriate more where necessary.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, once again, back to facts over feelings:  After the tax reform, what did we see in our society?   It was the first 2 years that we actually saw income and equality  shrink in modern economic times. I thought that was the Holy Grail.   Did you see what happened to Hispanics, African Americans' incomes,  working poor incomes?   The fact of the matter is, if you tell the truth about the post-tax  reform model--just maybe because I was in the room--the top 10 percent  actually were paying more of the Federal income taxes than prior. Yet  that somehow isn't the folklore that we so often hear from this floor.   Mr. Speaker, there are couple other points I would like to make. And  a couple of this is important because Chairman Beyer actually did a  terrific job touching on some of this. And he was making a very  powerful point. And, actually, I hate to say this, he was reading part  of my script, which actually is a little creepy.   The total deposits in commercial banks, if you take a look at this  line, have gone up dramatically. It is because too much of the money  that we have done bipartisan in the last year to help stimulate and  save the economy ended up in pockets of those very, very wealthy, or  even medium wealthy, and it ended up sitting in the bank and not  circulating, rotating in the economy and helping the workers, helping  the working poor, helping those who are just trying to survive.   My fear is this budget reconciliation document is going to be just a  lot more of this, if you actually look. The other thing is--this is a  tough one, and this is one I am hoping that the placeholder in this  document isn't what the Democrats really are heading towards because,  if it is, you are going to hear those who are on our side scream that  this is a payoff to, shall we say, a constituency that is very  supportive of the Democrats.   Mr. Speaker, not been a great year--the year 2000, about 350,000  State municipal workers lost their jobs. This budget reconciliation  bill has about $350 billion in the line item for that population. You  do realize that's $1 million a job. And if you do the total number, it  is still $350,000 a job.   Is that compassion? Or is that lunacy?   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I will tell you this: Mr. Green also can  sing, and he is one of those I consider a friend. He and I have done a  number of pieces of legislation, and he and I have a running discussion  of what actually helps the working poor. We have different views, but  we know we both have a passion of it.   Mr. Speaker, let's actually take sort of the theme that has been  offered here. I believe it is absolutely mathematically wrong, but an  argument that, Hey, so much of this has helped the wealthy in tax  reform and those things. Great.   Mr. Speaker, if someone on the Democratic side can promise me that  when I am looking at this budget resolution, this is not creating a  policy box for the Committee on Ways and Means  [[Page H310]]  to turn around and re-implement policy where, functionally, the benefit  goes mostly to the very, very wealthy.   So when I see the box here that looks like it would allow for certain  revenues to be raised, and then it goes to possibly a SALT--a State and  local tax deduction, which we all know the top 1 percent gets 57  percent of the value of it, the bottom 80 percent of our society only  gets 4 percent of the value--that would be, actually, a tax break.  Actually, I think I have been quoted as saying, ``It is the most  regressive tax break that you can think of in our society right now  that is in play.''   I am just desperately hoping that isn't what I am reading in some of  these pages as part of that setup. And I would love someone on the left  to basically promise me that we are not seeing a setup here to, once  again, subsidize the rich.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, the comment of ``look at this budget and see a party's  values,'' this may be a little ethereal, but have you all heard the  term ``blank check company''? It is one of the rages on Wall Street  right now. Take basically a shell, have a bunch of money put into it,  and then they promise, saying, we are going to find something to spend  the money on.   This is essentially a blank check budget reconciliation with actually  none of the very elegant and persuasive words said.   There is also one other thing, and I want to say this as respectfully  as possible, so I am going to read someone else's words. The well-worn  and misleading talking points is 83 percent of the tax cuts go to the  wealthiest 1 percent. Just not true. Since the day of tax reform until  2025, the wealthiest, and maybe it is too much, get 25 percent. At the  very end of tax reform, when many of the different tax breaks and those  things are expiring out, there is an anomaly in the year 2027. It is  not 83 percent.   Please, I beg of my friends on the left, I know we like our talking  points, but there is a reason the public is so enraged with us. It is  because we have this bad habit of getting behind these microphones and  playing some real games with the facts, and the facts are the facts.   Once again, the blank check company concept, this is now the blank  check budget.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, there is one other thing I wanted to share. First, the  Restaurants Act is a good piece of legislation. I think there are many  of us on Ways and Means who look forward to it or something very, very  close to it.   Also, one other comment, Madam Speaker spoke earlier, I was actually  somewhat enthused about her focus on kids in school. As Mr. Beyer  teased me, I am 58, my wife is 58, and I have a 5 year old. That is the  ultimate definition of being optimistic for the future. That is funny.   But the fact of the matter is, I desperately hope that Madam Speaker  will use her influence on the teachers' union to encourage getting  these kids back to school. I have some charts--but I am not going to  show them to everyone because I may save them for evening floor time-- on the devastation--and the Speaker actually just spoke about this,  which is a great irony--of what we are doing to the future earning  power of everyone from the parents to the children themselves.   How many saw the story, I think in The New York Times, this last week  about children suicides in Nevada?   It rips your heart out. But I don't see it in this budget document.  It is not in there.  [[Page H312]]    If that is where we are heading, great. As Republicans we are going  to help make good things happen, getting these schools open, but we  actually need the influence from the left, particularly with the  teachers' union to make that a possibility.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, this has been actually a reasonable conversation. I  desperately hope we are going to have more of this.   But back to some of the principal points from the Republican side we  are trying to share about this budget resolution is the SBA paycheck  protection. There is still $280 billion sitting in the account that  hasn't gone out the door; healthcare spending, still has $239 billion  sitting in the account that hasn't gone out the door; economic injury  disaster loans, $172 billion still sitting in the account that hasn't  gone out the door; unemployment insurance expansion, another $172  billion still sitting in the account; education funding, $59 billion  sitting in the account; assistance to State and local, $58 billion;  stimulus checks, there is still $52 billion sitting in there; food  stamps, there is still $33 billion; childcare and development block  grants, there is $10 billion sitting in that account; agriculture  assistance, there is still $29 billion sitting in the account. That is  $1 trillion.    Is there a need for more help in our society?   Absolutely.   Does this document actually target it to those who are hurting, to  the working poor, and to those who actually haven't gained great wealth  with the stock market? Are other dollars in their accounts?   I just don't see it in there.   And functionally, this is $2.5 trillion of spending. When we  authorize $1.9 trillion and then do the interest on it, I think that is  a fair interest calculation.   I beg of us that as this moves forward and we actually get to put  some policy behind these incredibly broad numbers, will those of us who  actually care about math--because the running joke in our family is  that Daddy works in a math-free zone. Somehow, I thought it would get a  laugh.   I desperately ask all of us, this is a stunning amount of money. I  understand the need for the administration and the Democrat majority to  act like individuals of action.   But what happens when that action is theater?   On the conservative side we want to help, but $1.9 trillion isn't the  help. It is figuring out where the needs are and getting it to them.  Instead--and I'll show some of the charts--some of the dollar amounts  that are in this document are absurd and still don't get us what we  know we need in our society.   So as part of my closing here, we have $1 trillion already still  sitting in the accounts that haven't gone out the door.   What are we doing to get those resources to those who need it?   Because this is something that we could do instantly. The cash is  already sitting there. It is already authorized.   But also, what could we do as those of us in the Joint Economic  Committee try to work on math saying: Here is how we get the maximum  amount of stimulus to help those who are hurting?   How do we get back to--forgive my cheat sheet--how do we get back to  an environment where, once again, like we had in 2018 and 2019, income  inequality actually shrank for the first time?   How do we get back to where food insecurity was shrinking and where  the working poor were getting substantially less poor?   I know there is a great difficulty for my brothers and sisters on the  left to extend tax reform and regulatory reform any credit. Then don't  give it credit. But do at least accept we had some amazing things  happening there for a couple of years for the very populations we come  behind these microphones and say that we care about.   Is there a way that on this left budget document--which is  functionally a blank check company--being authorized to drop $1.9  trillion in immediate cash with an ultimate cost of about $2.5  trillion, could we actually take a look at what was working in our  society before the pandemic and figure out how to do more of what was  working and take a look at what was done in the previous years where we  spent lots of money and we had almost no multiplier effect, none of the  folks we were trying to help were getting help, and do less of this?   Because this document reads very much like we are going back to the  bad old days of spend lots of money, do some great virtue signaling,  and, ultimately, the very people we talk about are no better off.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, as we get ourselves sort of organized,  one of the hazards of being someone that almost can't speak without a  chart with them, I wanted to do a couple of things in this time this  evening. Some of it is the continuation of the debate that happened on  the floor earlier today.   I will just try to add a little more meat, a little more detail on  what some of us are seeing from the Joint Economic Committee and our  economists there looking at the data, what is going on in our country;  and also, the Ways and Means Committee and what we see and what we  think we can do to truly help working men and women in this country,  the working poor, and where the policy is going, and it is some of our  angst as the legislation moved out of the House today on sort of a  blank-check budget document.   Here is $1.9 trillion in immediate funding, ultimately costing about  a trillion and half in the 10-year window because of interest and those  things because it is not paid for.   And where does that money go? And is it designed to truly maximize  helping our brothers and sisters around this country and their economic  vitality, dealing with the shutdowns and the  [[Page H319]]  economic devastation that we have seen in so many of our communities?   But some of the other side is where we have seen around the country,  even with the headwinds of the pandemic, where are we seeing the  economy moving in the right direction? Where are we seeing communities  that have, we used to use the term, green shoots. That is sort of  overused anymore.   And there is also a substantial difference from what we see in some  of the coastal economies to much of the rest of the Nation.   I am blessed to represent the Scottsdale, Phoenix, Carefree, Cave  Creek, Fountain Hills area, so Phoenix and some of its suburbs. And we  have some folks that have just been crushed, whether they be in the  hospitality business and tourism-related businesses, some of the  restaurants.   But yet, we have been shocked at also how healthy our economy has  been because of the creativity of some of these very same people  finding other ways to survive. And that is actually one of the  secondary things we want to try to talk about this evening is, as the  Democrats who run this place, they are in charge, will they actually be  creative enough? Will they be forward-thinking enough to say, as we are  looking at tax policy, where we are going to do stimulus policy,  regulatory policy, are we building it for what the future of the  economy looks like, for the future of opportunity, and will it be  designed to actually help all Americans?   So some simple examples, and I am going to then use some of the  display boards. We know there is already $1 trillion sitting in bank  accounts at the Treasury right now that are supposed to be helping  schools, States, others who are in need right now. And instead, today,  we spent all day debating $1.9 trillion of new spending over the next  year. Instead of saying, hey, there is $1 trillion sitting in these  accounts. What can we do to help the Biden administration get it out  the door, get it to those schools, to healthcare workers, to the places  that are already designated?   That is part of the problem around this place is we engage sort of in  the theatrics, but the really assisting and providing the resources for  the management to actually get to where the need is, that is secondary  because, in some ways, that doesn't give you the same television time  opportunity.   So a couple of things I wanted to walk through is, if I come to you  and tell you there is $1 trillion already sitting in accounts right  now--it turns out, CBO, the Congressional Budget Office, just did some  projections, and we want this better. But this is as if the additional  $1.9 trillion of spending were not to happen; we would just stay where  we are at with the dollars that are already appropriated, with the  budget that is already sort of modeled out.   If you actually look here, 2020, miserable fall in the size of our  economy. But our projections are functionally, by the end of the year,  we expect growth to actually be substantially positive. We are looking  at a year with just under 4 percent GDP growth. That is terrific. I  would like to see it more, and we could see it more if we would  actually target some of the resources, instead of doing what is often  referred to around here as a peanut butter spread, where we are going  to spend lots of money so we make sure we don't annoy any constituent  groups; or particularly let's put money where, you know, we made these  public employee unions happy. We made this group happy.   I think this needs to be less about making our politics happy and  making this line go up even further. And that is actually what, if we  would actually draft the legislation, I think you would see Republicans  line up with Democrats and probably, not for $1.9 trillion because we  know that is just almost absurd. But there are some real opportunities  to make this GDP growth substantially, substantially better.   As we sort of walk through some of the ideas that I am trying to  promote, and I am trying to find some of my friends on the other side,  particularly the Joint Economic Committee Democrats and some of the  Ways and Means Democrats, there is something very special going on  right now and we need to seize this as an opportunity.   In a time that has been so difficult for so many small businesses in  America, small entrepreneurs, microentrepreneurs, something has  happened. Do you know this last year was the biggest year ever in this  country for people starting new little businesses? Filing for new LLCs,  just starting new businesses. And you can see it here in the chart.   That is a pretty big spike when you consider 2019 was one of the  greatest economic expansion years in modern history. 2018, 2019 were  remarkable years economically, and yet, 2020, in the middle of such  difficulties, we are seeing people becoming entrepreneurial, taking  risks.    If we are going to work on public policy, where we want to build a  more egalitarian, a more robust economy next year, this year, future  years, how about a conversation where we get the Democrats to actually  talk to us as Republicans, instead of just run us over policy-wise. How  do you provide access to capital to some of these microbusinesses,  these businesses that are being started in people's back bedrooms?   How do you actually provide them a cleaner path through the  regulatory bodies, the licensing, the permitting?   Are we willing to be creative enough that, if you are poor and you  happen to be willing to start a microbusiness and you live in public  housing, you are actually allowed to run that business in the public  housing, instead of being threatened with losing your lease?   If you actually care about people, this is the time we say there is  something going on in our society and our economy; is this one of the  great disruptions a lot of the economists have been talking about, that  when we have gone through this upheaval of this last year, what the  future is going to look like?   And does Congress actually provide assistance in a way that makes  this economic change happen in a positive way? Or do we do what we are  seeing in today's budget document, which was functionally, $1.9  trillion, and most of it just going to fund either legacy economics,  States and municipalities, where the numbers were stunningly out of  whack? Or are we functionally funding the last decade's economy and not  moving to the future economy?   Now, I can try to explain this. If you will take a look at the bottom  chart here--I put two charts on one board--you will actually see  spending per government job lost. And the only point I am trying to  make with this board is there is about $350 billion set aside in the  Democrats' budget reconciliation bill.   There have been about 350,000 jobs lost in the government sector. But  let's first just do it by States. If that money were used for States,  that is $1 million a job. If it is all of them, it is still $350,000 a  job.   This is actually how--if you actually say, here is the problem, here  is the math of how much money is in that bill, you start to realize  something is not lining up. And I desperately hope we can actually have  an intellectually honest conversation saying, you want to help States  and municipalities? We know from the Census Bureau--and it was as of  the end of the third quarter because that is the last number we had-- State revenues were up. State and local revenues were up over 17  percent last year, which is remarkable to think about, because it is  unlike everything we have been told.   Yes, there are municipalities around this country where their  revenues have been crushed. They are also the very municipalities that  have been most aggressive in their shutdowns. Maybe those are places we  need to look at and figure out how we help them.   But the math is the math, and State and local revenues are up, if you  take the entire country, they are up rather dramatically.   The top part is part of the argument of targeting. If you are going  to have impact in the country while spending lots of money, do you  spend it in a way where you actually put the money in places that-- let's be honest--don't need it? Or do you put the money to those who  are truly hurting?   And we can actually tell, because we can see it just in the  aggregate. This is actually about commercial bank deposits, and this is  telling us big businesses that got access to capital, wealthier people  that actually got certain types of stimulus; stunning, stunning,  stunning rise of cash sitting in banks right now.  [[Page H320]]    Did the Democrats actually intend to hand these same people that much  more money?   So part of what we are arguing for is, please, could we actually take  a step back and understand the data? It is not slowing things down. It  is actually not sticking money into the very pockets that actually  don't need it.   The brutal political part is the folks that actually have these huge  deposits, they are also the ones that often finance those campaigns.   So let's actually walk through--and this one is a little tougher, and  I probably will do more on the floor on it in the future because I want  to go into some depth--$15 minimum wage. Okay. I am one of those who  genuinely, desperately wants to find ways to help the working poor.   Understand what was accomplished in 2018 and 2019. There seems to be  this fear of actually acknowledging that there was an economic miracle  going on. It was the fastest rise of wealth and income for the working  poor in modern history. It was the first, not one, but 2 years in  modern economic history where income inequality in this country  actually shrank.   If you say you end up with a society that becomes dangerously  fractured as income inequality splits and splits and splits apart,  there should have been joy in this body in 2018 and 2019 when that very  income inequality shrank.   The left can make whatever reason, excuse, but they need to at least  acknowledge it happened. The working poor's wages went up dramatically.   Nutrition, if you care about hunger, it was the first time in modern  years where, what do they call it, food fragility, food stress,  actually shrank. These are good things. Maybe we need to take a step  back and say what did we do for 2018? What did we do, as a body, for  2019 that created such prosperity, where revenues--so tax receipts is  the proper way to call it, ways and means, tax receipts actually went  up?   If you actually did inflation-adjusted dollars, I think we had the  number two and number three best years in U.S. history post-tax reform.   We need to have an honest dialogue, and I know this is really  difficult for the left. There are things for us on the right that are  really difficult. But the fact of the matter is; whether things have  changed in regulation; whether it is the things that changed in our tax  code, whether it was the adoption of technology, there were lots of  things moving in those couple of years there. But the fact of the  matter is, U.S. society got much healthier, and not at cost to the  Treasury.                                time  1900    If the truth here is that we care about where we are going  economically, that we care about the economic stress, that we care  about the working poor, a $1.9 trillion spending stimulus while  ignoring the fact that we had a couple of years where we actually had  success in shrinking income inequality, maybe we need to understand  what we did there and do more of it.   There is a reality here. If you want the working poor to have a  better life, we can raise their wages to $15 an hour. But you also have  to accept there is--I think one of these charts says it is like 3.2  million American workers in that working poor category who are going to  become much poorer because they will lose their employment.   We will spend some more time on a couple of these boards in the near  future to try to understand: Do you do what happened in 2018 and 2019,  where what we saw is wages, almost everywhere in the country, were  substantially above the minimum wage because of the scarcity of labor?  Labor became valuable.   There is also another controversial subject we are going to have to  have an honest discussion on: immigration issues in regard to the  importation of low-skilled labor. It was somewhat restricted in that  time. Competition for labor shrank; therefore, the value of that labor  went up.   There is a combination of a robust economy, a tax code that is  working, earned income tax credit, and things of that nature being  expanded, and also not flooding the market with others with similar  skill sets.   A couple of others we want to just sort of walk through. This one is  sort of difficult to get our heads around, but it is the math: total  monthly spending effects of first and second stimulus payments by  household income. What you find is, when you get up into the higher  income, almost none of the money was really getting spent. It  functionally went to make people's bank accounts more robust. When you  went down, you saw more of the money actually getting spent.   All we are trying to argue here is, if you are going to do direct  stimulus to individuals, great, but make sure it is not going into  populations that aren't going to spend it because you don't get any  multiplier in the economy. Lots of good data exist on this, and you saw  it in a previous chart when you saw how much is just sitting in bank  accounts right now.   Back to trying to make a point. This indicates income by households.  I want to make sure I say this the right way. If you take a look at  what I often refer to as sort of the miracle of 2018 and 2019, you  started seeing populations that were in the lower percentiles. All of a  sudden, their curve was much steeper than those who had typically  benefited.   There are series of data like this that we will show you, if you care  about the working poor, that mimic what the Republicans accomplished in  the tax reform and in the regulatory reform. If you are on the left,  put it under a different name. But the fact of the matter is, the data  is the data. There were some really wonderful things happening for the  poor and the working poor in this country.   Instead of going through the next couple of boards, I will save those  for when we do a concentrated conversation.   Madam Speaker, in sort of building a closing here, it has been a  crappy month for a lot of us here in Congress. We have gone through  some things I really thought I would never see.   But I always thought, even outside, when many of us are standing in  front of microphones and being a bit hyperbolic, thinking that the only  way voters will actually hear our words is when we tell stories because  math is too difficult, there have always been those moments in the  back--or the joy of being in the Ways and Means Committee where we  share a common back room, unlike so many other committees where you go  off separately.   In this time of COVID, we don't have those conversations right now.  We don't hear each other's arguments and, hopefully, build policy that  is good for the country.   What we saw on the floor earlier today, I think, is somewhat  shameful, a $1.9 trillion budget box, which is designed basically to be  able to run through the process, get through the Senate with 51 votes,  so they don't have to negotiate with any Republicans.   But what was also sort of heartbreaking is so many of the things that  were said just weren't true. They weren't mathematically true. They  weren't policy true. They weren't historically true.   The Speaker got up and said, I think, 83 percent of the benefits of  tax reform went to the top 1 percent. That just isn't true. We have  lots of papers and other things that say it isn't. I am sure the smart  people around her know it is not true. But around here, if you say  something enough times, it becomes part of, sort of, congressional  folklore.    To be correct, it is 25 percent of the benefits went to the top 1  percent, but they pay just a stunning percentage of Federal income tax.   How do we ever build policy, particularly for economic growth, for  opportunity for everyone, and build a much more, shall we say, fair and  egalitarian society when in the debates we have, so much of the  discussion is make-believe? The math isn't true. Yet, if we say it  enough times, you will hear it resaid over and over. I will argue that  is where a lot of the crisis is around here.   My family joke that Daddy works in a place that is a math-free zone  was meant to be funny. It wasn't supposed to be true. The problem is,  it is true.   How do you make public policy in times of difficulty, when you want  to have an economic future that is good for everyone, but when so much  of the debate has so little to do with the truth?   I double my commitment. Leading the Joint Economic Committee, our  economists, our team, I know we have all committed to working with our  [[Page H321]]  Democrat colleagues on finding the things that look like they work and  do more of it.   I desperately hope we can find some Democrats who are less bathing in  partisan rage, or whatever the proper term would be, and are willing to  look at the math that would be good for all of us, good for the  country, good for someone like myself who has a 5-year-old. I want her  future to be amazing.   I truly believe our society is at the moment of an economic  disruption that, if we can get policy right, the next couple of years  can be pretty darn amazing. The next decade could be just awesome. But  right now, our regulatory policy and our reimbursement policies aren't  there.   How do we get the conversation to move back to things that will make  this future amazing instead of just burying my 5-year-old daughter in  more debt?   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
