 Madam Speaker, that is while I was watching what was  happening with the San Francisco 49ers and the Baltimore Ravens.  Sports, sports, the center of our lives. That is the unifying factor.   We all are for our teams--aren't we?--and, hopefully, we are all Team  [[Page H12251]]  USA. Now we can prove that on this U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement.   While I was calling the distinguished chairman, I was in Brussels for  the 75th anniversary of the Battle of the Bulge. We had a bipartisan  delegation there to thank our veterans. All of them were in their  nineties, many of whom who were there, so we could thank them  personally and be there to see them acknowledged by heads of state and  the rest.   In terms of Spain, it was about we are still in it when it comes to  the Paris accord. So, work, work, work.   But this was a priority, and time was important. We were trying to  get it done as soon as it met the standards that we share.   I proudly rise to join my colleagues on this exciting day as the  House passes a historic trade agreement that is truly worthy of the  American people, a new and dramatically improved U.S.-Canada-Mexico  trade agreement.   I salute Chairman Richard Neal, a lifelong champion for working  people, the maestro in the House on our side of this process, who  helped deliver a trade agreement that will serve as a model for future  trade agreements.   I thank each member of the Trade Working Group who worked so hard to  improve the product that was sent originally by the administration  nearly 2 years ago to where we are now.   I thank Chairman Blumenauer, chairman of the Trade Subcommittee,  walking in now; Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro; Congressman   John Larson;  Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky; Congressman   Mike Thompson;  Congresswoman Terri Sewell; Congresswoman Suzanne Bonamici; and  Congressman   Jimmy Gomez, each of them working on the different  categories that are mentioned: enforcement, labor rights, environmental  protections, and pharmaceuticals.   I thank every Member for their wisdom, leadership, and commitment to  delivering for the people during this process.   I was just asked in a press conference: Aren't you giving President  Trump--Mr. Brady always asks this question--aren't you giving the  President a victory to boast about?   I said: That would be collateral benefit if we could come together to  support America's working families. And if the President wants to take  credit, so be it. That would not stand in the way of our passing this.  However, I do want to point out some of the distance we have come from  the President's original product.    The House Democratic Caucus is united in our values and our priority  to making progress for America's working families in everything we do,  including this trade agreement.   We all thank Trade Representative Lighthizer, Mr. Ambassador, for  being an honest broker and straight shooter with us as we worked toward  an agreement. Not every day was without its, shall we say, exuberances,  but this day is possible because of the hard work of many Members  representing every corner of our country.   We thank Richard Trumka, president of the AFL-CIO, a true warrior for  workers, who helped secure an agreement that is light-years better than  what the administration proposed 2 years ago.   Democrats knew that hardworking Americans needed more from the USMCA  than just some broken NAFTA with better language but no real  enforcement. That was my concern: We just can't come up with a bill  that is a little sugar on the top and say this is better, because the  impact on workers would be felt for a long time to come. And we knew we  could do better.   The original USMCA draft put forth by the administration fell far  short of where it is now. It still left many American workers exposed  to losing their jobs to Mexico; included unacceptable provisions,  locking in high drug prices; came up short on key environmental  standards; critically lacked the tough, effective enforcements that are  essential to protect American jobs and holding our trading partners  accountable to their promises.   After months of Democrats working with the Trade Representative, we  have key changes to the USMCA that make this a truly transformative  agreement for America's workers.   Now, with Democratic changes, the USMCA has the strongest enforcement  mechanism of any U.S. trade agreement. Again, in contrast to the  original USMCA draft which would have allowed nations that do not live  up to their obligations to stop enforcement complaints from even being  heard, Democrats' changes prevented nations from panel blocking.   For workers, while the administration drafts stack the deck against  labor violation claims, our changes enact new rules and monitoring  tools to protect American workers, prosecute labor violations, and  ensure that Mexico is complying with labor reforms.   Other points that are for the workers include establishing labor  attaches based in Mexico who will provide on-the-ground information  about Mexico's labor practices and creating a facility-specific rapid  response law enforcement mechanism to stop trade in goods that violate  this agreement.   These are not technical changes. These make a big difference.                                time  1130    For the environment, whereas the administration's draft had weak  environmental rules and tilted the playing field against violation  claims, democrats have strengthened the rules and enforcement tools and  are lowering pollution and increasing resilient infrastructure.   Sadly, while the administration refuses to acknowledge the existence,  let alone the urgency, of the climate crisis, our changes in the USMCA  set a firm footing for progress when we have a President who brings us  back to the Paris accord.   And, by the way, when we were in Spain on this subject, our large  bicameral delegation's theme was ``we are still in'' when it came to  the Paris accord.   For lowering prescription drug costs, the White House draft contained  unacceptable giveaways for Big Pharma that would have locked in high  prescription drug prices.   Democrats have eliminated these unfair handouts to big corporations  and secured provisions to lower drug costs and improve access to life- saving medicines.   The changes House Democrats have secured in the USMCA make this a  truly transformational trade agreement. As the AFL-CIO wrote in their  letter of support last week, we have secured an agreement that working  people can proudly support.   Working people are responsible for a deal that is a vast improvement  over the original NAFTA and the flawed proposal brought forward in  2017. For the first time, there truly will be enforceable labor  standards.   The USMCA also eliminates special carve-outs for corporations like  the big giveaway to Big Pharma in the administration's initial proposal  and loopholes designed to make it harder to prosecute labor violations.   The USMCA is far from perfect, but there is no denying that the trade  rules in America are fairer because of the hard work of so many people,  and our perseverance. Working people have created a new standard for  future trade negotiations.   Indeed, the strength of Democrats' USMCA is recognized by  endorsements from groups representing tens of millions of Americans  across industries and geographies: labor groups and trade  organizations; farmers, growers, and ranchers; groups representing  businesses around the country; social justice, and faith-based  organizations, such as NETWORK.   The list goes on and on, and it will be part of the statement that I  include in the Record.   This is a strong agreement that honors our promises For the People to  give us bigger paychecks and makes a difference for millions.   With all the respect in the world for our neighbors, our respect for  the greatness of Mexico as our neighbor, and the friendship that we  have and want to engender, and our neighbor to the north, Canada, with  respect to them, our responsibility is to have a trade agreement that  lifts all workers in our hemisphere. Our first responsibility is to  American workers.   I urge a bipartisan vote for the USMCA and urge Senator McConnell to  take the bill up quickly. We can send it right over, and he can take it  up anytime.   If the Senate Republicans care about workers, they will no doubt join  us to  [[Page H12252]]  send this bill to the President's desk in the House and in the Senate.   Madam Speaker, I commend our chairman, Richard Neal, for his  outstanding work. I know that you have a good rapport with Ranking  Member Brady. I thank all the Members who are responsible for bringing  this to the floor.                                                         AFL-CIO,                                                  December 10, 2019.     AFL-CIO Endorses USMCA After Successfully Negotiating Improvements    Labor Federation President Richard Trumka on the United States-Mexico-    Canada Agreement (USMCA), provided final text accurately reflects                                  changes:         Make no mistake, we demanded a trade deal that benefits       workers and fought every single day to negotiate that deal;       and now we have secured an agreement that working people can       proudly support.        I am grateful to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her allies       on the USMCA working group, along with Senate champions like       Sherrod Brown and Ron Wyden, for standing strong with us       throughout this process as we demanded a truly enforceable       agreement. I also commend Ambassador Robert Lighthizer for       being a straight shooter and an honest broker as we worked       toward a resolution.        Working people are responsible for a deal that is a vast       improvement over both the original NAFTA and the flawed       proposal brought forward in 2017. For the first time, there       truly will be enforceable labor standards-including a process       that allows for the inspections of factories and facilities       that are not living up to their obligations.        The USMCA also eliminates special carve outs for       corporations like the giveaway to Big Pharma in the       administration's initial proposal and loopholes designed to       make it harder to prosecute labor violations.        The USMCA is far from perfect. It alone is not a solution       for outsourcing, inequality or climate change. Successfully       tackling these issues requires a full-court press of economic       policies that empower workers, including the repeal of tax       cuts which reward companies for shipping our jobs overseas.        But there is no denying that the trade rules in America       will now be fairer because of our hard work and perseverance.       Working people have created a new standard for future trade       negotiations.        President Trump may have opened this deal. But working       people closed it. And for that, we should be very proud.
