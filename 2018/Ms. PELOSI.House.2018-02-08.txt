 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding to me.   I thank the members of the Rules Committee, all of them, for the  great service they provide to the House of Representatives, this great  House of the people.   I wish that the Speaker would treat the House of the people with the  dignity that it deserves by giving us an opportunity, just an  opportunity, for him to say that he would bring legislation to the  floor, the Hurd-Aguilar bill for one, and then the other pieces of  legislation regarding DACA so that the House could work its will under  the queen-of-the-hill rule.   Last night, Mr. Clyburn, the assistant leader; Mr. Hoyer, the  Democratic whip; and I sent a letter to the Speaker. It said: ``Dear  Mr. Speaker: In the spirit of bipartisanship, we write again to  reiterate our sincere desire to ensure that the government remains open  and that the priorities of the American people are properly addressed.  As you know, Democrats have been clear that we support a budget  agreement that ensures our men and women in uniform have the resources  they need to protect our country and that America's middle class and  working families have the tools they need to succeed. As part of this  agreement, we have always expected that the House and the Senate would  address the issue of DACA and the DREAMers.    ``Most of our Members believe that this budget agreement is a  reasonable compromise to address America's military strength and  critical domestic priorities, like fighting the opioid crisis, boosting  the National Institutes of Health, moving forward to resolve the  pension crisis, caring for our veterans, making college more  affordable, and investing in childcare for working families.''   The agenda that I read was what we fought for and obtained in the  budget agreement. We did not object to the large amount of money that  was in the bill for defense, although some had asked: What is the  purpose? What is the mission?   We said: Let's go forward with that. But to keep faith with the  budget agreement, we insisted that the increases in defense would be  met by increases on the domestic side.   So we have fought this fight. This is a success for us to get, as I  said, the opioid crisis, boosting the NIH, the pension crisis, caring  for our veterans, making college more affordable, and investing in  childcare for our working families. This was the fight we had  [[Page H1000]]  with the Republicans because they have a reluctancy to support domestic  spending.   So the fact that this came to agreement after months of going back  and forth on the caps, I think, is very important to recognize.   But, again, writing to the Speaker: ``We are writing to again  reiterate our request that you make a public statement regarding the  scheduling of a vote on a DACA bill. Our request is that you publicly  state that you will schedule a vote to consider the bipartisan Hurd- Aguilar bill and any other DACA bills that you wish to consider under a  Queen of the Hill rule,'' as I mentioned earlier.   ``We strongly believe that Members of the House and their  constituents deserve the same dignity that Leader McConnell has  extended to Members of the Senate by allowing for a vote on this issue.   ``Thank you for your immediate attention to this letter.''   So we haven't heard back from the Speaker on this, but I do support  defeating the previous question.   One of the gentlemen on the other asked: Why would anybody vote  against this bill? Why would anybody vote against this rule?   Well, because we have an opportunity right here to take matters into  our own hands. Defeat the previous question so that we can take up the  Dream Act.   That would be the House working its will, because we do know that the  Dream Act has support on both sides of the aisle. We thank our  Republican colleagues, those who have spoken out publicly, for their  courage in supporting this protection.   If another country said that they were going to deport 800,000 people  or place in jeopardy their protections under the law, we would be  appalled. We would criticize them. So how can we, the United States of  America--give me your poor--you know Emma Lazarus. I don't have to go  into it right now.                                time  0400    But I do. We all carry it in our hearts. So I urge a ``no'' on the  previous question because a ``yes'' would have allowed us to bring up  the Dream Act.   I really want to disabuse anyone in this body of any idea that we are  not there to support our men and women in uniform and to give them the  resources they need to keep themselves and our Nation safe. But I do  recognize also that what our military are protecting is the greatest  country that ever existed in the history of the world, the United  States of America.   What is the United States of America?   It is a country governed by a constitution that has been a beacon to  the world. It is a country populated by the beautiful diversity of  America. It is a country that has a beautiful patrimony given to us by  God, our natural beauty. Fighting for those values is what we try to do  in this bill.   Why can't we extend the hand of friendship and protection to our  DREAMers?   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. I also  thank her for her outstanding statement of values and what our country  is about. I thank her for her extraordinary leadership.   I thank all of our colleagues for the unity that we have had over the  months when we were having this debate about what this bill would look  like.   I want to, again, read a letter that Mr. Hoyer, Mr. Clyburn, and I  sent to the Speaker last night--I guess this night, because I think it  is very important for people to understand the simplicity of our  request, the fairness of our request to the Speaker.   It says: ``In the spirit of bipartisanship, we write to again  reiterate our sincere desire to ensure that the government remains open  and that the priorities of the American people are properly addressed.  As you know, Democrats have been clear that we support a budget  agreement that ensures that our men and women in uniform have the  resources they need to protect our country and that America's middle  class and working families have the tools they need to succeed. As part  of this agreement, we have always expected that the House and the  Senate would address the issue of DACA and our DREAMers.   ``Most of our Members believe that the budget agreement is a  reasonable compromise to address America's military strength and  critical domestic priorities, like fighting the opioid crisis, boosting  NIH, moving forward to resolve the pension crisis, caring for our  veterans, making college more affordable, and investing in childcare  for working families.''   Indeed, that is what the fight has been about all along. We have had  to fight the resistance on the Republican side to invest in the  domestic agenda. So I was pleased to hear some of our Republican  colleagues talk about some of the things in this bill that we, on the  Democratic side, insisted upon being there.   So, Mr. Speaker, we are writing again to request that you make a  public statement regarding the scheduling of a vote on the DACA bill.  That is our request. That is the request of the House Democrats that  Mr. Hoyer and Mr. Clyburn sent this letter last night: ``Our request is  that you publicly state that you will schedule a vote to consider the  bipartisan Hurd-Aguilar bill and any other DACA bills that you wish to  consider under a Queen of the Hill rule.   ``We strongly believe that Members of the House and their  constituents deserve the same dignity that Leader McConnell has  extended to Members of the Senate'' by stating that he will allow a  vote on this issue.   We asked him for his immediate attention to this issue, but we did  not receive that back.   I said earlier that America is the greatest country that ever existed  in the history of the world.   Aren't we proud to be Americans?   And what is America?   America is a country of great people of beautiful diversity that have  changed over time from the days of our Founders. ``E pluribus unum,''  they said. They could never imagine how pluribus it could be, how many,  how  [[Page H1068]]  many different people. Yet they established a Constitution that enabled  everyone the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. It  is a beautiful thing. Our country has become a more diverse country  over time, but still, e pluribus unum.   In this vote today, we are just saying to pay respect to the fact  that we are a nation of immigrants, constantly reinvigorated by  newcomers coming with their hopes, dreams, aspirations, courage to make  the future better for their families.   That is what America is about. That is what the optimism of our  Founders was based on, that every generation would take responsibility.  So these newcomers have made America more American.   Then who is America?   America is our great Constitution of the United States, a great  Constitution, which we take an oath to support.   And what else is America?   America is a great patrimony, this beautiful land that God has given  us to be stewards of. It is important to know that our country is our  50 States, the District of Columbia, and our territories.   In respect for that, I am very pleased that, in this bill, we were  successful in the negotiations to get more funding for the territories,  especially Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, an increase over what  was in the original disaster bill.   But there are other things that are important to note that are in  this bill. Again, opioids, mental health, National Institutes of  Health, these are Democratic priorities that we fought for. That is why  this took so long to come to fruition, because there was a resistance  on the Republican side to invest on the domestic side.   So they have been increasing the defense number, which we go along  with, but wanted commensurate increase on the domestic side,  recognizing the domestic side for us and our budget--appropriators know  this better than anyone--includes security functions, Homeland  Security, the State Department, Veterans Affairs, antiterrorism  activities of the Justice Department.   So there is much security on the domestic side. That is why we  insisted on increasing the number, and that did happen. That did  happen. That is why I am able to say in this letter that there are many  good things in this legislation.   But for some reason, sometimes I think the Speaker thinks he is  Speaker of the White House, not the Speaker of the House of  Representatives. We should have the opportunity--I touched a nerve  there, I hear--to have this House, the people's House, work its will,  not be the recipients of something that might--as he said: Well, if it  passes with 60 votes in the Senate and the President approves, then  maybe I will bring it to the floor.   That is not a commitment.   Just let me say again what an honor it is for any of us to associate  ourselves with the aspirations of the DREAMers in our country. They are  so magnificent. They are a model of patriotism to our country, and all  they wanted was the recognition of the Speaker of the House that they  are worthy of that.    In any event, I thank the various speakers who were presiding the  other day. I thank the speakers for their courtesies extended. I thank  the Chair, too, Mr. Speaker.   But here it is: Yes, I was one of the four principals with the White  House negotiating on this legislation. A lot of it came our way.   Do you know why?   Because nobody wants a shutdown.   This is a good bill. It doesn't do everything, but it is a  compromise. But the one thing and the one message to allay fear, to  build confidence, to honor the vows of our Founders that we could have  done is to say: We, the United States of America, in this people's  House, want to assure you that we will allow the House of  Representatives to work its will.   Let the chips fall where they may, but give us a chance to allay the  fear that is in the hearts of these DREAMers and their families and to  remove the tears from the eyes of the Statue of Liberty observing what  is happening here.
