 Mr. President, I come to the floor once again to discuss  the threats facing our country, the challenges confronting the brave  men and women of our Armed Forces. I feel compelled to remind my  colleagues about what is at stake because of our failure right here to  provide them the resources and equipment they need and deserve, placing  their lives at greater risk. That is not my opinion; it is the opinion  of the uniformed leaders of our country who have stated time after time  that because of our sequestration and our mindless meat ax, we are  putting the lives of the men and women who are serving our Nation in  uniform at greater risk.   Don't we have an obligation to try to stop that? Obviously, there is  not a majority here in the Senate who believes we should, to our  everlasting shame. Unless we change course, we will only continue that  failure.   We are about to vote on yet another Omnibus appropriations bill. It  is well over 1,000 pages. Look here; this is what we are about to vote  on without a single amendment--without a single amendment. Is there any  Member of the U.S. Senate who has read this? Is there any Member who  has read this bill of over $1 trillion that we are about to vote on?  Many of us are going to be compelled to vote for it because we don't  want to shut down the government again. The American people don't want  the government to shut down, no matter what some colleagues of mine  say. But here it is.   I challenge any of my colleagues to come to the floor and tell me  they have read this bill.   Is it any wonder that the American people are fed up with this way of  doing business? There are 1,000 pages--1,000 pages. That is what we are  going to vote on in a relatively short period of time--haven't read  it--no amendments.   I am sure there may be some provisions in this 1,000-page document  that Members would like to modify, like to add to. But what business  are we doing? What is the world's greatest deliberative body doing here  in a couple hours? We are going to vote yes or no on a 1,000-page  document. Shame on us. Shame on us.   Not a single appropriations bill--we have an Appropriations  Committee. They have their subcommittees. My friend and colleague from  Vermont is here and wants to talk about it. They churn out individual  bills. I believe there are 13 of them, one of them being Defense, by  the way. But all of that is without amendment, without debate on the  floor of the world's greatest deliberative body. Yet we are going to go  ahead and vote yes or no.   Many of us are going to vote yes because we don't want to shut down  the U.S. Government. We don't want to deprive our citizens of the  goods, services, and provisions that a government is supposed to  provide people. I don't want to shut down the Grand Canyon again, my  friends. I don't want to deprive people from all over the world the  ability to see the Grand Canyon. So what do we do? CRAs.   I am all in favor of repealing regulations that are onerous and bad  for America and small businesses and large. Is that a rationale for  what we are about to do?   I say to my friends on the other side of the aisle: You blocked many  of these bills that we wanted to bring to the  [[Page S2757]]  floor. You blocked them. Why? For what purpose? Of course, on this side  of the aisle, we have agreed to do something like that.   So I just say to my colleagues: You should not be curious when you  see the approval ratings of the Congress of the United States in the  teens.   Again, as I said, we will be blamed for putting our men and women in  uniform at greater risk. That is not John McCain's view; that happens  to be the opinion of our uniformed service Chiefs who are telling us  that when we are not funding the military, we are putting the lives of  the men and women serving at risk.   We passed the Budget Control Act 6 years ago as an attempt to address  our spending problem. This legislation led to a $443 billion cut to  defense. What has also happened? Deficits came down for a while, and we  are on track to return to $1 trillion deficits again in a matter of  years. The national debt is set at $20 trillion and has grown and will  continue to grow.   We slashed our military, friends. We slashed it. Yeah, great job, we  slashed the spending on the military. In fact, if you look, you will  see the only portion where there has been a reduction in spending is  where? Defense.   When you look at the past several years since sequestration, do you  think the world has gotten safer? Do you think the men and women who  are serving are better protected, better equipped?   We have 60 percent of our F-18s not flying. Why? No parts. We have  two submarines tied up at the pier for a year because they cannot leave  the pier. The Air Force is 1,000 pilots short.   What have we done? We have cut defense spending by 4 percent.  Meanwhile, the interest on the debt has increased by 7 percent;  nondefense, 19 percent; and the elephant in the room, the third rail  that none of us want to touch is mandatory spending; that is Social  Security and Medicare, primarily.   What have we done? We have shortchanged the men and women who are  serving in the military, trying to defend this Nation while nondefense  spending has gone up by 19 percent.   So the next time I hear one of my colleagues say: Well, we should  continue to cut defense spending because of the debt, we have already  done that. We have already shortchanged the men and women who are  defending this Nation.   Over the past 10 years, as I mentioned, mandatory spending has grown  by 56 percent, and defense has been cut by 4 percent.   The death spiral is occurring. We are in budget cuts with a high  operational tempo, and the military is now in a vicious cycle. The  death spiral works like this. This is the death spiral, OK? Constant  and frequent deployments increase costs. To send our men and women  overseas into harm's way increases costs. The more you fly the plane,  the more it costs to maintain the plane. The more you deploy a soldier,  the more you have to pay him or her to stay in the military.   When budget top lines are determined by politics and not  requirements, the Department of Defense has to make tradeoffs. For  example, the military may forgo buying military equipment to keep up  with wartime costs, but this exacerbates the problem. Our equipment  gets older as it is used more and the cost of maintaining aging  equipment skyrockets. Here is the death spiral, why the state of our  military is what it is today.   Three--count them--three of our Army brigades are at the highest  level of readiness. Four of 64 Air Force squadrons are ready to fight  tonight; that is four out of 64. Less than half of the Marine and Navy  planes are ready for combat. The Air Force has a pilot shortfall of  1,500--1,000 of which are fighter pilots. The Navy has a maintenance  backlog of 5.3 million days. The ship maintenance backlogs are so bad  that some ships are like the submarine USS Boise, which is tied up in  port and isn't qualified to dive and recently missed a deployment.   Look at this graphic. These are the aircraft--all of them that are  fully mission capable. These are the Army units that are ready to fight  tonight. This is the U.S. Air Force, and these depict the airplanes  ready to fight; Marine Corps aircraft, the same way.   So here we are with this situation, and what are we doing? We aren't  really addressing the issue because we are going to be faced in the  next year or so with the same budget problem of sequestration.   While this is happening, our enemies aren't sitting still. Our  adversaries are not waiting for this body to wake up to do its job and  act. While we have forced our military to make tradeoffs between  supporting immediate operational requirements and future modernization,  China, Russia, and other adversaries have been singularly focused on  developing military capabilities to target U.S. forces and take away  our unique military advantages.   Our military has multiple missions. Our adversaries have one mission,  and that is to undermine U.S. military superiority. I regret to inform  my colleagues that they are succeeding much more than we anticipated.   The fact is, the U.S. military advantage is eroding. National  Security Adviser GEN H.R. McMaster summed it up best when he testified  that the U.S. Army is outgunned and outranged. The reality is not much  different across the military services.   The President understands it. Rebuilding the military has been a  major priority for this administration, but we have to face the simple  fact that the military buildup proposed by this President is illegal  because the Budget Control Act forbids it. Over the next 4 years, the  Budget Control Act's caps on defense spending would leave President  Trump $216 billion short. Even President Obama's budget was $113  billion above the BCA caps, and that budget barely slowed the  deterioration of military readiness and capabilities.   I regret to say, Chairman Thornberry, the distinguished chairman of  the House Armed Services Committee, and I fare even worse against the  BCA. We believe that rebuilding our military will require a defense  budget of $640 billion in fiscal year 2018. Sustaining that level of  funding over the remaining years with the Budget Control Act would  require an additional $433 billion.   Give our men and women in uniform a budget that will allow them to  rise to meet the challenges of the 21st century. Congress must change  the Budget Control Act, and the only way to do that is with a  bipartisan budget agreement. As we stand here, there is no serious  conversation that I am aware of in this body or anywhere else in  Washington about what the agreement would look like or what it would  achieve.   The next 4 years can't be like the last 4 years. We must find a way  to provide the military with the resources they need and deserve to  perform the missions we assign them. We must provide them with the  timely authorization of appropriations bills. We must provide them with  something they have not had for years--certainty--so they can properly  plan and efficiently use taxpayers' dollars to defend the Nation.    What are we looking at right now?   We are going to pass this thing. It will pass. Then, in September-- how many months is that now? It is about 5 months from now--we are  going to be bumping up against the same ceiling and the threat of  shutting down the government. Are we going to wait until the beginning  of September before we start to address this or not? Is that the kind  of fiscal cowardice we are going to perform? We are going to see this  movie again and again and again and again unless we repeal the Budget  Control Act and start providing for the men and women who are serving  this Nation and the challenges we are facing, which any military expert  will tell you are the greatest they have been in 70 years. We have to  stop this.   We will paper over our failures with continuing resolutions. We will  cut piecemeal deals in the midnight hour that fail to fix the serious  challenges this country faces. We will accept these outcomes because  they are better than yearlong continuing resolutions or shutdowns. We  will clear the pitifully low bar of success we have set for ourselves,  and all the while, challenges we will have been charged to address will  only get worse. We have to break this cycle.   After several years of political gridlock, we know a bipartisan  budget deal will be necessary to pass appropriations bills. Let's try a  novel idea. Why don't we work on the deal now? Why  [[Page S2758]]  don't we sit down together, with all of us recognizing the challenges  to our national security, and fix this problem instead of kicking the  can down the road? My friends, if we do not, I guarantee you we will be  doing this same thing again in September. What is that? We will be  looking at another 1,000-page bill--1,000 pages that none of us has  read. Oh, I take it back. There may be four or five Senators who know  what is in it. Maybe 4, maybe 5, maybe as many as 8 out of 100 will  know about it. If we do not stop this, this is exactly the movie we are  going to see come September--not acceptable.   Don't we owe the men and women who are serving in uniform in harm's  way today--several of whom have just been killed in the last few days-- more than what we are giving them? Don't we owe them the best equipment  and the best training we can possibly provide them with rather than  their being dictated to by a meat-ax called sequestration? Don't we?   Mr. President, I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I come to the floor today deeply saddened  by the passing of my dear friend and fellow POW, Lt. Col. Leo  Thorsness. One of the greatest honors of my life was serving with Leo,  a man whose service exemplified selfless duty and devotion to others.  Leo earned the Medal of Honor for his heroism in a daring combat  mission in North Vietnam in 1967 when he flew directly into hostile  territory on dangerously low fuel in an attempt to rescue his comrades  who had been downed in an attack. Just 2 weeks after that courageous  mission, Leo's aircraft was shot down, and he was taken captive by  North Vietnamese soldiers. Leo would spend the next 6 years imprisoned,  including a full year in solitary confinement, and endure unspeakable  pain and suffering because of his steadfast adherence to our code of  conduct. However, Leo never let this experience break his spirit and  inspired the rest of us with his patriotism, perseverance, and hope  that we would someday be free.   After returning home, Leo continued to live a selfless life of  service, as a volunteer, State senator, and public speaker, with a  simple message: ``Do what's right--help others.'' I am forever grateful  for Leo's generosity, friendship, and example and, along with Cindy,  send my heartfelt condolences to Leo's wife, Gaylee, and their entire  family as we bid farewell to a genuine American hero.                            ____________________
