 Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Oregon.                    Retirement of Justice Anthony Kennedy    I would just say I have been planning to come to the floor about a  specific issue related to women's healthcare and rights and freedoms,  but before I get to that, I want to comment on the news that is clearly  very closely connected.   It is clear that Justice Kennedy's retirement comes at a pivotal  point in our Nation's history, when so many of our values are under  attack by a President who has spent every day in office testing the  limits of our Constitution.   I share the deep concern of so many families across this country who  are already suffering under the Trump administration and fear further  erosion of the progress in this country.   So, first, I want to be clear. I am hopeful that Republican leaders  go back and look at what they said very recently and give families  across the country the opportunity to weigh in with an election before  moving forward to fill this seat. We don't know whom President Trump  will nominate just yet or when he will make that nomination, but I want  to go back to something my dear friend and colleague Senator Kennedy  said because it highlights the stakes right now. He was talking about  an extreme nominee, Robert Bork. He said:         Robert Bork's America is a land in which women would be       forced into back-alley abortions, blacks would sit at       segregated lunch counters, rogue police could break down       citizens' doors in midnight raids, schoolchildren could not       be taught about evolution, writers and artists would be       censored at the whim of government, and the doors of the       federal courts would be shut on the fingers of millions of       citizens for whom the judiciary is often the only protector       of the individual rights that are at the heart of our       democracy.    Robert Bork was rejected, and Justice Kennedy took his place.   Today, we face similar stakes right now, in this moment. Voting  rights are at stakes. LGBTQ rights are at stake. The right to organize  collectively is at stake. Those are just a few. There are a lot more.   Families across the country are paying attention, and they are going  to be watching what President Trump and individual Members of this  Senate do right now. This is what they are going to want to know: Will  their rights be protected? Will their freedoms be secure? Will the  Supreme Court put people like them first, or will they stand with  special interests, big business, and the most extreme ideologues in our  country? Those are the questions people across this country will be  asking. That is the conversation I expect we will have here in the  Senate, and that is what President Trump should be considering as he  thinks about this issue and hopefully as he slows this down and gives  people across the country a chance to weigh in.                              Women's Healthcare    Mr. President, one issue I know women across the country will be  focused on and asking about is their constitutionally protected right  to control their own healthcare decisions affirmed in Roe v. Wade,  because, let me be clear, women and men in this country understand how  directly tied this right is to a woman's freedom and economic security,  and they overwhelmingly do not want to see that right rolled back.   Today is the anniversary of a ruling that further upheld women's  constitutionally protected reproductive rights, and I want to take a  few minutes today to discuss what this decision meant for women's lives  and why we will not stop fighting to protect the progress we have made.   Almost half a century ago, in its historic Roe v. Wade decision, the  Supreme Court ruled that every woman, no matter where she lives, has  the constitutional right to make her own decisions about her body, her  family, and her future, including the right to safe, legal abortion.  But a right means nothing without the ability to exercise it.   While Roe v. Wade has been the law of the land for years, extreme  conservatives have continually tried to undermine the Court's decision  by peddling ideological policies that would make it hard for women to  exercise their reproductive rights.   Women across the country have not been silent about these efforts and  neither has the Supreme Court. Two years ago, the Court reaffirmed the  rights enshrined in Roe v. Wade when it ruled in favor of Whole Woman's  Health and struck down an anti-abortion law in Texas that was designed  to make it harder for women to access the care they need.   The law in Texas attempted to undermine women's reproductive freedom  by putting access to that care far out of reach for women. If it had  been allowed to stand, the law would have closed three-quarters of the  clinics in the State that provided abortion services. If it had been  allowed to stand, hundreds of thousands of women would have no option  but to travel hundreds of miles for their reproductive health services.   The Texas law didn't stand; women's constitutional rights did. That  Supreme Court ruling sent a strong message, one women have been making  for years, and one we continue to make clear today: Politicians have no  business interfering with a woman's most personal decisions.   Unfortunately, many people on the right continue to ignore that  message. Unfortunately, they have continued to push for damaging,  extreme policies that ignore the Supreme Court, the Constitution, and  women across the country.   From day one, President Trump and Vice President Pence have made it  clear that turning back the clock on women's health and reproductive  rights is a top priority for them. They recently proposed a harmful  domestic gag rule on Federal family planning funds designed to restrict  access to healthcare for women, interfere with care providers' ability  to talk about the full range of reproductive health services with their  patients, and ultimately make it harder for women to exercise their  healthcare choices and constitutional rights.   That is just the latest of so many extreme and ideological steps,  statements, policies, and appointees that have repeatedly shown the  Trump administration's hostility to women's rights. We are still seeing  radical Republicans in many States pushing to put up new barriers, like  those that were struck down in the Whole Woman's Health case, to  prevent women from making their own healthcare decisions--barriers that  would allow perhaps a woman's ZIP Code or her income to determine  whether she is able to get the care she needs.   We are also still seeing that every time far-right politicians try  and bring us a step back, women and men across the country are stepping  forward and  [[Page S4487]]  speaking out against them, and that is not going to stop. We are going  to continue to defend women's reproductive rights, on all fronts and  against all attacks.   One effort to do that in Congress is the Women's Health Protection  Act--legislation I am very proud to cosponsor--that would help protect  women's constitutional rights to safe, legal abortion care and bring  down harmful, ideological barriers to that care, like the one struck  down in Texas, once and for all.   I remember being in the room when the Supreme Court heard the Whole  Woman's Health case and hearing the skepticism from many Justices as  they asked thoughtful questions about Texas's flimsy excuses for trying  to undermine women's rights. I remember being outside of the Court  shortly afterward and seeing all the women and men making their voices  heard and fighting for those rights. I remember being moved by the  personal stories shared by so many women about what the right to make  their own personal decisions meant for their health, for their family,  and their opportunities in life.   I am not going to let anyone forget those stories, including  President Trump, Vice President Pence, and far-right politicians across  the country. I am not going stop defending women's health and  reproductive freedoms. I am not going to stop fighting to make sure our  daughters and granddaughters have stronger rights and more opportunity,  not less. I am not going to stop, and I know women and men across the  country aren't going to either.   There is no question in my mind that people nationwide understand  just how important a woman's ability to control her own healthcare  decision is. This is not about politics. It is about women's health. It  is about their economic security, about a woman's ability to contribute  fully and equally in our country.   I am confident people across the country who do not want to go  backward will stand up and make their voices heard and reject President  Trump and Vice President Pence's extreme ideology wherever it rears its  head. I am hopeful that President Trump takes this to heart as he  thinks about his Supreme Court vacancy. I am hoping my Republican  colleagues are paying attention. I am truly hoping President Trump  decides to listen to people across the country, listen to what  Republicans just said recently, and not jam a nominee through before  people have a chance to weigh in.   I yield the floor.
