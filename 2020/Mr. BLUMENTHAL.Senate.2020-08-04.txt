 Mr. President, I am here with profound gratitude and  pride--first of all, gratitude to Senator Moran for his leadership, his  vision, his courage, and his steadfastness on a journey that had many  bumps. This task was far from easy intellectually, legally,  politically, and emotionally.  [[Page S4698]]  He stayed with it, and he demonstrated the spirit of bipartisanship  that I think will enable us, as partners, to achieve more but also  perhaps to reflect a model that this body may take in the future, even  as we go through one of the most difficult periods in the history of  the Senate.   I hope that the work that we have done on this bill, which affects  real lives and real people who suffered such grievous harm--and I will  begin where he ended and say that the heroes here are really the  athletes and survivors.   As extraordinary as is their performance on the field of athletic  endeavor and as wonderful as is their prowess and their grace, what  will last in history as their enduring legacy will be the courage and  strength they showed us again and again and again. They relived one of  the most deeply tragic and painful chapters of their lives.   As much as they celebrated victories in gymnastics and other sports,  they endured the abuse--emotional, physical, and other abuse--from  coaches and trainers whom they trusted. They put their trust in people  who betrayed them. It was more than just one coach--Larry Nassar. It  was more than just one sport--gymnastics. It was more than just 1 year  or one episode, and it was more than just one form of abuse.   Larry Nassar became the face of a pattern of systemic failure and  abuse, and he reflected a culture of putting medals and money above the  lives of athletes, prioritizing those tangible signs of victory above  the human lives that were impacted so adversely. Systemic failures were  reflected in Larry Nassar's success in terrorizing these young  athletes, and it affected other trainers and other coaches who  similarly betrayed trust. It affected other sports: figure skating,  swimming, as well as gymnastics. None were immune from the sexual,  physical, or emotional abuse.   Almost exactly a year ago, Senator Moran and I issued the report that  he just showed on the floor of the Senate showing that this  investigation into sexual abuse in gymnastics and the Olympic movement  should lead to a bill. I thank not only Senator Moran for his  partnership but also other colleagues, as he has mentioned: Senator  Wicker, Senator Thune, Senator Shaheen, Senator Feinstein, as well as  Senator Peters and Senator Cortez Masto. Each of them provided very  important assistance in this effort.   But most importantly--and I simply cannot say it enough times--the  real heroes here are the athletes who shared their stories and stood  steadfast in the face of betrayals from the very organizations that  were supposed to protect them. These survivors were failed at every  level by their doctors, by their coaches, by the U.S. Olympic and  Paralympic Committee, and by the national governing boards of their  individual sports. The gymnasts who survived Larry Nassar's abuse were  also failed by Michigan State University, by the FBI, and by local  police departments. Given the monumental abdication of responsibility  from countless people in power, no one could have blamed them for  surrendering hope that change was possible. But against those odds,  they persevered, and they are the reason that we have passed this bill  today. They stood with us--physically stood with us--on so many  occasions, evoking their suffering and pain.   I ask unanimous consent that the names of 140 of the Larry Nassar  survivors be printed in the Record with my remarks so that history will  forever remember their bravery and strength   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                 List of Survivors of Larry Nassar's Abuse         Kyle Stephens, Jessica Thomashow, Chelsey Markham, Jade       Capua, Alexis Moore, Olivia Cowan, Rebecca Mark, Bethany       Bauman, Kate Mahon, Danielle Moore, Marion Siebert, Annette       Hill, Taylor Stevens, Amanda Cormier, Jennifer Rood Bedford,       Nicole Soos, Ashley Erickson, Melissa Imrie, Megan Halicek,       Katelyn Skrabis, Brianne Randall.

Mr. President, I would like to recognize the 193  additional survivors who have chosen not to be identified publicly by  name. They, too, contributed to this cause, and they, too, deserve to  be recognized, as do survivors in the future who will come forward  under the tools and mechanisms that we are establishing today. They  should be recognized, valued, and cherished for their courage in the  future, as well as the past.   Over these past years, Senator Moran and I heard again and again and  again that the USOPC and the NGBs have failed their athletes at every  turn. Men and women in these organizations knew what was happening, and  they did nothing. They already had a legal duty under the law to report  what was going on. Clearly, laying out in the law what should be  obvious--that you must report allegations of sexual misconduct  involving minors--was not enough for them. They betrayed not only their  trust to these athletes but their legal and moral responsibilities.   The bill that we have passed today provides for enforcement and  deterrence, and it gives Congress essential oversight tools to assure  that the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee and NGBs will comply  with the heightened standards that this bill spells out. No one in  these organizations can plausibly claim ignorance now of the duty to  report these heinous crimes, and, if they try, Congress has the ability  and responsibility to intervene.   This bill also ensures that SafeSport, the organization tasked with  investigating and adjudicating reports of athlete abuse, has the  resources and independence it needs to do its vital work. The U.S.  Olympic and Paralympic Committee should play no role in determining how  much money the organization charged with investigating its members'  worst crimes will receive each year or how that organization is run.  Once this bill is signed into law, SafeSport will be independent of the  resource and other powers that have prevailed in the past.   The bill enacts numerous other reforms that ensure that athlete  safety and well-being are prioritized in the Olympic movement. It  assures that morals and athletes' interests are put first and that  medals and money do not take the place of athletes and their interests.   I want to finish by stressing the urgency of this task. I urge the  House to follow our model here and move in a bipartisan way to enact  these measures.   The Tokyo Games have been delayed until next year, but it is  essential that our framework go into effect as soon as possible and  that athletes be given the protection they need and deserve. The  urgency of this task should be shared by the House.   My hope is that the survivors of these horrible abuses, who have  waited years for this act, will see it happen during this session and  as soon as possible.   I want to say finally how grateful I am to my staff. Thank you to  Anna Yu,  [[Page S4699]]  Madeline Daly, Adam Bradlow, Subhan Cheema, Natalie Mathes, Charlotte  Schwartz, Colleen Bell, and Maria McElwain.   I want to join in thanking Senator Moran's staff. Our staffs worked  together with the teamwork that I think can also provide a model for  this body.   Finally, this act is profoundly important to the future of Olympic  athletes and sports generally in our country. In effect, it says that  trainers and coaches, the organizations that represent them--the  organizations that are supposed to care for athletes should do their  jobs and keep their trust for these athletes; protect them, not betray  them; put them ahead of whatever the other tangible signs of success  may be, medals or money. It would depend on protective, strong  enforcement and on deterrence.   My hope is that we will look back on this day and say that it  transformed this athletic endeavor; that it was a transformative  moment; that it changed the culture, not just the rule; that it changed  the way sports in the United States are played; and that it embodied  the best values of competition and athletics in our great country.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.
