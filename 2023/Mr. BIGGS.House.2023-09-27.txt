 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise to speak in support of my amendment that  cuts $300 million in funding for the Ukraine Security Assistance  Initiative. I encourage all of my colleagues to support that.   The fiscal year 2024 Defense Appropriations bill authorizes a total  $826.45 billion in new discretionary spending. This figure is $28.71  billion or 3.6 percent more than the fiscal year 2023 enacted level.   Currently, the United States has committed over $113 billion in  military, economic, and humanitarian assistance to protect Ukraine's  border, but we can't fund our own border to protect our citizens from  the fentanyl pouring across our southern border that is killing over  290 Americans daily, and the trafficking that the Mexican cartels are  engaging in.   Mr. Chair, I find myself asking this question: How is it that we are  willing to send over $100 billion to Ukraine, and in this bill an  additional $300 million, but we can't spend the money or find the  ability and will to secure our own border?   With no end in sight, we cannot continue to blank-check fund a war  when this administration said that we are going to stay there as long  as it takes and spend as much as it takes. We don't really know why we  are there, but we have morphed into a regime-change objective.   I would ask: What does that regime change look like? How are you  going to get there? What is going to be the extent of our  participation?   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, it is interesting to hear that. I appreciate  those comments. Explain to me, then, how this administration and our  allies have lost contact and cannot provide a full accounting of all of  the money we have sent and all the materiel we have sent.   Here is an example of that: When we talk about insufficient oversight  of funding going towards Ukraine, the Pentagon has overestimated the  value of the weapons it has sent to Ukraine by $6.2 billion over the  past 2 years. They have overestimated it.   How have central African nations reported that U.S. materiel has been  found in the hands of warlords in their areas, in their own countries,  rebellious warlords fighting them with U.S. materiel?  [[Page H4599]]    How is it that we have gone from supplying surplus to supplying our  own inventory, where our own stocks are going to take in some instances  7 to 10 years to rebuild, to put our own Nation in jeopardy?   The democratic peace theory was debunked 20 years ago, and that is  the argument I heard today; basically, the democratic peace theory.  That was utterly debunked.   This administration has also provided no explanation on what the  objective is, what does it look like. The objective is to stay as long  as it takes. What does that mean? Another 20-, 30-year war that we are  participating in funding? Not only as long as it takes, but as much as  it takes.   We are $33 trillion in debt. Our structural deficit this year is  going to be more than $2 trillion. It will be that next year. Our  interest cost is $700 billion. Everything we are sending to Ukraine, we  are borrowing. It is our children and grandchildren who are effectively  paying for this.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Crane), a great American.    Mr. Chair, in closing, our national interests are best  rooted in solving our national debt crisis, which has been determined  by many national security leaders as being our number one security  threat. I urge Congress to adopt this amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I rise to speak in support of my amendment,  which prohibits the use of funds to pay the salary and expenses of CISA  Director Jen Easterly.   It is no secret at this point that this administration is waging war  on conservative voices, and Jen Easterly has been at the tip of the  Biden administration's spear to censor American speech.   In the recent case decision of Missouri v. Biden, Judge Doughty  specifically pointed out Ms. Easterly's targeting of conservative  speech for censorship. In fact, Ms. Easterly's censorship efforts were  so explicit and pervasive that Judge Doughty believed that the  plaintiffs in the case are likely to succeed in their claims against  Ms. Easterly and the other Biden administration officials.   This was affirmed recently by the Fifth Circuit. On September 6,  2023, they wrote, ``CISA, however, did flag content. Beyond holding  regular industry meetings with the platforms, CISA officials engaged in  `switchboarding' operations, meaning they acted as an intermediary for  a third-party group by forwarding flagged content from them to the  platforms.''   For her part, Ms. Easterly has both worked with and in some cases  coerced social media platforms to take down and suppress posts that  don't fit into the administration's idea of what the truth is. We know  this because Ms. Easterly herself has said that conservative opinions  that question the administration are not truth but are instead  alternative facts and are dangerous to national security, implying that  terms like truth are for her and the administration to define. She and  other members of the administration have ordered the removal of posts  about Hunter Biden's laptop, the COVID lab-leak theory, the  ineffectiveness of masks and the vaccine, questions about the security  of the 2020 election and future elections, and the state of the  economy. Most of that has been proven objectively to be true, but she  suppressed it as well as suppressing a variety of other posts, which  happened to be inconvenient for the Biden administration.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, not only has Ms. Easterly already suppressed  many conservative voices, she has stated that she is preparing to do  the same thing again for the 2024 election; not somebody else in the  administration, not somebody else in CISA, Ms. Easterly has said this.  This continuous and purposeful censorship of conservative voices must  stop.   Just as we saw in the last amendment with Secretary Mayorkas, using  the Holman rule helps us do our job and do our duty.   In July, Federal Judge Doughty of the Western District of Louisiana  gave a memo decision in the case of the State of Missouri v. Joseph R.  Biden, Jr. As part of his conclusions, Judge Doughty stated multiple  times that it was likely the plaintiffs in this case will prevail on  their ultimate case of censorship and suppression of conservative  voices by the Biden administration.   The primary means of censorship by the defendants in the case was by  colluding with and in some cases ordering social media companies to ban  conservative individuals on their platforms and to take down posts  which dared to question the Biden administration on a number of  important issues.   Among the defendants listed by Terry Doughty as having directed this  purposeful policy of censorship are CISA Director Jen Easterly. I urge  my colleagues to join me in this important endeavor of holding someone  accountable. I don't know what more we need to do, but certainly we  should hold Ms. Easterly accountable.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I appreciate the two-on-one here. No, that is  fine. I am just kidding you guys.   Here is the deal. Not only is this critical that you hold people  accountable, but this person, this Director lied in response to a  question from Representative Cloud on this particular issue, on these  issues that we were talking about in testimony in the approps oversight  hearing earlier this year.   It is my opinion that if we fail to hold this person accountable,  then we are going to see like things happen in the future. When you  provide a specific deterrent, you also provide a general deterrent, and  that is the way a justice system works. That is the way you hold people  accountable.   Mr. Chair, in closing, I appreciate my colleagues who don't want to  see this  [[Page H4677]]  done. It is not unconstitutional to do this. This is a good way to hold  people accountable. That is one of the jobs of the United States  Congress, to hold people accountable.   What did the Founders give us? They gave us the purse strings. In  this instance, it seems to me that this individual should have her  salary eliminated.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, this may seem like Groundhog Day, but I am  going anew. I rise to speak in support of my amendment which prohibits  the use of funds to pay the salary and expenses of CISA Director of  Election Security Initiative Geoffrey Hale.   As outlined in Judge Doughty's memo decision in the Missouri v. Biden  case, as Director Hale worked with social media companies to censor  conservatives who speak out against the Biden administration, he was  singled out by the judge.   Under the guise of protecting national security and election  integrity, Mr. Hale and his team purposely suppressed social media  posts that went against the Biden administration's view of what they  considered the truth to be.   CISA seems to believe itself to be the ultimate arbiter of truth,  ordering social media companies to suppress and ban posts and users  that dare to question their side of the story, that dare to speak up  for what they believe. Listen to what I am saying, please.   That is what was going on in the agency that was supposed to protect  cybersecurity and our elections.   The blatant censorship by Mr. Hale and others of constitutionally  protected speech has got to end. It is the weaponization of government  against the American people. It is up to us to stand up against that.   I urge my colleagues to join me in passing this amendment. At some  point we are going to have to recognize that we need to hold people  accountable.   Now, I appreciate my colleagues who oppose this, but I will just tell  you something. I don't think we can say we can't do this in the  appropriations bill. We have already done something else in the  appropriations bill. We just passed by voice vote a defunding of the  Secretary of Homeland Security. Why cannot we hold these people  accountable? I think we can.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I again appreciate my colleagues and their  position. I fundamentally disagree. You have a heavy burden when you  are going to enjoin people. When this case came before the court, the  CISA Director of Election Security Initiative, Geoffrey Hale, was one  of the defendants that was found to be one of the officials of this  administration that was engaged in a clear and focused policy of using  the Department of Homeland Security to stop conservatives from  questioning the Biden administration on social media, even if it meant  censoring constitutionally protected speech.   I guess we have a fundamental difference here. I appreciate and  understand what my colleagues who oppose this measure are saying, but I  am just not certain what we are going to do then. How are we going to  stand up to an administration where every institution of this  administration has been weaponized: FBI, DOJ, Department of Education,  the border security leadership.                                time  1945    We have CISA and the people who are running CISA leading areas that  are systematically suppressing speech and censoring speech.   This isn't me saying it. It is a court of law saying it after  evidentiary hearings. It is through admissions, through discovery of  these individuals. That is why these individuals lost in court, but  there is no other way to hold them accountable.   Holding an administration accountable is one thing, but holding an  individual accountable for systematically participating in violations  of our First Amendment rights, this is the way we do it. This is the  way we should do it.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to join me, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise to speak in support of my amendment,  which prohibits the use of funds to pay the salary and expenses of the  DHS Under Secretary for the Office of Strategy, Policy, and Plans,  Robert Silvers.   Much of my argument is the same. In a court hearing, they are found  to have violated the free speech rights of Americans systematically.  They are going to lose in court, and we have an opportunity to hold  them accountable.   I feel the need to try to throw maybe a slider instead of a fastball.  I am reminded of George Mason, who said many years ago something to the  effect that because individuals can be punished and rewarded in Heaven  but nations can't, nations need to be held accountable on Earth. I am  now making an appeal that we hold individuals where we can accountable  on Earth.   What we have are people who systematically defied the rights of  American citizens for no other reason than they didn't like what was  being said about the administration. They politicized their position,  and we are going to hold them accountable. I thought it was $17 million  or something like that that was going to come off their overall budget.  Maybe I am off on that--$19 million? I was pretty close.   Let me give you another example. Somebody said recently that they  will take responsibility for that, for a problem that this  administration was doing. That begs the question: How did you take  responsibility for it? You can't just say, ``I take responsibility. I  take the full blame.'' No. What did you do? What did you do to take  blame? Were you fired? Were you reprimanded? What happened?   If you don't hold people accountable, they will persist. There is a  theory of punishment in criminal law--and I practiced criminal law--and  it was, why do you have punishment and sentencing at all? You have  punishment and sentencing for public safety. That is one reason.   You also have two kinds of deterrents. You have a general deterrent  and a specific deterrent. If you have a specific deterrent, you are  trying to teach that individual that that conduct is not acceptable and  cannot happen again, so you punish them in whatever way you can that is  appropriate. A general deterrent is when the entire society--in this  instance, it is the Federal bureaucracy that says, if we do that, we  are subject to specific deterrents--in other words, maybe even the  elimination of our position, elimination of our salary, whatever it may  be.   If we don't hold people accountable, this action will persist because  there will be no specific or general deterrents.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, may I inquire as to the time remaining.    Mr. Chair, I appreciate my colleague talking about the  border. I wasn't going to bring up the border because that is not what  my main beef is with this amendment. My beef was about the censorship  of U.S. citizens, but if you want to talk border, let's talk border.   I have to clear up one fact that I hear so often from my colleagues  across the aisle. When they say something like 90 percent of all the  fentanyl that is coming across the border is seized at ports of entry,  that is a total sham statement. Ninety percent of interdictions take  place at ports of entry, not 90 percent of the drugs coming across.   Why do you stop 90-plus percent at the ports of entry? Because that  is where the X-ray machines are, where the dogs are, where the  personnel is.   You have all the equipment, but do you know where you don't have  equipment? How about the 62-linear miles of the Tohono O'odham Nation  Reservation in southern Arizona, which is one of the busiest drug and  human trafficking corridors in the world?   This Under Secretary has not secured the border. That is two strikes.   I want to get back to the CISA argument because we have an individual  who systematically is okay with censoring United States citizens who  are exercising First Amendment rights, but if we want to talk border, I  will be here till hell freezes over to talk about why we need to make  changes in the Homeland Security folks on the border.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise to speak in support of my amendment,  which  [[Page H4679]]  prohibits the use of funds to pay the salary and expenses of the DHS  Assistant Secretary for Counterterrorism and Threat Prevention,  Samantha Vinograd.   When she was senior adviser for national security, Ms. Vinograd took  her role of surveilling and stopping terrorist threats against our  Nation and turned it on the American people.   As outlined by Judge Doughty in his memo ruling in the Missouri v.  Biden case, Ms. Vinograd and her colleagues purposefully and  systematically targeted American conservatives who dared to exercise  their right of freedom of speech.   This is on issues that later proved to be accurate objectively,  ranging from COVID-19 origins, lab leak theory, the Hunter Biden  laptop. The DHS explicitly sought to suppress statements and posts that  made the Biden administration look bad.   Turning the counterterrorism role of the DHS on the American people  and engaging in explicit government censorship of constitutionally  protected speech constitutes a major breach of trust.   Despite this--or, more likely, because of it--Ms. Vinograd was  promoted. She wasn't held accountable.   The court names her as a responsible defendant for this activity. She  wasn't held responsible. She was promoted to Assistant Secretary for  Counterterrorism and Threat Prevention.   In her new position, Ms. Vinograd is no doubt even more of a threat  to conservatives who wish to exercise their constitutional right of  freedom of speech.   Unelected bureaucrats like Ms. Vinograd cannot be allowed to continue  to censor Americans and to decide for themselves what is worthy of  being called the truth.   Mr. Chair, I urge the passage of my amendment.   Now, I want to add something different this time, as well. Elected  officials have an accountability measure built in. Leave out  impeachment or anything else, our voters elect us. They look at us with  scrutiny. We stand before them. We tell them what we intend to do. They  look at our record to see how successful we were in doing what we said  we would do. You do not have the same ability with a bureaucrat.   The reason that we know about these things, as we began to see these  things, is you had an attorney general and several attorneys general  come together and file a lawsuit, and a court, in looking at the  discovery and taking evidence, said the plaintiffs here, the attorneys  general, the States, are going to probably win this. Why? Because  people like this bureaucrat, Ms. Vinograd, abused her authority and  violated the constitutional rights of American citizens. Seems to me  that someone like that should not be in the pay of the American  Government.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, may I inquire how much time is remaining.    Mr. Chairman, I would rebut a couple of things. When you  quote statistics saying 94 percent of all drugs coming into the country  are stopped at interior checkpoints or ports of entry, that is an  inaccurate statement. It is 94 percent of drugs that are interdicted,  that we catch, that is where you catch them.   Why do you catch them there? I mean, this is not rocket science. You  catch them there because you have personnel there. You have drug- sniffing dogs. You have X-ray machines that are looking at trucks. You  have personnel there.   But I will tell you what you don't have. Come with me to San Miguel  Gate.   I have been all over southern Texas. I have been all over southern  Arizona and Southern California. Come with me to San Miguel Gate. There  is nothing near the San Miguel Gate. The nearest town south of the  border is Caborca; that is 2 hours away.   You know what happens? You have more got-aways, known and unknown,  through that sector than anywhere else in the country.   Good grief. They don't want to be caught because they are the ones  that are bringing in drugs and human trafficking. That is just kind of  a fallacious argument.   The next thing is when you say, only two people voted to increase  Homeland Security funding, it was because it was an omnibus bill. You  had every Christmas tree ornament in the world on that puppy, just  enough to drive every Republican off but two.   Yeah, if we had done 12 bills like so many of us advocate, you might  have seen a different thing. You might have seen a kind of a joinder of  stuff. This does not violate the Bill of Attainder provision of the  Constitution. It doesn't violate a court decision. What this is is  adherence to the Holman Rule?   Mr. Chairman, I urge adoption, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, at the risk of sounding like a broken  record, I rise in support of my amendment, which prohibits the use of  funds to pay the salary and expenses of DHS Director of the  Departmental GAO-OIG liaison office Jim Crumpacker.  [[Page H4680]]    Director Crumpacker leads DHS's Department of OIG liaison office, an  office tasked with maintaining mutually beneficial and productive  relations with GAO and the OIG. That is what Mr. Crumpacker stated in  testimony before the Senate several years ago.   Unfortunately, under the Biden administration, that mutually  beneficial and productive relationship has broken down completely.   DHS continues to obstruct oversight by its own inspector general in  violation of the agency's obligations under the Inspector General Act.   Last year, then-Ranking Member Comer and Oversight Committee  Republicans opened an investigation into reports that the Department of  Homeland Security was obstructing efforts by their inspector general to  conduct oversight over DHS programs and policies consistent with its  obligations under the Inspector General Act.   At the time the letter was sent, committee Republicans had uncovered  a memo circulated to Customs and Border Protection employees, which  essentially encouraged CBP employees to resist OIG's request for access  to CBP systems.   Think of that. You have a memo going out to CBP employees saying,  Don't cooperate with the OIG. The memo falsely claimed that OIG's  access to information was not unlimited, contrary to the statute,  incorrectly relying on a statute that limited public disclosure of  information.   To be clear, the Inspector General Act contains no such limitation.   DHS/OIG has a statutory mandate to have timely access to all records,  reports, audits, reviews, documents, papers, recommendations, or other  materials from DHS components, with only a narrow national security  exemption that requires Congressional notification. Unfortunately, DHS  continues to slow-walk and stonewall oversight efforts.   In June, Inspector General Cuffari came to committee and testified  under oath that:   Since the fall of 2021, DHS/OIG has consistently reported DHS delays  and denials of DHS/OIG's request for information.   These are requests for information allowed under statute, and a  response is mandated. These are requests for information that our more  than 700 career professionals need in order to do their jobs in the OIG  offices and which DHS is required to provide to DHS/OIG consistent with  the statute.   I remain hopeful that DHS will improve its responsiveness to our  requests for information so that DHS/OIG can continue to provide  Congress and the public robust and timely oversight with the words that  Inspector General Cuffari said.   I appreciate his optimism, but after nearly 3 years, Congress may  need to start twisting some arms.   This is the place, this is the individual who has put his thumb on  the scale to prevent that information from going to the inspector  general, information that we need, and we need the results of that OIG  report.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, may I inquire how much time is remaining.    Mr. Chair, let's litigate the border some more, and let's  talk about how these things get funded.   If that is the new deal that you throw an omnibus bill because you  don't bother to do your 12 bills and you are going to say, Oh, you  voted against something, then we should start talking about all of the  bad programs and policies that you all voted for in that omnibus bill  that has left us with $2 trillion in deficit this year. That is what  you did. You added $2 trillion to the national debt.   Mr. Chair, the bottom line is they have an individual here, Mr.  Crumpacker, who has basically said we are not going to provide  information to the DHS-OIG.   What are we going to do about it? We are going to say, Oh, that is  just too bad. That is too bad.   Mr. Chair, we have a massive border problem. I don't even think my  colleague across the aisle would disagree with that.   Last Friday in the Rules Committee, the gentleman from Massachusetts  said there was no border crisis. I thought that was intriguing. You got  11,000 people rolling through the Tucson sector. Those are the  encounters. They don't get those kinds of groups in Tucson because they  are getting the runners. But you know what, the whole border is in  disarray, and that is between the ports of entry.   That is your ports of entry that you are so pleased with. You have  the CBP One app bringing people in by the tens of thousands. I think we  need to hold Mr. Crumpacker responsible.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I rise to speak in support of my amendment,  which prohibits the use of funds to pay the salary and expenses of DHS  Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas.   I want to speak about Secretary Mayorkas. I want to speak about what  has happened at the border. By the time we are standing here today, you  have millions and millions of people who have come through illegally  into our country, and what they have done is they have surrendered.   In the meantime, you have at least 2.5 million people who have not  surrendered and who have escaped into the country.   I have asked Secretary Mayorkas, I brought him to a Border Security  Caucus. I said: Secretary, do you know what the Secure Fence Act of  2006 says?  [[Page H4681]]    Can you tell me, do we have operational control of the border?   He says: Oh, yeah, we have operational control of the border.   Okay. Then how come you have set a record every month?   At that point, he had set a record every month, from February 2021;  every month a new record. In fact, last month we had another new  record: 304,000 encounters.   We brought him into the Committee on the Judiciary. He is under oath  at that point.   Do you know what the definition of operational control of the border  is?                                time  2015    Oh, yeah.   Do we have it?   Yeah, we have it.   Then, Mr. Secretary, why in the world are we seeing literally tens of  thousands of people, 8 to 9,000 most days, some days 10, 12, 13,000  people? That is a violation of that act.   He says, Look, we have control.   The last time we had him in, what, just a month, month-and-a-half  ago: Mr. Secretary, hey, do you have operational control?   And he says, Yeah.   We bring out the poster with the statute again and said, Hey, take a  look at the statute.   He says, Oh, no, no. We don't have operational control with that. We  have defined our own operational control.   That is the kind of person that needs to be held accountable.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr.  Scalise), our distinguished majority leader, who we are so happy to see  with us on the floor tonight.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, may I inquire as to the time remaining.    Mr. Chair, let's talk about which side wants to get  something done on the border. I keep hearing about the magnificent omni  bill. How many Democrats voted for H.R. 2 in this House? Not one. Don't  tell me that you care about the border. You didn't vote to secure the  border with H.R. 2.   When you say Americans are importing the drugs, first of all, you got  it wrong again. I don't think you are listening. Ninety-two percent of  the drugs they catch, that is what they catch. It is what they  interdict. That is what they stop. That is who they arrest. That takes  place at the ports of entry. That ain't where 92 percent of the drugs  are coming through.   They are coming through the places wide open where there is no  fencing in Arizona. We don't have the river. We have four-strand  barbed-wire fence in places. They are coming through there. It is  considered the number one drug trafficking corridor in the world.   Don't be telling me that we are stopping 92 percent of the drugs  because we are not. Don't show me a heat map of where people are coming  through in Texas. That is xenophobic. You need to spread out. Don't be  so parochial.   Let's go to Arizona. I will take you to Cocopah. We will stand right  there. Literally hundreds of people walk on through. They are not  coming from the Northern Triangle states. They are coming from  Mauritania. They are coming from Mali and Togo. They are coming from  all over the world.   Don't say that you guys care about the border because you are not  doing a damn thing to stop it.   What is happening on the border is a crisis. It is the largest mass  migration in the history of this entire world. It is time you join us  and bring it under control because it is bringing crime.   Laredo is great. Good.   Do you know what they are releasing in Cochise County now? Secretary  Mayorkas is calling them freedom runs. We are just going to release  people into the community and call them freedom runs.   Mr. Chair, it is time to do something, and I urge my colleagues to  vote for my amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise to speak in support of my amendment,  which prohibits the use of funds in furtherance of the public charge  ground of inadmissibility rule.   Section 212 of the Immigration and Nationality Act states that any  alien who is likely at any time to become a public charge is  inadmissible for entry or a readjustment of status. Any alien at any  time who might become a public charge is inadmissible for entry or even  for readjustment of status. Think about that.   Someone is a public charge if they are likely to become primarily  dependent on the government for subsistence, as demonstrated by either  receipt of public cash assistance for income maintenance or  institutionalization for long-term care at government expense.   The primary factor that the DHS is supposed to look at when  determining if someone is or will likely be a public charge is the  likelihood that the person will be reliant on government benefits and  services, such as Medicaid and SNAP.   This past December, the DHS greatly reduced the number of public  benefits considered when determining whether an immigrant is or will be  a public charge and thus inadmissible for entry or permanent residency.   The Trump administration rightly included programs such as SNAP,  housing vouchers, and Medicaid in its determinations on whether an  individual would be a public charge. However, President Biden and  Secretary Mayorkas have decided that not only should we take in  thousands of illegal aliens every day but that they should receive the  same benefits that thousands of struggling Americans rely on and that  those same Americans should pay for it.   The American ideals of self-sufficiency and personal responsibility  have always been the spirit of our immigration law. It is in this  spirit that Congress decided that immigrants who are likely to become a  public charge are ineligible for admittance or permanent residency.  However, under this new rule, individuals who are reliant on a number  of government benefits can be considered self-sufficient when applying  for renewal or adjustment of status.   The DHS' new rule is not only costly to the American taxpayer but  also directly incentivizes hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens to  cross the southern border and come into our country.   It seems to me that Secretary Mayorkas is not only negligent and  reckless with securing the border, but he is also negligent and  reckless with the American taxpayers' hard-earned money.   That is why I am calling to stop any funding for the DHS' new public  charge rule until they secure our border and start acting in the best  interests of the American people.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I urge the passage of my amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise to speak in support of my amendment.   My amendment prohibits the use of funds to implement a TSA vaccine or  mask mandate. For years, the Biden administration subjected millions of  Americans to draconian vaccine and mask mandates, even when the science  showed these mandates did very little.   I remember at one point having literally meta studies and individual  studies showing the inefficacy of masks, but we were nonetheless  compelled to wear masks.   Now, we are beginning to hear the same people and institutions  suggesting again that we need to start looking at public vaccine and  mask mandates due to small rises in COVID. This must be coming up on an  election year or something.   Specifically, there is talk about TSA mandating people who wish to  fly to wear a mask or be vaccinated. These types of mandates are just  another form of overreach by this power-grabbing administration, and  the American people are not going to put up with it for a second time.   Americans make calculated decisions about their health risks every  day. You just saw the great   Steve Scalise come down, with a judgment  of his own health risk, so he could participate on the floor in  something that is meaningful to him. We all make those types of  decisions about our health risks every day.   The last thing they need is for unelected bureaucrats to tell them  once again when they can and cannot fly, especially since we now know  the actual efficacy, or I should say ineffectiveness, of the vaccine  and masks.   These calls to renew vaccine and mask mandates are coming from the  same people such as Anthony Fauci, who relished controlling the day-to- day lives of Americans and profited off it.   Americans have had enough. This is why we must ensure that neither  President Biden, Anthony Fauci, or any other bureaucrat can force  Americans to get a vaccine or wear a mask just to exercise their right  to travel.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I think this does belong in this bill. TSA is  in this bill, and this is an important policy. I urge the passage of my  amendment to stop any funds from being used to implement a TSA vaccine  or mask mandate.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
