 Mr. President, before I talk about what I came here to  talk about, let me add my congratulations once again to the vice  chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Senator Leahy, and to Senator  Collins, both of whom are critical members of the Appropriations  Committee. They have gotten us much further than we have gotten in the  last 15 years when it comes to the appropriations process.   I am optimistic that we will be able to wrap this up tomorrow. If we  do, the Senate will have voted to fund 87 percent of discretionary  spending. The last time we sent him an appropriations bill, the  President told us: Don't send me another omnibus. He is exactly right.  Omnibus appropriations bills are the worst way to do business; maybe  close behind that is a continuing resolution.   We are not doing our job if we don't act in a bipartisan way to move  these appropriations bills forward, especially since we have agreed to  the spending caps.   I would just congratulate all the members of the Appropriations  Committee--Chairman Shelby and all of the committee--for their good  work.                             Army Futures Command    Mr. President, tomorrow I will be heading back home to Austin where,  on Friday, I will be attending the activation ceremony for the new Army  Futures Command. The establishment of this command, which began  operations last month, is the most significant Army reorganization  since 1973. Its new headquarters is in the capital of Texas--Austin. It  will make that the epicenter of Army technology development.   So what does the Army Futures Command do? How does it fit into the  existing organizational structure? Why is it necessary?   Let's start with what it does. It seeks to modernize the Army,  period. It will do this by leveraging commercial innovation, science  and technology, and delivering them to warfighters in useful, cutting- edge ways. In a world with rapidly evolving threats distinct from  others we have faced throughout our Nation's history, the Futures  Command could not come at a more pivotal time.   The Army chose Austin because it wanted to be close to a hub of  innovation, which Austin certainly is these days. It has roughly 6,500  high-tech companies nestled among what is affectionately referred to as  ``Silicon Hills.'' We have Silicon Valley and Silicon Hills.   There are major academic institutions nearby, like the University of  Texas in Austin, St. Edward's, Texas State, and Texas A&M, with  thousands of students graduating each year with degrees in STEM  fields--science, technology, engineering, and math.   It is also worth noting that Austin has become a hub for startup  culture and is ground zero when it comes to useful talent,  technological ingenuity, and path-breaking ideas that are changing  industries, institutions, and what our normal ways of doing things were  in the past. What sometimes people refer to as ``disruption''-- certainly, we have seen that.   But Austin, let's not forget, is also a military city. We know Camp  Mabry is there, the headquarters of the Texas Army and Air National  Guards, and the Texas State Guard. Not far away is the ``Great Place''  called Fort Hood, as well as Joint Base San Antonio to the south.   Those military installations will now be joined by the Army Futures  Command in Austin, giving the bustling, live music capital of the world  an entirely new brand and reason for attention. If San Antonio, my home  town, is ``Military City, USA,'' you might call Austin ``Military  Innovation City, USA.''   You might be wondering how the Army Futures Command fits into the  existing organizational designs of our military. In short, it  complements the Army's three other four-star headquarters: the Forces  Command, Training and Doctrine Command, and Army Materiel Command.   The first of those trains and prepares combat-ready soldiers. The  second is essentially the Army's architect. It recruits, designs, and  builds the Army. And the third sustains the Army by providing the  necessary equipment.   Now the new fourth command will modernize the Army by integrating  technology as it is developed in research labs and other facilities.  When staffed at full capacity, the Austin headquarters will be home to  100 soldiers and 400 Department of the Army civilians. That is just a  start.   Leading them will be GEN John Murray, who was nominated and confirmed  just 2 nights ago to be the commanding general of the Futures Command.  My friend and our colleague, Senator Cruz, said it well. He said:  ``Just as Austin is uniquely positioned to ensure the Army succeeds in  this new mission, General Murray's long career and dedicated service in  uniform makes him the right leader for Army Futures Command.'' I agree  wholeheartedly.   General Murray and others will help create cross-functional teams  designed to focus on specific things that the Army wants to build or  improve--for example, next-generation combat vehicles, soldier  lethality, or cloud and network capabilities.   The next question I want to answer is, Why is it necessary? I think  the only answer is because our country's future military readiness  depends on it. That is why it is necessary. Our ultimate goal here is  to increase the Army's lethality against near-peer competitors in the  global conflicts that could arise at some point down the road.   So the Army Futures Command is really the hub of modernization  efforts for the Army. It takes new concepts from the realm of the  abstract, and it puts them to use concretely in the form of real-world  technology that the Army can acquire for its own purposes. Then it  helps the warfighters implement and use these new tools in the field.   There is a rough consensus in Congress that the Army's acquisition  machinery needs to operate faster and more efficiently--certainly, more  cost effectively. It is my hope that the many entrepreneurs, the  college graduates, and the military reservists collaborating with the  Army Futures Command in Austin will provide innovative ideas to help  remedy these problems. The Futures Command could reduce redtape, making  it easier to make decisions or changes quickly, particularly ones  involving the purchase or upgrade of equipment and systems.   In a world still marred by conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan,  strained by escalating cyber security threats, and threatened by the  increased belligerence of China and Russia, the U.S. military must keep  pace with evolving technologies in order to maintain our strategic  advantage and to maintain the peace.   Modernization is the key to deterring aggression, promoting peace,  and projecting American strength around the globe. Secretary of Defense  Mattis has made it clear that this ranks among his top priorities.   In closing, let me say that the Army Futures Command is aptly named.  When it comes to our national defense, we should always be looking  toward the future. It is incredible to think that starting in just  under 3 weeks, young people born in the aftermath of 9/11 will be  eligible to enlist in the Army with their parents' consent. That is an  amazing statistic. That tells you something about the rapid pace of  modern life and some of the transitions that are occurring right before  our eyes.   These young people born right after the terrible events of 9/11 have  grown up in a world that sees new forms of conflict, as well as  terrorism, the likes of which the Founders of this great Nation could  never have imagined. It is imperative, as brave men and women continue  to answer the call to service, even in such harrowing times as ours,  that we do our part to give them the tools they need to be successful.  The Army's Futures Command, therefore, is most definitely a step in the  right direction.   I yield the floor.
