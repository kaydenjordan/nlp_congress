 Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.        Mr. President, I understand that there are two measures  at the desk, and I ask for their first reading en bloc.    I now ask for a second reading, and I object to my own  request en bloc.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it stand adjourned until 10 a.m.  on Wednesday, January 25; that following the prayer and pledge, the  morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved  to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later  in the day, and the Senate be in a period of morning business, with  Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask that it stand adjourned under the previous  order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 6:02 p.m., adjourned until  Wednesday, January 25, 2023, at 10 a.m.
