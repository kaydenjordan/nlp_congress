 Mr. President, I rise today to honor the career of  Darnell DeMasters, who will retire from her position as vice president  of Federal Government Affairs at WEC Energy Group on April 4.   Over the past 25 years, Darnell has worked on behalf of customers in  Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan, and Minnesota, advocating for their  energy needs before Congress and ensuring lawmakers understand the  impact of legislation on their constituents. Prior to her time with WEC  Energy Group, Darnell spent many years on Capitol Hill and later  transitioned to positions in government affairs for the Duquesne Light  Company and General Public Utilities.   Darnell was also instrumental in re-establishing and leading the  Wisconsin Group, a nonpartisan, nonadvocacy organization to discuss  public policy matters and government actions affecting Wisconsin's  business, educational, public sector, and political communities.   Outside of her working hours, Darnell is an active member of the  executive board of The Woman's Club of Fairfax, GFWC, a unified group  of women dedicated to enhancing the lives of families and strengthening  their community through charitable work, donations, and volunteer  service.   I am fortunate to have worked with Darnell in her capacity at WEC  Energy Group for many years. Her efforts to re-establish the Wisconsin  Group as a forum to connect Wisconsinites and Wisconsin organizations  in Washington, DC, have proven to be valuable, and my staff and I have  regularly enjoyed the connection and community they have fostered.   I know Darnell's colleagues will miss her thoughtful and expert  guidance, good humor, and deep knowledge. I am grateful for all of the  work Darnell has done for the people of Wisconsin, and I wish her all  the best as she begins a new chapter in her retirement.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the exceptional  career and life of Rev. Joseph Ellwanger. Reverend Ellwanger is a  pillar of the Milwaukee community and has left an indelible mark on the  lives of so many. From his early career as a pastor in Alabama standing  with civil rights leaders, to his ongoing work to reintegrate formerly  incarcerated people into their home communities, Rev. Joseph Ellwanger  has put into action his faith to affirm all people.   Reverend Ellwanger was born in St Louis, MO, but grew up in Selma,  AL. He left his childhood home when St. Paul Lutheran Church, an  African-American congregation in Birmingham, requested a pastoral  candidate. During his time with St. Paul's he joined the Southern  Christian Leadership Conference's fight for civil rights. Reverend  Ellwanger attended civil rights meetings and eventually received an  invitation to meet with the SCLC's steering committee, where he met Dr.  Martin Luther King. Reverend Ellwanger was the lone White pastor to  join the movement, and he stood undeterred by challenges from his  conservative denomination. He recruited both students and clergy to  join with him in the civil rights movement. On March 6, 1965, the day  before Bloody Sunday, Ellwanger led a group of 72 White Alabamians to  Selma to participate in the Concerned White Citizens march supporting  voting rights for African-Americans.   Reverend Ellwanger joined the National Council of Christian Churches  and met with President Lyndon Johnson after Bloody Sunday. This meeting  brought together a group of clergymen from a broad spectrum of  denominations to communicate to President Johnson that the religious  community supported the Voting Rights Act.   Reverend Ellwanger's work for equal justice has been ongoing. From  Alabama, he moved to Milwaukee, WI, where he was a Lutheran pastor for  decades. He continues to work for voting rights and is a founding  member of Project RETURN to help individuals who have experienced  incarceration make a positive, permanent return to community, family,  and friends.   As Reverend Ellwanger celebrates his 90th birthday, I am pleased to  join others in recognizing the contributions he has made to the people  of Milwaukee, our State, and our Nation.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the long career  of Scott Leonard, of Milwaukee, as he retires from Amtrak after 19  years of dedicated service. Born in Milwaukee on April 2, 1961, he  graduated from the University of Wisconsin in 1984. His first job was  with the blood services division of the American Red Cross, first in  Wisconsin, then in Washington, DC.  [[Page S1085]]    Scott always loved trains, especially passenger trains. As a child,  he would ride some of the storied trains that travelled through the  Badger State. His interest and passion for the railroad led him to a  position with the National Association of Railroad Passengers--NARP--an  advocacy group supporting the growth of rail passenger services in the  United States. There, he worked with the membership of the association  to advance ideas to Amtrak for improved service and to communicate back  to NARP what they could do to support Amtrak. Scott was an ever-present  figure on Capitol Hill providing information and support to the Members  and their staffs as they worked on the important rail bills of the late  1980s and 90s.   In 2004, Scott joined Amtrak's government affairs office and was  responsible for handling congressional correspondence, managing special  projects, and assisting with VIP travel. He is well regarded for his  thorough and prompt replies to queries and ability to provide personal  and professional service to inquiries or complaints. Members of  Congress, foreign dignitaries and other important passengers came to  know Scott on a first-name basis as he met or escorted them to the  station or their train. Leaving the office and headed to the station,  suit and tie, clipboard in hand, his friends in government affairs  would say: ``Somebody is about to get the Scott Leonard Treatment.''  For many, he was Amtrak, a recognized face in the crowd, a measure of  consistency in a harried world.   Scott also holds the unique distinction of travelling every mile of  Amtrak's 21,400-route system, one of only two people known to have that  achievement. As in every large endeavor such as this, one needs a  playbook or guide so others may follow on a clear and consistent path  of requirements. In a system as large as Amtrak's, there are many  anomalies. Scott organized the ``playbook'' right to down the last  switch, siding, and alternative route options. There are others chasing  this goal, and maybe someday there will be created the ``Leonard  Prize'' for those who do indeed cover that last mile. In addition to  his knowledge of Amtrak's system, he can recite the beginning and end  of the U.S. highway system and possesses excellent mapmaking skills and  a deep knowledge of American geography.   Some might say that Scott was lucky to get a job that allowed him to  pursue his passions and interest. However, the truth is that Amtrak was  lucky to have Scott. He lives the values of the company every day, and  he is a beloved colleague to those around him. His former boss in  government affairs once said that ``if there were ever a human cloning  opportunity, Scott would be No. 1 on the list.''   Soon, Scott will retire from service at Amtrak and return to  Wisconsin with his husband, Kevin. They will settle in a historic  property in Racine, not far from the Hiawatha line where friends and  family alike can keep an ear out for the whistles and sounds of trains  racing by.   Scott, thank you for your dedication and long service to Amtrak-- America's Railroad. May you and Kevin have a long, happy, and healthy  retirement.                            ____________________
