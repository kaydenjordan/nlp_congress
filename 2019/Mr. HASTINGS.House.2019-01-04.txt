 Madam Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule I, I demand a  vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the Journal.    Madam Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that  a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is  not present.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 6, Title II--Select  Committee on the Modernization of Congress.   Title II establishes a bipartisan Select Committee on the  Modernization of Congress to investigate, study, make findings, hold  public hearings, and develop recommendations to modernize and improve  the way Congress operates.   This institution has a responsibility to the people--to our  constituents--and to this country to build a Congress that works for  everyone, not just those at the top. This is not something that will  happen on its own. It is going to take hard work, but it is worthwhile  work.   This is not the first time Congress, as an institution, has wrestled  with how to be more effective and efficient. Three times in the 20th  century--in 1945, in 1965, and again in 1992 when Ms. Lofgren and I  came to Congress--we established joint committees to examine various  aspects of the legislative process in an effort to improve efficiency  and promote transparency.   Madam Speaker, today we are at a similar crossroads. Last Congress,  we witnessed the Republicans lead the most closed Congress in the  history of our country. Republicans blocked everything from immigration  reform and infrastructure to gun safety and lowering prescription drug  costs.   Last November, many of the American people demanded a new direction.  Part of that new direction includes making the House of Representatives  an institution that debates big ideas.  [[Page H221]]    We are at a moment where the challenges we face as a country are so  great--everything from the opioid epidemic that is devastating  communities across the country to the immense economic and human cost  the world will incur as a result of climate change--that we must come  together as a body in a deliberate and transparent way.                                time  0915    The select committee will provide a venue for Members to consult  outside experts, academics, and this institution's own Members in an  effort to analyze, debate, and adopt those ideas that will help us  improve how we do the people's business.   This select committee, along with the bipartisan rules package that  passed on the House floor yesterday, is proof that we stand ready,  willing, and able to protect not only this institution's prerogative  but the interests of the American people.   With public trust in Congress at historic lows, House Democrats are  taking transformational steps that will modernize Congress, restore  regular order, and bring integrity back to this institution. This  comprehensive and deliberate approach will undoubtedly improve the  overall function of this great institution that we all have the  privilege and honor to serve in.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern), chairman of the Rules  Committee and my good friend.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Washington (Mr. Kilmer), my friend, a member of the  Appropriations Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Sarbanes), my good friend and a member of  the Committee on Energy and Commerce and the Committee on Oversight and  Reform.     Madam Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 30  seconds.    Madam Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the resolution,  and I yield the control of the remainder of my time to the gentlewoman  from California (Ms. Lofgren), the distinguished chairwoman of the  Committee on House Administration.
