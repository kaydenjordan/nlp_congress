 Mr. Speaker, 1 year ago I started a healthcare listening  tour across Minnesota's Second Congressional District. Whether it is  Wabasha or Burnsville, the issue is the same.   The cost of lifesaving prescription drugs is skyrocketing. Over the  past 2  [[Page H317]]  decades, the cost of insulin has risen 600 percent, a lifesaving drug  that more than 350,000 Minnesotans rely on.   That is unacceptable and that is why I have introduced the Emergency  Access to Insulin Act, to make insulin more affordable, and hold big  drug companies accountable for jacking up insulin prices and making  other lifesaving drugs unaffordable for Minnesota families.   Over the past 10 years, the cost of Canasa, a medicine for Crohn's  disease, has increased by 150 percent. That is why I have cosponsored  61 bills to address skyrocketing healthcare costs.   We do not have the luxury of standing by any longer while 3 in 10  Minnesotans are rationing their medicine. It is time to sit down with  my colleagues and lower the cost of healthcare.                            ____________________
