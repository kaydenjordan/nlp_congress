 Madam Speaker, I thank my good friend for courageously  bringing this contempt resolution to the House today.   The authority and the very integrity of the House of Representatives  has been challenged by this administration as never before in American  history. If it were not for the Supreme Court, this administration's  determination to deliberately prevent an accurate Census count would  have succeeded.   Neither the President nor the Republican House has the support of a  majority of the American people.   Using Secretary Ross, the administration tried to cheat its way to an  undercount. Both Attorney General Barr and Secretary Ross have gone out  of their way to refuse to provide needed documents or offered pretexts  for not providing them pursuant to valid subpoenas.   So serious has been this obstruction that the House must seek  criminal contempt, which can carry stiff penalties  [[Page H5948]]  and prison time, or simply surrender to the administration and invite  continuing obstruction of our ability to perform our legislative and  oversight functions.   To be sure, we fully recognize the difficulty of enforcement of  criminal contempt against this administration by this administration,  but the House would as soon surrender its authority as to take no  action in the face of historic and willful defiance.
