 Madam Chair, I ask unanimous consent to claim the time in  opposition to the amendment, although I am not opposed to it.    Madam Chair, although I strongly oppose H.R. 1, I  appreciate the intent of Mr. Lujan's amendment.   This amendment would improve the election infrastructure innovation  grant program established in H.R. 1 by requiring consultation with the  Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology.   NIST is already working with the Election Assistance Commission to  develop voluntary standards and guidelines for voting systems and is  well-positioned to support the Department of Homeland Security, the  National Science Foundation, and the Commission's election security  research efforts.   I would like to note that the amendment does not add the Committee on  Science, Space, and Technology as a recipient of the report required by  section 321(b).   I am the ranking member of the Research and Technology Subcommittee,  which has jurisdiction over the DHS Science and Technology Directorate,  the NSF, and the NIST, all of which are implicated by section 321.   Although I do not expect H.R. 1 to ever become law, I hope election  security is something that we can do on a bipartisan basis in the  future. This process has been rushed, and appropriate due diligence to  create strong and effective bipartisan election and security reforms  has not been done.   Once again, I support the intent of this amendment, but I oppose H.R.  1.   Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman, and I yield back the balance of  my time.
