 Madam Speaker, I rise today during National Police  Week to honor law enforcement officers across Arizona and the Nation.   As a former investigator and officer, I know what the brave men and  women and their families go through every day to protect their  communities.   This week brings back the memories of the friends and partners I have  served alongside during my time on the force. We remember the officers  who have been killed in the line of duty, many of them friends of mine,  including DPS Officer Tyler Edenhofer and Jesus Cordova.   We will never forget their service to our State and our country.   Madam Speaker, I join my colleagues this week in thanking the men and  women who serve our communities, protect our families, and allow us to  continue to be a free society.                            ____________________
