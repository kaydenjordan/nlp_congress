 Mr. Speaker, President Biden recently promised us food  shortages in the United States. This is the country that leads the  world in production. Well, that is one heck of a campaign promise being  kept. Food shortages, along with energy skyrocketing; what a reset.   Indeed, my home State of California, which produces so much of what  America relies on, due to Federal and State policies, the water has  been taken away. Up on the Klamath Basin, zero water allocation.   I just drove around part of my west side of the district the other  day, and there are miles and miles of open land that is not growing  rice; that they are trying to put all that water toward trying to keep  orchards alive. The waterfowl are not coming in. The jobs are not  happening; all because of a backwards campaign promise, evidently, to  put food shortages out there for people.   Empty shelves in the supermarket; it is unbelievable that this is  what this administration--and what are they doing? What are they doing?   We are not getting more water facilities built. We are not getting  more storage made. No, we are just continuing down the same path to try  and save fish that don't exist in the delta, or that are being marketed  by people catching them up on the rivers and out in the ocean.   I guess that is why everybody is leading the charge these days in  cheering for: Let's go, Brandon.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding.   Tonight, I join my colleagues in support of this year's Water  Resources Development Act. While it may not be readily apparent, the  threat of storm damage and floods remains front and center, despite the  prolonged drought across the Western United States.   In the wake of wildfires, mudslides will bring vegetation down from  mountainsides into our public waterways. With fewer but more intense  storms seen this year, the risk of flash floods has increased.   Now, as with many bipartisan bills, there are policies and provisions  that I believe are missing from this measure. That work is not done. I  will continue to push for more control over project construction to be  given to local water agencies; more up-front inclusion of Tribes so we  can avoid ruining their cultural and burial sites, literally crushing  skulls while working on levees--this is about basic respect; and for  the Army Corps and EPA to work with our constituents, rather than  against them, such as penalties for when farmers plow their fields or  change crops.   Indeed, we need to keep this conversation going, but I appreciate the  legislation and the direction we are going.
