 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  recess until 11:30 this morning for conference meetings.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 10:33 a.m., recessed until  11:30 a.m. and reassembled when called to order by the Presiding  Officer (Mr. Johnson).                            ____________________     The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator  from Arizona (Mr. McCain).   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber  desiring to vote?   The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 81, nays 18, as follows:                        [Rollcall Vote No. 16 Leg.]                                  YEAS--81       Alexander      Baldwin      Barrasso      Bennet      Blunt      Boozman      Brown      Burr      Cantwell      Capito      Cardin      Carper      Casey      Cassidy      Cochran      Collins      Coons      Corker      Cornyn      Cotton      Crapo      Cruz      Daines      Donnelly      Duckworth      Durbin      Enzi      Ernst      Fischer      Flake      Gardner      Graham      Grassley      Hassan      Hatch      Heinrich      Heitkamp      Heller      Hoeven      Inhofe      Isakson      Johnson      Jones      Kaine      Kennedy      King      Klobuchar      Lankford      Manchin      McCaskill      McConnell      Moran      Murkowski      Murray      Nelson      Perdue      Peters      Portman      Reed      Risch      Roberts      Rounds      Rubio      Sasse      Schatz      Schumer      Scott      Shaheen      Shelby      Smith      Stabenow      Sullivan      Thune      Tillis      Toomey      Udall      Van Hollen      Warner      Whitehouse      Wicker      Young                                  NAYS--18       Blumenthal      Booker      Cortez Masto      Feinstein      Gillibrand      Harris      Hirono      Leahy      Lee      Markey      Menendez      Merkley      Murphy      Paul      Sanders      Tester      Warren      Wyden                               NOT VOTING--1               McCain           The PRESIDING OFFICER. On this vote, the yeas are 81, the nays are  18.   Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having voted in  the affirmative, the motion is agreed to.   Cloture having been invoked, the motion to refer falls.   The Senator from Maryland.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, I know the paperwork is being finalized,  but I for one--and I guess I am not the only one; I am sure there is  broad appreciation for the fact that our Democratic colleagues who  voted to close the government have now changed their minds and now will  vote on final passage, having just voted on cloture, to reopen the  Federal Government. This was a strategy that lacked an endgame and was  never going to work.   The safety, health, and livelihoods of Americans across the country  didn't deserve to be held hostage, and the American people have had  enough of these kinds of games. I think, basically, the verdict of the  American people is ``A pox on both your houses.''   I don't think anybody comes out of this looking very good. But  surely, this calculated stunt that put funding for our government,  military, and the Children's Health Insurance Program at risk, all  because our colleagues wanted to accelerate consideration of the DACA  issue--the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals--was a mistake by any  measure.   They, of course, had planned this strategy for months. Many of them  had signaled their intention to vote against any spending bills unless  the DACA issue was resolved, despite the fact that a majority of  Americans in recent polls said that avoiding a shutdown was more  important to them than other priorities.   If we just think about it, trying to deal with the concerns--and they  are legitimate; I am sympathetic with them--of the 690,000 DACA  recipients versus 320 million Americans who were hurt by this shutdown,  it just seems disproportionate and unnecessary.   For most of the last 3 days, negotiations led to nowhere. The  majority leader in particular took the conciliatory gesture of--instead  of pursuing the 4-week extension--saying: OK. We will do it for 3  weeks. That is ultimately what our colleagues across the aisle voted  on, but what did they have to show for that? To my mind, they got  nothing to show for that.   Sure, they got a commitment from Senator McConnell, the majority  leader, to take up the issue of immigration in February. He was going  to do that anyway. We know the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals  Program expires on March 5. So logic would tell us that, yes, we are  going to have to take it up in February. But it just seemed so  unnecessary and so harmful to try to shut down the government to force  something that was going to happen anyway. So I said: That doesn't make  much sense to me.   I am glad our colleagues decided to take this step to reopen the  government while we resume our work to find a solution on this  immigration issue. But we have a lot of other important issues.   First of all, the Children's Health Insurance Program will be  reauthorized as part of this vote here shortly. But we have other  issues.   We have to agree on spending caps for this fiscal year so that the  Appropriations Committees can figure out, How much money can we commit  to our national security? We have shortchanged our national security in  recent years because of the Budget Control Act and sequestration, which  creates automatic spending caps, absent some agreed-upon grand bargain.  This has been a perennial problem, not just for Congress and the  country, but it has particularly fallen hard on our military at a time  when James Clapper, the former Director of National Intelligence, said  that in his 50 years in the intelligence community, he had never seen a  more diverse array of threats confronting our country and confronting  the world. We can tick down the list, from North Korea, to Iran, to  Russia to China. There is a threat of home-grown terrorism here in the  United States because of domestically inspired Islamic extremists. The  world is a dangerous place, and it is made safer only when America is  strong and America leads, and we can't do that while underfunding our  national security apparatus, our intelligence agencies, and the  Department of Defense. So we need to take care of that.   We also need to deal with disaster relief. I come from a State that  was hammered by Hurricane Harvey, the most significant rain event in  many, many--perhaps even 1,000--years. More than 50 inches of rain  inundated the city of Houston and that environment. Many people are  still hurting. Many people are still not back in their homes. Their  businesses were blown away. And while the House of Representatives has  voted on an $81 billion disaster relief package, because of the holdup  here--again, because our Democratic colleagues in the Senate think this  DACA issue is more important than those victims of natural disasters,  not to mention the wildfires out west--that has been put on ice as  well.   There are a lot of important things that we need to get done, and I  hope we will take advantage of the next few weeks here to get them done  as we continue our discussions about DACA and what to do to provide  some assistance to these 690,000 young people who were brought here as  minor children by their parents and are in somewhat of a box.    Earlier today, I went to the White House with several of my  colleagues to meet with President Trump to discuss the four areas he  has laid out to address the March 5 deadline relating to DACA. We are  working through those four issues as I speak, trying to find a  permanent solution for the DACA recipients and making sure that border  security and interior enforcement is beefed up so that we don't have a  repetition of this situation in the future.   We also are looking to limit chain migration and perhaps even to use  some of the additional visas left over to accelerate the movement of  people who have been playing by the rules and have been waiting in  line, some for 10 or 20 years, just to rejoin their families here in  the United States.   Finally, the President instructed us to deal with the diversity  lottery visa program. There are about 50,000 visas that are literally  provided based on a lottery, not because the immigrant has any special  skills or qualities that would help enhance our country and help them  contribute to our country but merely because they happened to win the  lottery. I think it makes sense to reform that and perhaps use some of  those additional visas, again, to deal with the backlog of people who  have been waiting in line, patiently trying to immigrate to the country  in a legal fashion--we ought to reward them, not continue to punish  them--but also, to try to do what we might to maybe reassign some of  those visas to merit-based immigration, people who have graduated with  skills that we need here in the United States, including the STEM  fields--science, technology, engineering, math. I think that makes a  lot of sense.   Obviously, I am not going to decide this by myself. We are going to  have to build a coalition of Democrats and Republicans, and I think we  can. I think we can demonstrate our natural American compassion when it  comes to immigrants. As I have said before, we are a country that has  been built by immigrants. But the part we seem to always forget in this  conversation on immigration is that we are also a nation of laws. That  is what people have lost confidence in--that the Federal Government is  committed to securing the  [[Page S437]]  border and enforcing our laws. If we do that, I think the American  people will continue to welcome people through a legal immigration  system who want to come here to America for a better life, to  contribute, and to pursue their dream.   Our meeting at the White House was a productive conversation. It was  just one of many. I know Senator Schumer visited with the President, I  believe last Friday, on the immigration question. Our colleagues,  Senator Durbin and Senator Graham, have been working with Senator  Flake, Senator Menendez--I think Senator Gardner is part of that, as  well, and I am probably leaving somebody out. But they have a  bipartisan proposal that they took to the White House. Unfortunately,  the President said that it wasn't a proposal he could support, so back  we go to the drawing boards. Nobody pretends that this solution is  easy, but it is one that we need to address.   I believe the President remains engaged and committed to finding a  solution for these young adults who were brought here, as I said,  through no fault of their own.   I especially remain committed to the 124,000 DACA recipients in my  home State of Texas. It is no surprise that Texas has a large immigrant  population because of our proximity to the border. But we are not  alone, and many of these 690,000 DACA recipients are spread throughout  every State in the country.   I have a personal interest in making sure we come up with a  bipartisan solution for these young adults who face such uncertainty,  but it is important that any solution we agree on contains two things.  First is a DACA solution for these young adults, many of whom are huge  contributors to our communities; indeed, these are our neighbors, and  they work alongside us in our community. They deserve a thoughtful and  compassionate solution that I hope we deliver.   I understand the plight they find themselves in. I have had a chance,  like all of the Members of the Senate and the House, to meet many of  these young people, and many of them are extraordinarily impressive.  They have excelled in school. They have a lot of promise. But,  unfortunately, they carry this burden of a status that does not permit  them to stay in the country absent legislative action. So it is a  precarious position, I am sure, to live every day not quite sure of  what the future will mean.   But any solution we come up with over the next several weeks must  also protect the 320 million Americans who already live in the country,  in addition to these DACA recipients. What I mean by that is I think  there needs to be some natural symmetry here. To the extent that we  provide compassionate relief to these young people, I think we need to  correspondingly assure the American people that we are actually serious  about border security and enforcing our laws.   My State has had to bear the burden of a lot of the cost of border  security, including placing law enforcement personnel along the border,  because the Federal Government has simply failed to do its job over  these many years. I know leaders in my State will be glad to see the  Federal Government finally step up and accept their responsibility.   I know the President has talked frequently about a wall. Some people  talk about tactical infrastructure. As a matter of fact, the President  referred to the 2006 Secure Fence Act and said: Well, basically, we are  talking about the same thing. The Border Patrol usually refers to this  as tactical infrastructure.   My tutor on matters affecting border security is the current sector  chief of the Rio Grande Valley sector, Manny Padilla, who has had a lot  of experience in Arizona, Texas, and California. He says that each and  every place along the border, each of which is unique in its own way,  requires a combination of three things. He said it requires  infrastructure--call it defense, call it a wall, call it a barrier;  whatever you call it, that's one piece of it. But the second is  technological; it is technology. It is an aerostat balloon in the sky,  it is ground sensors, it is radar, it is a UAV--an unmanned aerial  vehicle--but it basically is tied up in a system that is complemented  by boots on the ground, by the Border Patrol, which is an essential  component. So when Manny Padilla says that border security at each  place along the border involves infrastructure, technology, and people,  what he is saying is that we should leave to the experts how to deploy  each of these items where it makes the most sense.   In Big Bend, out in West Texas, I have flown over the cliffs there  that are 3,200 feet tall, that look down into the Rio Grande River. You  don't need to build a fence there. You don't need to build a wall  there. But if you go to San Diego, CA, or to some of the corridors or  to the hard-to-control places on the Texas-Mexico border, maybe what  you would prefer to do is to have a technological solution. Or in an  urban area, where it is easy to dart across the border into the United  States and melt into the urban landscape, maybe it makes sense to have  fencing and tactical infrastructures and walls, where appropriate.   Being able to put in place the right mix of infrastructure,  personnel, and technology will enable us to begin to regain the  public's confidence on this issue because if we address the plight of  these young adults but do not address the cause of the problem, which  is illegal immigration--which is how they got here, being brought here  by their parents--we will be back here arguing the same issue a decade  from now.   I stand ready to work, and I am glad our Democratic colleagues have  joined us today in reopening the government so we can work on finding a  solution to our border security and immigration challenges. We are all  working, and have been for months, on a path forward on DACA, and we  will continue to do so now that the government has reopened. We can  roll up our sleeves, work with the White House, work with our  colleagues in the House and the Senate, and come up with solutions to  the four items the President has identified for us.   I welcome ideas from our colleagues on both sides of the aisle, in  both Chambers, and certainly from the President himself. Work on this  issue will require an effort by all of us. Now it is up to the House to  do its job, after we pass this continuing resolution for 3 weeks, and  move us past the shutdown. Let's reopen the government and all get back  to work.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.   Mr. McCONNELL.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.   Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, after 3 days of an unnecessary lapse  in funding, a bipartisan majority has brought the Democratic leader's  extraordinary filibuster to an end and passed a bipartisan bill to  reopen the Federal Government.   As I have said repeatedly over the past week, shutting down the  government is an irresponsible way to do business. It does not reflect  the seriousness with which I know my colleagues on both sides would  like to approach the people's business here in the Senate.   All our important work for the American people had to be put on hold  while this manufactured crisis was dealt with. We made no substantive  progress--not one inch--on the serious bipartisan negotiations that it  will take to solve issues such as immigration, border security,  healthcare, defense spending, and many other matters. I am glad we can  finally get back to work here.   Amid the political gamesmanship, the past 3 days have highlighted the  commitment of many of my colleagues to honest and bipartisan work. I  would like to particularly thank Senator Graham, Senator Collins,  Senator Flake, and several of our Democratic colleagues who worked  tirelessly to bring this impasse to a conclusion.   Soon, Federal operations will be getting back to normal for the  American people. We all know what comes next--challenging negotiations  on a host of serious issues. The weeks ahead will require the best from  all of us.   I hope we can remember some lessons from this regrettable incident.  Brinksmanship and hostage-taking do not work. They make bipartisan  progress harder, not easier, to achieve.   Senators must focus on the common good of the American people, not  the warped priorities--the warped priorities--of extreme voices, no  matter how loudly they shout at us to do otherwise.   With the pointless, damaging, partisan theatrics of this government  shutdown behind us, serious and bipartisan negotiations can resume. We  have been talking for months about how to address military spending,  disaster relief, healthcare, immigration, and border security, and the  rest of Congress's unfinished business. Now those talks can get going  again. Whether they bear fruit is up to all of us.                            ____________________
