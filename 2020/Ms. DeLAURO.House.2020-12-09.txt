Res. 71       (115th Congress).        (c) Classification of Budgetary Effects.--Notwithstanding       Rule 3 of the Budget Scorekeeping Guidelines set forth in the       joint explanatory statement of the committee of conference       accompanying Conference Report 105-217 and section 250(c)(8)       of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of       1985, the budgetary effects of this division shall not be       estimated--        (1) for purposes of section 251 of such Act; and        (2) for purposes of paragraph (4)(C) of section 3 of the       Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 as being included in an       appropriation Act.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the bill, H.R. 8900, currently under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, as we speak, the Appropriations Committees are hard at  work negotiating fiscal year 2021 appropriations bills. There are many  serious issues facing our Nation, and Federal funding plays a critical  role in supporting families and communities as they go about their day- to-day lives as they try to survive during this health and economic  crisis.   Mr. Speaker, Americans deserve the certainty of a full-year funding,  and the Congress has a responsibility to the Nation to do its job and  pass all 12 funding bills before we adjourn.   The continuing resolution we consider today will keep the government  up and running to bring spending talks to a successful conclusion.  These are serious issues that touch every aspect of people's lives,  like their education, transportation systems, national security, public  health infrastructure, and our environment.                                time  1230    In addition to an omnibus appropriations bill, it is my hope that  this additional week will allow negotiators the time to assemble an  emergency coronavirus relief package.   To take advantage of this window of opportunity, Leader McConnell  must finally sit down with Democrats to find a bipartisan solution.   Coupled with a full year of government funding, an interim  coronavirus relief package is critical. It is a lifeline for working  families. If we do not act, 12 million Americans could lose  unemployment aid just after Christmas, and millions could lose access  to paid sick leave and protections against evictions. This will put  working families over the edge and our economy closer to the financial  cliff.   I urge my colleagues to join me in adopting this continuing  resolution. Let us support the ongoing negotiations.   People are desperate. They are counting on us. We need to provide  relief to working families, to our schools, to our children, to small  businesses, and to communities across the Nation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).                                time  1245     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I know the majority leader has left the floor, but I  thank  [[Page H7066]]  him for his congratulations and his warm words. I look forward to  working in conjunction with him as we move to pass 12 bills by June.   I want to particularly say how pleased I am to be able to work with  the ranking member, my colleague from Texas. We have worked on issues  in the past, never at this level, but I am looking forward to a really  close and wonderful relationship as we try to do the Nation's business.  Thank you so very much.   Mr. Speaker, with an additional week to negotiate, I am optimistic  that we can fund the government for this year and we can deliver  coronavirus relief for the American people who are desperate and  looking to us for hope.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in passing this  extension of funding so we can complete our work. It is not about us.  We have the responsibility, but it is about the people outside of this  Chamber who are relying on us.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
