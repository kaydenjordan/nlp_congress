 Madam Speaker, I rise to urge that we come together  today to defend the Constitution of the United States by repudiating  President Trump's emergency declaration of February 15.   Few provisions of the Constitution are more plain than Article I,  Section 9, Clause 7: ``No money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but  in consequence of appropriations made by law.''   The President has immense powers, but he cannot spend money unless  we, the people's Representatives in Congress, have agreed that he can.   Now, there might be extraordinary circumstances when a President  could violate that principle, when all of us would agree that he must  act but there is no time to ask Congress for funds: a military invasion  or a massive natural disaster, for example. The National Emergencies  Act provides for that.   But if the situation on the southern border were that kind of  emergency, then the President hasn't been acting like it. For 2 years,  when his party controlled the House and Senate, he never asked us for  money to build a wall, and if we truly faced that kind of imminent  threat, a wall would not even be an emergency measure given how long it  would take to build.   The critical point is this: When the President finally got around to  asking us for money, we deliberated on his request, and we said no. You  may believe we were right or you may believe we were wrong, but that is  what the elected Representatives of the American people decided.   So the question before us today is not how do we secure the border;  it is whether this President or any President can use emergency powers  to defy the Congress when he disagrees with a  [[Page H2106]]  decision that we have made. Are we going to stand by and watch this  President seize funds from the military to forcibly take land from law- abiding American citizens to build something that Congress has said  should not be built?   We know this would be wrong. The National Emergencies Act is for  genuine emergencies. It is not a get-out-of-the-Constitution-free card  for Presidents who want something that Congress won't give them.   Now, I have heard some people say that President Obama did the same  thing. I am sorry, he did not. Both President Obama and President Bush  were sometimes accused of exceeding their constitutional authority; the  courts sometimes overruled them. But neither Obama nor Bush nor Nixon  nor Reagan nor Roosevelt nor Lincoln nor any President since the  founding of our Republic has ever decreed an emergency to spend money  that the Congress explicitly denied them.    If you want to find a precedent for what President Trump has done, I  can give you one. When I was a diplomat representing our country and  standing up for our values around the world, I had this exact same  debate with authoritarian governments in Ethiopia, in Bahrain, and in  Egypt, telling them: Do not use emergency powers to get around your  constitutions. I never thought I would have that kind of argument with  a President of the United States.   Many of my Republican colleagues have been saying that America must  not go the way of Venezuela, and they are right. When President Trump  said in his State of the Union that we must never become a socialist  country, I joined them in getting to my feet and applauding.   But how do you think Venezuela got to be a socialist country? I will  tell you. President Maduro declared a state of economic emergency to  give himself the power to defy his elected national assembly and spend  money however he pleased.   That is not America. We must never become that. We believe in rule of  law, not rule by decree.   We disagree passionately within the boundaries the Constitution  draws, but we agree zealously to defend those boundaries when any one  of our party or any party tries to cross those boundaries. That is how  we have survived as a constitutional democracy. It is the only way we  can survive.   We are divided enough right now, so, please, let's not allow another  tear in the constitutional fabric that holds us together. Let's unite  as patriots on this one question so that we can safely disagree as  partisans on everything else.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, today I rise to welcome the Mayors  Council on Rahway River Watershed Flood Control to Washington. They  represent towns in and around New Jersey's Seventh District and are  here to ask our help to stop the flooding that hurts thousands of  people in our communities.   For years, homeowners near the Rahway River have lived under the  constant threat of flooding that devastates businesses and homes  whenever there are heavy rains. The last major flood was in 2011, when  Hurricane Irene ravaged the East Coast. The town of Cranford was the  worst hit, with 1,600 homes sustaining damage worth $40 million.   Our mayors have presented a proposed solution to the Army Corps of  Engineers and are now asking for a feasibility study to be completed.  This will get us one step closer to authorizing construction on the  Rahway River Basin.   Mr. Speaker, this is a solvable problem. We need to start now. I will  do everything I can to support our mayors' call to action and expedite  this process so that we do not have to be pulling people out of second- floor windows in suburban New Jersey, so people up and down the Rahway  River can feel safe in their homes.                            ____________________
