 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the 44\1/2\  years of service and dedication of Houston's own Judge Richard Vara. A  trailblazer in 1974, when he was appointed judge, he was 23 years old.  At the time, that made him the youngest person to be appointed as  justice of the peace. He was just 23 years old.   Judge Vara grew up in the historic east end of Houston, graduating  from Austin High School, the University of Houston, and the South Texas  College of Law.   The judge got his first encounter with politics and people and  fighting for all of us by going to meetings of LULAC with his parents.  This sense of service to the Latino community remained with him  throughout his service.   Both in the courtroom and in the community, Judge Vara has  exemplified public service and commitment by bettering his community.  He has created and volunteered for countless organizations in Houston,  all aimed at improving the lives of people around him.   Please join me in congratulating Judge Richard Vara for his many  years of service. Enjoy your retirement, Judge. You have earned it.  Thank you and God bless.                            ____________________
