 Mr. President, today I wish to remember the life  and legacy of Mr. Willard ``Will'' P. Heddles, a champion of American  manufacturing who dedicated much of his life to improving his home--the  community of Tiffin, OH.   A native of Colorado, Mr. Heddles moved to Tiffin in the 1970s to  oversee Tiffin Art Metal Company. The company was founded at the turn  of the century, originally making stamped ornamental ceiling panels.  When cars became popular in the 1920s, the company seized the  opportunity and began making large billboard frames.   When its parent company wanted to sell the plant, Mr. Heddles wasn't  impressed by any of the potential buyers. He knew how important this  plant was to his community. So Mr. Heddles organized a management  buyout and eventually became the owner of the company, known today as  Tiffin Metal Products.   Under Mr. Heddles' leadership, Tiffin Metal Products continued to  demonstrate the kind of adaptability and creativity that enables a  company to grow and thrive. Today Tiffin Metal Products remains one of  the two main manufacturers of large billboards in the country, while  also making custom products and a popular brand of specialty lockers  for law enforcement.   Mr. Heddles took pride in his role in American manufacturing and in  keeping his company true to its Ohio roots. Over the years, Tiffin  Metal Products has provided good jobs to hundreds of people in Tiffin  and Seneca County, and those workers have shown the world that Ohioans  know how to make things and make them well.   Will Heddles also took pride in his community, giving generously to  local service programs and the arts and helping establish the Seneca  Industrial and Economic Development Corporation, a private nonprofit  organization working to drive positive economic and community  development in the area.   He will be missed by his family, church, community, and the men and  women who have been a part of Tiffin Metal Products, a great Ohio  manufacturing success story. I am sure that my Senate colleagues join  me in celebrating the life of Mr. Willard P. Heddles and his lifelong  commitment to American manufacturing.                            ____________________     Madam President, I speak in opposition to Scott Pruitt,  and I thank Senator Carper for the good work he has done in leading the  opposition to someone who is a climate change denier and will not  release information that the public should see.   I want to say a few comments about the majority leader's comments. I  am incredulous that he thinks this has been unfair to the Trump  administration and Republicans; that we have not moved faster. We know  a bunch of things. We know President Trump didn't begin his vetting  process, as most Presidential candidates do, in August.   We then know right after the election he fired his person in charge  of vetting and of the transition. We know then he appointed people  without vetting them because he wanted to speed it up, and we also know  that a number of people who President Trump nominated were billionaires  and Wall Street bankers, and they had very complicated financial  backgrounds and holdings, and because the Trump administration didn't  do it, the Senate had to do it, and the media had to do it--to look at  the backgrounds of some of these nominees.   Then, on top of that, we saw a level of corruption we had never seen  in Presidential nominations. We saw a Secretary of Health and Human  Services--passed by being voted for by every Republican--who bought and  sold healthcare stocks while a Member of Congress, voting on and  sponsoring healthcare amendments and bills.   We saw other nominees. We saw Secretary Mnuchin, and Senator Carper  played a role in this, now-Secretary Mnuchin, who forgot to disclose a  $100 million investment he had and then lied to the Senate committee,  as pointed out by the Columbus Dispatch--the most conservative paper in  my State--about robo-signing, sending hundreds of people in my State  into foreclosure.   The ethics of these nominees are such, and then you have Scott Pruitt  to be Administrator of the EPA, and he will not disclose 2,600 emails  that we know how--as Senator Carper has done such a good job on--we  know how a number of these emails point to--I am not a lawyer--if not  the word ``collusion,'' certainly doing the bidding of the fossil fuel  industry that he might occasionally want to regulate instead of the  EPA. That is the story.   I want an Administrator of the EPA who wants to protect the country's  great natural resources, not someone hell-bent on undermining the  Agency he will lead. The environmental challenges we face in my State  are too great to put the EPA in the hands of someone with a track  record of putting polluters before public health, of choosing companies  that pollute over communities that are victimized by that pollution,  and too often he is doing the work of campaign donors instead of the  public.   I know what the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts have meant to my  State. I know what Lake Erie looks like. When I was a kid, I lived  about an hour and a half away. Lake Erie was an environmental disaster.  The counties of Cuyahoga, Erie, and Lorain couldn't clean it up. The  State of Ohio didn't have the resources to clean it up.   It was only that terrible fire in Cleveland where bridge trestles on  the Cuyahoga River caught on fire that got the Nixon administration to  move and create the EPA, and then we cleaned up Lake Erie. That was one  of the great accomplishments in our country's history--environmental  and otherwise, one of the great accomplishments.   It was a Republican administration with the Democratic Congress, when  good environmental policy was bipartisan, when Republicans as well as  Democrats believed in being stewards of the Earth in following a number  of the teachings of the New Testament about being stewards of the  Earth.   It was a sustained effort by citizens and by their elected officials  in both parties to protect our public health. The EPA affects the water  that comes into our children's drinking fountains. It affects our small  businesses that rely on tourists at our lakes and beaches. It affects  farmers who feed the Nation. According to Dr. Aparna Bole--a pediatric  specialist at Cleveland's University Hospital in Cleveland--asthma  rates in my part of Ohio are above the national average because of the  region's poor air quality.   Climate change is not some distant problem. We tend to think about  wildfires in the West or devastation faced by coastal communities, like  those affected by Hurricane Sandy. The Midwest is affected too.   In August, 2014, a harmful algae bloom left 500,000 Ohioans in  Greater Toledo, in Northwest Ohio, without safe drinking water for  nearly 3 days. This is Lake Erie. This is more or less the natural  color of Lake Erie. This is the algal bloom. It is a stunning,  beautiful picture if you don't know what it is, but when you see a boat  cutting through these algal blooms and seeing what this meant, as the  algae chokes Lake Erie--Lake Erie right here is about 30 feet deep.  Contrast that with Lake Superior, 600 feet, and you will see why Lake  Erie is more vulnerable.   Lake Erie is 2 percent of the water in all the Great Lakes. Lake Erie  has 50 percent of the fish of all the Great Lakes. The fish like  shallower and warmer water, but they don't like these kinds of algal  blooms and what they do to this community. Because it is the shallowest  of the Great Lakes, and this is the shallowest part of this great lake,  it is uniquely vulnerable to these harmful algal blooms.   We know these blooms are caused by excess nutrients in our water-- untreated sewage, urban runoff, and runoff from farm fields. This  Maumee River Basin going into the lake from the south, going into the  lake just north of Toledo, drains the largest 2 million acres, the  largest basin of any tributary going into any of the Great Lakes.   On Wednesday, I met with David Spangler, a charter boat captain on  Lake Erie. We talked about how the Great Lakes region has seen a 37- percent increase in heavy rain events. We have seen that hotter summers  make the blooms worse. We talked about protecting the lake as one of  the great environmental challenges, not just for Ohio or even the  industrial Midwest but protecting Lake Erie and the Great Lakes, the  greatest source of freshwater in the world, by most measurements--how  important that is.   Dave has been fishing on this lake and its tributaries for decades.  He bragged about the improvements we  [[Page S1368]]  have seen over the year--how water quality has improved, how walleye  and yellow perch populations have rebounded, how he leads fishing  expeditions on the Great Lakes, on Lake Erie. You know what, look at  what these algal blooms have done. You can guess what they have done.  Nobody will go fishing in these kinds of waters.   If the algal bloom is there too long, lots of fish die in addition to  that. We need an EPA Administrator who understands that the  contamination hurts everything from our children's health to our small  businesses. He told me he doesn't think Scott Pruitt is the right  person for this job. He believes that with Scott Pruitt at the helm of  the EPA, we would likely lose the gains we made in the lake.   Of particular concern to both Mr. Spangler and me is that Mr. Pruitt  said mercury does not cause a threat to human health. Really? Mercury  doesn't cause a threat to human health? If Mr. Pruitt doesn't believe  that, I would like him to explain to me why the Ohio EPA, the Ohio  Department of Health--both with Republican administrators--have a  statewide mercury advisory stating that women of childbearing age and  children under 15 are advised to eat no more than one meal per week of  fish from any Ohio water body. Think about that. You shouldn't eat more  than one meal a week of fish taken out of any of the Ohio aqua system-- limit the amount of fish eaten from our State's largest body. That  means even though we worked for decades to reduce mercury emissions,  apparently Mr. Pruitt doesn't think mercury exposure is a threat to  public health.   Mr. Pruitt has solicited thousands of dollars of campaign  contributions for himself, the Republican Attorneys General  Association, all the Republican attorneys general. There are three  dozen or so of them. They work together to raise lots of money to keep  themselves in office so they can continue to do some of the work they  do. Some of the work they do is stand in the way of good environmental  policy.   He has refused, for years, as Senators Merkley and Carper have  pointed out consistently, to disclose some 2,600 documents, showing  correspondence between his office and the very companies he is supposed  to ensure follow the law.   We know who some of those companies are. What is he hiding? Why won't  he tell the Senate what is in those documents? Why does the Senate  Republican leader not want us to see those documents? Because he is  saying, no, we have to vote on this now. It just happens to be we will  be looking at documents over the next few days, but apparently it is  not going to be able to affect this vote.   It could be because in the past he submitted letters to the EPA that  were written by the companies he is supposed to regulate. Think about  that. An oil company writes a letter and then that letter remarkably  ends up pretty much word for word to be sent to the EPA.   Allowing him to become EPA Administrator is like allowing an arsonist  to become the fire chief--the goal of both is to burn things down. Mr.  Pruitt's record clearly shows he is not the right person to lead our  Environmental Protection Agency.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER.
