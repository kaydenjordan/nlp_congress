 Madam Chair, I am honored to rise today to speak on H.R. 7,  the Paycheck Fairness Act. I am proud to be part of a Congress that is  finally taking action to close the gender pay gap. After so many years  of inaction on this issue when our Republican colleagues were in the  majority, I think it is fair to say that it is about time.   It is hard to imagine that, in this day and age, women could be paid  less than a man for doing the same job. But it happens, and it happens  often. Statistics show that pay disparity isn't a thing of the past; it  is happening today. It isn't just holding women back; it is amplifying  racial inequalities across the country.   We often hear the statistics that say women make 80 cents to every  dollar that is paid to a man, but those figures are often worse for  women of color. Black women are making only 61 cents on the dollar. For  Latina women, that is 53 cents. For Native American women, it is 58  cents. Clearly, the pay gap is compounded by a racial gap.   It should be obvious to all of us that this problem extends beyond  the workplace.   Madam Chair, you see the impact everywhere you look around our  society. Women of color are less likely to have healthcare coverage.  They are more likely to experience hunger. They are less likely to own  a home or be fully prepared for retirement.                                time  1445    At the end of the day, those pennies on the dollar add up, and that  loss of income is putting women of color at a serious disadvantage.   The Paycheck Fairness Act will take aggressive action to remedy these  inequalities and tear down the economic barriers that women of color  face. It will do that, in part, by ensuring the Equal Employment  Opportunity Commission has the information it needs to detect pay  discrimination and to identify those additional cross-section biases.    Madam Chair, I am proud to introduce an amendment with my  colleague, Representative Beyer from Virginia, that will ensure that  the major employers are required to report that information to that  commission. That will go a long way to finally ending the systemic  barriers that women and women of color face in this country.   I thank Chair Scott and Chair DeLauro. I am really excited to be part  of this change-making Congress.   I include in the Record a letter from the NAACP in support of this  legislation.           Washington Bureau, National Association for the             Advancement of Colored People,                                    Washington, DC, March 25, 2019.      Re: NAACP Strong support for the immediate passage of H.R. 7,           the Paycheck Fairness Act.       The Honorable,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the NAACP, our nation's       oldest, largest and most widely-recognized grassroots-based       civil rights organization, I strongly urge you to support and       vote in favor of H.R. 7, the Paycheck Fairness Act. This       critical legislation would update and strengthen the Equal       Pay Act of 1963, which mandated that employers pay equal       wages to men and women who perform substantially the same       work. The Paycheck Fairness Act closes loopholes in the Equal       Pay Act which have diluted its effectiveness in combating       unfair and unequal pay. While the Equal Pay Act has helped to       narrow the wage gap between men and women in our workforce,       significant disparities remain and must be addressed.        Especially in today's economy, more women work outside of       the home and their paycheck is a necessary part of their       households' resources. Yet all too often women are forced to       raise their families on incomes lower than that of male       colleagues performing the same jobs. According to 2018 data,       women in the United States are typically paid 80 cents for       every dollar paid to men. The median annual pay for a woman       who holds a full-time, year-round job is $41,977 while the       median annual pay for a man who holds a full-time, year-round       job is $52,146--a difference of $10,169 per year. The       statistics are even worse for women of color. African-      American women make only 61 cents, and Hispanic women only 53       cents, for every dollar earned by white, non-Hispanic men.       These gaps translate into a loss of almost $24,000 a year for       African-American women and almost $28,500 annually for       Hispanic women.        The Paycheck Fairness Act is a responsible, steady yet       aggressive bill. It will help remedy this inequity and close       this unacceptable gap. In short, the legislation will protect       women and families across America by: protecting against       retaliation for discussing salaries with colleagues;       prohibiting employers from screening job applicants based on       their salary history or requiring salary history during the       interview and hiring process; requiring employers to prove       that pay disparities exist for legitimate, job-related       reasons; providing plaintiffs who file sex-based wage       discrimination claims under the Equal Pay Act with the same       remedies as are available to plaintiffs who file race- or       ethnicity-based wage discrimination claims under the 1964       Civil Rights Act; removing obstacles in the Equal Pay Act to       facilitate plaintiffs' participation in class action lawsuits       that challenge systemic pay discrimination; and creating a       negotiation skills training program for women and girls.        I again urge you to do all you can to see that this       important legislation is enacted as quickly as possible so       that women can begin to have some parity for a day's work.       This in turn will help hard working American women, their       children and their families gain the economic stability they       deserve. Please support the Paycheck Fairness Act and work to       eliminate this unacceptable gap in pay.            Sincerely,      Hilary O. Shelton,        Director, NAACP Washington Bureau & Senior Vice President       for Policy and Advocacy.
