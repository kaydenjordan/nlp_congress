 Mr. President, I am thrilled to rise and join my  colleagues in pressing the case for DC statehood. I won't be long  because I was on the floor about 3 weeks ago talking about this same  matter. I really talked about Virginia then. I talked about Patrick  Henry.   The phrase ``no taxation without representation'' is a phrase that we  learn coming up in elementary school. The root of it isn't really at  the beginning of, say, the Declaration of Independence or during the  Revolutionary War; that phrase really came about as colonists rallied  to oppose the Stamp Act.   The Stamp Act was an act of Parliament in 1765 that put a tax on  paper goods, including newspapers and pamphlets and periodicals. The  English Crown was getting very, very worried about the restive nature  of Americans pressing their case for being treated equally as royal  colonists and subjects of the Crown, but they were not happy with the  way they were being treated.   The Stamp Act was an attempt not just to levy a tax, but it was also  an attempt to shut down their rights to have political discussions.   Patrick Henry led an effort in the Virginia General Assembly in 1765  that came to be known as the four resolves. He put five resolves on the  table, one of which was set aside, but four resolves were passed, and  the core of the four resolves was to protest taxation without  representation.   One of my great regrets was wanting to hear the great orators of  history and never to have had a chance to hear Patrick Henry, although  I have heard good Patrick Henry impersonations at St. John's Church in  Richmond. What a powerful speaker--the ``Give me liberty or give me  death'' speech on the very kind of verge of the United States declaring  independence; his court advocacy as a relatively untrained lawyer in  Virginia on behalf of religious freedoms so that people who were not  part of the established Church of England could still practice their  faith as they chose. But many believe that Henry's advocacy against the  Stamp Act was his most powerful oratory.   I read excerpts from the resolves when I was here 3 weeks ago, but  now I want to jump from Patrick Henry to somebody else who is very much  in the spirit of Patrick Henry, and that is Frederick Douglass.   If DC becomes a State, it will become a State named in honor of the  abolitionist Frederick Douglass.   Frederick Douglass certainly was an inheritor of the Patrick Henry  tradition. He was enslaved for the first 20 years of his life, and then  following the Civil War, he moved to the Nation's Capital to become so  many things--diplomat, civil rights leader, confidant of President  Lincoln, President Grant, and others.   In his autobiography, ``The Life and Times of Frederick Douglass,''  he wrote:         The District of Columbia is the one spot where there is no       government for the people, of the people, and by the people.       Its citizens submit to rulers whom they have had no choice in       selecting. They obey laws which they had no voice in making.       They have a  [[Page S3405]]       [sic] plenty of taxation, but no representation. In the great       questions of politics in the country, they can march with       neither army [neither party], but are relegated to the       position of neuters.    Those are the words of the great Frederick Douglass echoing the  Patrick Henry speech a century earlier against the Stamp Act. Those  words are as true today as they were when he wrote them, and they were  as true when he wrote them as when Patrick Henry delivered them in  1765.   In the history of States coming into the Union, most States have some  pretty interesting background and history, but there are some common  themes. The two commonalities--but then there has been one quirk that I  want to mention as I conclude--the two commonalities are States come  into the Union when they achieve sufficient population and when they  have a demonstrated desire that is not just temporary, effervescent,  but is essentially fixed and permanent   In the mid-1800s, Congress would set a population deadline. Say, for  example, in the Northwest Territory, Michigan was told: As soon as you  get to 60,000 residents, then we will entertain you if you want to be a  State, but you have to do a referendum first.   There is no minimum number established by Congress in terms of  population now to become a State, but we would all agree that DC would  pass any minimum because DC is larger than States that currently are  part of the Union. So whatever criteria we might set--well, you need to  be of sufficient size to be a State--DC has met that.   DC has met the second criteria as well, which is demonstrated desire,  most recently in a referendum in 2016 where the overwhelming sentiment  of DC, as you would expect, was a patriotic sentiment: We want to be a  State of the greatest Nation on Earth.   So those two criteria have usually been sufficient for States having  demonstrated that or territories or populations having demonstrated  that to become part of the Union and to have their star added to the  flag of this country.   There have been controversies, though, bluntly, when States have  sizable minority populations.   The quest of Hawaii for statehood took longer than it otherwise would  have because many Members of this body stood on the floor and expressed  concerns about whether Hawaii would be a cultural match for the United  States because of the predominant API and indigenous population. I am  sad to say that some of those who took the floor and raised those  questions and objections were from Virginia.   The State of New Mexico had a particularly rocky path to becoming a  State because Members of this body, including from Virginia, took the  floor and raised a question about the size, the population, the  percentage of New Mexico's indigenous and Latino population.   About 46 percent of the population of DC is African American, folks  who--many march in the footsteps and quest for the same equality that  Frederick Douglass was questing for in the 1800s.   I hope we can show that the failures of the past that led statehood  for New Mexico and Hawaii to take perhaps longer than should have been  the case--I hope we will have learned something from that and can move  finally to grant these 700,000-plus residents of this wonderful city in  our Nation's Capital the ability to be a State.   The last thing I will say is this. I did say this when I was on the  floor 3 months ago. We haven't added a State, we haven't added a star  to our flag for I guess 70 years now, about 70 years. I don't think a  fixed number of stars on the flag sends a message of a growing,  thriving nation. I think it might send the message of a nation that is  kind of fixed. When you are fixed and set and not willing to change, I  believe that can almost send a little bit of a message of decline.   Throughout our Nation's history, the addition of stars to the flag  has sent the message of an America that--we are not done growing. We  are not done expanding. We are on the move. History isn't done with us  yet.   The fact that we haven't added a State--this has been the longest  period of time in the history of the United States where we haven't  added a star to the flag. I think doing so would suggest very  powerfully that the best days of our Nation aren't behind us; they are  still ahead of us.   For these reasons and those articulated by my colleagues, I strongly  support the effort for DC statehood.   I yield the floor.    Mr. president. There are significant racial and ethnic  inequities in maternal and infant mortality rates in the U.S. American  Indian/Alaska Native women are more than twice as likely as nonHispanic  white women to die as a result of pregnancy or its complications, and  the infant mortality rate among babies born to American Indian/Alaska  Native women is 2.1 times higher than that of non-Hispanic white women.  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the  maternal mortality rate for non-Hispanic Black women in 2018 is more  than 2.5 times higher than the maternal mortality rate of non-Hispanic  white women, and the infant mortality rate of non-Hispanic Black women  is more than 2.3 times higher than the infant mortality rate of non- Hispanic white women. Any pregnant woman choosing to have a child  should be able to do so safely without regard to income, race,  ethnicity, employment status, or any other socio-economic factor.   This is why Senator Murkowski and I are reintroducing the Mothers and  Newborns Success Act, which aims to reduce maternal and infant  mortality, ensure that all infants can grow up healthy and safe, and  protect women's health before, during, and after pregnancy. Our  legislation supports innovation in maternal health delivery and  improves data collection on maternal mortality and maternal deaths,  including implementing quality assurance processes to improve the  validity of pregnancy checkbox data from death certificates so that we  can better understand the causes of maternal deaths. The bill will help  ensure that women are matched with birthing facilities that are risk- appropriate for their particular needs to improve maternal and neonatal  care and health outcomes. The legislation strengthens support for women  during the critical postpartum period, the year after birth.   The bill also establishes a public and provider awareness campaign  through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to promote  awareness of maternal health warnings signs and the importance of  vaccinations for pregnant women and children, ensuring pregnant women  get the vaccinations they need. The bill promotes maternal health  research, providing technical assistance to states to ensure  representation of communities of color in key datasets. The bill  establishes a National Maternal Health Research Network at the National  Institute of Health to support innovative research to reduce maternal  mortality and promote maternal health. The bill supports the Rural  Maternity and Obstetric Management Strategies (RMOMS) Program at the  Health Resources and Services Administration to improve access to, and  continuity of, obstetrics care in rural communities, including thorough  use of telehealth.   No woman should fear for her or her child's health because of socio- economic factors, such as race or geographic location. We need to  ensure more women of color and their children, particularly Black women  and children given the significant disparities they experience, receive  equitable care and a fair chance for a healthy pregnancy and safe  delivery. COVID-19 and its impact on pregnant women has only  underscored the need for urgent action. The Mothers and Newborns  Success Act is a significant step toward reducing racial, ethnic, and  geographic inequities in maternal and infant health. I'm calling on my  Senate colleagues to cosponsor this bill and support its passage so we  can enact positive systemic changes to make sure more women and  newborns thrive and have the maximum chance for success.                                  ______                                         By Mr. DURBIN (for himself and Ms. Duckworth):   S. 1812. A bill to modify the boundary of the Lincoln Home National  Historic Site in the State of Illinois; to the  [[Page S3426]]  Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.
