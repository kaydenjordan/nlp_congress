 Madam Speaker, I proudly rise in strong support of this  bill. We have to pay our bills and uphold the full faith and credit of  the United States. My constituents in Philadelphia don't get a choice.  They have to pay their bills. Congress must do the same.   We are working together to finalize legislation to advance the Build  Back Better agenda that we share with President Biden. As we do that,  we must remember we are elected to govern. Let me repeat that. We are  elected to govern.   Yes, the Senate needs to act, but we also must be responsible in this  House. We are responsible for protecting the recovering economy against  the threat  [[Page H5532]]  of severe financial damage. This will clear the way to focus on bold  opportunities to support American families.    Madam Speaker, I call on my colleagues to act responsibly and join me  by voting ``yes'', ``yes'' to avoid the first-ever default in the  Nation's debt.
