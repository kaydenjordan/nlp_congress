 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the city of  Clermont's police chief, Chuck Broadway, for his appointment to an  important subcommittee of the Florida Police Chiefs Association.   The Subcommittee on Accountability and Societal Change aims to  rebuild trust between law enforcement and communities through increased  consistency, accountability, and transparency, and I know Chief  Broadway will represent our district well.   As a proud supporter of law enforcement across our district and  Nation, I believe it is now more important than ever to have these  conversations and to bring unity and safety where fractures have  emerged. That was a priority for me as a Florida State representative,  and it remains a critical need today.   Each time I interact with those on the front lines, whether it is law  enforcement or fire and medical personnel, I am reminded that it is  because of their sacrifice that our communities live in harmony. I am  grateful for those who protect, and I commend Chief Broadway for his  leadership and his vision. Chief Broadway's contributions to this new  group will be invaluable, just as his 24 years of service already have  been.                      Defending the Rights of the Unborn     Mr. Speaker, I rise today as a proud Representative of  Florida's 15th District to defend the rights of the unborn.   For entirely too long, our Nation has turned deaf ears and cold  hearts to the most vulnerable among us. Since Roe v. Wade was enacted  nearly 50 years ago, over 61 million Americans have been aborted. That  is 61 million lives that will never be.   This month, I was proud to fight for the inclusion of Hyde Amendment  protections in any Federal funding or tax credits that may be used to  address the healthcare needs of unemployed Americans.   I also fought against Planned Parenthood and their improper  application for Paycheck Protection Program funds, as well as their  despicable sale of aborted body parts and fetal tissue.   This modern-day genocide must end. That is why I am proud to support  President Trump's appointment of pro-life Justices to the Supreme  Court, and I look forward to the day where we can finally put this  atrocity behind us.                     America Must Hold China Accountable     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to add my voice to the millions  in our country demanding that the communist Chinese Government be held  accountable for its deception regarding the coronavirus, COVID-19.  China lied and Americans died. It is really that simple.   For too long, our own national leaders have looked the other way as  China has taken advantage of American ingenuity and naivete. They have  continually countered our interests around the world, and it is our  companies and our citizens that have paid the price.   China intentionally mislead the international community about what it  knew regarding the deadliest pandemic our world has seen in over 100  years. COVID-19 has since caused the deaths of over 100,000 Americans  and over 9 million people worldwide.   China's complicity in this crisis has, likewise, brought ruin to  economies around the globe while increasing their relative advantage,  and for this they must answer. I have introduced and joined numerous  legislative initiatives to do just that, and I ask my colleagues to  join me to do the same.   China must and will be held accountable.                      In Support of the Second Amendment     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of our rights  [[Page H2426]]  under the Second Amendment, which are under continual attack.   The tragic death of George Floyd has brought to surface many  important issues that demand our attention, but if there is one thing  that has become clear during the subsequent weeks of social unrest,  rioting, destruction, and further deaths, it is the importance of being  able to protect ourselves, our families, our homes, and our businesses.   For far too long, gun-grabbing policies at the State and local levels  across our Nation have targeted our ability and our right to defend  ourselves. Now, as the idea of autonomous and police-free zones gain  momentum, law-abiding citizens must retain the ability to protect their  loved ones and their way of life.   Gun control and censorship always proceed tyranny; just ask our  neighbors in Venezuela. But the citizens of Florida's 15th District  will have none of it, nor will I. The Constitution is clear, and the  events of this spring and summer are foreboding. We must retain the  right to protect ourselves.                            ____________________
