 Madam Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I rise to offer an amendment to H.R. 5 that  supports students, parents, and school personnel. My amendment would  simply add that local education agencies provide to parents the number  of school counselors employed at their child's school so that parents  have a better idea about their child's education and safety during the  school day.   As we all know, school counselors play an important role not only in  the academic and career development of our students, but they address  emotional challenges that are a critical component of safety in our  schools. This simple provision gives parents the full knowledge and  transparency needed to decide if their children need additional  resources outside of the academic environment. This can assist our  educators in making sure our children are best prepared for school and  learning.   So, Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment which  has support from both sides of the aisle. A happy and healthy student  empowers our educators to provide the best possible education, and  parents deserve to be empowered to best help their children achieve  that.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, this amendment doesn't increase the number of  counselors, but it allows the parents to know if the number of  counselors is adequate or not. This is very important for our parents  to have.   This is being requested by teachers and parents. I have received this  request from teachers and parents to have this added to the bill  because they said it will make the bill better.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I will close by saying that I would  appreciate the support of both sides of the aisle. This bill has  support from teachers and parents to have this added in.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
