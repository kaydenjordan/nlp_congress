 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 934, I call  up  [[Page H5164]]  the bill (H.R. 5788) to provide for the processing by U.S. Customs and  Border Protection of certain international mail shipments and to  require the provision of advance electronic information on  international mail shipments of mail, and for other purposes, and ask  for its immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on H.R. 5788, currently under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to be here today to speak in support of H.R.  5788, the Synthetics Trafficking and Overdose Prevention Act, which is  short for STOP Act. By passing this important bipartisan bill today, we  are standing up for the health and safety of our communities and  families and closing an important loophole allowing contraband to enter  the United States through international mail.   In my home State of Washington, there has been a 134 percent increase  in opioid-related cases between 2004 and 2016, and opioid-related  deaths increased by 33 percent. This increase, shockingly, exceeds our  State's population growth, and it is why the work that we have been  doing in Congress and in the Ways and Means Committee is so important.   In April, we held a hearing in the Trade Subcommittee with witnesses  from the United States Customs and Border Protection and the United  States Postal Service. They discussed how synthetic opioids are  entering the United States through the international mail system and  how we can help them put a stop to this.   The bipartisan legislation that we will vote on today supports their  work by requiring advance electronic data on international mail  shipments and allowing the Border Patrol to target for opioid  shipments. It also holds these agencies accountable to do so much more  than they have been doing by using hardline deadlines and mandates, as  well as penalties. Ultimately, the bill will require the Postal Service  to refuse packages for which this information is not provided unless  there is compelling reason.   The opioid crisis must be addressed from every angle, and that  includes stopping illicit synthetic opioids from entering our country.  We must do more to protect our families, our communities, and this bill  would do just that.   I want to thank Chairman Brady and Ranking Member Pascrell,  Representative  Mike Bishop, Representative  John Faso, and many of my  colleagues who have worked together on this bill. I would also like to  thank the staffs of each one of these Members who have worked so hard  and dedicated so much time on this critical issue.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the STOP  Act.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

Hon. Kevin Brady,      Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Brady: I write concerning H.R. 5788, the       ``Securing the International Mail Against Opioids Act of       2018.'' This legislation includes matters that fall within       the Rule X jurisdiction of the Committee on Homeland       Security.        In order to expedite floor consideration of H.R. 5788, the       Committee on Homeland Security agrees to forgo action on this       bill. This is conditional on our mutual understanding that by       foregoing consideration of H.R. 5788 at this time, the       Committee on Homeland Security does not waive any       jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in this or       similar legislation and will be appropriately consulted as       this bill or similar legislation moves forward so that we may       address issues in our jurisdiction. Our Committee also       reserves the right to seek appointment of an appropriate       number of conferees to any House-Senate conference involving       this or similar legislation, and asks that you support any       such request.        Please place a copy of this letter and your response       acknowledging our jurisdictional interest into the       Congressional Record during consideration of the measure on       the House floor. Thank you for your cooperation in this       matter.            Sincerely,                                                 Michael T. McCaul,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                     Committee on Ways and Means,                                       Washington, DC, June 6, 2018.      Hon. Michael T. McCaul,      Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman McCaul: Thank you for your letter regarding       H.R. 5788, ``Securing the International Mail Against Opioids       Act of 2018,'' on which the Committee on Homeland Security       was granted an additional referral.        I am most appreciative of your decision to waive formal       consideration of H.R. 5788 so that it may proceed       expeditiously to the House floor. I acknowledge that although       you waived formal consideration of the bill, the Committee on       Homeland Security is in no way waiving its jurisdiction over       the subject matter contained in those provisions of the bill       that fall within your Rule X jurisdiction. I would support       your effort to seek appointment of an appropriate number of       conferees on any House-Senate conference involving this       legislation.        I will include a copy of our letters in the Congressional       Record during consideration of this legislation on the House       floor.            Sincerely,                                                       Kevin Brady,      Chairman.                                   ____                                        Committee on Ways and Means,                                        House of Representatives,                                       Washington, DC, June 8, 2018.      Hon. Trey Gowdy,      Chairman, Committee Oversight and Government Reform,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Gowdy: I write to you regarding H.R. 5788,       the ``Securing the International Mail Against Opioids Act of       2018'' on which the Committee on Oversight and Government       Reform was granted an additional referral. I ask that you       waive formal consideration of H.R. 5788 so that it may       proceed expeditiously to the House Floor.        I acknowledge that by waiving formal consideration of this       bill, the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform is in       no way waiving its jurisdiction over the subject matter       contained in those provisions of the bill that fall within       your Rule X jurisdiction. I would support your effort to seek       appointment of an appropriate number of conferees on any       House-Senate conference involving this legislation.        I will include a copy of our letters in the Congressional       Record during consideration of this legislation on the House       floor.

Hon. Kevin Brady,      Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means,      Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for your letter regarding H.R.       5788, the Securing the International Mail Against Opioids Act       of 2018. As you know, certain provisions of the bill fall       within the jurisdiction of Committee on Oversight and       Government Reform.        So that H.R. 5788 may proceed expeditiously to the House       Floor, I agree to discharging the Committee on Oversight and       Government Reform from further consideration thereof. I agree       that forgoing formal consideration of the bill will not       prejudice the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform       with respect to any future jurisdictional claim, and I       appreciate your agreement to support appointment of members       of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform as       conferees in any House-Senate conference on this or related       legislation. In addition, I request the Committee be       consulted and involved as the bill or similar legislation       moves forward so we may address any remaining issues within       our jurisdiction.        Finally, I request you include your letter and this       response in the bill report filed by your Committee, as well       as in the Congressional Record during consideration of the       bill on the floor.            Sincerely,                                                        Trey Gowdy.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the gentleman  from Michigan (Mr. Bishop) be permitted to control the time of the  majority.
