 Mr. President, I was unable to cast a vote on  rollcall vote No. 148 the motion to instruct the conferees of the  United States Innovation and Competition Act of 2021 offered by Senator  Barrasso. The motion would force the administration to immediately  develop a 5-year offshore oil and gas leasing plan that includes a  minimum of 10 region-wide oil and gas lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico  and Alaska regions of the Outer Continental Shelf--OCS--with two sales  every year.    Had I been present, I would have voted against the motion. Rather  than tying the administration's hands with an arbitrary timetable for  offshore leases, we should be carefully weighing the risks and benefits  of such projects to each offshore ecosystem while diversifying our  energy sources, enhancing our energy efficiency, and encouraging the  transition to clean renewable energy.                            ____________________
