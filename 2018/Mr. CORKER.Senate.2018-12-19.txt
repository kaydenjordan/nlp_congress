 Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute. Upon such notification,  the Congress has 30 calendar days during which the sale may be  reviewed. The provision stipulates that, in the Senate, the  notification of proposed sales shall be sent to the chairman of the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee.   In keeping with the committee's intention to see that relevant  information is available to the full Senate, I ask unanimous consent to  have printed in the Record at this point the notifications which have  been received. If the cover letter references a classified annex, then  such annex is available to all Senators in the office of the Foreign  Relations Committee, room SD-423.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                    Defense Security                                              Cooperation Agency,                                                      Arlington, VA.

[[Page S7913]]         (viii) Date Report Delivered to Congress: December 18,       2018.        * As defined in Section 47(6) of the Arms Export Control       Act.                             POLICY JUSTIFICATION      Turkey--Patriot Missile System and Related Support and Equipment         Turkey has requested the possible sale of four (4) AN/MPQ-      65 Radar Sets, four (4) Engagement Control Stations, ten (10)       Antenna Mast Groups (AMGs), twenty (20) M903 Launching       Stations, eighty (80) Patriot MIM-104E Guidance Enhanced       Missiles (GEM-T) missiles with canisters, sixty (60) PAC-3       Missile Segment Enhancement (MSE) missiles, and five (5)       Electrical Power Plant (EPP) III. Also included with this       request are communications equipment, tools and test       equipment, range and test programs, support equipment, prime       movers, generators, publications and technical documentation,       training equipment, spare and repair parts, personnel       training, Technical Assistance Field Team (TAFT), U.S.       Government and contractor technical, engineering, and       logistics support services, Systems Integration and Checkout       (SICO), field office support, and other related elements of       logistics and program support. The total estimated program       cost is $3.5 billion.        This proposed sale will contribute to the foreign policy       and national security of the United States by improving the       security of a key NATO Ally on the front lines of the fight       against terrorism. Turkey is a member of and critical       enabling platform for the Defeat-ISIS campaign and continues       to be an essential element of our National Security Strategy       and National Defense Strategy efforts to compete against       great powers in both Europe and the Middle East. The TPY-2       radar site that Turkey hosts is important to the European       Phased Adaptive Approach and to efforts to protect Allies and       partners against growing Iranian ballistic missile threats.       This sale is consistent with U.S. initiatives to provide key       allies with modern systems capable of being networked to       defend against regional instability. The proposed sale will       enhance Turkey's interoperability with the United States and       NATO, making it a more valuable partner in an increasingly       important area of the world.        Turkey will use Patriot to improve its missile defense       capability, defend its territorial integrity, and deter       regional threats. The proposed sale will increase the       defensive capabilities of the Turkey military to guard       against hostile aggression and shield NATO Allies who might       train and operate within Turkey's borders. Turkey should have       no difficulty absorbing this system into its armed forces.        The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not       alter the basic military balance in the region.        The prime contractors will be Raytheon Corporation in       Andover, Massachusetts, and Lockheed-Martin in Dallas, Texas.       The purchaser requested offsets. At this time offset       agreements are undetermined and will be defined in       negotiations between the purchaser and contractors.        Implementation of this proposed sale will require       approximately 25 U.S. Government and 40 contractor       representatives to travel to Turkey for an extended period       for equipment de-processing/fielding, system checkout,       training, and technical and logistics support.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.                            Transmittal No. 18-17       Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to           Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act                             Annex Item No. vii         (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:        1. The Patriot Air Defense System contains classified       CONFIDENTIAL hardware components, SECRET tactical software       and CRITICAL/SENSITIVE technology. Patriot ground support       equipment and Patriot missile hardware contain CONFIDENTIAL       components and the associated launcher hardware is       UNCLASSIFIED. The items requested represent significant       technological advances for Sweden Patriot. The Patriot Air       Defense System continues to hold a significant technology       lead over other surface-to-air missile systems in the world.        2. The Patriot sensitive/critical technology is primarily       in the area of design and production know-how and primarily       inherent in the design, development and/or manufacturing data       related to certain components. The list of components is       classified CONFIDENTIAL.        3. Information on system performance capabilities,       effectiveness, survivability, missile seeker capabilities,       select software/software documentation and test data are       classified up to and including SECRET.        4. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain       knowledge of the hardware and software elements, the       information could be used to develop countermeasures or       equivalent systems which might reduce system effectiveness or       be used in the development of a system with similar or       advanced capabilities.        5. A determination has been made that Turkey can provide       substantially the same degree of protection for the sensitive       technology being released as the U.S. Government. This sale       is necessary in furtherance of the U.S. foreign policy and       national security objectives outlined in the Policy       Justification.        6. All defense articles and services listed in this       transmittal have been authorized for release and export to       Turkey.
