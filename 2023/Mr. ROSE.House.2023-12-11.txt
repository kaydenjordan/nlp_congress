 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Colorado for  yielding and for claiming the time this evening to acknowledge and  honor our Nation's 82nd National Bible Week.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to join those Members here tonight on the House  floor to share the Lord's Word, its meaning, and the lessons I have  learned from reading and studying it throughout my life.   There are many lessons we learn throughout our lives, whether in  school or our careers, as parents, or throughout the countless  challenges life provides. However, there are no better lessons than  those revealed in God's Word in the Bible.   For example, in 1 Thessalonians 5:16-18, we learn about the  importance of gratitude when the Apostle Paul writes: ``Rejoice always,  pray continually, give thanks in all circumstances; for this is God's  will for you in Jesus Christ.''   Mr. Speaker, I know many of us tend to voice our displeasure with  many of the world's current affairs on the House floor, but thankfully  there is so much for which to be thankful.   We also learn about forgiveness when Jesus dies for our sins on the  cross. Ephesians 4:32 says: ``Be kind and compassionate to one another,  forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you.'' There is  nothing more powerful than the message of forgiveness.   Each and every lesson found in the Bible of forgiveness, compassion,  gratitude, generosity, faith, humility, wisdom, perseverance, patience,  and respect, among many others, are powerful lessons on their own.   Each lesson has had a tremendous impact on my life and the lives of  those around me. I couldn't be more grateful to have them impact me the  way they have so that I can go forth and spread them in my community  and in my family, including with my two sons, Guy and Sam.

As always, it is important to remind ourselves what we are  celebrating this time of year: the birth of our Savior, Jesus Christ.  Of course, there are no better reminders than those that exist in the  Bible, which is why we are here today to honor the Bible during our  country's 82nd National Bible Week.   So, Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, Mr. Lamborn, for taking the time  today to recognize the importance of the Bible in our Nation and its  history. As a Christian, I am proud to recognize National Bible Week,  and I pray that by doing so I will be able to encourage more souls to  know the teachings of the Lord through His written word, the Bible.
