 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the Conference  Report for H.R. 6395, the William M. (Mac) Thornberry National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021. This bill contains many  important provisions that should become law, but unfortunately those  laudable policies are outweighed by the staggering cost and I cannot  support the bill as a whole.   I am grateful for the Conferees' work to include language increasing  treatment and benefits for veterans by expanding the types of diseases  that are presumed connected with exposure to Agent Orange. I also  strongly support the pay increase for our troops, the removal of names  and symbols associated with the racist legacy of the Confederacy, and  the bolstering of paid parental leave policies across the federal  government. I commend Chairman Smith for his ongoing work to advance  legislation that improves the military's prevention of sexual assault  and support for survivors, takes encouraging steps to address climate  change, and prevents the misuse of taxpayer money on a wasteful border  wall. In response to authoritarian tactics by federal agents in  Portland, Oregon, and elsewhere, the Chairman and House Conferees also  achieved bipartisan support for a policy I championed requiring that  any federal forces responding to a protest or civil disturbance by  clearly identifiable.   I cannot ignore, however, the unprecedented amount of military  spending that this legislation would authorize. Amid a national crisis  precipitated by a global pandemic, voting to allow billions of dollars  to be spent on weapons is unjustifiable when our communities  desperately need food and housing security, access to childcare,  affordable health care, and small business support. We must not accept  the notion that annual increases in defense spending are somehow  inevitable and can be rationalized as modest when adding just one  percent costs billions of dollars that should instead be invested  domestically in schools or infrastructure.   I do not take this vote lightly and my commitment to providing for  our servicemembers remains steadfast. It is a complex and challenging  task to responsibly fund our national defense, but I am confident that  we can maintain adequate security while reining in the immense and  ever-increasing sums that endlessly pour into the military-industrial  complex. I look forward to continued engagement with my colleagues as  we address these difficult issues.                                time  1400
