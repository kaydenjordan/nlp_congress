 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the  House adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 9 a.m. tomorrow.    Madam Speaker, I rise today in honor of all the nurses,  the healers who tirelessly serve patients across our Nation. I thank  them for their dedicated service to heal, care for, and serve people  across all our communities.   Our country is facing a dire shortage of healthcare workers. Whether  nurses, primary care physicians, psychiatrists, behavioral health  specialists, or technicians, you name it, the growing shortage of  workers is exacerbating the already high cost of healthcare, making  high-quality care that much harder.   Right now, in my own district, thousands of nurses and healthcare  workers are on strike at a hospital owned and operated by the Bon  Secours Health System, a $3.8 billion not-for-profit based in Maryland  that owns or manages more than 20 health-related institutions in seven  States.   The nurses at St. Vincent hospital are striking on quality of life  issues: overtime, mandatory on-call, and, ironically, healthcare for  them and their families.   The struggle these workers and these patients are facing is on my  mind every minute, and I continue to urge a real dialogue from the  company. Go back to the table and bargain to get our nurses back on the  job peacefully and productively.   Meanwhile, I urge my colleagues to reauthorize title VIII of the  Nursing Workforce Act and amend the Public Health Service Act to  establish direct care registered nurse-to-patient staffing ratio  requirements in hospitals.   Finally, Congress must do more to protect and improve DSH payments  that help hospitals provide charity care for vulnerable, uninsured  patients, so many of whom come into St. Vincent hospital.                            ____________________
