 Mr. Speaker, Sunday is National Ice  Cream Day. In 1984, President Ronald Reagan issued a proclamation  designating the third Sunday in July as National Ice Cream Day in the  United States.   The sweet treat holds a special place in the hearts and refrigerators  of many Americans. In fact, almost 90 percent of Americans have ice  cream in their refrigerator as I speak.   The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania produces 10.8 billion pounds of milk  annually, and 10 percent of our Nation's milk supply goes to the  production of ice cream.   In the Fifth District, the Penn State Berkey Creamery has been  researching dairy and producing ice cream for more than 150 years. They  were the first collegiate institution in the United States to offer  lessons on making ice cream; and in 1978, two men by the name of Ben  Cohen and Jerry Greenfield took one of their courses and later went on  to launch their company, Ben & Jerry's.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Penn State for being an industry leader,  and in honor of National Ice Cream Day, I hope all Americans will  celebrate with a scoop on Sunday.                            ____________________
