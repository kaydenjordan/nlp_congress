 Mr. Speaker, this week, National Police Week, is a special  time to recognize the courage and sacrifice of police officers in my  district and across the country.   Police chiefs have shared their challenges with me, from difficulties  with recruitment and retention to the high costs of modernizing their  equipment and technology.   That is why I am cosponsoring the Invest to Protect Act that funds  small police departments, like many in Pennsylvania-07, to help with  retention and training, small departments like this one in Weatherly,  Carbon County, Pennsylvania.   It is why I voted to institute stricter consequences for assault of  law enforcement officers and voted to memorialize fallen officers  killed in the line of duty.   It is why I am opposing the extreme GOP budget proposal to cut by 23  percent the number of local law enforcement agencies receiving Federal  funding. That is why I am proposing that we increase funding for public  safety programs.   Police officers put their lives on the line to keep us safe every  single day. They deserve our thanks and our support, but they also  deserve the Federal resources that they need to modernize and retain  their officers. I will keep working to ensure they have those  resources.                            ____________________
