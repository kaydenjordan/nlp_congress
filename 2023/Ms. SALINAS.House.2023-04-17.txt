 Madam Speaker, I rise on Mental Health Monday in defense  of the transgender community.   Last year, lawmakers introduced 315 anti-LGBTQI+ bills. During that  same year, a national survey found that 45 percent of LGBTQI+ youths  seriously considered suicide. That is 45 percent, Madam Speaker.   This year has far surpassed 2022's record with more than 400 hateful  and harmful laws introduced so far, including H.R. 734.   Reputable athletic organizations like the International Olympic  Committee and the National Collegiate Athletic Association have  guidelines for the equitable participation of transgender athletes.   With this bill, House Republicans are creating a problem where there  isn't one because they think the American people won't see this for  what it is: a ploy to distract from their failures.   Madam Speaker, this is not a game. It is a mental health catastrophe  in the making. The trans community deserves our support, not our scorn.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to consider healing over harm and  to reconsider H.R. 734.  [[Page H1732]]                                ____________________
