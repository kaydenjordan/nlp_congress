 Mr. Speaker, and still I rise.   And still I rise as a proud, unbought, unbossed, unafraid, liberated  Democrat.   I rise today, Mr. Speaker, in the name of liberty and justice for  all. Liberty and justice for all, not the name of liberty and justice  for people of color, for people who happen to be of a different hue,  but in the name of liberty and justice for all and, more specifically,  in the name of liberty and justice for Ralph Yarl and Kaylin Gillis.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in the name of liberty and justice for them  because our country should be in mourning today. A life was needlessly  lost, and no one of great notoriety, or a person who happens to have  been a Congressperson, or a person holding some prominent position in  society. They were not persons who were out in Hollywood making motion  pictures; just an ordinary citizen who lost their life, and we ought to  be in mourning.   We ought to be in mourning because the young man was shot for ringing  a doorbell. His sin was he was ringing a doorbell. He was a person of  color, yes. Apparently, according to at least one statement by an  official, there is something to do here with race. But he was ringing a  doorbell, and he was shot twice--once in the head.   The young woman that I speak of was White. She went into the wrong  driveway, and she was shot.   Is this where we are in this country? People are going to be killed  for ringing the wrong doorbell? Going to be murdered for pulling up in  a driveway? Innocently, I might add.   Is this where we are?   We ought to be in mourning today. These lives matter. We ought not  allow this to happen without some sort of special occasion, something  that speaks to them, some sort of way of commemorating this.   We have gotten to the point now where it is just a life lost.  Tomorrow there will be more. The day after that, even more.   What is wrong with us?   Can not we see where we are headed? We stand on the eve of  destruction and don't know it. We are going to destroy ourselves.   Mr. Speaker, we have the power to do something about this. We cannot  allow constitutional carry, meaning just get a gun and not have to take  any sort of test. You don't have to prove that you are a person who can  manage this level of lethality. You can buy a gun because you have the  money to buy it. Then only God knows what you will do with it.   I am not contending that I know the history of these two persons.  That is not it. But I am saying to you that if we don't get a handle on  what we are doing with this level of lethality by placing these weapons  in the hands of people willy-nilly, we are going to see more of this.  It can be your child next.   Do not assume that it cannot happen to you. It can be your daughter.  These were the children of somebody, and they deserve life, liberty,  and the pursuit of happiness.   I am totally, completely, and absolutely antithetical to this notion  of constitutional carry, where you can just buy a gun because you have  the money to buy it. We ought to have red flag laws in this country. We  ought to be able to decide whether or not we are going to allow people  to have lethality that can, at a moment's notice, take tens of lives.   Gun manufacturers ought to be held accountable for placing this level  of  [[Page H1767]]  lethality within the communities. At some point, gun manufacturers are  going to lose this immunity they have to being held accountable. The  Congress never should have given it to them.   This is a sad day in the history of this country. Two people--it  doesn't matter about their color--two people were shot because they  happened to be in the wrong place in the presence of persons with  lethality.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, and still I rise and I rise today,  again, in the name of liberty and justice for all. More specifically,  liberty and justice for Ralph Yarl and Kaylin Gillis as promised in our  Pledge of Allegiance.   Mr. Speaker, earlier today in making a floor speech concerning these  two persons who were victims of gun violence, I incorrectly indicated  that both lost their lives.   Miraculously, Mr. Yarl did not lose his life for which I am grateful  and for which I want to make the Record clear. I want people to know  that if I make a mistake, I am going to correct my mistake in the same  venue where I made it. I made a mistake, and I am grateful that I have  had the opportunity to correct it.                            ____________________
