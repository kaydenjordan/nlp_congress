 Mr. President, when I opened the Senate on Monday, I  repeated something Republicans have stated for months now. We need to  put partisanship aside and get more bipartisan, targeted coronavirus  relief out to the American people.   Dating back to the summer, and all fall, Senate Republicans tried  repeatedly to advance hundreds of billions of dollars to prevent  layoffs, protect small businesses, fund vaccine distribution, and  continue assisting workers who have already lost their jobs due to the  crisis. Every time, the Speaker of the House and the Democratic leader  blocked our efforts. It had to be the entirety of their leftwing wish  list or nothing at all.   Finally, this week, we are seeing cracks starting to form in the  Democratic leaders' stone wall, and thank goodness for the country that  that is finally happening. In the last several days, the Democratic  leaders have signaled a new willingness to engage in good faith and,  yesterday, a number of Senate Democrats proposed a different  compromise.   But at the risk of repeating something we all know, making law will  not just require the Senate's approval but also the signature of the  President of the United States.   So, after several conversations with the Secretary of the Treasury  and the White House Chief of Staff, I put forward yesterday another  proposal reflecting what the President is ready to sign into law. What  we have proposed would give universities and nonprofits the legal  certainty they need. It would create a second draw on the job-saving  Paycheck Protection Program to prevent more layoffs, and it would  extend  [[Page S7144]]  two important emergency unemployment benefit programs that were created  by the CARES Act and which will expire in December without action.  These programs have been championed by our Democratic colleagues,  particularly the senior Senator from Virginia, and we made sure they  were included in the framework.   I hope our Democratic colleagues will finally let Congress pass a  bipartisan bill that the President will likely sign into law and do so  soon                            ____________________     Now, Mr. President, on a completely different matter,  the Senate revolves around people.   The body consists of 100 individuals. One of our key duties concerns  the personnel whom we examine and confirm, and there are all these  dedicated staff professionals who make this place go.   Today, it is both my great honor and regrettable task to honor  someone who secured all three parts of that senatorial triple crown:  the senior Senator from Tennessee, the chairman of the Committee on  Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, Lamar Alexander.   Lamar first set foot here as a talented young staffer. Decades later,  he appeared before us as a supersuccessful former Governor and  university president with a nomination to the Cabinet. And for the past  18 years, the other 99 of us have gotten to serve alongside one of the  most impactful Senators in modern American history.   I have known Lamar for more than 50 years. We first met in 1969, when  I was working for a freshman Senator named Marlow Cook and he worked  down in the executive branch. We met at the suggestion of his previous  boss and mentor, Senator Howard Baker. Either he suspected our paths  might cross again later or he just saw two serious young guys in need  of some livelier social lives. Now, this may shock the Presiding  Officer, but I am afraid young Lamar Alexander and young Mitch  McConnell did not exactly go crazy and paint the town red. But I will  take a five-decade friendship any day.   Both of us headed back home to continue our careers. It was already  clear that a bright future in elected office likely lay in store for  him.   Lamar's reverence for public service started early. I believe he was  about 10 years old when his father, himself a longtime local official,  took him to meet his hometown Congressman, Howard Baker, Sr. The father  of his future boss shook the boy's hand and handed him a dime. I think  Lamar was hooked, then and there.   Decades later, when Lamar announced his 1996 Presidential run, he was  in his hometown of Maryville. His speech began with a story about his  mother. She had read where he had lovingly described his upbringing as  lower middle class, and she had taken umbrage to that. After all, Lamar  had a library card and music lessons. In her words, ``everything you  needed that was important.''   And I would certainly add loving parents to that list.   This son of two educators grew up steeped in the importance of  schooling. He would later reference his mother's work in early  childhood education by saying he is probably the only Secretary of  Education in history--in history--who spent 5 years in kindergarten.   That passion would remain throughout Lamar's career. His cutting-edge  focus on improving opportunities and reforming education benefited  Tennessee hugely in the 1980s, and our whole Nation during his time in  President Bush 41's Cabinet.   But that isn't the only way Lamar has honored his roots. You couldn't  walk across the entire State of Tennessee in a plaid shirt, get elected  Governor before the age of 40, and serve more combined years as  Governor and Senator than anyone else in the history of the Volunteer  State without becoming entirely intertwined with the place. Every  corner of the State is better for his service. His groundbreaking work  to bring home good-paying auto jobs has paid dividends, so has his  major focus on infrastructure and better roads.   But alas, even building a statewide and then national reputation does  not always, always, translate into honest-to-goodness celebrity status.   I understand that following Lamar's Governorship, a stretch of  highway in Maryville was fittingly named the Lamar Alexander Parkway to  honor him. I further understand that sometime later, Lamar was driving  on that very road and stopped for breakfast. When it was time to pay  for his food, he handed over his credit card. The woman on the other  side of the counter glanced at the name on the card, and then back at  Lamar. ``Hey,'' she said, ``were you named after this road?''   Now, as a man of faith, I am certain Lamar knows Luke, chapter 4:  ``No prophet is accepted in his hometown.'' Apparently, neither are  statesmen to be recognized on their own highway.   Here in the Senate, too, Lamar's impact has been massive, and the  convictions that fueled it have been straightforward. He starts with a  very firm framework: the right-of-center principles that Ronald Reagan  used to rebuild a confident, prosperous America and beat communism. The  Federal Government isn't meant to take over our States, neighborhoods,  or our lives. But Lamar's career has also confirmed that conservative  governance is not a contradiction in terms. There are genuine public  goods it is the government's job to secure: public roads, public lands,  public education, certain aspects of public health. He has dedicated  himself to making those things better and stronger, especially for  those who need opportunity the most.   This vision aligns with the greatest traditions of the Republican  Party and indeed of American history--government that is limited but  effective and smart; a system where power stays close to the people and  working families can thrive and prosper. These principles made our  colleague a nationally known leader long before he was sworn in as a  Senator. But I would say they have reached full flourishing with  Chairman Alexander's astonishingly effective leadership right here in  this body.   Students, families, and teachers benefit every day from the Every  Student Succeeds Act, Chairman Alexander's historic, bipartisan  makeover following No Child Left Behind. One report called it ``the  largest devolution of federal control to the states in a quarter  century.''   Millions of medically vulnerable Americans also have their champion  in our friend from Tennessee. The overwhelmingly bipartisan 21st  Century Cures Act was the single most important law of the entire 114th  Congress. It is paving the way for more innovation and faster  innovation to benefit patients who have no time to waste--another Lamar  Alexander production.   His leadership was instrumental in the landmark legislation we passed  2 years ago to combat the opioid epidemic.   Just this year, he was the driving force behind the Great American  Outdoors Act, the Senate's historic project to secure our parks and  public lands for generations to come.   The list doesn't end there. There have been other education wins,  like permanent funding for historically Black colleges and universities  and simplifying the student loan process. There have been laws like the  Music Modernization Act, which Lamar hammered out with our former  colleague, Senator Hatch--a legislative duet from two musical virtuosos  in their own rights.   Senator Alexander knows about 50 different issues as well as most  Senators know 3 or 4. He is hands down one of the most brilliant, most  thoughtful, and most effective legislators any of us have ever seen.   He likes to say this about the Senate: ``It's hard to get here; it's  hard to stay here; so while you're here, you might as well try to  accomplish something.'' Well, mission accomplished--and then some.   If you reviewed Senator Alexander's resume and results without  knowing the man, you might suspect he arrived as an established hotshot  and threw his weight around. But even as Lamar has mastered the levers  of power here, his character has never been captured by Washington.  Lamar has remained clear that he has just been on loan from Tennessee  the whole time.   So we have had more than just a master legislator to call upon; we  have been blessed with a sober, honest, and deliberate statesman-- someone who cares as much about preserving this institution as the  near-term results he can wring out of it.  [[Page S7145]]    From daily conversations to committee business, to the most dramatic  moments on the floor, whether in the minority or the majority, Lamar  has taken pains to treat his colleagues exactly as he would hope to be  treated in their shoes. He has worked to build consensus in a  consensus-based body. He has cherished and defended the Senate the  Framers designed.   It is no exaggeration to say Lamar Alexander is one of the most  brilliant people I have met in my life. His mind is a steel trap. I  understand he likes to keep his staff experts locked around a  conference table for long sessions, turning a complex issue over and  over until they have arrived at the best path forward for the country  and the most precise, concise way to communicate it. He has a mastery  of policy, mastery of the English language, and I can't forget to  mention my friend's good cheer.   Lamar really does live by the motto he inherited from his good friend  and fellow Tennesseean, the late author Alex Haley: ``Find the good and  praise it.''   I myself have leaned on Lamar's wisdom for many years, but I think I  have learned just as much from his optimism, his can-do spirit, and his  ability to look on the bright side and then discern how some more hard  work can make it brighter still. So I am going to miss our regular  dinners, even with our weeknight scheduling and official one-drink  limit. Like I said, we weren't exactly party animals in our twenties  either.   But here is something else that never changes: How reassuring it is  to be weighing a thorny question and see Lamar Alexander seated across  the table. You know, the Senate can be all-consuming. It is not only  our colleagues but their spouses and loved ones who all get folded into  the extended family around here. So I am extremely grateful that it  turned out that Mitch McConnell was not the most important young person  Lamar Alexander met during his stint in Washington--not by a mile.   Honey Alexander is a remarkable woman. She is a force of nature and  incredible partner for Lamar. She raised a young family in the  Governor's mansion for 8 years. She charmed and impressed more voters  during Lamar's various campaigns than Lamar himself, and she has  devoted her own career to public health and philanthropy. Their shared  love and mutual respect inspire everyone. Honey is just about the  finest ``in-law'' the U.S. Senate could have ever had, so Elaine and I  are grateful to call her our friend as well.   So as much as I am dreading life in the Senate without my brilliant  friend, even I can't begrudge him the silver lining. The most  distinguished public servant has more than earned the right to spend  more days fly-fishing or walking trails in the Smokies, more mornings  waking up on Blackberry Farm, and a much larger share of his time with  Honey and their family.   About 6 years ago, it fell to Lamar to eulogize his friend and  mentor, Howard Baker. Here on the floor, he quoted another Senator who  had said that when it came to the Senate, there was Howard Baker, and  then there was the rest of us.   Well, my friend, for 18 years, there has been Lamar Alexander, and  there has been the rest of us. So I am sorry that in a few more weeks,  it will be just the rest of us left. But you are leaving this body and  those of us in it and the Nation it exists to serve stronger and better  because you were here.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Chair  lay before the Senate the House message accompanying H.R. 6395.   The Presiding Officer laid before the Senate the following message  from the House of Representatives:         Resolved, That the bill from the House of Representatives       (H.R. 6395) entitled ``An Act to authorize appropriations for       fiscal year 2021 for military activities of the Department of       Defense, for military construction, and for defense       activities of the Department of Energy, to prescribe military       personnel strengths for such fiscal year, and for other       purposes.'', do pass with an amendment.
