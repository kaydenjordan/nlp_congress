 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from New York for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, there are 2,400 DACA recipients in my district. ``We are  not one,'' ``no somos uno.'' There are 30,000 DACA recipients in my  home State of New York. ``We are not 100,'' ``no somos cien.'' There  are 800,000 DACA recipients in the country. As of this year, there were  more than 10,000 noncitizens serving in the U.S. military and an  additional 12,000 noncitizens under Reserve status. ``We are millions,  count us well,'' ``somos millones, cuentanos bien.''   DREAMers are veterans, teachers, nurses, college students; and  DREAMers are also MacArthur genius fellows. Cristina Jimenez is a  MacArthur genius fellow, a powerhouse championship for immigrant youth,  and, like me, she is also a CUNY alum and she grew up undocumented.   This is why I urge my colleagues to bring a clean Dream Act to the  House floor. H.R. 3440, the Dream Act, would not provide automatic  amnesty, as I have heard some of my colleagues incorrectly say. The  Dream Act has an 8-year conditional basis of permanent residency  status. You have to either work for 3 years, serve in the Armed Forces,  or study. You have to keep a clean record, get a background check, and  a medical exam. Then, and only after then, for a few more years, you  can apply for citizenship.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to vote against the previous  question so that we can immediately bring the Dream Act to the floor  and provide certainty, hope, and opportunity for 800,000 talented young  people. Our country needs them and we cannot afford to wait another  day.
