 Madam Speaker, President Trump stood in this very  Chamber last week promising that he would protect Medicare and Social  Security, but like so many things with this administration, that empty  promise didn't even last a week. In fact, when he sent his budget  proposal to Congress on Monday, it cut more than $1.6 trillion for  Medicare, Medicaid, and other healthcare programs. It cut another $24  billion from Social Security.   As the top 1 percent of wealthy corporations continue to benefit from  the President's tax cut, he is now asking for you, the American people,  to pay for it.   He likes to brag that the stock market is up and unemployment is  down, but what he refuses to acknowledge is that the economy isn't  working for most working folks.   Healthcare costs are rising as his administration sues the eliminate  the ACA in its entirety. The cost of living is increasing as he tries  to cut funding for affordable housing. And prescription drug prices  continue to climb despite our passage of H.R. 3, which is collecting  dust on Mitch McConnell's desk.   The President's budget is nothing more than assault on hardworking  families just trying to keep a roof over their heads and put food on  their table. The American people deserve better.   House Democrats are going to continue passing legislation that  actually gets government working for the people again, and the  President and Mitch McConnell should get off the sidelines and join us  in this effort.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, with Virginia becoming the 38th State  to ratify the equal rights amendment, today we make it clear that  Congress never intended the arbitrary deadline to act as a barrier to  ratification of this vital amendment.   Ratification of the equal rights amendment affirms our Nation's  values by codifying an expressed prohibition against sex discrimination  in our Nation's foundational document.   While our Nation's courts have properly recognized that women are  entitled to equal protection under the law, we have a responsibility to  do all that we can to guarantee that, regardless of sex, all Americans  are treated the same in every aspect of their lives, including making a  living, obtaining healthcare, and accessing public services.   These rights must not be swayed by political ideology or depend on  judicial philosophy. Equality is a founding value of this great country  and, more than any other word, describes the very idea of America.   Madam Speaker, a vote for H.J. Res. 79 is a vote for equality. I urge  my colleagues to support H.J. Res. 79.
