 Mr. Chairman, I thank my colleague and I  rise in strong support of H.R. 1. It is a comprehensive, once-in-a- generation blueprint for reforming our democratic  [[Page H2393]]  system, ranging from gerrymandering to voter suppression, and voting  rights to the dominance of unaccountable big money in our politics. It  is an urgent priority rightly numbered H.R. 1, and basic to everything  else we need to do. If our democracy doesn't work, nothing works.   It represents a culmination of issues I have worked on during my  entire time in Congress, particularly, the way moneyed interests can  corrupt our politics and how they drown out the voices of everyone  else.   The For the People Act will modernize our Presidential public  financing system. It will establish a new public matching system for  congressional races to empower small donors. It will crack down on  improper super-PAC coordination with campaigns.   H.R. 1 also includes my legislation to repeal the IRS dark-money  rule, and it expands my original stand-by-your-ad provision to require  corporations and other groups to disclose the top funders when they run  political ads over the air or on the internet.   These reforms will empower American voters and encourage more diverse  candidates to run for office, and will help break the stranglehold of  big money on our politics.   Let's deliver on the promises we have made to restore integrity,  accountability, and transparency to our democracy. I urge my colleagues  to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 1.
