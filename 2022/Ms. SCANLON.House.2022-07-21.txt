 Mr. Speaker, I am proud to share the direct investments  in Pennsylvania's Fifth District for workers and businesses provided by  this year's National Defense Authorization Act.   We worked hard to secure its continued funding for the CH-47F Block  II Chinook and V-22 Osprey programs, which provide good-paying local  jobs to over 4,000 skilled men and women who build those aircraft in  Ridley Park, Pennsylvania.   In addition to supporting thousands of good-paying local jobs, the  programs benefit dozens of small businesses and suppliers across  Pennsylvania.   I am also pleased that this year's NDAA includes my bill to support  Federal firefighters in PA-05 and across the country. Federal  firefighters, like those at Philadelphia's Navy Yard, have some of the  toughest jobs in our communities, but budget cuts have forced them to  operate without full crews, making their jobs more dangerous.   My bill requires the Department of Defense to adhere to national fire  protection staffing standards at the Navy Yard and elsewhere.   I am proud that this year's defense bill recognizes the invaluable  contributions of PA-05 workers and businesses to our national security,  and I will continue to advocate for PA-05 priorities as the legislation  makes its way to the President's desk.                            ____________________
