 Madam Speaker, first, I want to address a bill that we  voted on this afternoon, one of the three bills under the suspension of  the rules, H.R. 35, to amend section 249 of title 18, United States  Code, to specify lynching as a hate crime act.   I was in the Judiciary Committee when we took up the hate crimes act.  I know there were people who said because of James Byrd, the African  American who was drug behind a truck by three individuals, that that  was a poster case that demanded hate crime legislation.   Actually, I was quite comfortable if all three of the defendants in  that case had gotten the death penalty. In Texas, we do have the death  penalty for such a crime as that. Two of the three got the death  penalty. One got life in prison. And I felt like the death penalty,  from everything I had read, was appropriate.   I am someone who has looked two defendants in the eye and sentenced  them to death. It is a very somber, serious thing to do, but the crimes  justified it in those cases.   I was talking to my friend, Congressman   Bobby Rush, a man who has  been fighting injustice and unfairness, seems like, his whole life. He  is absolutely one of the kindest, most decent people to talk to and  deal with here in Congress. He is just a real gentleman. This was  Congressman Rush's bill. And I mentioned to him after the vote--I did  vote ``no'' on this.   Now, there are some great findings for the first six pages. But at  page 7, we finally get to actually what the act does. It says: Whoever  conspires with another to violate section 245, 247, or 249 of this  title or section 901 of the Civil Rights Act shall be punished in the  same manner as a completed violation of such section, except that if  the maximum term of imprisonment for such completed violation is less  than 10 years, the person may be imprisoned for not more than 10 years.   That is ridiculous. First of all, I have trouble with the Federal  nexus of lynching. I would, like in the James Byrd case, prefer that  those defendants be tried under the Texas capital murder statute rather  than under the Federal hate crimes law. Because under the Texas capital  murder laws, the defendants could get the death penalty. And they  should have been tried under that and should have gotten it.   I have such respect for Congressman Rush. Lynching is more serious  than a 10-year maximum sentence. And I would much rather, if somebody  is lynched in Texas, they be subject, under Texas law, to the death  penalty rather than a 10-year maximum. It sends entirely the wrong  message about how serious this is. I couldn't vote for a 10-year  maximum when we are talking about lynching.   I know there are some States that don't have good criminal laws, that  maybe they would prefer the Federal Government try such cases. But  Congressman Rush said this was the best he could get an agreement on.  But, God bless him, he knows better than most people how serious this  is.   So on the one hand, I applaud his efforts at trying to bring people  to justice who would commit such a heinous act, and I regret needing to  vote ``no.'' But I just felt like this is too serious to be handled at  such a low level.                                time  1600    So I thank Congressman Rush for his efforts. He is indeed a very fine  man. It is a pleasure to interact with him here in Congress, but I  couldn't vote for that. That is just too serious.   I have had a friend I met here years ago named Philip Haney. He was  one of the finest, most patriotic, competent people I have ever known  in my life, a man of absolute honesty, complete integrity, who cared  deeply about the future of this country. He also was a  [[Page H1220]]  Christian brother, and that certainly affected so much of what he did.   Philip studied Arabic culture and language while he was working as a  scientist in the Middle East before he became a founding member of the  Department of Homeland Security in 2002. He was there at the beginning  when Homeland Security became a Department for the first time. He was a  Customs and Border Protection agriculture officer.   He was a scientist by education and training. It was amazing how  organized and how brilliant he was. I constantly marveled at his  ability to organize facts in his own head and memorize them, remember  things so clearly.   But after he advanced as a CBP officer, where he served several tours  of duty at the National Targeting Center near Washington, D.C., he was  quickly promoted to its Advanced Targeting Team, which was an  unprecedented accomplishment for an agent on temporary duty assignment.   The FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force Award was something he was  presented in recognition of his exceptional contributions to  interagency national security successes. He won numerous awards and  commendations from his superiors for meticulously compiling information  and reports that led to the identification of hundreds of terrorists.   He specialized in Islamic theology and the strategy and tactics of  the global Islamic movement. He wrote a book after he left and retired  from government service, a takeoff on the Obama administration's  slogan, ``See Something, Say Something.''   But, as he experienced firsthand, he saw things that were a threat to  this country, he said something, and he was severely punished for it,  because apparently the Obama administration had some radical Islamic  ties that they did not want anybody, including Philip Haney, to expose.   So, he had a book that he wrote, ``See Something, Say Nothing,'' and  it documented the Obama administration's effort to obfuscate the role  that radical Islam played in numerous terrorist attacks that took place  in America from 2008 to 2016.   One review of Philip's book described it as an expose of a  politically correct Federal Government that capitulates to a subversive  enemy within and punishes those who reject its narrative.   In 2016, he, as a whistleblower, testified before the Senate  Judiciary Committee, chaired by then-Senator Ted Cruz, to allege that  the Obama administration had acted irresponsibly concerning Islamic  extremism. Philip Haney claimed that the administration had acted in  favor of political correctness rather than take actions that may well  have prevented the June 2016 Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando and  the San Bernardino shooting in December of 2015.   He was investigating groups that helped radicalize normal Muslim  believers, radicalizing them to the point that they would commit acts  of terror, and he found some ties. It was amazing, when he got ahold of  a string, how he could trace that string back to its roots.   He once said that he did, at the Department of Homeland Security,  what he did with bugs: He followed the trail and found the nest. It was  amazing how he could do that, and that is the reason he was cited as he  was.   In fact, this letter from June 8 of 2012 to Officer Philip B. Haney:         On behalf of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, I commend       your outstanding contributions while assigned to the National       Targeting Center-Passenger. Your display of dedication and       effort in the fight against terrorism has been exemplary.        Your talents and professionalism have contributed to the       continued achievements of the NTC-P. You played a key role by       providing support to the CBP mission and the NTC lead role in       defending and protecting our Nation's borders. A key       component of the National Targeting Center-Passenger's       success is the invaluable people, like you, who perform the       work in our important mission. I am confident to know that       CBP can rely upon you to provide expertise to combat threats       against our Nation.        Additionally, your expertise and experience has been       invaluable while assigned to the Advanced Targeting Team.       Your research on the Tablighi Jamaat Initiative has assisted       in the identification of over 300 persons with possible       connections to terrorism. The assistance you have provided in       the development of this initiative has been key to the future       success of the project. The National Targeting Center looks       forward to your continuing support and assistance in the       program.        Once again, thank you for your unfailing commitment to the       success of the National Targeting System mission. Your       professional actions and achievements reflect favorably on       you and all of the Customs and Border Protection.        Thank you for a job well done.    Well, that was June of 2012. It wasn't terribly long after that he  had been entering information on radical Islamic ties with people in  the United States, attempting to come into the United States, with ties  to people in the United States. He was documenting all those things.   We had a Secretary of Homeland Security who bragged about how  Homeland Security could connect the dots, and then he was ordered to  start removing these dots, so to speak. He was ordered to start  deleting thousands of pages of data that he had carefully researched  and identified that would help protect America.   That was during the Obama administration.   He was scared for his country, that the Obama administration would  make him delete, and there was an occasion when he was watching his  computer and somebody started deleting hundreds of pages of documents  as he watched, hundreds of pages of information that would have helped  keep America safe for the future.    There was an opportunity the House of Representatives had--we were in  the majority--where he could have been brought in as a specially  requested agent for the House. Apparently, there were people who were  afraid that he had so much information that the Obama administration  might come after anybody who was attempting to help or protect him and  the valuable information he had.   He wasn't brought in. He was told: Oh, go file an IG complaint with  the Homeland Security inspector general.   I implored him that that would be a mistake because the inspector  general at that time at Homeland Security had already been cited for  falsifying an IG report to protect the Obama administration. We knew  that it was not going to be a fair inspector general investigation.   In fact, he became a whistleblower, filed his IG complaint about the  Obama administration deleting so much data from its database to help  identify terrorists, and, clearly, for anybody who was involved in that  effort to purge our computer data on foreign terrorists, his complaint  could be seen as a threat to expose people within the Obama  administration who were involved in purging or, as one of our intel  people--Homeland Security, like DOJ, began to blind itself of the  ability to see our enemies.   That is why, even though he was investigating Tablighi Jamaat and the  manner in which normal Muslim believers were converted into radicals  who would be capable of murder, there were a number of things that he  noticed that they did to move people in that direction.   He identified that the people at San Bernardino who killed, I think  it was, 14 Americans there, that, if he had been allowed to pursue his  investigation, would have identified those people.   We blinded ourselves of the ability to see our enemy, and we also had  not been training people.   Philip had identified a female in California involved in the  shooting. She took on the name of a famous radical Islamic male  terrorist. If he had been allowed to question her, he would have  immediately known: There is something very wrong here. Why would you  take on the name of a male terrorist, historic terrorist?   But it had been made very clear in the Obama administration that, if  you are too active in pursuit of radical Islamists, it is not going to  go well for you.                                time  1615    And, in fact, after he filed the IG report, I think it was an effort  for some in the Obama administration to protect themselves. We have now  seen it occur with the Trump campaign.   There was a Grand Jury that was convened to go after and try to  destroy Philip Haney's life. His wife, Francesca, was a college  professor, and the trauma of being raided, constantly harassed, and  questioned, seeing one of the finest, most honest and honorable  protectors of America in our history,  [[Page H1221]]  Philip Haney, she saw him just being savaged. And it ended up resulting  in her going to the hospital. Whether it was a full-blown nervous  breakdown or not, I am not sure, but it sent her to the hospital to  have the United States Government go after a man she knew was a hero  for and to the United States.   Well, Philip was so meticulous, so organized. They couldn't find  anything with which to indict him. They were trying to drag up  something, but he had documented well everything he had ever done. It  was the way he was. It is who he was. They couldn't find anything to  indict him. They had already moved him in basically a closet, kept him  from doing the job he was the best at in protecting America. And  finally they basically said, we can't find anything. So, look, if you  will just agree to retire, then we will let everything go, but you have  got to destroy stuff in your possession.   Well, he retired, and that is when he wrote the book See Something,  Say Nothing. He had been savaged by his own government, his own country  that he was trying to protect.   And I had commented to him about his book. He had given me a draft to  read before it was published. I said, Philip, you don't really name a  whole lot of names in this book about where the problems have been. He  said, ``I know, this is just the first draft. I will do another that  names names.'' And that is what he was working on.   After Francesca died about a year ago, he moved to California and was  near his sister, Diana. I was so thrilled to get a text from Philip  saying basically, I have met someone. She is wonderful. They were soul  mates. And I texted him that I had a minister friend that had said, you  know, it is interesting, when men who have been in long marriages have  their wife pass away, it is not unusual; in fact, it may be average, to  have them remarried in 6 months. Of course, he volunteered, women that  had been in a longstanding marriage when their husband dies, a lot of  them don't ever want to remarry. It is an interesting difference.   I wasn't surprised that Philip had found love again. Philip and  Denise were going to be married on April 4. It appeared he would be  coming back to work for the United States Government and finally be  able to put to full use his incredible knack for rooting out  terrorists.   I was amazed, because when you met Philip, you weren't sure. He was  kind of a quiet guy, and you didn't realize at first just how brilliant  he was. He could ask questions--and I know he did this with people  trying to come into the country--and he got people to volunteer  information. I bet they thought, oh, this guy, what a doofus. What does  he know? He got them to volunteer information that I doubt I could have  ever gotten out of them, no matter how tough a cross-examination I had  done. But Phil in his amazing way, he could get information out of  people. It was amazing what he was able to do and capable of doing.   So he had hoped to be coming back in the next few weeks to work for  the Federal Government. But then he got some news last week that he  needed to have open heart surgery. The chances of success were very  good. Complete success shouldn't be too long of a recuperation time.  And he passed that along to the person that he was going to be coming  to work for in the Federal Government. Sent him a text, I have got to  have open heart surgery next week, but basically hope to be available  for work shortly after that. Short recuperation.   Philip either talked or texted with his sister virtually every day,  and they texted up to the evening last Thursday. And Friday he was  found in his car with a gunshot wound and a gun nearby.   I think the Amador County law officials are doing a decent job. They  seem to be very committed. But his book was going to name names of  people that put this country at risk. He was getting married April 4.  Finally going to be able to come back to the U.S. Government and use  his incredible talents and ability to spot danger for our country and  stop it, and he ends up with a bullet in him.   So the investigation is ongoing. He is severely missed by those of us  who loved him. We had talked back before he filed the IG complaint, I  had been concerned about his safety with all the information he knew  and the people that could have gotten in trouble. And we had a mutual  pact, if it was said either one of us ended up having committed  suicide, then the other is going to make sure that truth wins out.   He was so organized, though. He had made it clear to his sister that  there was something he was going to do and something he was doing, he  said you need to come over because I have got everything laid out. If  something happens during the heart surgery next week, I have everything  laid out. And that is how he was, everything was so organized. I would  love to be as organized as Phil.   Philip had such a positive outlook on things. He had been through a  horrendous time with his wife having been made ill by the raucous Obama  administration coming after him to try to shut him up.   See, that is a real whistleblower. He testified before the Senate.  That is what a real whistleblower does. A real whistleblower does not  remain anonymous. They come forward, subject themselves to cross- examination, and supposedly have protection.   But that is not what happened in the Obama administration. In fact,  the Obama administration prosecuted more people for leaking than every  other administration in our country's history added together. They went  after whistleblowers. Rather tragic. I can't adequately express it.   February 5, 2016, The Hill had an article about Phil. ``DHS Ordered  Me to Scrub Records of Muslims with Terror Ties.''   Conservative HQ, George Rasley has done a really nice piece; ``In  Memoriam: Philip B. Haney, 21st Century Paul Revere.''   Fox News had an article by Nick Givas, ``Philip Haney, DHS  Whistleblower During Obama Era, Found Dead, Police Say.''   Joe Martin, ``Philip Haney: Whistleblower and Happy Warrior.''   What an amazing man. I miss him. I miss getting his cheery text  messages. And I know his fiance and his sister and even his brother-in- law misses getting those messages, as well.   So there is big news supposedly that the Trump administration is now  trying to make sure that people that are working for the Trump  administration are actually working for it and not against it.   And the truth is, President Trump got some bad advice from people  that were not concerned about his achieving the goals he promised he  would work toward, but they were interested in stopping him.   We found out after the George W. Bush administration there were  holdovers from the Clinton years that would tell President Bush, yes,  sir, we will take care of it, and then drag their feet and made sure  what he wanted didn't happen, and even would leak information to try to  stop President Bush from achieving what he hoped to achieve. And we  have certainly seen that occur in the Trump administration.   In fact, an article mentions Rich Higgins, he had prepared  information, basically a memo, on how to move forward and how the Trump  administration could protect itself from people that would try to stop  President Trump and to make sure that people working for him were  actually working for him.   But a buddy of Mr. Brennan and Mr. Clapper, named H.R. McMaster,  found out about the memo and instead of rewarding Rich Higgins for his  brilliant work to help the Trump administration, he had him perp walked  out and refused to let him even go back to his office. Because Mr.  McMaster, despite his front and his sucking up to President Trump, he  was all about stopping President Trump.   And for his time there he may have helped on some little things, but  overall he was making sure--it certainly appeared to me he was making  sure--that President Trump didn't achieve the goals he hoped to, and,  in fact, was heard to bad-mouth, say vulgar things about President  Trump. So it was good when he was gone.   And President Trump has continued to work on efforts to get people  that actually want to help him achieve his goals. And naturally deep- state establishment people in Washington, they don't want to see that  happen, so they  [[Page H1222]]  throw up things like, oh, gee, the Trump administration is on a witch  hunt. It is not on a witch hunt. It just wants people that will work to  help the President achieve his goals.   If, for example, you have an inane person working with the National  Security Council and in his mind he knows everything that anybody needs  to know about Ukraine, and he puts together talking points for the  President to use in talking to the President of Ukraine and the  President doesn't follow his expert talking points because the  President is foreign policy when he gets elected, not what some  lieutenant colonel thinks--but you can tell Vindman got a burr in his  saddle, so to speak, when the President didn't follow his talking  points to a T.                                time  1630    He needed to go. It appears he likely leaked information to the so- called whistleblower, not a real whistleblower.   A real whistleblower is a man of courage and integrity, like Phil  Haney. That is a real whistleblower.   A real whistleblower is somebody like Adam Lovinger, who sees that  the Department of Defense is paying hundreds of thousands of dollars,  multiple payments, to some professor in London named Stefan Halper, who  happens to be setting up the Trump campaign so that they can get  warrants against it, and the Department of Defense is paying this guy.  But Adam's job is making sure the Defense Department was getting their  money's worth when they paid, and he couldn't see they were getting any  money's worth from this Stefan Halper guy in London.   If the left really wants to see somebody prosecuted who was in the  U.S. Government who was paying for foreign interference in our  election, maybe they should start with the guys that came after Adam  Lovinger, a real whistleblower, not like this guy that filed a secret  complaint that wasn't firsthand, had no personal knowledge. They just  knew they wanted to stop President Trump and didn't mind putting the  United States Government at risk by doing so, because, after all, they  hated the President.   So it is worth looking back a little bit.   Here is an article from October 19, 2016, titled ``Obama's plan to  make the administrative state permanent,'' by Nathan Mehrens. This is  before the election, a month before the 2016 election. He points out  that: ``President Obama's cronies are being placed into permanent staff  positions in the Federal Government, and the administration is not even  bothering to follow its own personnel rules which govern the process.''   Apparently, there were people in the Obama administration that  realized: You know, there is a chance Trump could win this election.  Even though we are sure the American people will elect Hillary Clinton,  there is a chance.   There are supposedly around 4,000 people or so that an administration  appoints into politically appointed positions, but those people are  subject to being fired on the whim of a new President. So, according to  this article, the Obama administration started taking people who were  political appointees and moving them into career appointments.   We have even seen a case in Arizona where a Federal employee commits  a Federal crime, is found guilty of a Federal crime, and a court comes  back later and said: Eh, that wasn't an adequate basis to fire a  Federal employee.   Well, once you get into a position like she was in, it is hard to  root them out even when they have committed a Federal crime in their  job. That was in the VA. We have changed the law with regard to VA to  make it easier to fire felons that commit felonies when they are in  their job at the VA.   The Office of Personnel Management's Director in November 2009 made a  big show of a new policy requiring prior approval for these  conversions, taking a political appointee and what is called burrowing  them into the Federal Government so they will be part of the deep  state, hard to ever get rid of, when they are nothing but political  hacks.   This statement says:         I believe we must hold ourselves and the government to a       higher standard, one that honors and supports the President's       strong commitment to a government that is transparent and       open. OPM's responsibility to uphold the merit system is not       limited to Presidential election years nor to competitive       service appointments. That is why I am instituting a change       in OPM policy with respect to hiring political appointees for       civil service jobs.    They go on to say that in order to convert somebody from political  appointee to career civil service status, they have to get the  permission of OPM. But as the article says, apparently, some agencies  didn't see the need to bother with that permission, and they processed  conversions without OPM permission.   So we see what is happening.   Here is another article, this one is from November 27, after  President Trump was elected:         Congressional Republicans are warning the departing Obama       administration against moving any more political appointees       into career jobs.    But that is what they had done.   It says: ``Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs  Committee Chairman Ron Johnson, Wisconsin Republican, has asked Acting  OPM Director Beth Cobert for weekly reports on all conversions or  attempted conversions.''   But I would be willing to bet they didn't get what they were asking  for, certainly not all of it.   This article is from December 8, 2016. This is from the Daily Signal,  Fred Lucas: ``After President Barack Obama exits office, at least 88 of  his political appointees will likely remain working in the Federal  Government under a Donald Trump administration, according to numbers  from the Office of Personnel Management.''   It goes on to talk about ``Federal agencies selected 112 political  appointees for career civil service jobs,'' and that is just in  December. They had about another 6 weeks to be moving people from  political appointee positions into civil service so that when President  Trump came in, he would have people in key positions who would hate  him, be loyal to people like Sally Yates and President Obama, others,  Brennan, Clapper. They could undermine the Trump administration, as  they have been doing for 3 years now.   In Axios, Jonathan Swan comes out with an article this week that  appears to be taking aim at some people who are friends of the  President who are trying to help him figure out who it is that is  undermining and has no interest in helping President Trump achieve his  goals and, in fact, has an interest in destroying them.   Three years in, I would think a President should be entitled to  people working for him who are actually working for him and not against  him, but I am sure there will be more people who I classify as heroes  trying to help President Trump make America even greater by getting the  people out that are trying to stop what he promised to do.    People will come after one of my heroes, Ginni Thomas, the wife of  Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, and Barbara Ledeen, and those  who are coming after people that are trying to help President Trump,  have people who actually like him working for him, not people who can  just suck up to him, but people who will actually like him, support his  agenda, and want to help, and I think we will be seeing a lot more of  that.   It is a shame that they have not been doing articles pointing out  some of these duplicitous people who say they are loyal to the Trump  administration, and they do all they can to undermine it and violate  their oaths.   I still believe if Durham doesn't end up indicting some people who  could go to jail, we won't get the country back.   There is no deterrence in what has gone on so far. People abused the  FISA court system, repeatedly lied to a Federal judge or judges in the  FISA court to get warrants to spy on the Trump administration.   If there are no consequences, if people who have made it an  instrument of politics to use the intelligence community, Department of  Justice, Department of Defense, State Department to try to defeat a  Presidential candidate, and then when he gets elected, try to remove  him from office, if there aren't multiple people who go to jail for  what they have done, the crimes committed, then there is no deterrence.  They will be up to it even bigger, but next time, they will have  figured out where they made mistakes in getting caught and being  unsuccessful, and we will lose the  [[Page H1223]]  freedom we once had to select our own leaders.   But I don't hear of these authors. I don't read any of these authors  actually condemning the DNC, the Clinton campaign, the Department of  Defense, the DOJ in using and getting help from foreigners to try to  combat the Trump campaign and to affect our election.   Anybody who would say on this floor that there were no Ukrainians  involved in trying to affect our election, they are just ignorant. You  know, there is no harm, we are all ignorant of some things, but they  are ignorant of the facts.   We can start with the op-ed that the Ambassador from Ukraine wrote  before the election, trashing President Trump. That is trying to affect  our election by a Ukrainian, and we know it had to go a lot deeper than  that.   I would love to see some of these folks who want to come after  President Trump and come after those of us who would like free and fair  elections, I would like to see them be more fair on both sides of the  aisle, as far as where crimes have really been committed.   If we are going to preserve this little experiment in self- government, there needs to be multiple people go to jail for the crimes  they have committed. If that doesn't happen, we are in big trouble.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
