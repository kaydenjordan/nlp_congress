 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Ranking Member Lowey for  yielding, and I want to thank her for her leadership that she provides  in the Appropriations Committee.   I also want to thank Chairman Frelinghuysen. As Ms. Wasserman Schultz  said, we are going to miss you. We appreciate your leadership, and we  thank you. You are a decent human being, and we really appreciate your  friendship.   I also want to thank the staff and the Members on both sides of the  aisle who have worked in a very bipartisan way to address these issues  that are important.   Every year, we have to pass the appropriations bill. It is the train  that has to pass every year. And I certainly want to thank Mrs. Lowey,  the chairman, and the folks responsible for making this happen.   First of all, let me talk about defense.   I certainly agree with the Members that this provides billions of  dollars to make sure that we restore critical military readiness  programs. We have to make sure we have a strong military, and with this  funding, we will. I certainly appreciate the sacrifice that the men and  women make to protect our country, and this is what this appropriation  bill does.   We also fully fund the 2.6 percent pay raise for our military  families because, again, we have to make sure that we support them  because they are under very difficult times.   There are a lot of other things in the Defense Appropriations bill,  whether it is the assistance that provides $50 million for specialized  counseling programs to meet the unique needs of military children or  whether it is the National Guard's counterdrug program to help reduce  the illegal drugs from coming into the United States. Those are areas  that are strong for our military.                                time  1530    Let me move over to the Labor-HHS bill. There are so many things that  both Chairman Cole and Ms. DeLauro also provided that they worked so  hard on; let me just highlight a couple of them.   The Pell grant is so important because we increased the amount by an  extra $100. Now the maximum amount is $6,195. You have to have Pell  grants so that we can have our young students go off to college.   $10 billion for Head Start. There was a $200 million increase. I want  to thank our folks for adding that money.   The Federal TRIO program and the GEAR UP program are moneys that we  added.   I certainly want to say thank you also for the $907 million for  senior nutrition programs to help our seniors.   The title I grants for school districts, $15.9 billion that we added.   And the last thing I want to talk about is the Low-Income Home Energy  Assistance Program, we have increased the funding to provide that type  of assistance.   So, again, I want to say thank you to the chairman, to our ranking  member, Mrs. Lowey, and all of the staff on both sides, I thank them  for a job well done.
