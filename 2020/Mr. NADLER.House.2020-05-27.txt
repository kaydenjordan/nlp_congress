 Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 2746) to require the Director of the Federal Bureau of  Investigation to provide information on suicide rates in law  enforcement, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 2746         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Law Enforcement Suicide Data       Collection Act''.       SEC. 2. INFORMATION ON SUICIDE IN LAW ENFORCEMENT.         (a) Establishment.--Not later than 1 year after the date of       enactment of this Act, the Attorney General, acting through       the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, shall       establish, for the purpose of preventing future law       enforcement suicides and promoting understanding of suicide       in law enforcement, the Law Enforcement Officers Suicide Data       Collection Program, under which law enforcement agencies may       submit to the Director information on suicides and attempted       suicides within such law enforcement agencies, including       information on--        (1) the circumstances and events that occurred before each       suicide or attempted suicide;        (2) the general location of each suicide or attempted       suicide;        (3) the demographic information of each law enforcement       officer who commits or attempts suicide;        (4) the occupational category, including criminal       investigator, corrections officer, line of duty officer, 911       dispatch operator, of each law enforcement officer who       commits or attempts suicide; and        (5) the method used in each suicide or attempted suicide.        (b) Policies.--The Federal Bureau of Investigation shall       work with the Confidentiality and Data Access Committee of       the Federal Committee on Statistical Methodology to develop       publication policies to manage the risk of identity       disclosure based upon the best practices identified by other       Federal statistical programs.        (c) Report.--Not later than 2 years after the date of       enactment of this Act, and annually thereafter, the Attorney       General, acting through the Director of the Federal Bureau of       Investigation, shall submit to Congress and publish on the       website of the Federal Bureau of Investigation a report       containing the information submitted to the Director pursuant       to subsection (a).        (d) Confidentiality.--The report described under subsection       (c) may not include any personally identifiable information       of a law enforcement officer who commits or attempts suicide.        (e) Definitions.--In this section--        (1) the term ``law enforcement agency'' means a Federal,       State, Tribal, or local agency engaged in the prevention,       detection, or investigation, prosecution, or adjudication of       any violation of the criminal laws of the United States, a       State, Tribal, or a political subdivision of a State;        (2) the term ``law enforcement officer'' means any current       or former officer (including a correctional officer), agent,       or employee of the United States, a State, Indian Tribe, or a       political subdivision of a State authorized by law to engage       in or supervise the prevention, detection, investigation, or       prosecution of any violation of the criminal laws of the       United States, a State, Indian Tribe, or a political       subdivision of a State; and        (3) the term ``State'' means each of the several States,       the District of Columbia, and any commonwealth, territory, or       possession of the United States.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of S. 2746, the Law  Enforcement Suicide Data Collection Act, which requires the FBI to  establish a data collection program that gathers data on law  enforcement and former law enforcement suicides at the local, State,  and Federal levels.   We consider this bill today in response to a growing epidemic of law  enforcement suicides in America. Tragically, more than 227 U.S. law  enforcement officers took their own lives last year, an increase of  more than 50 deaths from the year before.   While law enforcement officers are tasked with the responsibility of  protecting our communities and responding to often dangerous emergency  situations, the number who have died as a result of suicide has, in  recent years, exceeded the numbers of officers lost in the line of  duty.   My community has been particularly affected by this issue. Last year,  the New York Police Department lost nine officers in a deeply troubling  string of suicides. With long, late hours, regular traumatic  experiences, life-threatening situations, and work in constant  proximity to firearms, law enforcement officers are at an increased  risk for mental illness such as post-traumatic stress disorder,  depression, and anxiety.   A number of reports over past decades indicate that that law  enforcement officers have an increased risk of suicide when compared to  the general public. While suicide is currently the leading cause of  death for law enforcement officers, the nearly 18,000 law enforcement  agencies in this country lack a unified reporting mechanism for  collecting data on these tragedies.                                time  2015    Without the proper information and statistics, law enforcement  agencies and local, State, and Federal leaders are hindered in their  ability to educate, prevent, and respond to this epidemic of suicides.   This bill directs the FBI to establish the Law Enforcement Officers  Suicide Data Collection Program to prevent future suicides and to  promote the understanding of suicide in law enforcement by collecting  information from Federal, State, and local law enforcement agencies.   Data allowed to be collected pursuant to this bill includes details  relating to both suicides and attempted suicides, including the  circumstances and location of each event, as well as demographic  information of each law enforcement officer and the method used in each  incident.   It is imperative that the law enforcement community, mental health  professionals, Congress, and the American people better understand the  extent of, and the reasons for, this crisis.   The bill, therefore, also requires public reporting of the FBI's  findings so that Congress and others can best support State and local  agencies that are grappling with the day-to-day consequences of officer  suicide.   Madam Speaker, I am grateful for the bipartisan effort to address  this important issue. In the House, our colleague, Representative    Mike Quigley, authored H.R. 3735, the companion to this Senate-passed  bill. I commend him, and I commend the bill's Senate sponsor, Senator  Catherine Cortez Masto, for their tireless work on behalf of law  enforcement officers and their loved ones.   Madam Speaker, I support this bill. I urge my colleagues to do the  same, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, in this time of great national crisis, we are all even  more dependent on our law enforcement personnel, on our first  responders, on the heroes that we honored by the title of the bill we  passed a couple of weeks ago, the HEROES Act.   It is unfortunate, obviously, that the stress that some of these  heroes undergo, the stress that our police officers undergo, leads to a  greater suicide rate. Especially in this time of crisis, we can expect  that only to increase. It is imperative that we do whatever we can to  safeguard the lives of those we depend on, to safeguard the lives of  the heroes that we all need.   Madam Speaker, it is unfortunate that we do not have a national  database with which to inform proper actions to help deal with this  problem and save lives. That is why we are supporting this bill today,  to solve this problem, to eliminate this void, so that we can better  inform ourselves, the country, all the different agencies in the  country, and State, Federal, and local agencies as to what actions  might be taken to mitigate this threat to the lives of those we depend  on.   Madam Speaker, I very much urge the passage of this bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Quigley).    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, we appreciate the service of our law enforcement  officers who face unique challenges and risks in protecting us every  day. Today, we take an important step to recognize the psychological  toll that serving in such an inherently dangerous job can take on law  enforcement officers and work to combat the tragic epidemic of suicides  among their ranks.   Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting the Law  Enforcement Suicide Data Collection Act so that we may be better able  to address this crisis and save lives.   Throughout our country, the vast majority of police officers execute  their jobs with dignity, honor, and respect for the citizens they serve  and protect, but it would be remiss if I did not take note of the  alarming and appalling incidents involving individuals in law  enforcement in the last few weeks. These include the death of Breonna  Taylor in Kentucky and George Floyd in Minnesota, both at the hands of  law enforcement officers, and the disturbing circumstances surrounding  the death of Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia.   We must bring all those responsible to justice and work to improve  accountability between law enforcement officers and the communities  they serve.   While we appreciate all of our law enforcement officers, we can't  hide from America's history of racism and its deadly consequences. We  see it in the disproportionate rate of COVID deaths, in our country's  rates of mass incarceration, and, yes, in the treatment of African  Americans by a few of our police officers.   The ugly truth is clear: Black Americans often live under different  rules. It is up to all of us to change them.   Working with my colleagues on the Committee on the Judiciary and with  Members of Congress from all across the country, I will continue to  fight to do so.  [[Page H2316]]    But the bill before us today is a necessary and worthy bill,  recognizing the honorable and selfless service that the vast majority  of our police officers provide, and trying to deal with the high  suicide rates that the stresses of this job that they do to protect us  cause.   We should pass this bill so we can start getting a handle on this  problem to preserve the lives of the vast majority of our police  officers who serve us honorably and without whom we would be adrift.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote for this bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 6509) to amend the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets  Act of 1968 to provide public safety officer death and disability  benefits for certain public safety officers who contract COVID-19, and  for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 6509         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Public Safety Officer       Pandemic Response Act of 2020''.       SEC. 2. DEATH AND DISABILITY BENEFITS FOR PUBLIC SAFETY                     OFFICERS IMPACTED BY COVID-19.         Section 1201 of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets       Act of 1968 (34 U.S.C. 10281) is amended by adding at the end       the following new subsection:        ``(o) For purposes of this part:        ``(1) COVID-19 (or complications therefrom) shall be       presumed to constitute a personal injury within the meaning       of subsection (a), sustained in the line of duty by a public       safety officer and directly and proximately resulting in       death, in the case of a public safety officer who was       diagnosed with, who received a positive test for, or for whom       evidence indicated that the officer was infected with, COVID-      19, unless such officer was not on duty during the 45-day       period prior to being diagnosed with or having positive test       for COVID-19.        ``(2) The Attorney General shall accept claims, including       supplemental claims, under this section from an individual       who--        ``(A) was serving as a public safety officer and was       injured or disabled in the line of duty as a result of the       terrorist attacks on the United States that occurred on       September 11, 2001, or in the aftermath of such attacks       developed a condition described in section 3312(a) of the       Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 300mm-22(a)); and        ``(B) was diagnosed with COVID-19 during the period       described in paragraph (3), which, in combination with the       injury or disability described in subparagraph (A),       permanently and totally disabled or directly and proximately       resulted in the death of the individual.      In assessing a claim under this paragraph, the presumption of       causation described in paragraph (1) shall apply.        ``(3) The presumption described in paragraph (1) and       standard in subsection (p) shall apply with respect to a       diagnosis of COVID-19 (or complications therefrom) beginning       on January 20, 2020, and ending on January 20, 2022.        ``(4) The term `COVID-19' means a disease caused by severe       acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).        ``(p) In determining whether the personal injury under       subsection (b) resulting from COVID-19 (or complications       therefrom) was a catastrophic injury, the Attorney General's       inquiry shall apply the presumption in subsection (o) and be       limited to whether the individual is permanently prevented       from performing any gainful work as a public safety       officer.''.       SEC. 3. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' or this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  any extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 6509, the Public  Safety Officer Pandemic Response Act. I introduced this bill on April  14 in response to the escalating and deadly threat of the COVID-19  virus to our public safety officers, and I am pleased that the House is  considering it today.   H.R. 6509 expands the Public Safety Officers' Benefits program, known  as the PSOB program, to ensure that public safety officers who contract  COVID-19 in the line of duty are eligible for benefits under the  program should they become disabled or should they die from the virus.   Madam Speaker, this bill would accomplish three critical objectives.   First, it establishes that a diagnosis, a positive test, or evidence  of COVID-19 infection shall be presumed to constitute a personal injury  in the line of duty for the purposes of eligibility for the PSOB  program, unless the officer was not on duty in the relevant time  period.   Second, it ensures that officers who were injured or disabled in the  line of duty in relation to the attacks of September 11, 2001, and  whose injuries in combination with a COVID-19 illness rendered them  disabled or caused their death will receive benefits under the PSOB  program.                                time  2030    And, third, it establishes that the COVID-19-related disability  standard is based on whether a PSOB claimant is permanently prevented  from performing any gainful work as a public safety officer on account  of a COVID-19 diagnosis.   Because of the demands placed on public safety officers during this  crisis, it is important that Congress enact all of these elements.   In seeking to protect and serve their communities in their various  roles, public safety officers willingly undertake risks of harm on a  daily basis. Because of this, we have established the PSOB program to  provide disability and death benefits for them when they are disabled  or die due to line-of-duty injuries.   During the current crisis of COVID-19 contagion, the risks to public  safety officers go well beyond the dangers first responders ordinarily  experience. Police officers, firefighters, and EMTs are often the first  responders that those with COVID-19 encounter.   Current estimates are that nearly 40 percent of COVID-19 carriers are  [[Page H2317]]  asymptomatic. Therefore, for first responders, even ordinary encounters  with members of the community become potentially life-threatening  events.   On top of this, a lack of availability of appropriate personal  protective equipment has unnecessarily exposed thousands of officers to  COVID-19. Despite the additional risks they take on, public safety  officers continue to faithfully execute their jobs and protect us all.   H.R. 6509 acknowledges this by clarifying and expanding certain  aspects of how the existing PSOB program for officers who contract  COVID-19 is applied.   If an officer was on duty during this crisis and contracts this  disease, his or her illness should be considered a line-of-duty injury.  And officers who are disabled due to COVID-19 should be eligible for  disability benefits under a less stringent standard, given the added  risks they undertook during this crisis, particularly because many  officers have not been given appropriate equipment to mitigate their  risk.   We must also address another unique and tragic circumstance. I have  long been a champion of the public safety officers who provided their  service in responding to the deadly 9/11 attacks on our country. In  fact, this bill is modeled on legislation that Congress enacted just  days after 9/11, which I authored, to ensure that public safety  officers who were injured or killed in the line of duty because of 9/11  received the benefits they deserved.   Many first responders lost their lives that day; and in the days and  weeks following the attacks, thousands of public safety officers rushed  in to help the injured and to seek the remains of those who perished.   Numerous studies have sadly shown that, as a result of these attacks,  these public safety officers were exposed to a slew of toxic chemicals  and dust that directly inhibit lung capacity. Therefore, 9/11 public  safety officers are uniquely vulnerable to COVID-19, which attacks a  person's ability to breathe effectively.   H.R. 6509 acknowledges that the service of public safety officers  during and after 9/11 continues to put them at a higher risk of  disability or death. This bill allows those officers who were injured  or disabled in the line of duty in relation to 9/11 and whose injuries,  in combination with COVID-19 illness, rendered them disabled or caused  their death to apply for benefits under the PSOB program.   To date, Congress has upheld its promise to 9/11 first responders  who, on account of their injuries on 9/11, have been tragically  succumbing to cancers and other diseases. Today, we will do so again.   I note that the Sergeants Benevolent Association of the New York City  Police Department wrote to me yesterday expressing strong support for  this bill and citing the importance of including provisions addressing  the 9/11 issue in this legislation.   We have also received letters of support for this bill from the  Fraternal Order of Police and the National Association of Police  Organizations.   I include all of these letters in the Record.           Sergeants Benevolent Association, Police Department, City             of New York,                                        New York, NY, May 26, 2020.      Hon. Jerrold Nadler,      Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,      House of Representatives, Washington. DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing on behalf of the more       13,000 members of the Sergeants Benevolent Association of the       New York City Police Department to advise you of our strong       support for H.R. 6509, the ``Public Safety Officer Pandemic       Response Act.'' This important legislation will establish a       much needed presumption to enable the Public Safety Officers'       Benefits (PSOB) Program to process death and disability       benefits for our frontline law enforcement officers,       firefighters, and EMTs exposed to COVID-19.        Nearly nineteen years ago, thousands of first responders in       New York and across the country were exposed to a deadly       cocktail of toxins at the sites of the worst terrorist attack       in American history. To date, exposure to those toxins has       claimed the lives of more police officers than died on 9/11       itself. While today we fully recognize the toll suffered by       the rescue and recovery personnel in the months alter 9/11,       that was not always the case. And it required nearly all of       the past nineteen years to fully secure health and       compensation benefits for impacted first responders. The       lessons of the 9/11 health crisis are the historical context       for which you, the SBA, and others are seeking to address       both the actual short-term and potential longterm       consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on public safety       officers. We are unfortunately experiencing the short-term       impact of this disease on the ranks of law enforcement, which       has already claimed the lives of more than 100 officers,       including six from the NYPD. But we do not yet know the long-      term effects COVID-19 will present to those exposed to it.        While the PSOB Program currently covers deaths and       disabilities from ``infectious disease,'' providing evidence       that a disease was contracted in the line of duty is not       always straightforward. In this current pandemic, making the       connection between an officer's death or disability from       COVID-19 and one specific exposure to a carrier of the       disease is likely impossible. H.R. 6509 addresses this issue       by establishing a full presumptive standard for COVID-19-      related death and disability claims for PSOB benefits. It       will also create a similar presumptive standard for those       officers who are suffering from 9/11 health conditions and       are at significantly higher risk from this disease. In so       doing, the ``Public Safety Officer Pandemic Response Act''       affords Congress the opportunity to be proactive in its       response to the threat COVID-19 poses to the public safety       community and ensures that our nation's heroes are not       subjected to another lengthy battle to obtain the benefits       they are entitled to.        On behalf of the membership of the SBA, thank you for your       leadership on this legislation and your legacy of supporting       positive enhancements to the PSOB Program. Please do not       hesitate to contact me.            Sincerely,                                                        Ed Mullins,      President.                                   ____                                            National Fraternal Order                                                       of Police,                                       Washington, DC, May 27, 2020.      Hon. Nancy P. Pelosi,      Speaker of the House,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin O. McCarthy,      Minority Leader,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Madam Speaker and Representative McCarthy: I am       writing on behalf of the members of the Fraternal Order of       Police to advise you of our strong support for H.R. 6509, the       ``Public Safety Officer Pandemic Response Act,'' and to urge       the House to pass it.        We knew at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic that law       enforcement officers on the front lines combating this       pandemic would be increasingly vulnerable to contracting the       virus. As we had feared, the virus has claimed the lives of       many, and now includes a growing number of law enforcement       officers. As of today, 112 law enforcement officers have died       from COVID-19 related illnesses.        The Public Safety Officers' Benefits (PSOB) program       provides that the surviving family members of a public safety       officer who contracts an infectious disease in the line of       duty and dies as a result of its contraction are eligible for       the PSOB's death benefit. With the help of the President and       the Attorney General, the Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA)       announced on 9 April that a death benefit claim for a COVID-      19 related death will be found by the BJA to have contracted       the disease in the line of duty in most cases. This was a       vitally important issue for our members on the front lines       during this pandemic and this legislation would expand and       codify this presumption.        In addition to the presumption for death benefit claims,       H.R. 6509 would ensure that public safety officers who       contract COVID-19 in the line of duty are eligible for       benefits should they become disabled from the novel       coronavirus. It would establish new standards for disability       claims related to COVID-19 by defining ``catastrophic       injury'' in cases where the injured officer was ``permanently       prevented from performing any gainful work as a public safety       officer.'' At a time of heightened risk from this pandemic,       we believe this is necessary to ensure that these officers       and their families, who are not able to ``stay at home''       during this crisis, will be taken care of in the event they       are disabled and unable to continue to serve as law       enforcement officers.        The legislation also recognizes the unique vulnerability of       officers who were injured or disabled in the line of duty in       relation to the attacks of September 11. 2001, and whose       injuries--in combination with a line-of-duty COVID-19       illness--rendered them disabled or caused their death will be       eligible to receive the death or disability benefits under       the PSOB program.        On behalf of the more than 351,000 members of the Fraternal       Order of Police, I urge the House to pass this measure and       send it to the Senate. If I can be of any further assistance,       please do not hesitate to contact me.            Sincerely,                                                      Patrick Yoes,      National President.                                   ____                                      National Association of Police                                             Organizations, Inc.,                                       Alexandria, VA, May 26, 2020.      Hon. Jerrold Nadler,      Chair, Committee on the Judiciary,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Nadler: On behalf of the National Association       of Police Organizations (NAPO), representing over 241,000 law       enforcement officers across the United States,  [[Page H2318]]       I am writing to you to express our strong support for the       Public Safety Officer Pandemic Response Act of 2020 (H.R.       6509).        The PSOB Program was designed to offer peace of mind to men       and women seeking careers in public safety and to make a       strong statement about the value that American Society places       on the contributions of those who serve their communities in       potentially dangerous circumstances, such as the current       coronavirus pandemic. Officers have been protecting our       communities with insufficient personal protective equipment       (PPE), putting themselves at high risk of exposure to this       very communicable disease.        While the PSOB Program does cover line of duty deaths and       disabilities due to infectious diseases, we feel strongly       that COVID-19 is unique and presents its own challenges in       proving line of duty exposure. While with most other       infectious diseases, it is easy to pinpoint the source and       details surrounding the exposure, but this situation is more       difficult with the new coronavirus and its asymptomatic       spread. Every day, we are learning more about COVID-19.       First, it was believed it could only be spread by close human       contact. Now, experts know that it can also be spread through       the air. Individuals can be carriers of COVID-19 without       being symptomatic. Our officers have found themselves in an       extraordinary and dangerous situation over which they have       very little control.        The Public Safety Officer Pandemic Response Act would       establish that COVID-19 shall be presumed to have been       contracted as a result of the officer's service for the       purposes of PSOB death and disability benefits. It would       create a specific standard for COVID-19-related disability       this is based on whether a PSOB claimant is permanently       prevented from performing any gainful work as a public safety       officer due to their COVID-19 diagnosis. Finally, it would       recognize the physical toll 9/11 related illnesses have had       on first responders by covering under the PSOB Program those       public safety officers whose 9/11 related illness are       compounded by a COVID-19 diagnosis and lead to their death or       disability.        For these reasons, NAPO wholeheartedly supports the Public       Safety Officer Pandemic Response Act and we call on the House       of Representatives to pass this important legislation. If we       can provide any additional information or assistance, please       feel free to contact me.            Sincerely,                                                William J. Johnson,                                                Executive Director.    I also want to note that, as we work to support our first  responders today, we must also support other essential workers who are  on the front lines of this pandemic, like those in the food and  healthcare industries who are putting their lives at risk each day  during this crisis.   We should ensure that all those who are making the ultimate sacrifice  for their communities, for us, are properly compensated. That work  begins today with supporting our public safety officers with this bill.   I thank my colleagues, Representative Max Rose from New York and  Representative Bill Pascrell from New Jersey, for their support of this  measure from its inception. And I ask my colleagues in the House to  join me in supporting this bill so that we can pass it today.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pascrell), one of the authors of this  legislation.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Rose), another sponsor of the bill.  [[Page H2319]]         Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, the COVID-19 crisis in this country has taken many  lives and impacted every community. In our national response, there are  many areas in which we know we must do better and do more to address  the public health emergency and the economic impact on our people.   This bill, which expands an existing program in several important  ways will help address the tragic circumstances of public safety  officers who are disabled by or die from this virus. It is one piece of  the overall effort, but an important one.   Madam Speaker, I, therefore, ask my colleagues to join me in  supporting passage of H.R. 6509 today.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
