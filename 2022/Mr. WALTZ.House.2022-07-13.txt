 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Smith and Ranking Member  Rogers for their strong bipartisan product that is worthy of our  servicemembers. I also thank the chairman of the Readiness  Subcommittee, Representative Garamendi, for his thoughtful and  collaborative work on this bill.   Mr. Speaker, the threats are growing: Russia, Iran, North Korea, and,  most significantly, China's most rapid military buildup that we have  seen in modern history.   The bipartisan top-line increase above inflation is a positive step,  but our defense investments still fail to keep pace with the Chinese  Communist Party and their rapid military buildup.   Mr. Speaker, I don't want to keep pace. Our servicemembers deserve  better. We need to have overmatch over that military buildup. That is  how we then keep the peace and maintain deterrence.   As the ranking member of the Readiness Subcommittee, I know we cannot  continue to afford to use our operations and maintenance accounts to  pay for other priorities. Russia's invasion of Ukraine is a teachable  moment for all of us. The entire world is witnessing that logistics,  training, and maintenance win or lose wars.   China's own growing aggression in the vast Indo-Pacific requires more  operations and maintenance funding for our partners and allies. We have  to keep our forces forward, again, in order to maintain deterrence, and  I will oppose amendments that thoughtlessly take from those accounts.  We cannot, as a body, continue to rob Peter to pay Paul.   Overall, I believe this is a strong bill. It does hold our military  accountable but also makes significant steps toward deterrence.   Some key priorities: We authorize interoperable military exercises  with Taiwan. We permanently prohibit purchases of goods by the Defense  Department from the Xinjiang province. We require universities in China  that support the CCP and the military to be identified and listed. We  allocate funding for incredibly important new construction projects at  Florida's military bases. We set gender-neutral fitness standards for  our combat military occupational specialties in the U.S. Army. Perhaps  most importantly, we passed a wounded warrior bill of rights.   Finally, Mr. Speaker, as we continue to aid Ukraine, we must be  accountable for those taxpayer dollars, and this bill would appoint an  inspector general to oversee the aid that we are providing.   Mr. Speaker, the number one job of the Federal Government is to keep  the country safe. I urge my colleagues' support for this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Speaker, this amendment requires local preferences and  State construction licenses for all facility sustainment and military  construction projects.   Mr. Speaker, it is notable the opposition to this amendment includes  the Chamber of Commerce, the National Defense Industrial Association,  the Associated General Contractors of America, the Association of  Building Contractors, and the American Council of Engineering  Companies. All of them oppose this, and notably, this provision last  year was strongly opposed by the Biden Administration.   Mr. Speaker, this provision would increase time and money to an  already difficult, lengthy, and often slow military construction  process. These are facilities that our fighting men and women  desperately need.   Mr. Speaker, it also impacts the skilled workforce. The local hiring  preferences would significantly impact a military construction  contractor's workforce by creating scenarios where long-term, highly  skilled workers may have to be released and may have to be laid off in  order to meet the local hire mandate. Then in order to comply with the  requirements, employers would have to bring in unnecessary and  unskilled workers to fill these now vacant positions, creating  additional costs and creating additional safety concerns.                                time  1630    Local preference requirements falsely assume--and here is the  fundamental issue. It is a false assumption that there is this  automatic pool of qualified military contractors and workers wherever  this military construction project may take place. Often, there is, in  some locations. But often, in our most rural locations, there is not.  There is an assumption that they are capable of performing this work.   Mr. Speaker, the bottom line is the provision would increase costs.  Again, it would expand an already bloated military construction  timeline, and it will reduce skilled employment and decrease the  quality of construction in these vital projects.   Mr. Speaker, I urge opposition to this amendment. I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Wittman).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Military construction and sustainment is bureaucratic; it is  cumbersome; it is slow; and it is not providing our servicemembers what  they need. That needs to be the focus, period.   This provision would represent a momentous shift, a sea change in the  way the Department of Defense and defense contractors perform work,  with unknown costs to both the government and the contractors,  especially small business contractors.   We have to get these projects done timely and on budget and get the  facilities that we need to our servicemembers.   Mr. Speaker, I urge opposition, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Mr. Speaker, I just want to take a moment.   I have no issue in principle with more Joint Strike Fighters. We need  more Joint Strike Fighters, and we need to continue to modernize our  aviation fleet.   My issue here is where the money for it comes from. As I was just  saying in my previous comments, we have to as a body, we have to as a  Congress, and as a military to stop robbing Peter to pay Paul, to stop  robbing operations and maintenance to buy new things.   Just as a few examples of the many accounts that would be decremented  to pay for these F-35s: we have got $50 million from Army operations  and maintenance from their maneuver units, $100 million from Navy  military manpower and personnel, $56 million from Air Force  maintenance, $62 million from base support, and the list continues.   Colleagues, we have to build in the operations and maintenance for  new things we want to buy rather than taking from the things we have  already bought that literally cannot sail or fly.
