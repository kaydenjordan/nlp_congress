 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak against H.  Res. 826, a resolution that was hastily put together that opposes the  administration's Healthy Adult Opportunity demonstration initiative in  Medicaid.   The use of waivers to grant States more flexibility in managing their  healthcare systems is foundational to health reforms from both parties  throughout the years. In fact, most Medicaid programs across the  country today are currently operating under some form of waiver.   In the latest waiver proposal, the Trump administration would allow  States more flexibility to manage their Medicaid expansion population  by choosing to accept their Federal funds in a per person or lump sum  basis. States would be able to take that Federal money and more  efficiently treat these patients and then share in the savings.   The Medicaid program was built to be a safety net for our children  and the poor, not to be our Nation's largest insurer. This waiver would  not affect how Medicaid cares for children, seniors, or those with  disabilities.   The Healthy Adult Opportunity waivers are designed only to help  States manage the rapidly ballooning costs from able-bodied adults who  are now on Medicaid after ObamaCare.   Medicaid benefits and patient access to care will not be cut in this  proposal. Any State pursuing a Healthy Adult Opportunity waiver will  still be held responsible for the accessibility of services to  beneficiaries.   As much as my friends across the aisle seek to demonize this proposal  and use every scare tactic in the book, this is sound policy to help  the growing number of States struggling to manage the costs of their  growing Medicaid programs.   Mr. Speaker, I commend President Trump, Secretary Azar, and  Administrator Verma for their work, and I urge my colleagues to vote  against this resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr.  Kevin ``Catfish'' Jackson, who was honored at this year's Opportunity  Award Gala at the Savannah Technical College Foundation for his  business acumen, vision, and commitment to developing the next  generation of Georgia's leaders. This award is much deserved for all  the hard work and dedication that Mr. Jackson has poured into the  Savannah business community.   He is the founder and CEO of EnviroVac Holdings, which employs over  1,000 people, and the chairman of the Savannah Economic Development  Authority. He was appointed by the Governor to serve on the board of  the Georgia Ports Authority, and he has continued to volunteer with  numerous charitable organizations around town.   This is now the third major award he has won in Savannah for his  accomplishments. He won Entrepreneur of the Year awards in both 2015  and 2018.   I am so proud that the Savannah Technical College Foundation chose  Catfish for this year's honor.   Congratulations, Catfish. Keep up the great work.                            ____________________
