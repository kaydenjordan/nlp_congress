 Mr. Speaker, today the Republicans showed their values.   They showed their values in the tax bill that gave 83 percent of the  dollars to the upper 1 percent of the economic strata in this country.   They showed their values in giving real estate developers special tax  breaks, like President Trump and others, and gave people who are  extremely wealthy the opportunity to will more money to their children  or whoever they choose than they can today, an $11 million break.   It has been sad sitting on the Judiciary Committee and watching the  Republicans be aiders and abetters of the President in trying to demean  the reputation of one of the finest Americans and public servants I  have ever had the opportunity to know, Bob Mueller, and probably with  the intention of firing him, something that should wake Republicans up  to the fact that our country is in jeopardy.   We shouldn't be doing things that help the Russians get away with  efforts to change our elections and interfere with our country's  values. America first, Russia last. Protect Bob Mueller.                            ____________________
