 Mr. President, let me say that that was an excellent  presentation by Senator Harris. I can recall when she first came here,  and I sat down with her and we talked about her predecessor and about  how people with diverse philosophies can get along and actually love  each other.   I would expect the same thing to happen in this case--because it  does. I listened to some of the things that were said by the new  Senator from California, talking about the rule of law, about freedom  of religion, freedom of speech, and the First Amendment. I agree. I am  hoping that we end up with more things in common than things that would  keep us apart because we have a lot to do. We need to get busy doing  it. I appreciate very much hearing the opening speech by Senator  Harris.   Mr. President, I wanted to get to the floor because it won't be long  until we will be voting on my Oklahoma attorney general, Scott Pruitt.  I am looking forward to it. He and I go back a long way. I know that he  has been through the ringer, as a lot of them have. I look  [[Page S1259]]  at Jeff Sessions and some of the abusive things that were said about  him during the time that he was going through this process. Of course,  the same thing has been true with Scott Pruitt.   Scott Pruitt just happens to be not only a candidate who is going to  make an excellent Administrator of the EPA, but he is also one who  knows the job. He has been there. He has been attorney general for  Oklahoma, my State. He lives in my home town of Tulsa, OK. So I know  him quite well. In fact, I am in aviation, and I remember flying him  around the State in some areas, introducing him when he was just  starting out in the statewide race.   I think he is going to do a really good job. It is my understanding  that my colleagues on the other side are determined to run the clock  before we vote on Attorney General Pruitt, and they are using the  opportunity to make the case that he will destroy the environment and  return pollution to the air and water.   Yet they know that he will do nothing of the sort. Attorney General  Pruitt is highly qualified. Yes, it is true that he has had the  occasion to file lawsuits on behalf of the State of Oklahoma against  the Environmental Protection Agency. I can assure you that he knows  that he has represented the State of Oklahoma. There are many other  States that were doing the same thing.   He is a believer in the rule of law and will uphold the laws as  passed by Congress within constitutional bounds. He has built a career  defending the law, and I see no cause for concern that he will ever  stop. He has been practicing law in Oklahoma since 1993, when he  graduated from law school at the University of Tulsa. In 1998, he ran  and was elected to the Oklahoma State Senate, where he served for 6  years. During that time in the Oklahoma State Senate, he was seen as a  leader, someone who could be counted upon, and someone who should be in  higher office in the State.   Of course, that is what happened. Since 2010, he has been the  Attorney General for Oklahoma. He became a respected defender of the  State's role in our Federal system of government. As EPA Administrator,  Pruitt will continue to uphold core constitutional principles and won't  be engaged in the same Federal overreach that we have seen over the  last 8 years.   I know there are varying philosophies in this body. I know there are  people who want to concentrate the power in Washington. They see  nothing wrong with what we refer to as governmental overreach. I have  experienced this because it happens that I was the chairman, as well as  the ranking member, of the Environment and Public Works Committee,  which has the jurisdiction over the Environmental Protection Agency. So  I have watched this take place.   I know that there are members of the Environment and Public Works  Committee who have differing philosophies as to what the EPA should be  doing. They see outsiders. They see the State, sometimes, as someone  who is opposed to the things they are trying to do. But we have watched  this happen over the last 8 years.   Attorney General Pruitt has said again and again that he will uphold  the laws that we pass right here in Congress--no more and no less. So  it is up to us as lawmakers to provide him with effective bipartisan  legislation that will make a positive difference for the environment  and for our future, while balancing State and private interests. This  balance is possible and Scott Pruitt is a testament to this balance.   Oklahoma is an energy State. Oklahoma is an agricultural State. We  care a great deal about the land we live on and the air we breathe, and  we want to be sure it is safe for our families and for generations to  come. I think about the Administrator that was there during the years  of the Obama administration, and he was actually in a hearing just a  few hours ago. He talked about how comforting it was to come to our  State of Oklahoma--which he did twice. He learned that landowners are  on the side of the environment. They are the ones who want to care for  the land. They are the ones who want to exert whatever energies are  necessary to take care of the problems with pollution that are present  in this world.   As attorney general, Mr. Pruitt has worked closely with the Oklahoma  Department of Environmental Quality and the Oklahoma Water Resources  Board to protect Oklahoma's scenic rivers from upstream pollution. As a  matter of fact, as to his reputation, he is ``Mr. Scenic Rivers'' back  in Oklahoma. I don't understand how people concerned with the  environment are opposing him and saying things about him that are  detrimental.   He was able to use unbiased logic and science to reach an agreement  with the State of Arkansas to protect our water in Oklahoma. He has  also been instrumental in negotiating a historic water settlement  agreement. This agreement was between the State of Oklahoma, the  Choctaw Nation, and the Chickasaw Nation.   This thing, I say to the Presiding Officer, has been in litigation  for 100 years. He walked in, and he resolved the problem. It was a  battle that had gone on for 100 years. One of the chief concerns of the  Chickasaw and the Choctaw Nations was to ensure that conservation  guidelines were preserved. The agreement not only provides Oklahoma  City with its long-term water needs but also protects our two Indian  nations with their conservation goals. Again, this was tried by a lot  of people over a period of 100 years until Scott Pruitt came along. He  is the one who did it.   He has sued the EPA and fought against the Fish and Wildlife Service  at times. It has all been in Oklahoma's best interest. Now he will have  the entire Nation's best interest in mind when making decisions as the  EPA Administrator. I have no doubt that he will continue to protect our  State's interests from overreach and unnecessary harmful regulations.   It is no secret that Attorney General Pruitt's confirmation process  has been unusually lengthy. It is time we vote to confirm him in this  position. We had his nomination hearing in the Environment and Public  Works Committee. That was back on January 18, almost a month ago. That  hearing was one to be remembered because we broke a record by asking 4  rounds of questions. I suggest that no one in this confirmation process  this year or in the last three generations has had to undergo four  rounds of questions.   During the course of this day-long, 8-hour hearing, he answered more  than 200 questions. Now, after this, he responded to more than 1,000  questions for the record, including the extra questions Senator Carper  asked him in a December 28 letter, as Attorney General Pruitt promised  he would.   Now, this means that he answered--these are questions for the  record--1,600 questions. The average director, during confirmation over  the last 3 Presidential years, had 200. So it is 200 questions, as  opposed to 1,600 questions that he was subjected to. He never  complained about it and actually did a great job.   Now, despite the Democrats' efforts to delay his confirmation vote,  we need to be responsible and move forward to confirm Attorney General  Pruitt. The longer we postpone this vote, the longer it is going to  take for things to get done at the EPA. Right now nothing can get done.  Everyone knows that. That is wrong. I know that Attorney General Pruitt  will continue to be a champion for economic development and  environmental responsibility by upholding the law and restoring the  Environmental Protection Agency to its role as a regulatory agency, not  an activist organization.   You know, this is all for show because everybody knows the votes are  there. He is going to be approved. I look forward to working with him.  I think he is ready now to move in and do the job. It is going to be a  while before he is able to get the other positions confirmed. That is  why it is important to go ahead and do it, and I understand we are  going to be doing it when this time runs out.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.    Madam President, will the Senator yield for a UC request?    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that at the  conclusion of the remarks of the Senator from New York, I be recognized  for 5 minutes.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?    I thank the Chair.    Madam President, since I did not object to the additional  30 seconds, I ask unanimous consent that my 5 minutes be changed to 5  minutes and 30 seconds.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Madam President, a quick comment about climate change: No  one--no one--has denied that the climate is consistently changing. All  the Scriptural evidence, historical evidence, and archeological  evidence says, yes, it has always been changing and always will change.  But what they are trying to infer is that because of that, then the  world is coming to an end because of what? Manmade gases--anthropogenic  gases--manmade gases. That is what the real hoax is, but I am not going  to waste my time on that. However, I will next week, I might add.   The Senator from New York talked about the fact that we have an  attorney general who has sued the EPA many times. Let me just remind  everyone--and I don't think I have heard this on the floor, but I have  watched Democrat after Democrat after Democrat come by and just  brutally attack Scott Pruitt, a guy I know to be an honorable man. I  don't know of one attorney general who has served with him who doesn't  agree with that.   In terms of suing, I think it is important to understand that almost  every Democrat who has stood up and said disparaging things about Scott  Pruitt and talked about the fact that he has sued the EPA countless  times--their attorney general from their State has also sued the EPA. I  will read the States: The attorneys general from Wisconsin, Colorado,  Ohio, Nevada, Indiana, New Mexico, Missouri, Florida, Michigan, and  Montana, all have Democratic Members of the Senate who have been  criticizing Scott Pruitt. Their own States have filed lawsuits against  the EPA.   The other thing I want to mention, which I think is very important,  is a letter from our newest Senator, Luther Strange. Senator Strange is  the replacement for our Honorable Jeff Sessions, who now is the  Attorney General. This letter is signed by two pages of attorneys  general from all over America--Democratic States, Republican States,  States where Democrats have come to this floor criticizing him. I will  read the last two paragraphs of the letter from Luther Strange signed  by all of these Democratic and Republican Attorneys General:         Scott Pruitt is more than just an exemplary state attorney       general, he is also our friend. A man of deep faith who is       committed to his family and to his friends, Scott seeks       always to do the right thing. His friendship and leadership       have been invaluable to us over the years.        The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency       plays a critical role in our Nation's government.    Keep in mind, this is coming from Democratic attorneys general.         Attorney General Pruitt has proven over the course of his       career that he has the right character, experience, and       knowledge to serve as the Administrator of the EPA. We urge       the Senate to confirm his nomination.    This is signed by about 22 attorneys general, Democrats and  Republicans.   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent this letter, along with the  list of States who have had occasion to sue the EPA, the same as Scott  Pruitt has, be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                   State of Alabama,                                  Office of the Attorney General,                                    Montgomery, AL, January 4, 2017.      Hon. John Barrasso,      Dirksen Senate Office Building,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Tom Carper,      Hart Senate Office Building,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Barrasso and Ranking Member Carper: As the       attorneys general of our respective states, we write to       express our unqualified support for our colleague and the       Attorney General of Oklahoma, E. Scott Pruitt, as       Administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.        As attorneys general, we understand the need to work       collaboratively to address threats to our environment that       cross state lines, as well as the importance of a federal       counterpart in the EPA Administrator who possesses the       knowledge, experience, and principles to work with our states       to address issues affecting our environment. We believe that       no one exemplifies these qualities more than Scott Pruitt.        As the Attorney General of Oklahoma, Mr. Pruitt developed       expertise in environmental law and policy. He negotiated a       historic water rights settlement with Indian tribes that       preserved the ecosystems of scenic lakes and rivers; he       worked with his Democrat counterpart in Arkansas to reduce       pollution in the Illinois River; and he represented the       interests of Oklahomans in rate cases against utility       companies and in numerous actions against those who       contaminated his state's air and water.        Attorney General Pruitt is committed to clean air and clean       water, and to faithfully executing the environmental laws       written by Congress. He believes that environmental       regulations should be driven by State and local governments--      a notion endorsed by Congress in the Clean Air Act and Clean       Water Act. When our nation is confronted with issues       affecting the environment that are not covered by a       particular statute, Scott will come to Congress for a       solution, rather than inventing power for his agency. He       wholeheartedly believes in a strong Environmental Protection       Agency that carries out its proper duties, providing a       backstop to state and local regulators as they develop       environmental regulations suited to the needs of their own       communities.        Scott Pruitt is more than just an exemplary state attorney       general, he is also our friend. A man of deep faith who is       committed to his family and to his friends, Scott seeks       always to do the right thing. His friendship and leadership       have been invaluable to us over the years.        The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency       plays a critical role in our Nation's government. Attorney       General Pruitt has proven over the course of his career that       he has the right character, experience, and knowledge to       serve as the Administrator of the EPA. We urge the Senate to       confirm his nomination.            Sincerely,        Jeff Landry, Attorney General, State of Louisiana; Alan       Wilson, Attorney General, State of South Carolina; Luther       Strange, Attorney General, State of Alabama;Marty Jackley,       Attorney General, State of South Dakota; Patrick Morrisey,       Attorney General, State of West Virginia; Adam Laxalt,       Attorney General, State of Nevada; Mark Brnovich, Attorney       General, State of Arizona; Herbert Slatery, Attorney General,       State of Tennessee; Curtis Hill, Attorney General, State of       Indiana; Brad Schimel, Attorney General, State of Wisconsin;       Ken Paxton, Attorney General, State of Texas; Bill Schuette,       Attorney General, State of Michigan.
