 Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition to  the amendment.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to amendment  No. 32, which represents an unfortunate attempt to protect the  influence of dark corporate money in politics.   I am so proud of the package of bills included in H.R. 1, because I  believe that the work we are doing here will transform our democracy.   One of the bills included in H.R. 1 is my Transparency in Corporate  Political Spending Act, which will reverse a law that prevents the U.S.  Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, from requiring corporations  to disclose political spending to their shareholders.   The only reason that the law my measure will reverse is even on the  books is that for years, conservatives in Congress have misused the  appropriations process to enact anti-transparency measures, contrary to  our most fundamental democratic values.   This amendment would keep that anti-transparency law in place.   I cannot for the life of me understand why my colleagues on the other  side of the aisle seem so keen on helping corporations keep their  political spending a secret. How is that good for our democracy?   Indeed, Justice Scalia, in another case after Citizens United, wrote:  ``Requiring people to stand up in public for their political acts  fosters civic courage, without which democracy is doomed.''   The situation could not be simpler. Americans deserve to know which  corporate interests are donating money to influence our elected  officials.                                time  1415    Corporations should play by the same rules as Michiganders in my  district in Macomb and Oakland Counties and that the rest of Americans  play by and disclose their political contributions because secret  corporate spending poses a threat to our democracy and to investor  confidence.   Since the disastrous decision in the Citizens United v. FEC case  allowed corporations to make unlimited political contributions,  investors and citizens concerned about the future of American democracy  have looked to the SEC to require corporate disclosure of political  spending. We need to untie the hands of the SEC so that it can move  forward with finalizing a crucial rule requiring corporations simply to  disclose their political spending.   Requiring public corporations to be honest with their shareholders,  customers, and the public about the political donations they make is  essential to taking our democracy back from the hands of special  interests.   This is why I rise in vehement opposition to this amendment, and I  urge my colleagues to oppose it as well.   Madam Chair, I reserve the remainder of my time.    Madam Chairwoman, how much time do I have  remaining?    Madam Chairwoman, I am glad to hear that some  corporations are good citizens. However, we cannot leave our basic  functioning of our democracy to the whims of individuals.   Some corporations protected the safety of their workers before we had  the OSHA laws. Some corporations didn't use child labor before we had  our child labor laws. We need fundamental rules to make sure there is  sunshine in this area.   Now, I yield the remainder of my time to the gentleman from Maryland  (Mr. Sarbanes), my friend.    Madam Chair, I yield to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Lofgren).    Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I am a proud cosponsor of H.R. 1,  the For the People Act.   This historic package of democracy and anticorruption reforms will  put power back in the hands of the people and restore the American  people's faith that government works for the public interest, not the  special interests.   I am pleased that my bill, the Transparency in Corporate Political  Spending Act, is included in H.R. 1. I am also proud today to present  an amendment to prohibit violators of our Federal election campaign  laws from serving on critically important redistricting commissions in  the States.   Our democracy has been under attack from foreign interference,  gerrymandering, hidden corporate money, and voter suppression. Today,  the time has come to reform our system and restore faith in our  political process.   I believe we have a duty to transform our democracy from a spectator  sport into a true dialogue in which we all participate to debate the  issues, defend our interests, and demand our rights.   By passing H.R. 1, we will move one step closer to that  transformation by breaking the grip of special interests and ensuring  that the American people come first in our democracy.   Among its many important provisions, this historic democracy reform  package includes my Transparency in Corporate Political Spending Act,  which will eliminate the policy rider that lets corporations keep their  unlimited political spending secret.   In addition, I look forward to this Chamber's consideration of my  amendment to H.R. 1. This amendment would protect our democracy by  prohibiting campaign finance law violators and their immediate family  members from serving on redistricting commissions.   Congress needs to ensure that we set out commonsense minimum criteria  for people who will serve on redistricting commissions in States across  the country. My amendment will ensure that redistricting commissions  nationwide are free of individuals and immediate relatives of  individuals who have knowingly and willfully committed a violation of  the Federal Election Campaign Act.   In November 2018, the people of Michigan overwhelmingly passed Voters  Not Politicians, a ballot initiative that sets up a nonpartisan  redistricting commission to create State legislative and congressional  districts after the 2020 census. About seven or eight States have  already done this, and more are considering it.   If we are going to transform our democracy, we need to do it right. I  could not be more proud to vote to end the dominance of big money in  our political system, to guarantee free and fair elections that are  open to all, and to ensure public officials work for the public  interest.   I would like to thank Congressman Sarbanes and the members of the  Democracy Reform Task Force for their unrelenting efforts to reclaim  our democracy as one for and by the people.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support the For the People Act and  to support this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I deeply appreciate the gentleman  from Illinois' kind remarks. I will absolutely give my dad his regards.  I will call him tonight and tell him, seriously, that the gentleman  said that.   I really appreciate the incredible honor and opportunity to be here  working with the gentleman to do the people's business.   I really hope we will get a chance to work together on any number of  bills to perfect and expand our democracy.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1900     Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my  time.
