 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, Republicans are committed to preparing America's  workforce for the 21st century. This reauthorization of the Workforce  Innovation and Opportunity Act, WIOA, will not help our country live up  to its potential. In fact, this reauthorization moves our workplace  development system in the wrong direction.   Our labor market is not facing a lack of job openings or a lack of  workers. Currently there are 11.3 million open jobs, but unfortunately  there are too few Americans with the skills needed to fill them  effectively. That is why we need a robust workforce development system  that will prepare workers for in-demand skills.   During the Education and Labor Committee markup of H.R. 7309,  Republicans offered an amendment that would empower employers to  respond to local economic needs; streamline the workforce development  system by increasing local collaboration and putting program  qualification decisions at the State and local level; strengthen  outcomes and accountability by adding evidence-based practices,  maintaining common performance-based metrics, funding programs with a  track record of success, and improving transparency measures; and  reduce bureaucracy by requiring the Department of Labor to address  regulatory bottlenecks.                                time  1430    Democrats blocked all those commonsense proposals.   Republicans also pushed to allocate more funds for upskilling workers  and support robust postsecondary education programs that focus on in- demand skills. Instead of embracing innovative models, Democrats rely  on an 85-year-old Federal apprenticeship model from the Great  Depression. This model has not been working and throwing more money at  it won't change that.   Our Nation's job creators are in a far better position to help run  workforce development programs, but this bill puts Washington in the  driver's seat. Instead of putting workers first, this legislation makes  bureaucrats and labor unions the priority.   For example, provisions in this bill increase the size of State and  local governing boards and dilute employer input to increase the power  of labor unions. Too often, labor unions have the interests of their  union bosses in mind instead of the interests of workers. Giving big  labor an outsized role on these boards will render these programs less  responsive to industry needs.   H.R. 7309 also promotes progressive gender ideology and critical race  theory by requiring States to develop and publish State equity reports  regarding performance outcomes on race, ethnicity, sexual orientation,  and gender identity. Leave it to the left to destroy equality in  pursuit of equity, a word one author aptly described as ``dispensing  unequal treatment in order to achieve equal outcomes.'' Taking the  focus of our job programs off upskilling workers and putting it onto a  woke agenda will do a disservice to all our jobseekers.   This legislation also increases cumbersome administrative hurdles for  employers. If we want employers to participate in these programs, we  need a system that has fewer barriers and is easier to navigate. This  process should be streamlined instead of making it more complex.   Instead of making this program more efficient, provisions in this  reauthorization will end up costing taxpayers more. H.R. 7309 will  require Job Corps contractors to comply with onerous local prevailing  wage requirements. This will significantly increase the cost of all Job  Corps projects without improving the program's effectiveness.   On top of that, the bill weakens expectations for Job Corps' success.  Job Corps is a program that has been fraught with negative issues for  decades. This is a program in which 30 different government reports and  audits have raised concerns over its safety and security. People have  literally been killed in this program, and the left wants to make it  less accountable. Other provisions in the bill water down performance  metrics, reducing the ability of Congress to measure the success of  workforce development programs.   More accountability and measurable outcomes are clearly necessary.  According to a 2018 investigation by the Tampa Bay Times, some local  workforce boards had significantly misreported their outcomes and took  credit for finding thousands of jobs for people who never even  participated in the program.   Other data demonstrate that these programs are not always effective,  even when being operated honestly. Less than one-quarter of young  enrollees and barely one-third of adults exited programs with  occupations related to the workforce development program in which they  were enrolled. Clearly, something isn't working. Let me repeat: Fewer  than 25 percent of young enrollees and only 30 percent of adults came  out of the programs into jobs related to the workforce development  program in which they were enrolled.   If we hope to enhance our Nation's economic competitiveness and  upskill workers for in-demand jobs, we must create a workforce  development system that actually works. This bill utterly fails to do  that. The American people deserve so much better.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Wisconsin (Mr. Grothman).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Arkansas (Mr. Hill).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, in FY 2021, taxpayers spent about $1.8 billion on  adult, dislocated worker, and youth activities under title I of WIOA.  According to the Department of Labor, only $537 million, or less than  30 percent of that money, went toward ``training services.''   Most people assume that our Nation's workforce development system is  primarily focused on providing workers the skills they need to be  successful in the modern economy. Unfortunately, that is not accurate.   Not surprisingly, with so little focus on actual skills development,  the outcomes for these programs are poor. Among youth participants,  less than one-quarter exited the program with employment in an  occupation related to the services they received from the system. Among  adults and dislocated workers, a little more than one-third exited with  employment related to their program.   Republicans would like to address these shortcomings and believe this  reauthorization presents an opportunity to do that. The Republican  proposal we offered during committee, and to the Rules Committee,  increases the percentage of funding going toward skills development. We  proposed reforms to bring more employers to the table and engage more  employers in the workforce system.   Unfortunately, the Democrats' bill rejects those proposals and,  instead, would actually make these problems worse. As a result of  provisions in H.R. 7309, an even smaller portion of WIOA funding will  be directed toward skills development.   The bill will also dilute employers' involvement in State and local  governance of the workforce system, which is the opposite of what we  should be doing.   Madam Speaker, this bill is a missed opportunity. I urge my  colleagues to oppose the base bill so we can get back to work and truly  reform this program to get more workers the skills they need to fill  the economy's open jobs.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Rutherford).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, by reversing some of the key reforms made in the  bipartisan 2014 WIOA reauthorization, H.R. 7309 takes our workforce  system backwards. It does this by imposing more bureaucratic hurdles to  job creators and reducing program accountability. It is time to stop  being so frivolous with taxpayer dollars.   This bill proposes pouring more money into an already expensive  program. In FY 2021, taxpayers spent $1.8 billion on programs under  title 1 of WIOA alone. This is too much money, especially as inflation  is still at a 41-year high.   The House of Representatives has been entrusted with the power of the  purse. It is time we took this responsibility more seriously. The  Nation deserves a workforce system that will actually prepare Americans  for in-demand jobs. Unfortunately, this bill fails to protect taxpayers  at a time of rampant inflation, pushes a radical progressive agenda,  expands Federal control over the workforce, and embraces that failed  status quo rather than pursuing opportunities for innovation.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, this en bloc includes several amendments that I  believe would improve the underlying legislation so I will vote for the  en bloc.   Unfortunately, I must also note that the en bloc includes three  amendments to which I have concerns.   The Gottheimer amendment reduces the flexibility the workforce system  needs to meet the needs of workers.   The Harder amendment will reduce the percentage of funds going to  help youth receive the skills they need to enter the workforce.   And the Lee amendment authorizes a duplicative study that would not  be a reasonable use of taxpayer funds.   However, on balance, this en bloc will improve the underlying  legislation. This group of amendments better focuses WIOA on in-demand  jobs, decreases duplication by encouraging better alignment between K- 12 education providers and local workforce development boards, and  includes information on entrepreneurship in career and skills  development services.   Madam Speaker, I hope my colleagues will support this set of  amendments, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, the amendments in this en bloc will refocus the  workforce development system on the individuals it was created to  serve: jobseekers and employers.   We must make sure that WIOA is helping all American jobseekers get  the skills they need to compete in our modern economy. We must also  make sure that WIOA programs are helping employers connect with skilled  workers, instead of saddling them with unnecessary requirements that  have no proven effectiveness.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the amendment. This Democratic  en bloc creates new programs, authorizes new funding, expands  bureaucracy on workforce development boards, imposes new mandates on  States and local areas, detracts from skills development services, and  transforms WIOA from a workforce program into a welfare program.   This laundry list of problems is not what our Nation's jobseekers  need. I cannot agree to saddle employers and workers with new Federal  mandates that will make it harder for them to grow the economy and  better individual lives.   I urge my colleagues to oppose the package, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, we should focus on empowering jobseekers to select  skills development providers that will prepare them for in-demand jobs  and make sure that employers are involved in this process so we can  close the skills gap.   We should also streamline the workforce system so that funding is not  wasted on unnecessary bureaucracy and administrative overhead. This  funding should instead be directed toward upskilling workers.   Unfortunately, this Democratic en bloc misses the mark on each of  these fronts.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this group of  amendments, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Good).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   This en bloc includes several amendments that I believe would vastly  improve the underlying legislation.   First, these amendments would bring needed flexibility and innovation  to the workforce development system when it comes to apprenticeships.  Democrats have, unfortunately, chosen to double down on the outdated  registered apprenticeship model rather than meet employers where they  are at. This group of amendments includes proposals that encourage  innovation to occur so that apprenticeships can meet the needs of more  employers.   Second, one of the amendments would ensure that States provide a  realistic and workable timetable for awarding grants and contracts for  adult basic education. This is simply good governance. States should  not hold on to funding indefinitely that is intended to be directed  toward jobseekers. This amendment will make sure the funding goes where  it is intended and doesn't get stuck with bureaucrats to the detriment  of individuals seeking basic education services.   Third, WIOA should be focused first and foremost on providing skills  development services for jobseekers. It is unfortunate that H.R. 7309  adds vague language encouraging supportive services to include  ``healthcare supports.'' While I was pleased that the longstanding Hyde  amendment was secured and will apply to WIOA funds for fiscal year 2022  appropriations, I will always fight to see the Hyde amendment applied  to ensure Federal funds do not support the killing of babies. It is of  utmost importance that taxpayer dollars do not go to pay for killing  babies, and this amendment would guarantee that.   The right to life is our most fundamental and sacred right and must  always be protected. I will always remain vigilant to ensure that  taxpayer funds do not pay for the killing of babies.   Madam Speaker, I hope my colleagues will support this set of  amendments, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I have a couple of other speakers, so I am  not prepared to close.   Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from New York (Mr. Jacobs).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Illinois (Mrs. Miller).    Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I yield myself  such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, the amendments in this en bloc will refocus the  workforce development system on the individuals it was created to  serve: jobseekers and employers. We must make sure that WIOA is helping  all American jobseekers get the skills they need to compete in our  modern economy.   We must also make sure that WIOA programs are helping employers  connect with skilled workers instead of saddling them with unnecessary  requirements that have no proven effectiveness.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague from Iowa (Mrs. Miller- Meeks) for her great work on this committee and for bringing forth this  amendment. It is an excellent amendment, and I support it.   We need to do everything we can to improve the workforce development  programs in our country.
