 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    First, Madam President, I want to offer condolences to  the family of   Don Young, the dean of the House and longest serving  Republican in history, who passed away last Friday at the age of 88.   The State of Alaska has lost a titan, the House of Representatives  has lost a legend, and my thoughts are with his family in this  difficult time.                     Nomination of Ketanji Brown Jackson    Madam President, now on SCOTUS, earlier today, the Senate Judiciary  Committee commenced their hearings on Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson's  historic nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court.   The daughter of public educators, the pride of Miami Palmetto Senior  High School, and a Federal judge for nearly a decade, Judge Jackson  began her testimony by returning to what matters most: her family, her  upbringing, her qualifications, and, most of all, her fidelity to the  Constitution.   Over the course of the week, I expect the American people will  finally see for themselves why Judge Jackson is one of the most  qualified individuals ever to be nominated to the Supreme Court of the  United States. They will see, for instance, why the American Bar  Association unanimously rated Judge Jackson as ``well qualified'' for  the Supreme Court, their highest rating possible.   They will see why the president of the Fraternal Order of Police said  there is ``little doubt that [Judge Jackson] has the temperament,  intellect, legal experience, and family background to earn this  appointment.''   They will see why even conservative judges, like retired DC Circuit  Judge Thomas Griffith, who introduced Judge Jackson today, wrote that  ``Judge Jackson is immensely qualified to serve on the Supreme Court  and should be confirmed by the Senate.''   And I also trust that Americans will see right through the misleading  and desperate broadsides that a few Members of the other side have  launched against the judge in recent weeks. We need not pretend that  wild accusations from self-interested actors deserve to be taken  seriously, so color me skeptical that the American people will give  them much weight.   Finally, as these hearings begin, I want to thank Chairman Durbin for  organizing a speedy and fair confirmation process. His work has been  outstanding. Every member of the Senate Judiciary Committee has met  with the judge, which will allow for thoughtful and thorough hearings,  just as the chairman had promised.   I, thus, remain confident that as these hearings begin, the Senate is  on track to confirm Judge Jackson as the 116th Justice of the Supreme  Court by the end of this work period.                          Business Before the Senate    Madam President, now on Senate business, as the Judiciary Committee  begins a busy week of hearings, the Senate, likewise, begins a busy  week here on the floor.   Later this afternoon, the Senate will vote to invoke cloture on the  motion to proceed to the House-passed America COMPETES Act, the next  important step toward enacting major jobs and competitiveness  legislation that both Republicans and Democrats widely support.   Over the past year, the House and Senate have acted independently to  pass their own versions of competitiveness legislation. To reconcile  the differences between these bills, both Chambers must enter a  conference before we send the final product to the President's desk.   In order to go to conference, the Senate needs to amend the House- passed COMPETES bill with the Senate-  [[Page S1263]]  passed U.S. Innovation and Competition Act and then send it back to the  House. That is what we are working toward starting today.    It is of the highest urgency we move forward on competitiveness  legislation. It will lower costs--the words of the day are ``lowering  costs stop inflation.'' This bill will do a lot in that regard. The  competitiveness legislation will lower costs by bringing manufacturing  jobs back to America, by fixing bottlenecks in our supply chains, and  by fueling scientific research.   Importantly, this bill would also help ensure that the United States  has a long-term and resilient supply of chips--crucial for our  military, our auto industry, our tech industry, and for American  families who feel the sting through price hikes and maddening delays in  available goods.   As the war in Europe reminds us, our country is vulnerable when we  import too many goods from a single country, particularly  semiconductors so needed in so many sectors of the economy. We need to  make more of these products here in America instead of overseas to  shore up our supply chains, preserve our national security. For that  reason alone, let's not tarry any longer. Let's pass this important  bill--no more delay.   I want to thank my Republican colleagues, especially Senators Cornyn  and Young, for continuing to work in good faith in this process. Most  of us want to see a conference happen soon, and I believe we can reach  that goal in the coming weeks.   Now, as important as Judge Jackson's hearings are, I urge everyone  not to sleep on a handful of other hearings happening this week that  are crucial for our country's agenda and, frankly, our Democratic  agenda.   In the Senate HELP Committee, Chairman Murray will hold a hearing  tomorrow on something Democrats have pushed for months: cutting the  cost of childcare and preschool for American families.   The Senate Committee on Aging, meanwhile, will hold a hearing this  Wednesday on increasing home care services to seniors, something I  strongly support. And I thank Chairman Casey for organizing this  hearing.   And, finally, the Committee on Environment and Public Works will also  meet Wednesday for a hearing on clean energy, combating climate change,  and increasing America's energy independence in the 21st century.   All these issues--fighting climate change, lowering the costs of  childcare, taking care of our seniors--remain at the top of our  caucus's priorities. These hearings will inform us immensely as our  caucus continues working on legislation that will lower costs and  expand opportunity for the American people.                                    russia    Madam President, finally on PNTR, last week, the House acted in near- unanimous fashion to pass legislation revoking Permanent Normal Trade  Relations with Russia.   This legislation is very much needed for fighting Russia and holding  Putin accountable for the carnage--the despicable, nasty, devilish  carnage--he has waged, he has levied upon the Ukrainian people. This  bill is one way to make sure he continues to pay a heavy price for  starting this bloody and savage war.   We need this legislation passed without delay. It got overwhelming  support from Republicans in the House, including from Leader McCarthy.  There is no reason to hold it up. Let's move it forward. Let's move it  forward.   No nation has so thoroughly soaked the blood of innocent civilians as  Russia. No nation like that deserves to have any kind of normal trade  relations with the United States.   I call on my Republican colleagues to work with us to pass this  legislation quickly. There is no reason--absolutely no reason--to delay  its passage.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m. on  Tuesday, March 22; that following the prayer and the pledge, the  morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved  to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later  in the day, and morning business be closed; that upon the conclusion of  morning business, the Senate resume consideration of the motion to  proceed to Calendar No. 282, H.R. 4521, the America COMPETES Act  postcloture; further, that all time during adjournment, recess, leader  remarks, and morning business count postcloture; that the Senate recess  from 12:30 to 2:15 to allow for the weekly caucus meetings; finally,  that if any nominations are confirmed during Tuesday's session of the  Senate, the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the  table and the President be immediately notified of the Senate's  actions.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 6:58 p.m., adjourned until  Tuesday, March 22, 2022, at 10 a.m.                            ____________________
