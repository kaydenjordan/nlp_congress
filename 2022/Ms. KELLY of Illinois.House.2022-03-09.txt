 Mr. Speaker, in regards to Division P, Title  III--Medicare, Subtitle A--Telehealth Flexibility Extensions, Sec 308.  Reports on Telehealth Utilizations, an analysis of racial and ethnic  minorities as well as dual Medicare and Medicaid eligible beneficiaries  should be considered by the Commission. By not including racial and  ethnic minorities in this study, Congress will be unable to identify  potential health inequities that occur with regard to accessing  telehealth services. Furthermore, the inclusion of dual eligible  populations will allow Congress to account for differences in socio- economic status with telehealth services. By including racial and  ethnic minorities and dual eligible beneficiaries, we can ensure  vulnerable populations have equitable access to telehealth services.
