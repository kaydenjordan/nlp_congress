 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Madam President, I come here today to again speak in  support of comprehensive tax reform. For weeks, I have worked to  highlight the enormous benefits that our tax reform efforts will have  for the economy. I am very excited about the point where I think we are  now because I know this will help our middle-income families, workers,  and businesses of all sizes.   I think it should not be lost that the tax reform bill doubles the  standard deduction. In my small State of West Virginia, 83 percent of  the people living there don't itemize. They are going to use the  standard deduction, and that is going to be doubled. It also  significantly increases the child tax credit, which is great for  families and great for young families with children trying to make ends  meet.   It will make America's businesses more competitive around the world,  which I think will lead to higher wages and more opportunities for our  workers.   I encouraged my colleagues to join these efforts as the Senate  proposal worked its way through the Senate Finance Committee and again  as it came to the Senate floor for debate. Next week, we hope to see  the conference committee report on the Senate floor.   Last week, I explained why I was proud to cast my vote for this  critical legislation. I expressed my optimism that the Senate and the  House would come together, reconcile the differences between the two  bills, and settle on an agreement that would provide real relief and  real opportunity for the American people.   Today, we are closer than ever to getting comprehensive, pro-growth  tax reform across the finish line, and that is why I am standing here  to explain why it is so important that we move it all the way through  this process and pass these reforms.   I asked you to take my word, and I have for the last several weeks  and months, but now, today, I ask you to not simply take my word on  this. Throughout the process, when I have been back at home in West  Virginia, I have heard from constituents, friends, and even strangers  who are really rooting for this effort. They are rooting for it because  they understand what a difference it will make in their lives. Whether  I am at a roundtable discussion or at the grocery store, so many West  Virginians have shared with me what tax reform would mean for them and  their families. They have encouraged me and they have encouraged us to  get this done because they know what tax reform would do for our State  in terms of jump-starting the economy.   One West Virginian I recently heard from, Donald from Beckley,  recently wrote to me on behalf of his sons and grandchildren, who he  said will ``reap the rewards'' of the tax reform bill. He wrote:         There are too many minimum wage jobs in West Virginia and       not enough higher-paying jobs for advancement. There is no       ladder for the young people to climb anymore.    Donald added that he would be very surprised if the tax bill doesn't  help solve this problem. If we don't see higher wages, which we believe  we will, Donald said that he would be surprised. I know we are going to  see higher wages. He said: ``I really hope that the Senate and House  get this bill to the President's desk before Christmas so he can sign  it.''   This week, similar support was echoed by a number of groups and  organizations in West Virginia. The National Federation of Independent  Business said that both the House- and Senate-passed tax reform  proposals ``recognize the need for small business tax relief, which  means businesses could reinvest in their businesses and employees,  create local jobs in rural and urban areas of West Virginia.''   I had to kind of laugh when they said ``urban'' areas in West  Virginia. I am not sure we truly have urban areas. We have many rural  areas. But we have great towns in West Virginia.   The NFIB went on to say: ``We can't afford to miss this once-in-a- generation opportunity to help Main Street businesses grow and create  jobs.''   The West Virginia Chamber of Commerce, which represents businesses  small and large in the State, also expressed support for the tax reform  effort this week by calling it a ``real win-win'' and noting that ``by  making tax rates more competitive, small businesses will be able to  reinvest in growing their operations and creating more  [[Page S8030]]  jobs, and individuals will be able to determine how best to spend their  hard-earned money, further stimulating economic growth.'' The chamber  also pointed out that this effort is expected to grow jobs in our State  by roughly 5,000 new jobs. To some States, 5,000 might not sound like a  lot, but in a State such as ours, 5,000 jobs would be welcomed and  welcomed heartily. They also highlighted that West Virginians are  expected to see an average reduction of nearly $2,000 in their Federal  taxes that they pay. That is a significant amount of money for hard- working families across our State, to be able to determine how they  want to spend their money.   Additionally, the State director of the West Virginia chapter of  Americans for Prosperity recently said:         This is a huge step for taxpayers. This is going to make       American businesses competitive again. It's going to put more       money in the pockets of West Virginians.    Finally, our West Virginia manufacturers--we have a great  manufacturing sector--weighed in by saying:         Manufacturers large and small know this reform will mean       more jobs in America, more investment in America, and more       men and women making things in America. . . . Our elected       leaders now need to seize this opportunity, get tax reform       across the finish line, and send it to President Donald       Trump's desk.    I couldn't agree more.   Many of the folks I have quoted represent numerous businesses and  numerous people who work in and for those businesses.   To get this economy growing is incredibly important, and that is what  we are going to do. It is time to seize this once-in-a-generation  opportunity. It is time to get tax reform across the finish line. It is  time to send this pro-growth legislation to President Trump's desk.  Families, workers, and small businesses in West Virginia and across  this country are counting on us. They are counting on us to do the  right thing, to be big and bold, to get this economy moving. That will  result in more jobs, higher wages, more investment, and more  opportunity and optimism about the future of our country.   I thank the Presiding Officer, and I look forward to voting for this  bill.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.
