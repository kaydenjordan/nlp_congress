 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to praise my House colleagues  for their swift and decisive action to attack the corona threat  yesterday.   Members of both parties recognized that this disease is a national  and public health crisis, that it will affect all Americans, regardless  of political party. We came together to approve $7.8 billion to protect  the safety and well-being of all Americans. The Founding Fathers  created this Chamber for exactly that reason.   In the spirit of bipartisan cooperation, I would like to discuss the  Affordable Care Act. Like our coronavirus bill yesterday, the ACA  attacked a public health crisis. It improved the health and security of  millions of Americans, especially those with preexisting conditions. It  has saved money for American workers, and it has helped millions of  American families provide care for their children.   If these attacks on the ACA are successful, at least 25 million  Americans will be uninsured. We do not want them to avoid screenings  for coronavirus or future viruses because they cannot afford it.                            ____________________
