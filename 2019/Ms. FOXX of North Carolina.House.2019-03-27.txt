 Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Madam Chair, my friend, the chairman, is a diligent and thoughtful  colleague, and I believe his heart is in the right place.   Everyone in this House is in agreement that pay discrimination on the  basis of sex is wrong, no matter how you look at it. The law is very  clear about this. But this bill doesn't do anything to help working  women. This is a bill for trial lawyers, plain and simple. That is what  shows a fundamental difference in outlook and principle. Democrats want  women to sue their bosses; Republicans want women to become the bosses.   Republicans have favored strong economic policies that will empower  and enable women to keep driving the economy forward and build the  lives they want for themselves. Instead of looking for ways to line the  pockets of trial lawyers, we stand with working women.   I am proud, Madam Chair, to yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Wyoming (Ms. Cheney), one of the hardest working women I know.    Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. Hartzler), my distinguished colleague.    Madam Chair, I yield 5 minutes to the  distinguished gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Byrne).    Madam Chair, I yield 5 minutes to the  distinguished gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Stefanik).    Madam Chair, I yield an additional 1  minute to the gentlewoman from New York.    Madam Chair, before I recognize the next  speaker, I include in the Record a chart which shows that pay  discrimination charges filed per year with the EEOC have remained  statistically consistent during the George W. Bush, Obama, and Trump  administrations.                       EEOC Equal Pay Act Statistics        Equal Pay Act (EPA) Charges Filed with EEOC (Average Per Year)         George W.

Madam Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the  distinguished gentlewoman from West Virginia (Mrs. Miller).    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Madam Chair, we have made it clear that we do not believe H.R. 7 is  good for working women, but no one has to take our word for it. There  are more working women today than ever before.   Here is what many of the job creators who have helped make that a  reality have to say about H.R. 7.   The H.R. Policy Association said:         As written, the bill would penalize legitimate,       nondiscriminatory pay decisions; impose an unworkable burden       of proof on employers that even The Washington Post has said       ``potentially invites too much intrusion and interference       with core business decisions''; and add to the confusing       labyrinth of State and local pay history laws.    The National Federation of Independent Business said:         H.R. 7 requires the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission       to issue regulations providing for collection of employers'       compensation data. Most small business owners do not have a       human resources department or a full-time staff member in       charge of reporting and compliance. NFIB members report       unreasonable government regulations as their second most       important small business problem.    Americans for Tax Reform and the Center for Worker Freedom says:  ``Unfortunately, this bill would actually likely harm the women the  Democrats are claiming to help. If signed into law, the legislation  would likely lead to less flexible work schedules for women, fewer  incentives for those who work hard, and lower pay for all.''   The National Taxpayers Union said:         Though well-intended, H.R. 7 would not resolve lingering       issues of pay discrimination, particularly when safeguards       are already available under the Equal Pay and Fair Labor       Standards Acts. Instead, under H.R. 7, women could be       perceived as a legal liability, ultimately reducing       employment opportunities. Rather than impose new regulations       that increase the cost of doing business and kill jobs,       Congress should remove barriers that limit prosperity for       both men and women.    This bill, as my colleagues have said, is a sham, and it simply  doesn't do what my colleagues across the aisle say it will do.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Madam Chair, earlier, my colleagues presented some interesting  numbers. The wage gap is a truly fascinating subject to study because  there are statistics to show it is vast, and there are statistics to  show, in many cases, it is virtually nonexistent.   We should note the numbers that really aren't up for debate. There  are more working women today than ever before, 74.9 million. A record  2.8 million new jobs were created in the past year, and nearly 60  percent of those jobs are now filled by women. There are more women  owning businesses and employing Americans than ever before. That was no  accident. Women are the direct beneficiaries of strong economic policy.   They need strong economic policy. They don't want more ways to sue  people. They want more freedom to work in the jobs they want.   We are here for women, Madam Chair, not their lawyers.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of  my time.    Madam Chair, I continue to reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Madam Chair, I have worked for most of my life. I entered the  workforce as a young woman, not because I wanted to but because I had  to. I knew the burden of poverty well. If I didn't work to support  myself, if I didn't contribute to my family income, we would go hungry.   Well, I have been enormously blessed to have gone from working for  survival to working for pleasure and, I hope, a greater purpose. I know  there are millions of women of all ages in this country today who must  work to survive, just as I did.   When I entered the workforce, equal pay for equal work--equal pay for  [[Page H2859]]  women--was a demand, but not yet the law. Today, it is the law. The  Equal Pay Act and the Civil Rights Act are clear that pay  discrimination is wrong, it is unacceptable, and it is illegal.   Managers who discriminate on the basis of sex are breaking at least  two Federal laws, and they have no excuses.   No one should operate under the assumption that women have reached  their full potential in the workplace.   Over the years, I have experienced sexism and misogyny. I have seen  unfairness. I have seen, also, remarkable advancement, and I have  remained disappointed in many ways.   So, for the sake of all the working women I have known and know now,  women who work because they choose to and women who work because they  must, I looked for anything in this legislation worthy of their  support. I found that this bill wasn't written for their sake at all.   This bill is a cynical political ploy that borders on paternalism.  There is not a single new or strengthened legal protection against pay  discrimination for working women in H.R. 7.                                time  1500    This bill is entirely designed for trial lawyers, and Democrats must  think women are too dumb to understand what they have done.   It is an insult to women everywhere that Democrats are passing this  bill off as something good for them. This bill is like every other  cheap product in drugstores and supermarkets across America that has  been covered in pink packaging, marketed as the solution women have  been waiting for, and sold for twice what it is worth.   We know women are smarter than that. Democrats, who have assumed that  women will always follow their agenda, realize they are running out of  time, and that is why they have stooped to a stunt like H.R. 7.   Women in America are embracing their power and potential in ways they  never have before. I am not talking about the record number of women in  Congress. I am talking about the historic, groundbreaking number of  women in the workforce.   More than half of the record number of new jobs created in the past  year have gone to women. More women are stepping up to start and lead  businesses, to be job creators themselves, than ever before.   Women need Representatives in Washington who will cheer for them, not  their rich lawyers. If Democrats want to champion a bill to make life  easier for trial lawyers, that is their choice, but they should be  honest about it and, for once, bypass the opportunity to talk down to  hardworking women everywhere.   For the women who work today because they must, I am glad they have  the legal protections I didn't when I was in their shoes. It was women  like them who paved the way for suffrage a century ago. It was women  like them who made equal pay for equal work the law of the land, and it  is women like them, today and tomorrow, who will continue to clarify,  to sharpen, and to exemplify what ``a more perfect Union'' was always  supposed to look like. This House should follow their lead.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the  desk.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   In 2016, the Obama administration proposed adding employee pay data  to the EEO-1 report, which is filed by certain employers specifying  employee data by job category, ethnicity, race, and sex.   After strong concerns were raised about this misguided proposal by  congressional Republicans, the Office of Management and Budget stopped  it from going forward in August 2017. A Federal district court recently  overturned OMB's stay on the data collection, which the administration  will likely appeal.   The Obama administration scheme would have imposed an extremely  costly and uniquely burdensome mandate on business owners, providing  reams of proprietary data to the government for uses which were never  adequately explained.   The Obama EEO-1 mandate would have increased the data fields provided  by employers in each EEO report twentyfold, from 180 to 3,660. It was  also estimated that adding employee pay data to the EEO-1 form would  have brought the overall cost to employers of submitting the report to  approximately $700 million annually.   It is appropriate to compare the pay data collection provisions in  H.R. 7 to the 2016 Obama scheme because H.R. 7, as modified by the  Scott amendment printed in part A of the Rules Committee report,  codifies much of the 2016 Obama administration mandate. In fact, H.R. 7  now includes 12 pay bands, the same number as in the Obama mandate, at  the exact dollar amounts that were part of the Obama mandate.   Incredibly, H.R. 7's employee pay data mandate is even more extreme  than the Obama proposal. In addition to collecting reams of employee  pay data, the bill requires the EEOC to collect hiring, termination,  and promotion data. How the EEOC would collect this kind of data and  how business owners would comply is anyone's guess.   As with the previous scheme to expand the EEO-1, H.R. 7's provision  raises many concerns. For one, H.R. 7 would pose significant threats to  the confidentiality and privacy of employee pay data. For instance, the  EEOC shares the EEO-1 data with the Department of Labor, which, in  certain situations, might release data even if the EEOC would not.   Moreover, time and again we have seen massive and harmful data  breaches of Federal agencies. Requiring the EEOC to collect pay data  would create yet another valuable target, and H.R. 7 fails to  adequately address the need for protection of employee data.   As with the Obama EEO-1 scheme, I also have concern regarding the  data's lack of usefulness and whether the EEOC would be able to  appropriately manage and interpret the massive amounts of employee pay  data it would collect. I have already mentioned the burden of such a  collection on employers.   For all these reasons, this amendment strikes the invasive, risky,  and burdensome provision requiring the EEOC to collect employee  compensation data from employers broken down by race, sex, and  ethnicity. I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this amendment.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.    Madam Chair, my colleague just said that  Latina women are being paid 53 cents for every dollar a White man earns  for the same work. That is currently illegal and should be reported.   My colleague may want to amend her statement on that, but I want to  say again, paying a woman less than a man when they are both doing the  same work is abhorrent and illegal.   Women deserve equal pay for equal work. That is why two Federal laws  prohibit pay discrimination based on sex.   What Congress should be looking at are ways to expand opportunities  for women in the workplace. H.R. 7, however, does nothing to help  women. Instead, it is written to help trial lawyers.   Rather than treating sex discrimination charges with the seriousness  they deserve, H.R. 7 is designed to make it easier for trial lawyers to  bring more suits of questionable validity, which will siphon off money  from settlements and jury awards to line the pockets of trial lawyers.   As we have said before, H.R. 7 offers no new or meaningful  protections against pay discrimination.   The findings section in H.R. 7 to which this amendment is added  already discusses women in the workplace and implies that the gender  pay gap is largely caused by discriminatory acts. However, economic  studies conducted by government and private entities alike consistently  show that women make more holistic and discerning choices than men  about managing work-life demands, placing an equal and sometimes higher  value on life factors besides their paycheck as they make decisions  about hours worked, overtime pursued, and promotions sought.   Those values and choices should be honored, Madam Chair. As such, the  gender pay gap significantly shrinks when these choices and factors are  taken into account.   Pay discrimination is a serious issue, but I do not believe this  amendment will improve the bill or help to address pay discrimination  in the workplace.   Madam Chair, I urge a ``no'' vote, and I reserve the balance of my  time.  [[Page H2865]]         Madam Chair, again I say, Republicans  abhor any type of discrimination, particularly pay discrimination  against women.   Madam Chair, if H.R. 7 would help with the situation that my  colleague described, we would be in favor of it. No woman should be  discriminated against because she reports the fact that she is  receiving unequal pay for work, but, again, H.R. 7 does nothing to help  those situations. That is why we oppose it.   Madam Chair, H.R. 7 is not helping women; it is helping trial  lawyers. I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.    Madam Chair, women deserve equal pay for  equal work. In America, it is law codified in the Equal Pay Act and the  Civil Rights Act.   Unfortunately, H.R. 7 is a false promise that creates opportunities  and advantages for trial lawyers, not for working women, and the bill  already requires new government studies.                                time  1530    H.R. 7 allows for undocumented compensatory and punitive damages,  expands class actions, and makes it impossible to defend against a  claim, when the pay difference at issue is legitimate. But the bill  does not offer new protections for workers against pay discrimination.   Both government and nongovernment studies have shown that the gender  pay gap significantly shrinks when certain choices and factors are  included, such as choices made in managing work-life demands.   For example, a recent Harvard University study found that the gap in  pay between female and male bus and train operators working for the  Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority was explained by the  workplace choices that women and men make, rather than other factors  such as discrimination. The Harvard study is noteworthy because the  workplace characteristics of the female operators are entirely  comparable to their male operators. All of the operators are  represented by the same union, and all are covered by the same  collective bargaining agreement.   We want to ensure the laws prohibiting pay discrimination are  effective. However, this amendment, and the underlying provision in  H.R. 7, are not going to be helpful in this regard.   We should strive to provide women and all workers more freedom,  flexibility, and opportunities. I do not believe this amendment will  help us achieve that goal.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose it, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I want to say, again: no one  in the workplace should be discriminated against. No woman of color, no  woman, should be discriminated against. Republicans are opposed to any  discrimination, in pay or otherwise, but H.R. 7 is not going to fix  that. If it were, we would be on board.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, once again, it is wrong to  discriminate, including with respect to pay, based on sex. It is also  illegal to do so under both the Equal Pay Act of 1963 and the Civil  Rights Act of 1964.   Everyone, Republicans and Democrats alike, supports equal pay for  equal work because, when workers thrive, America thrives, but H.R. 7  does not further this goal.   Democrats claim H.R. 7 will improve upon these existing and  bipartisan laws to create new avenues for women to fight pay  discrimination. What H.R. 7 actually does is create new avenues for  trial lawyers to earn higher paychecks--while dragging countless women  into unwanted lawsuits.   Of the 2.8 million jobs created in the past year, more than 58  percent have gone to women.   Today, there are 74.9 million working women in the United States,  more than ever before; and one in five employer businesses, nationwide,  is owned by women.   We celebrate workers who choose to give priority to professional  success and promotion, but it is equally important to show that we  value freedom and diversity of choice in the workplace.   It is not the job of Federal lawmakers to tell American workers of  either sex what their priorities should be. A number of economic  studies conducted by government and private entities alike consistently  show that women make more holistic and discerning choices than men  about managing work-life demands.   The new government studies mandated by H.R. 7 will likely tell us  what we already know and that our colleagues will not acknowledge: that  [[Page H2868]]  work patterns and life decisions are key to explaining the wage gap,  and that the wage gap shrinks considerably when factors such as hours  worked per week, industry, occupation, work experience, job tenure, and  preferences for nonwage benefits are considered.   In addition to opening countless avenues for trial lawyer payouts  while limiting employer defenses, H.R. 7 mandates intrusive and  elaborate data collection from employers, breaking down compensation,  hiring, termination, and promotion data by sex, race, and national  origin of employees--that will cost about $700 million a year.    Rather than expending taxpayer dollars on expanding studies, Federal  lawmakers should promote a continued focus on strong economic policy,  education, and innovation that will create opportunities and expand  options for all American workers.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, we believe women should not  be discriminated against. We don't want women discriminated against,  women of any category in this country, and this amendment is not  necessary and neither is H.R. 7.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the amendment  and ``no'' on the underlying bill, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in  opposition to this amendment.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the right to change  my mind based on what I hear from my colleague from Virginia.   Mr. Chair, I do have great respect for my colleague from Virginia,  and I appreciate the fact that this amendment recognizes the very  serious problem with H.R. 7 by applying the expansive government data  collection mandate only to business owners with 100 or more employees.  However, the forced data collection scheme in the underlying bill, even  with this amendment, is still extremely misguided.   H.R. 7 requires business owners to, for the first time ever, submit  reams of pay data to the EEOC, broken down by job category, race, sex,  and ethnicity. Moreover, the collection must also include hiring,  termination, and promotion data, which even the Obama administration's  2016 pay data collection scheme did not include.   This data collection mandate raises several concerns.   First, it puts at risk volumes of highly confidential pay data  involving millions of individual workers. We all know the widespread  data breaches the Federal Government has suffered.   Second, the EEOC will not be able to manage or properly use this  data. It has never been explained what exactly the EEOC will do with  this data.   Third, this mandate is overly burdensome. The data cells required  from business owners when they file an employer information report,  EEO-1, with the EEOC will expand from 180 cells to 3,660. It has been  estimated that the new reams of pay data added to the EEO-1 will cost  business owners $700 million annually.   Although this amendment would spare some business owners from the  mandate, the serious flaws in this data collection mandate make the  provision in the underlying bill not worth saving.   If the pay data collection mandate is not worth applying to smaller  firms, then perhaps it should be reconsidered entirely. What is good  for the goose is good for the gander.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, could I inquire as to how  much time I have remaining, and how much time the gentleman from  Virginia has remaining.    Mr. Chairman, I have said it I don't know  how many times today. I will say it one more time. Republicans are  opposed to pay discrimination. We have always been opposed to pay  discrimination. We have always been for the rights of others.   The first Republican President in this country was the leader that  ended slavery in this country. Republicans have been for civil rights.  We have been for equal pay. We support the rights of all citizens to be  treated equally. We have all said that, every Republican who has spoken  here.   This bill does not do that. I believe that the gentleman from  Virginia's amendment proves that this is a damaging bill, because he  wants to spare smaller companies from the very damaging impacts of the  pay data collection mandate.   That, in a way, is discriminatory in itself because there is a  feeling that it is okay for big businesses to pay the cost of this, but  it is not okay for small businesses to pay the cost of this. In a way,  this amendment itself damns the bill.   As our colleague from Maryland says, I hope that every business owner  in America will note that every Democrat is a cosponsor of this bill. I  hope that word gets out loud and clear across the country, particularly  among business owners.   I will say that this amendment to spare smaller companies makes the  teeniest, tiniest improvement to this bill, and, therefore, I will  support it, although I don't believe the bill will go anywhere in the  Senate.   It is my hope that, again, that points out the discriminatory nature  and the terrible aspects of this bill to all business and industry in  the country. It doesn't help the underlying bill in terms of the other  businesses and industries.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, in America, discriminating  in pay based on sex is illegal as codified in the Equal Pay Act and the  Civil Rights Act.   Democrats claim H.R. 7 will improve upon these bipartisan laws to  create new opportunities for women to fight pay discrimination. What  H.R. 7 actually does is create new opportunities for trial lawyers to  earn higher paychecks. Similarly, while this amendment appears to be  marketed as assisting young women, this paternalistic approach  undermines young women's abilities and pigeonholes them into  stereotypical roles.   This amendment directs the Secretary of Labor to conduct a study on  the gender pay gap in the teenage labor force and then to report  recommendations to Congress, including recommendations to expand  awareness, specifically for teenage girls, on pay grades and employment  rights. I am tempted to call this the babysitting amendment because it  additionally asks the Department of Labor to spend taxpayer dollars to  compare amounts earned by men and women in informal jobs such as  babysitting.   This amendment could also be called the in loco parentis amendment,  because it is parents who should be teaching their children about the  benefits of hard work and education and the importance of a first job,  which is often a minimum wage job. We don't need the government coming  in and telling children and parents what their children should be  doing. These initial jobs help to teach teenagers important skills that  will stay with them their entire lives.   American women of all ages are skilled, they are smart, and today  they are driving the American economy. Of the 2.8 million jobs created  in the last year, more than 58 percent have gone to women. One in five  employer businesses is owned by women; and we are seeing more young  women than men earning college degrees.   I support equal pay for equal work, which is rightfully required  under two Federal statutes. Congress should focus on policies that will  continue to increase economic opportunity and expand options for all  workers. This amendment and the underlying bill fails in this regard.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I know that my colleague  was not on the floor earlier when I spoke and told of my need to work  even before I was a teenager, and I worked for survival. So I know that  she did not know that and did not know that I do not take lightly the  fact that many young people in this country are like I was and working  to help support their families so that they have food and they are able  to survive.   I do not take lightly anyone's work in this country, not anyone. I  worked hard all my life, and I have always wanted to be paid equally  with men, and I know there were times I was not. So I understand that.  I never want to see anyone discriminated against in this country. I  particularly never want to see a woman discriminated against for equal  pay when she is doing the job that a man is doing.   I wish with all my heart that we were improving on the Equal Pay Act  and the Civil Rights Act and helping to make things better for women  with H.R. 7. We are not. We are lining the pockets of trial lawyers and  in many cases will be harming women. This amendment stereotypes young  women because it mentions babysitting. That is where the stereotypes  come in, in this amendment, and that is unfortunate.   We do have a younger generation, and we have women who can do any job  that any man can do, and she should be paid equally for it. But neither  this study nor this bill is going to guarantee that.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in  opposition to the amendment.    Pay discrimination on the basis of sex is  wrong, and it also, importantly, violates two Federal statutes.   Retaliation by an employer against an employee for pursuing  reasonable discussion or inquiry regarding potentially discriminating  compensation is wrong, and it, too, is illegal.   However, like the rest of this bill, the expanded nonretaliation  provision in H.R. 7 goes too far, and this amendment takes it even  further.   Under current law, those who inquire about, discuss, or disclose  compensation information in a reasonable manner and with a good faith  belief that an unlawful pay disparity may exist are protected from  retaliation. However, the underlying provision in H.R. 7 regarding pay  disclosures and discussion has no limits at all.   The inquiry, discussion, and disclosure allowed under this bill is  not required to be reasonable nor related to any perceived pay  disparity and raises serious privacy concerns for all employees,  especially in the age of social media.   H.R. 7 takes away an employee's ability to control disclosure of  information about their own pay. It also limits an employer's ability  to protect what should be confidential information about employees.   Congress should focus on policies that promote opportunity and  options for all workers. This amendment does not further this purpose.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to protect workers' privacy rights by  opposing this amendment and the underlying bill, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, once again, I reiterate my  opposition to the underlying bill and to this amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I have a motion to  recommit at the desk.    Madam Speaker, in its present form, I am.    Madam Speaker, I am here to offer a  motion to recommit that is about honesty.   It is about making sure this bill does what my Democrat colleagues  say it will do, and that is help victims of wage discrimination on the  basis of sex.   It is about making sure that any woman who experiences unfair and  illegal wage discrimination just because she is a woman doesn't go  through all the hardship of a legal battle only to see her lawyer walk  away with even more of her money.   With this motion to recommit, if a plaintiff has entered into a  contingency fee arrangement in Equal Pay Act litigation, the attorney's  contingency fee, including costs, will not exceed 49 percent of the  judgment awarded to the plaintiff.   If adopted, it will ensure that the individual who has brought the  claim actually receives a majority of the judgment and that the  attorney doesn't collect the lion's share.   The authors of H.R. 7 failed to include in the text any new legal  protections for workers against discrimination. Instead, the bill  alters the Equal Pay Act to allow unlimited compensatory damages even  when there is no intentional discrimination, and unlimited punitive  damages. It also expands class action lawsuits.   H.R. 7 makes it impossible in many cases for employers to defend  against Equal Pay Act claims even when there is a legitimate business  reason for a pay differential.   H.R. 7 creates special incentives and awards for trial lawyers.   For working women who have been taken advantage of by their bosses,  it sets them up to lose out again.   H.R. 7 encourages trial lawyers to file more lawsuits of questionable  validity and to drive workers into the suits without their knowledge  for the purpose of siphoning off the new pool of unlimited compensatory  and punitive damages created by H.R. 7, lining their own pockets at the  expense of plaintiffs.   A similar amendment capping lawyers' contingency fees at 15 percent  was offered by Mr. Byrne when H.R. 7 was considered in committee. Every  Democrat on the Education and Labor Committee opposed this modest  change.   If this amendment is adopted, trial lawyers will have to somehow make  due with 49 percent of the overall judgment, and we all know that trial  lawyers siphon off more than this amount in many of their class action  cases.   Victims of true pay discrimination should be the true beneficiaries  of any judgment in their favor. This amendment will help ensure this  outcome in Equal Pay Act cases.   Madam Speaker, supporters of H.R. 7 say the bill is about helping  victims of pay discrimination. If that is true, then all Members should  support this reasonable proposal.   All we are asking is that if our colleagues are so intent on giving  trial lawyers a bigger piece of the pie, then consider giving working  women more than a few crumbs.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas  and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
