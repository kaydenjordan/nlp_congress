Hon. Michael McCaul,      Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has       prepared the enclosed cost estimate for H.R. 1486, the       Securing American Non-Profit Organizations Against Terrorism       Act of 2017.        If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be       pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contact is Robert       Reese.            Sincerely,                                                        Keith Hall.        Enclosure.                                   ____   H.R. 1486--Securing American Non-Profit Organizations Against Terrorism                                Act of 2017       As ordered reported by the House Committee on Homeland           Security on December 13, 2017                                   SUMMARY         H.R. 1486 would authorize the appropriation of $50 million       annually for fiscal years 2018 through 2022 for the Federal       Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to provide grants to       certain nonprofit organizations to enhance security measures       aimed at guarding against terrorist attacks.        Assuming appropriation of the authorized amounts, CBO       estimates implementing H.R. 1486 would cost $112 million over       the 2018-2022 period. Enacting the bill would not affect       direct spending or revenues; therefore, pay-as-you-go       procedures do not apply.        CBO estimates that enacting H.R. 1486 would not increase       net direct spending or on-budget deficits in any of the four       consecutive 10-year periods beginning in 2028.        H.R. 1486 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector       mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act       (UMRA).                   ESTIMATED COST TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT         The estimated budgetary effect of H.R. 1486 is shown in the       following table. The costs of this legislation fall within       budget function 450 (community and regional development).  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                By fiscal year, in millions of dollars--                                                     ------------------------------------------------------------                                                        2018      2019      2020      2021      2022    2018-2022 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                  INCREASES IN SPENDING SUBJECT TO APPROPRIATION   Authorization Level................................        50        50        50        50        50        250 Estimated Outlays..................................         4        11        21        33        43        112 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                             BASIS OF ESTIMATE         CBO assumes the bill will be enacted near the beginning of       calendar year 2018 and that the authorized amounts will be       appropriated each year. H.R. 1486 would authorize the       appropriation of $50 million in each of fiscal years 2018       through 2022 for FEMA to provide grants to nonprofit       organizations for improvements to physical security and       cybersecurity. (In 2017, FEMA allocated $25 million for such       grants.) Based on historical spending patterns for such       grants, CBO estimates implementing the bill would cost $112       million over the five year period and $138 million after       2022.                         PAY-AS-YOU-GO CONSIDERATIONS         None.              INCREASE IN LONG-TERM DIRECT SPENDING AND DEFICITS         CBO estimates that enacting H.R. 1486 would not increase       net direct spending or on-budget deficits in any of the four       consecutive 10-year periods beginning in 2028.                                   MANDATES         H.R. 1486 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector       mandates as defined in UMRA.                             ESTIMATE PREPARED BY         Federal Costs: Robert Reese; Mandates: Andrew Laughlin.                             estimate approved by         H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy Assistant Director for Budget       Analysis.     Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the cost estimate  from the Congressional Budget Office regarding H.R. 4559. The cost  estimate was not available at the time of the filing of the Committee  report.                                                      U.S. Congress,                                     Congressional Budget Office,                                    Washington, DC, January 9, 2018.      Hon. Michael McCaul,      Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has       prepared the enclosed cost estimate for H.R. 4559, the Global       Aviation System Security Reform Act of 2017.        If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be       pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contact is Megan       Carroll.            Sincerely,                                                        Keith Hall.        Enclosure.                                   ____        H.R. 4559--Global Aviation System Security Reform Act of 2017    As ordered reported by the House Committee on Homeland Security on                             December 13, 2017         H.R. 4559 would direct the Transportation Security       Administration (TSA), in consultation with other federal       agencies, to review security-related standards across the       global aviation system. The bill would require TSA to       identify best practices for:        Enhancing security by collaborating with foreign partners       involved in aviation security,        Identifying foreign entities that have not yet implemented       international standards,        Improving processes for issuing security-related directives       to air carriers, and        Assessing cyber-related threats to screening equipment.        Using information from TSA, CBO estimates that meeting the       bill's requirements would increase the agency's costs by less       than $500,000 in 2018; such spending would be subject to       appropriation. Enacting H.R. 4559 would not affect direct       spending or revenues; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures do       not apply.        CBO estimates that enacting H.R. 4559 would not increase       net direct spending or on-budget deficits in any of the four       consecutive 10-year periods beginning in 2028.        H.R. 4559 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector       mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act.        The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Megan Carroll.       The estimate was approved by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy       Assistant Director for Budget Analysis.     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the  Screening and Vetting Passenger Exchange Act. I want to thank  Congressman Fitzpatrick for bringing this important legislation. The  United States is currently experiencing one of the highest terror  threat environments since  9/11.   Despite crushing the caliphate in Iraq and Syria, ISIS continues to  demonstrate its capability to inspire attacks on the West, including in  the homeland. The two terror attacks in New York City late last year  are stark reminders of this reality and the threat facing the United  States. Given the nature of this evolving threat, I established a task  force on denying terrorists entry into the United States last year and  I appointed Representative Mike Gallagher to head up the effort.   I would like to thank all of the members of the task force for their  hard work in making this effort a success. I charged this task force  with examining how terrorists might infiltrate the homeland,  identifying challenges with current U.S. Government information sharing  and vetting procedures, and reviewing the screening agencies' structure  and bureaucracy.    After completing its review, the task force issued a report outlining  its findings and providing seven recommendations designed to address  the identified gaps. These recommendations were the basis for several  of the bills we are considering today. As evidenced by the recent spate  of attacks, there is a large population of radicalized individuals in  Europe who are willing to commit violence in the name of terrorist  groups like ISIS. We must remain vigilant and cannot forget many of  these individuals are just one flight away from the United States.   Given the seriousness of this threat, we must do more at home and  abroad to screen and vet people seeking to enter the United States. The  bills we are considering today will enhance our capabilities by  improving information sharing and promoting efficiencies in the  screening and vetting process, helping ensure the homeland is the best  secured against terrorist infiltration.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of this  resolution condemning the Iranian regime's crackdown on legitimate  protests and to show the world that America stands with the Iranian  people who want peace, prosperity, and freedom.   For many years, we have known the regime in Iran has fueled  radicalism and violence across the Middle East as the world's leading  state sponsor of terror. But over the last few weeks, we have seen the  brutal tactics Iran's leaders are willing to take to silence protesters  who are fed up with extremism, corruption, and incompetence coming from  their capital. The protesters deserve to have their voices heard  without fear of retaliation.   Today, Iranians are not citizens who are free to choose their own  destinies. They are subject to a fanatical dictatorship that fears the  people it rules by denying their freedoms.   Sadly, the Obama administration believed that the Ayatollah and his  radical clerics would be willing partners for peace, naively rewarding  them with billions of dollars in sanction relief. It is clear, however,  that, since the signing of the flawed Iran deal, the regime's behavior  has only gotten worse by continuing its support for terror groups like  Hezbollah and its backing of Houthi rebels in Yemen, all in pursuit of  establishing a Shia crescent.   Fortunately, the current administration and this Congress will not be  so easily fooled or complicit in their foreign adventurism. Leaders of  rogue states will say whatever they must to bring unearned concessions  from great powers.   But if it is real change that is desired, we must apply more  pressure. We cannot trust a country's government to be peaceful with  other nations if it resorts to violence against its own people it is  supposed to protect.   That is why I will soon introduce legislation that requires the Trump  administration to determine whether senior members of the Government of  Iran are responsible or complicit in human rights abuses, corruption,  or censorship.    Mr. Speaker, the bill also calls out the Iranian regime's  practice of taking American citizens and other foreign nationals  hostage, and lays out several steps the administration should take in  conjunction with our allies to put an end to this practice.   A time will come when the tyrants of Tehran are held accountable for  their actions. After many decades of authoritarian rule, Iranians  deserve to be free. When democracy finally does flourish in Iran, the  people will remember who stood by their side.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.
