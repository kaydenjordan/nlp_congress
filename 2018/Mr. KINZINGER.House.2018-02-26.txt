 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 767, the  Stop, Observe, Ask, and Respond to Health and Wellness Act. I am a  proud colead of this important bill with Mr. Cohen from Tennessee, and  I thank him for his work.   Mr. Speaker, when someone says ``human trafficking,'' oftentimes we  view it as a problem far away from our shores that affects people who  are not us. It is hard to imagine that this modern-day slavery is  happening over here, hurting the people within our community every day.  In my home State of Illinois, we have the fifth highest number of  trafficking cases in this country; and the city of Rockford, in my  district, is ranked second behind Chicago in human trafficking cases.   The most important thing we can do to combat this heinous crime is to  raise awareness. That is what the SOAR to Health and Wellness Act is  designed to do. This important legislation would expand on a pilot  program with the Department of Health and Human Services by supporting  the training of healthcare workers to identify victims and best care  for them through established protocols and procedures.   Many times, when trafficking victims come to emergency rooms,  healthcare professionals may not always spot the signs that their  patient was a victim of human trafficking. Education is critical in  combating human trafficking, and our awareness could, in fact, save a  life.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly encourage my colleagues to support H.R. 767.  I believe it can have an impact towards identifying cases of human  trafficking and helping the most vulnerable and at-risk individuals of  this evil crime.
