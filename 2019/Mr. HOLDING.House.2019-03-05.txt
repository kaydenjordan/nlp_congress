 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy  of my good friend and former colleague, Congressman Walter B. Jones.   For nearly a quarter century, Walter Jones served his country and the  people of North Carolina with steadfast dedication, conviction, and  integrity.   A man of deep faith, Walter Jones' kindness and servants heart earned  him the affection of all who knew him.   In Washington, Walter Jones was a rare breed who truly broke the  mold. He was an independent-minded public servant who rose above the  trappings of partisan politics and political parties to vote his  conscience, no matter the consequences.   Lucy and I send our heartfelt prayers and deepest condolences to his  wife Joe Anne, his daughter Ashley, and the entire Jones family during  this difficult time.   Our nation and the state of North Carolina are better off today  because of Walter Jones' principled and steadfast public service. I  will forever be honored to call Walter my friend and colleague.
