 Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague and my next-door  office mate. The south wing of Cannon is well guarded.   Of course, the third verse of the ``Marines' Hymn'' says that when  all the rest of us get to heaven, they will find that the gates are  guarded by United States marines. But I guarantee you, there are some  snipers up there somewhere, making sure that the marines don't get  taken from behind.   We have a term, or had a term because I am no longer involved with  the Pentagon on a direct basis, but while working there over a long  period of time, there was a term called BLUF, B-L-U-F, bottom line up  front. So the bottom line up front from my remarks today is that CRs,  continuing resolutions, seriously inhibit and in some cases, prevent  long-term planning, training, and readiness.   We have a term that you will hear now used by the military on a daily  basis: We have to be ready to fight tonight. That is not tonight next  week. That is not tonight next month. That is right now and around the  globe.                                time  1800    When you have a mission like the U.S. military does to protect not  only our citizens here but those citizens in countries of our coalition  partners around the world, we have to be able to fight tonight, and we  have to be able to fight as a coalition force around the world. When  you are not ready, you are not a good partner. Continuing resolutions  consume time, they consume resources, and they increase the overall  cost of warfighting.   DOD's mission is to protect all of our citizens by successfully  executing operational war plans. These operational plans change over  time due to evolving threats. Continuing resolutions prevent DOD from  maintaining momentum in keeping ahead of those changing threats.  Warfighting is not like a sports team where you can go 18 and 1 for the  season and still claim victory. That 1 has to always be in the zero  column for our military.   Training and readiness go hand in hand. The readiness comes in two  forms: personnel readiness and equipment readiness. When you think  about the time it takes to train a young soldier, sailor, airman,  marine or coastguardsman, that can't be done overnight. Long-term  planning goes into that individual training. That individual training  morphs into unit training so that individual part of a unit is  [[Page H6166]]  ready to go and defend our Nation's interests at home and abroad.   Equipment readiness is a challenge, because when you cannot plan long  term for your buys of parts, whether they be for aircraft, ships,  tanks, whatever it happens to be, again, your cost goes up.   We have the responsibility as the Congress to give our Department of  Defense and the Secretary of Defense the tools they need to keep our  country safe. Continuing resolutions seriously hinder our capability to  complete that mission.   I strongly urge the Senate to act swiftly and come to the realization  that a continuing resolution is not an answer going forward for the  safety and security of our country, all of its citizens, our families,  and our coalition partners who rely on us when times get in dire  straits.   So, Madam Speaker, I am thankful for the opportunity to speak with  you tonight, and I just want to end with one real-time, real-life  anecdote.   Forty-six years ago yesterday, July 11, 1972, we saw the evidence of  a successful evolving threat in Vietnam when the worst, most  devastating helicopter shoot-down of the entire Vietnam war occurred.  Sixty-two people perished in one CH-53 helicopter in the northern I  Corps. We had not had the capability to adjust our tactics because the  SA-7 missile had been introduced. That is how quickly life can change  on the battlefield.   We as the Congress need to do everything possible to ensure that that  doesn't happen to our Nation's warriors.   Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague not only for his service, but for  his friendship.
