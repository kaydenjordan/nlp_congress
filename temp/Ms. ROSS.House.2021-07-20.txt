Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Burgess), pending  which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During consideration  of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members be  given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, on Monday, the Rules Committee met and  reported a rule, House Resolution 535, providing for considering of  three measures. First, H.R. 2467, the PFAS Action Act, under a  structured rule. The rule self-executes a manager's amendment from  Chairman Pallone, provides for 1 hour of general debate equally divided  and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the  Committee on Energy and Commerce or their designees, makes in order 10  amendments, provides en bloc authority, and provides one motion to  recommit.   The rule also provides for consideration of H.R. 2668, the Consumer  Protection and Recovery Act, under a closed rule. The rule provides for  1  [[Page H3709]]  hour of general debate on the bill equally divided and controlled by  the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Energy and  Commerce or their designees and provides one motion to recommit.   The rule further provides for consideration of H.R. 3985, the ALLIES  Act of 2021, under a closed rule. The rule self-executes a manager's  amendment from Chairman Nadler, provides for 1 hour of general debate  on the bill equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking  minority member of the Committee on the Judiciary or their designees,  and provides one motion to recommit.   Finally, the rule provides the majority leader or his designee the  ability to en bloc requested roll call votes on suspension bills  considered on July 19 and July 20, 2021. This authority lasts through  July 22.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the three bills in this rule:  H.R. 2467, the PFAS Action Act of 2021; H.R. 2668, the Consumer  Protection and Recovery Act; and H.R. 3985, the ALLIES Act of 2021.   H.R. 2467 will require comprehensive regulation of PFAS under our  Nation's landmark environmental laws.   PFAS compounds--dangerous, manmade chemicals which do not break down  easily and are known as forever chemicals--have contaminated our water,  soil, and air for decades. The CDC estimates that nearly every American  has been exposed to them, especially our brave firefighters,  servicemembers, and their families.   In my home State of North Carolina, we know this issue too well.  Chemical companies have polluted the Cape Fear River with PFAS for  years. Tests of drinking water systems in my district, including in  Raleigh and Cary, have detected PFAS.   This bill would accomplish multiple goals, including directing the  EPA to establish standards to protect our drinking water from  contamination and authorizing grants to drinking water utilities  treating PFAS contamination.   Some utilities are already investing millions of dollars to upgrade  their water treatment technology. I was proud to offer a bipartisan  amendment with Congressman Rouzer to clarify the requirements for this  grant program, helping to ensure that communities that are already  investing money to address this problem can still benefit from the  funding included in this bill.   H.R. 2467 is a strong step forward to protect the health of our  water, air, soil, and our people. I am thrilled that we are bringing  this bipartisan legislation to the House floor.   I also rise in support of H.R. 2668. For over 100 years, the FTC has  been tasked with protecting consumers from fraud and deception in the  marketplace. Until the Supreme Court's recent ruling, the FTC used a  provision of the FTC Act to recover and return billions of dollars to  victims of fraud. Senior citizens, military families, and immigrants  are particularly vulnerable to scammers and deceptive business  practices.   H.R. 2668 will ensure that the FTC has the tools it needs to protect  hardworking families and small businesses and to make victims of fraud  whole.   Lastly, I rise in support of H.R. 3985. I come from a military State,  and I am proud to advocate on behalf of all those who have risked their  lives to protect our country. As we draw down our forces in  Afghanistan, the very least we can do for our Afghan allies--including  interpreters, contractors, and security personnel--is to protect them  from the Taliban and provide them with the opportunity to rebuild their  lives in safety here in the United States.   North Carolina is fortunate to be home to many courageous Afghans who  relocated to the United States through the Afghan Special Immigration  Visa program, and I know that my community will benefit from allowing  more of these heroes to take refuge in our State.   By increasing the Afghan Special Immigration Visa cap and easing  requirements for applicants, this bill will ensure that our Nation  keeps its promises to those allies who stood shoulder to shoulder with  American forces on the battlefield.   Mr. Speaker, it is time to pass all three of these bills, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Pennsylvania (Ms. Dean).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Pennsylvania (Ms. Scanlon), a distinguished member of the Rules  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Morelle), another distinguished member of the Rules  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   It is long overdue for Congress to take comprehensive action to  address the PFAS contamination of our environment and its health  impacts on Americans. I have seen this in North Carolina.   Industry has known of the danger of PFAS contamination for decades,  yet we still lack significant Federal protections.   We cannot continue to let these manmade chemicals endanger the health  of our people and our planet.   H.R. 2467 will protect Americans and our environment by setting  standards for our drinking water, instituting comprehensive PFAS  testing requirements, providing grants to utilities that are treating  contamination, and so much more.   I also support H.R. 2668 to solidify the FTC's ability to retrieve  money for victims of frauds and scams. We cannot allow American  consumers and businesses to fall victim to fraud without holding  scammers and bad actors financially accountable. This emergency  legislation will help make Americans who have fallen victim to fraud  whole.   Lastly, I support H.R. 3985 to keep our Nation's promises to our  Afghan allies and protect those who helped protect us. We owe it to  those who put their lives on the line for our Armed Forces. We also owe  it to our servicemembers, who will continue to rely in the future on  allied interpreters, contractors, and security personnel in foreign  lands.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule and the previous  question.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.
