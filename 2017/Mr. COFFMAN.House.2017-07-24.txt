 Mr. Speaker, it is my honor today to recognize the long  career and accomplishments of a dear friend of mine, Professor Ved  Nanda, who will be celebrating his 50th year teaching international law  at the University of Denver.   As a professor at the Sturm College of Law, Professor Ved Nanda has  been a pioneer in the international law community since his arrival at  the University of Denver in 1965. Professor Nanda created the school's  renowned international legal studies program and established the Denver  Journal of International Law and Policy in 1972. His work has inspired  a countless number of students to become a part of the conversation on  human rights and international issues.   In addition to his achievements as an educator, Professor Nanda has  contributed significantly to the international law community. He has  served as the United States delegate to the World Federation of United  Nations Associations where he worked to promote world peace, human  rights, and the spread of democracy throughout the world.   The culmination of his work has led to his receipt of countless  awards, including the ``World Legal Scholar'' award in 1990 and the  ``United Nations Association Human Rights Award'' in 1997. I want to  congratulate Professor Ved Nanda once more on his long career and many  achievements. Professor Nanda's greatest passion was educating his  students about the importance of international law and human rights. It  is an honor to have a living legend in our community.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, today the House will vote on H.R. 3218,  the Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act, the largest  expansion of educational benefits for our veterans in over a decade.   This legislation provides a lifetime benefit of the GI Bill, an  additional 9 months of GI Bill eligibility for veterans pursuing a STEM  degree, protection of GI Bill benefits for veterans impacted by a  school's closure, and makes it easier for veterans to use their GI Bill  for credentialing and licensure tests.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 3218 also includes provisions from my bill, the  GI Bill Processing Improvement Act, H.R. 2549, which ensures that  veterans studying under the GI Bill for their military service receive  their benefits in a timely manner.   Madam Speaker, as a United States Army veteran who attended the  University of Colorado under the GI Bill, and my late father, a retired  United States Army Master Sergeant, Harold Coffman, who learned heating  and air-conditioning repair under the GI Bill, I rise today in strong  support of this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, one of the VA's top procurement goals is to  achieve savings through competition. However, there is no uniformity in  how the savings are calculated or if they are recorded at all.   This is why I introduced H.R. 2006, the VA Procurement Efficiency and  Transparency Act. My bill will create a consistent method for the VA to  measure and record the cost savings generated by competing contracts  from its $20 billion procurement budget.   H.R. 2006 also directs the VA to organize its document templates,  which are the building blocks for every contract, and make them  accessible in a central place.   Mr. Speaker, too often, the VA reports flawed or incomplete data to  Congress and to the public. While the VA's current leadership is  working to correct years of transparency problems, the legislation  gives that effort a much-needed push in the right direction.   Mr. Speaker, the VA's contracting will benefit by adopting these best  practices, and I encourage my colleagues to support this commonsense  measure.
