 Mr. Speaker, the FREED Vets Act mandates that the  Department of Education automatically discharge Federal student loan  debt for eligible permanently disabled veterans. The staggering student  loan debt crisis harms the financial security of many Americans,  including the women and men who have honorably served our Nation.   Our Nation's veterans have sacrificed immensely for our freedom and  our way of life, and it is unacceptable that many disabled veterans  continue to be saddled with high levels of student debt. The least we  can do for them, Mr. Speaker, is to forgive the Federal student loans  for those who have served our country.   The VA established a program in 2018 to forgive veteran student debt,  but the barrier of going through the processes meant that only 20  percent of those eligible veterans received the assistance they  deserved. This strong bipartisan bill makes student loan forgiveness  for these vets automatic.   I thank my friend, Congressman Lamb from Pennsylvania, for leading  this bill, and I urge all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  stand with our veterans today and vote for H.R. 3598.
