 Mr. Speaker, this procedure that we are witnessing here  this morning, based on what happened at the White House for the last 48  hours, has all the charm of a ransom note.   The idea that this is put in front of us so that they can provide a  tax cut at the expense of middle class Americans is really what we are  voting on today. So that child who is born with diabetes across America  can no longer be guaranteed health insurance if we turn this option  over to the States. Anybody who comes from local or State government  knows this: that money will be used to balance the budgets in economic  downturns at the expense of those who need it for health care.   Another essential point here as I think we go forward, the other  side--by the way, there are only two on the other side. What is amazing  about this is--when you consider that argument that they had with us  yesterday about national defense, understand this: real national  defense also includes providing health care for members of the American  family. That is a very important consideration. They are about to  subtract from guaranteed benefits to the American family for the  purpose of offering a tax cut to people at the very top, again, at the  expense of middle class Americans.
