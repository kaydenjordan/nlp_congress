 Madam President, I am honored, so honored, to say a few  words this morning about Judge James Buckley--a statesman; a patriot; a  member of the World War II Greatest Generation; a senior Reagan State  Department official; a DC Court of Appeals judge; a former Member of  this body, the U.S. Senate; a friend; and a shining example of a good,  meaningful life lived in full.   It is not very often that you get to say happy birthday to your  hundred-year-old mentor on the Senate floor, but today, I get to do  that to one of my mentors.   Judge Buckley has been a mentor and role model to me and so many  other people who worked for him or worked with him over the past  century.   So, Judge, I hope you are watching. I hope some of your family  members are watching. I want to wish you a happy hundredth birthday  from the U.S. Senate. We have this wonderful card here signed by dozens  of U.S. Senators--Republicans, Democrats, Independents--here on the  Senate floor on your hundredth birthday, right now. We are going to  deliver this to you soon.   For those watching, who is this remarkable American statesman? There  is a wonderful Wall Street Journal op-ed in this morning's Journal  entitled ``Jim Buckley's Century of Service.'' I encourage all of my  Senate colleagues to read it.   He was from a very large and famous Connecticut family with many  prominent brothers and sisters--10 of them. It is quite large. His  younger brother was the conservative intellectual William F. Buckley.   James Buckley--Judge Buckley, as I like to call him--served his  country in so many ways: as I noted, first, heroically, as a World War  II Naval officer. He served in many battles, including the Battle of  Okinawa, which was the bloodiest battle in U.S. Navy history.   He served as a U.S. Senator from New York and Under Secretary of  State in the Reagan administration, a judge on the Federal court of  appeals for the DC Circuit right down the road, commonly referred to as  ``the second-most important court in the land.''   Think about that. That is service at the highest levels of three  different branches of government--the only living American to do that  and the oldest Member of the U.S. Senate, former Member.   In every position, Judge Buckley, throughout his life, brought  integrity, a fierce intellect, and a compelling commitment to American  exceptionalism.   I have known Judge Buckley for 30 years. He is a man of faith, class,  dignity, and humility. He has never stopped serving his country. Even  into his late nineties, he was still at work writing a very well- received book on public policy just a few years ago called ``Saving  Congress from Itself.''   A few years back, I suggested that he present his book to us at one  of our Republican lunches. In so doing, I explained to the judge the  way in which we have lunches here in the Senate. Three times a week, we  get together. There is the Tuesday policy lunch; there is the  Wednesday--what we call--Steering Committee lunch; and then there is  the Thursday lunch, more informal, hosted by members of our conference  who can brag a little bit about their State and feed us great food from  their State. So I suggested to the judge, come by the Wednesday  Steering Committee lunch and share with us your new book. And I noted,  you know, you may know, Judge, that the Steering Committee was  initially set up a long time ago by a group of more conservative  Senators but is now pretty much attended by all Republican Senators for  lunch. Was he familiar with the Steering Committee, I asked the judge.   In typical, James Buckley humble fashion, he said quietly: Why, Dan,  yes, I believe I was one of the cofounders of the Steering Committee.   Of course, you were, Judge. Of course, you were.   Anyway, we all had a great, very memorable lunch here in the Senate  with Jim Buckley, where just in an hour, so many of my colleagues  learned so much from him, which is what he has been doing his whole  life.   I got to know Judge Buckley when I caught a lucky break 30 years ago  and was hired by him as his fourth law clerk--kind of a law clerk  intern--when he was a DC Circuit Court of Appeals judge right down the  road and I was in my final year at Georgetown Law School. This was an  incredible experience for me.   As most know, and I already mentioned, the DC Circuit is considered  the second most important court in the country and, of course, is known  as a feeder court into the U.S. Supreme Court for law clerks, but  particularly for judges. Just look at all the former DC Circuit judges  who went on to be Supreme Court Justices: Burger, Scalia, Ginsburg,  Thomas, Roberts, Kavanaugh, and Jackson.    As a Georgetown law student, this internship was a very exciting  opportunity for me, and I saw up close in Judge Buckley an example of  principled jurisprudence that was anchored in the text of Federal  statutes and the Constitution that recognized and emphasized the limits  on Federal judiciary and agency powers and that understood the  importance of federalism and the separation of powers in our  constitutional system of ordered liberty.   These were lifelong lessons for me, and I continue to use them daily  right here in the U.S. Senate.   I enjoyed this job so much and was learning so much that I pretty  much quit going to many of my law school classes.   For the young people watching, especially law students, don't do  that. That was a dumb idea. My very low grade in my evidence class was  evidence of this.   Judge Buckley, back then, tolerated me in his chambers 30 years ago,  but he really developed a special bond with my then-girlfriend, Julie,  who is now my wife of over 28 years.   Julie and the judge had a small-world connection concerning the great  State of Alaska that was quite remarkable.   In 1971, there was a very important bill being debated right here in  the U.S. Senate called the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, what we  call ANCSA. That bill became the world's largest land settlement for  indigenous people ever, anywhere in the world. Right here in America,  44 million acres of Federal land went to the Native people of Alaska.  And Jim Buckley, then a first-term U.S. Senator in his first year,  became a big supporter of Native rights in Alaska. It was curious,  interesting. What was going on there?   He was a conservative Republican and believed in property rights, and  ownership, and free enterprise, and fee simple lands for the Native  people, which was what ANCSA was all about--much different than the  lower 48, where the system of reservations and land held in trust by  the Federal Government does not work well.   There was something else going on there, the Alaska Native leaders  went to Washington in force to lobby different Senators. Senator  Buckley was lobbied by a beautiful 36-year-old brilliant Alaska Native  leader named Mary Jane Fate, who just so happened to be my wife's--then  my girlfriend's--mom. So the judge and my girlfriend, Julie, figured  that out, put two and two together, that her mom was one of the big  reasons in terms of lobbying that he got interested in the ANCSA  legislation and was a strong supporter of that.   Of course, that cemented their relationship and our relationship, and  Julie and I and the judge have been great friends ever since. I do want  to thank him, again, on behalf of the people of Alaska for being such a  strong supporter of that legislation, which literally changed the  history trajectory of our State for the better 51 years ago.   A few years ago, I was asked by the outstanding organization, The  Fund for American Studies, to give an address about honorable  leadership--honorable leadership--and I made my entire speech about the  life and example of James Buckley.   Honorable leadership and upholding the highest values of ethical  service, which is what the life of Judge Buckley epitomizes, is not  always easy.   For example, as a U.S. Senator, Judge Buckley was one of the first  Members of the Senate Republican caucus to call on President Nixon to  resign  [[Page S730]]  in the wake of the Watergate scandal. That certainly was not easy.   He was also an early Republican leader on issues of environmental  stewardship and responsible, commonsense conservationism in the spirit  of Republican President Teddy Roosevelt that has the support from local  communities.   He cosponsored legislation that created the Gateway National  Recreation Area, which stretches along the northeast Atlantic coast  from New York to New Jersey and is home to one of the most significant  bird sanctuaries in the northeast part of the United States.   As an avid birder himself, I am sure that this is one of the many  proud aspects of the judge's important legacy to New York and to the  rest of the country.   I think without a doubt, the most important legacy Jim Buckley has  left all of us in the past 100 years has been his commitment to freedom  and American liberty in both words and deeds.   He fought for American freedom in the Pacific in World War II. Like  so many from his ``greatest generation,'' he literally saved the world  from tyranny.   He spoke eloquently of American freedom throughout his life. In  another one of his books, titled ``If Men Were Angels,'' he wrote the  following:         I believe that in the last analysis the most important       thing in social and political life is freedom, and I believe       that it is because of the safeguards written into the       Constitution, and the character of the American people, that       we have enjoyed it in so great a measure.    More than any other country.   Mr. President, this great American patriot has left his mark on the  American soul and American history and American heritage at the highest  levels of our Federal Government, in all three branches of service.   Thank you for your exceptional service to our great Nation, Judge  Buckley. All of the U.S. Senate and all of America wish you a happy and  healthy 100th birthday.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I rise to join the other  members of Alaska's Federal delegation--Senator Lisa Murkowski and  Representative Mary Peltola--in honoring our very dear friend  Georgianna Lincoln, who will be retiring from the board of the regional  Alaska Native Corporation, Doyon, Limited, after 47 years of service.   For decades, Georgianna has been a force for good in our State. A  force of nature, with an indomitable spirit, Georgianna, a Koyukon  Athabascan Indian, was born in the village of Rampart, AK, in 1945. She  moved to Fairbanks when she was in fourth grade. Like the experience of  many Alaska Natives, moving from a small village to a relatively big  city was tough. Fairbanks, she said, was ``foreign to me.'' But her  mother, Kathryn Evans Harwood, told her repeatedly that she was as good  as anyone else--an equal. And that message stayed with her throughout  her long career in public service and politics.   ``This path is cut clear for me and I am following it, willingly,''  Georgianna later recalled. ``Knowing that, I can take boulders and move  them aside because in front of that boulder is green pastures; maybe  more trouble, but nothing is insurmountable.''   Indeed, from executive board rooms, to the halls of the State  legislature, to communities throughout Alaska that she has worked  tirelessly to improve, nothing has been insurmountable for Georgianna.  As a young woman in Fairbanks, Georgianna got involved with the  Fairbanks Native Association, eventually becoming the executive  director of the organization. This was in the 1960s, when the Alaska  Native Claims Settlement Act--the largest lands claims act in U.S.  history--was in full debate. She, along with thousands of Alaska  Natives from across the State, advocated tirelessly for the bill, which  eventually passed. It redefined Federal Indian policy in Alaska and  fundamentally transformed the lives of Alaska Natives.   That was just the beginning for Georgianna. She went on to develop  health and education programs in her region, helping to improve the  lives of so many. And then she decided to run for the Alaska  legislature. She won a seat in the house in 1991, then ran for the  senate, where she stayed until 2005. In the legislature, she was a  fierce champion of issues impacting women and children, as well as  natural resource management. Still today, she is the only Alaska Native  woman ever elected to the Alaska State Senate.  [[Page S741]]    Her achievements didn't end there. She became the director of  programs for Tanana Chiefs Conference, served as a director on the  Alaska Native Heritage Center board, United Bank of Alaska, Alaska  Native Health Board, National Indian Health Board, and the North  American Indian Women's Association.   Significantly, she dove head first into her work for Doyon starting  in 1976, later serving as board chair of the corporation and its  subsidiaries--and guiding the corporation through years of remarkable  growth. Most recently, she served on the finance committee, shareholder  relations committee, and on the Doyon Oil Field Services, Inc., board.  She also served as the Doyon representative on the Alaska Federation of  Natives board of directors.   Throughout the years, Georgianna has mentored countless Alaskans,  focusing especially on Alaska Native women. Channeling her mother, she  tells them, ``Know that you are Indian. Know that you are Native and  that is enough. Apologize to no one. Be proud of who you are. Learn to  love yourself.''   Her service to Doyon--now with 20,400 shareholders, and the largest  private landowner in Alaska and one of the largest in North America-- and to all of the various organizations of which she has been part,  have been invaluable. But she counts her greatest accomplishments to be  her two adult children, Gidget Lincoln and Sean Lincoln, and her nine  grandchildren.   We thank Georgianna's family, including her partner Chris Cooke, for  sharing her with Alaska. We thank her for the many years of service to  our State and congratulate her on such an illustrious career. We wish  her all the best in retirement.   ``Ana Baasee' Georgianna.''                            ____________________
