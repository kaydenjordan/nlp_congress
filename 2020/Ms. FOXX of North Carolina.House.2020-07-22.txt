 Mr. Speaker, it is time, yet again, to  correct the record.   For years, my colleagues across the aisle and the mainstream media  have been spouting off unfounded claims that Republicans are complicit  with the presence of statues in the Capitol that memorialize figures  who had ties to the Confederacy.   Democrats seem to have forgotten that members of their own party on  the State and Federal levels are the ones responsible for these statues  in the first place.   Since 1870 statues have been present in the Capitol, and since then,  Democrats retained a majority in the House 39 times. They had ample  opportunities to remove controversial statues from the Capitol, yet,  they did nothing. Why has it taken this long for them to even broach  the issue?   We can all agree that racism, in any shape or form, must be denounced  and rejected. But it is odd that my colleagues across the aisle want to  skew the narrative, do everything they possibly can to rewrite history,  and insert themselves into a conversation where they lean on conjecture  more than they do on facts.   For years, I have advocated that both of North Carolina's statues of  Charles Aycock and Zebulon Vance be removed based on their ties to the  Confederacy.   I have suggested that two statues of people that all North  Carolinians and Americans can be proud of be put in their place. I am  proud that the first Republican majority in North Carolina's  legislature in 140 years voted in 2015 to replace the Aycock statue  with a statue of Reverend Billy Graham.   For years, the North Carolina Democrat Party has used former Governor  Aycock's name, along with Governor Vance, for major fundraisers, and  have held meetings in buildings named after him. Where was the  initiative then?   North Carolina's former Democrat Governor, Bev Perdue, sidestepped  questions about buildings named after former Governor Aycock in press  conferences. Instead, she pivoted to his impact on public education in  North Carolina. Again, I say, where was the initiative to remove the  statutes then?   Even in 2007, in a Democrat primary for Governor in North Carolina,  it was said that addressing controversial statues was not the answer  and that ``the issue of equality is one that North Carolina must deal  with on a more broader level.''    If our colleagues across the aisle want to have a meaningful  discussion on this issue with us, we welcome it.   The decision to replace these statues goes beyond bipartisan  collaboration. It is about doing what is right, in an expeditious  manner, as opposed to exploiting a situation to score cheap political  points.   Mr. Speaker, describing the vote we will hold today as ``political  showmanship'' would be an understatement.  [[Page H3618]]  Maybe it is to compensate for the fact that Democrats are responsible  for the statutes having been placed in the Capitol and the times  Democrats failed to act in the past. You be the judge.                            ____________________
