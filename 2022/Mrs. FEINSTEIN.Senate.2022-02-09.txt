 Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Violence  Against Women Act Reauthorization Act of 2022.   This bipartisan bill would reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act  through 2027 and provide important updates to modernize the law that  has been critical to protecting and supporting the survivors of  domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking.   I was proud to support the original Violence Against Women Act in  1994 and have supported each reauthorization of the law.  [[Page S615]]    This includes the most recent reauthorization in 2013, which passed  the Senate by a strong bipartisan vote of 78 to 22.   It is an honor to introduce this reauthorization and expansion of  protections for survivors.   This bill is the result of a truly bipartisan effort. I would like to  thank Senator Ernst, Senator Durbin, and Senator Murkowski for working  with me to prepare this important piece of legislation.   We have also had help from a number of our Senate colleagues who have  made important contributions to this effort. I am proud that this bill  has received strong bipartisan support in the Senate.   I would also like to thank the many advocates who have lent their  thoughts and support to this effort. This bill was written in close  consultation with the people who are on the frontlines helping  survivors of domestic violence every day. It is not a Democratic bill  or a Republican bill--it is a bill for survivors.   Together, we drafted a bill that preserves the good work of the last  Violence Against Women Act reauthorization and strengthens existing  programs.   For nearly 30 years, the Violence Against Women Act has played a  vital role in the Federal response to domestic violence, dating  violence, sexual assault, and stalking. I hope that this bill will be  an effective tool to build upon those efforts.   Despite the progress made over the last three decades, sexual,  emotional, and physical abuse are still painful realities for far too  many Americans. More than one in three women experience rape, physical  violence, or stalking by an intimate partner in their lifetime.  Nationwide, an average of three women are killed each day by a current  or former intimate partner.   According to the National Network to End Domestic Violence, in a  single day in 2020, 76,525 domestic violence survivors received the  resources they needed thanks to programs funded and supported by the  Violence Against Women Act.   It is clear that the programs created by the Violence Against Women  Act are necessary, and they need to be continually updated to meet the  needs of survivors. The bipartisan bill that we are introducing today  reauthorizes these important programs and provides the necessary  updates to strengthen them.   This bill enhances and expands services for survivors of domestic  violence, including survivors in rural communities, LGBT survivors,  survivors with disabilities, and survivors who experience abuse later  in life.   This bill reauthorizes and strengthens the criminal justice response  to domestic violence, including by improving the Justice Department's  STOP grant program; expanding support provided to survivors in the  legal system; and strengthening the ability of Tribal courts to address  instances of domestic violence on Tribal lands.   This bill also invests in prevention education efforts, improves the  healthcare system's response to sexual violence across the country, and  establishes a pilot program on restorative practices that focuses on  preventing or addressing domestic violence, dating violence, sexual  assault, and stalking through community based, victim-initiated efforts  to seek accountability.   I am pleased that we have strong bipartisan support for this bill,  but our work is not done. The survivors--who this bill is for--need the  Senate to not only introduce this bill but to pass it. The prevention  of domestic violence and the support for survivors of these heinous  crimes is not a partisan issue.   This is not a perfect bill. I regret that certain provisions were not  able to be included in this bill, most notably the closure of the  ``boyfriend loophole'' to ensure that individuals convicted of domestic  abuse against a dating partner could not purchase firearms. Individuals  convicted of domestic violence against a spouse are already prevented  from purchasing a firearm, and it is deeply disappointing that there is  not sufficient bipartisan support for this commonsense provision to  close this loophole. I would have liked to include those additional  provisions, as would many of my Senate colleagues. But though it is not  perfect, it is a strong bill.   I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the  aisle to advance this bill through the Senate and get it signed into  law as soon as possible.   The time to act is now. I urge all of my colleagues to support this  important bipartisan legislation, and I hope that it will come to the  floor for a vote quickly.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Violence  Against Women Act Reauthorization Act of 2022.
