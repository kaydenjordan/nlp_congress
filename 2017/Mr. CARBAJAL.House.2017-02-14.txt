 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recommit myself to work  first and foremost for the interest of the American public, regardless  of political ideology.   I am under no illusion about the overwhelming partisanship that  permeates this Congress. But I believe that, as vigorously as we debate  our policy differences, we should also commit to upholding the  principles of civility and respect to encourage productive discourse.  To this end, we must work together, when at all possible, to advance  the policy that serves our constituents and our country.   In this effort, I reflect on my service in the United States Marine  Corps. We did not first stop to question whether our fellow marine was  a Democrat or a Republican. We counted on each other to protect and  defend our country. That is the approach to service we should aspire to  in this distinguished legislative body.   On the issues of national security and to provide for the needs of  the American people, there is no doubt in my mind that there is more  that unites us than divides us. I look forward to working with my  colleagues here today to do just that.   In the infamous words of President Kennedy: ``Let us not seek the  Republican answer or the Democratic answer, but the right answer.''
