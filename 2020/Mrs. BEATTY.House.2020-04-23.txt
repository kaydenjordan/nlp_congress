 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I rise with the good, the bad, and the ugly for small businesses.   The good: Democrats fought hard and won in providing more than $310  billion for small businesses.   The bad: It may not be enough.   The ugly: Thousands and thousands of small businesses and minority  businesses may be left out again.   The past weeks of economic history and trends offer reasonable  predictions of what we should do in this financial assistance funding  bill.    The longstanding economic inequalities already undermine any ability  to close the wealth gap, and COVID-19 will undeniably exacerbate this  paradigm.   I am asking that we match the language that the Democrats fought so  hard for. It is not enough just to allocate funding to institutions; we  must hold the Secretary of the Treasury accountable that minority and  small businesses will not be left out.   Just like in the film ``The Good, the Bad and the Ugly,'' we must be  the one to shoot the COVID-19 noose to save small businesses. I know  that we will do more in the weeks to come because this a great victory  for Democrats, but still not enough.
