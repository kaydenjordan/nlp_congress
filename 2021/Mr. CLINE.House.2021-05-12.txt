 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Riverheads  High School football team of Augusta County, Virginia, who recently won  the Commonwealth's class 1 State football champion.   After a close first quarter, the Gladiators scored 34 points in the  second quarter, propelling them to a resounding 65-29 victory or the  Galax Maroon Tide.   Riverheads has now won a notable five consecutive State titles.  Senior running back Zac Smiley, who led the team with 121 rushing  yards, said: ``It almost feels normal, but it's not.''   The Riverheads' running game had been strong all season, which  allowed the Gladiators to catch the Maroon Tide off guard with an  impressive three passing touchdowns, culminating in an all-around  unstoppable offense.   When asked what the pressure was like to win again, Head Coach Robert  Casto said: ``We didn't get caught up in all of that stuff.'' He said  their victory ``was just a byproduct of the hard work these kids have  put in.''   Indeed, every State championship is earned, not given, and this squad  certainly earned it.   Congratulations to the players, coaches, and staff on their  remarkable accomplishment.                            ____________________
