 Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I appreciate  my colleagues' work on this legislation. I am pretty sure I have never  opposed a bill that Senator Isakson was involved in. If you are looking  for thoroughness in legislation, he is the epitome of it, but on this  bill, many of us have been recently made aware of the potential cost  growth and budget-sharing and operational pressures that would happen  at the VA. They are having a lot of problems anyway, but the VA's  analysis shows that the cost could be nearly five times what Congress  assumed it was when the House of Representatives passed it--and they  did pass it by those strong numbers.   A recent letter from the Congressional Budget Office estimated an  increased cost from their first estimate of about $1.3 billion. So  there is clearly more work to do just on figuring out the spending and  the administration of this and the deficit impact this bill will have,  while we still want to make sure the veterans who are having the  problems get the solutions they need.   There will be a report out in June that is going to maybe narrow down  the risks. I am not that excited about any studies, but another concern  I have heard from veterans is the pay-for. There will be an increase in  the interest rate for housing for some veterans who are trying to buy a  house. That isn't enough money to cover the renewed estimates of how  much this is.   I think the bill can be made more specific--which is really tough for  Johnny because he has been working on it, and it will be specific--but  we need to get some way to justify the numbers that range between  63,000 people and 440,000 people. That is a pretty big gap on whom we  let in. If they have a problem, and we need to take care of it, I think  we need to spend a little bit more time doing it. I know that is  difficult at the end of a session, but as a result I am going to  object.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the November  29, 2018, letter from the Congressional Budget Office regarding H.R.  299, the Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act of 2017, be printed in  the Congressional Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                        Congressional Budget Office,                                                   U.S. Congress,                                  Washington, DC, November 29, 2018.      Hon. Mike Enzi,      Chairman, Committee on the Budget,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: On May 15, 2018, the Congressional       Budget Office transmitted an estimate of the budgetary       effects of H.R. 299, a bill to amend title 38, United States       Code, to clarify presumptions relating to the exposure of       certain veterans who served in the vicinity of the Republic       of Vietnam, and for other purposes, as ordered reported by       the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs on May 8, 2018.       Among other things, the act would provide disability       compensation to more of the veterans who served in the       territorial seas of Vietnam during the Vietnam War under the       assumption that they had been exposed to Agent Orange, a       blend of herbicides used by the Department of Defense to       remove dense tropical foliage. CBO estimated that those       provisions would increase direct spending by about $900       million over the 2019-2028 period.        The bill that was passed by the House amended the earlier       version to expand the nautical area in which veterans would       be presumed to have been exposed to Agent Orange. That change       would increase CBO's estimate of the costs of the legislation       by about $250 million to account for the additional veterans       that would be affected.        Since the original estimate was prepared in May, CBO has       obtained new information that would affect future estimates       of similar legislation. In total, we expect that accounting       for this new information would increase the estimate of the       legislation's effect on direct spending by at least $1       billion over 10 years.        First, CBO now expects that more veterans would be affected       by enactment of the bill than previously estimated. The       Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) already presumes that       veterans who served aboard certain U.S. Navy ships on the       dates they were near the coast of Vietnam were exposed to       Agent Orange. Using information about the crew size of those       listed ships, CBO estimated that about two-thirds of veterans       who served in the geographic area covered by the bill would       obtain compensation under current law. Thus, in its estimate       for H.R. 299, CBO projected that only one-third of veterans       in the covered population would be newly eligible for       disability compensation under that bill.        We have since learned from additional discussions with VA       that there is considerably more uncertainty than we       originally anticipated about the number of veterans that,       under current law, VA would presume to have been exposed       because of service aboard those vessels. Specifically, there       is a greater likelihood that less than two-thirds of veterans       who served in the geographic area covered by the bill would       obtain compensation under current law.        To account for that uncertainty CBO would, in future       estimates expect that half of affected beneficiaries would       obtain benefits under current law, and thus would not be       affected by enactment of H.R. 299. That estimate is in the       middle of the range of possible outcomes. Using that updated       estimate would mean that fewer veterans would be expected to       receive benefits under current law and more would get       benefits as a result of H.R. 299. The increase in the number       of affected veterans would result in additional retroactive       payments to veterans whose disability claims previously have       been denied by VA and also would increase the number of       recurring disability payments.        In addition, on the basis of new information from VA, CBO       also would increase its estimate of the number of surviving       spouses of deceased veterans who would receive compensation       because the cause of those veterans' deaths would be presumed       to have been caused by exposure to Agent Orange.        Finally, CBO would estimate that spending subject to       appropriation would increase for additional personnel to       process disability claims. Such spending would allow VA to       handle new claims more quickly. Although H.R. 299 would not       require VA to hire more personnel to process these additional       claims, the department has indicated that it would need to do       so in order to avoid a lengthy backlog.        CBO will incorporate this new information into its future       estimates of the budgetary effects of such legislation.        If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be       pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contact is Logan       Smith.            Sincerely,                                                        Keith Hall,      Director.                            ____________________
