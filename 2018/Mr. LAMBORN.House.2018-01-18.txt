 Mr. Speaker, there are some issues we debate here in the  House that, frankly, should not be a matter of question in anyone's  mind. One of those is whether or not a baby born and is outside of the  womb deserves protection.   Sometimes abortion attempts fail and babies are born alive: its heart  is beating, muscles moving, and lungs working. Tragically, some  abortion providers then kill these infants directly or through neglect  and exposure, and this is unconscionable.    The Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act says that a baby who  survives an abortion must be treated at a hospital with the same care  as a baby born alive naturally at the same state of pregnancy. The bill  includes criminal sanctions against any abortion provider who kills a  baby born alive.   Mr. Speaker, killing a baby outside of the womb is unquestionably the  taking of an innocent human life. I urge unanimous support of  Representative Blackburn's bill.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I would say to the gentlewoman from  Wyoming that I am not going to vote for the CR because it doesn't do  anything for community health centers and doesn't do anything to  alleviate the burden of DSH payments for the hospitals that provide to  vulnerable communities and doesn't fund Veterans Health the way we want  it to. There is a whole bunch of stuff.   I just want this process to move forward so we can get back to  negotiating and actually get a deal that is bipartisan that we all can  be proud of. That is why--tell your Members: Please don't go on this  political rally today. Instead, let's keep this House going and let's  do the people's work.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida  (Ms. Frankel).
