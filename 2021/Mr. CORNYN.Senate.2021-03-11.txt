 Mr. President, before he leaves the floor, let me just  congratulate our colleague from Ohio.   That was, perhaps, the most concise and informative speech I have  heard on that topic, including speeches that I have given on that  topic. In representing a border State, as I do, and in my having served  on the Judiciary Committee and on the Immigration Subcommittee for my  entire time here, the way he described it, I thought, was entirely  accurate. I think you can call it a crisis, a challenge--whatever you  want to call it--but it is getting worse all the time, and I think it  will get much, much worse if we don't act and act together. So I thank  him for his outstanding remarks.   (Ms. CORTEZ MASTO assumed the Chair.)
