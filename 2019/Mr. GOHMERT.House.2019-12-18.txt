 Madam Speaker, in 1998, Senator Schumer said: ``This  impeachment will be used as a routine tool to fight political  battles.''   We thought it was a prediction. It was a promise, and now it is  playing out. That is exactly what is being done here.    And for those who say we don't address the defenses of fact, here you  go. The impeachment served two purposes:   Number one, stop the investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice  and Ukraine into the corruption of Ukraine interference into the U.S.  election in 2016.   You have said this was about, oh, this terrible Russia collusion. Oh,  then that fell through. It is about emoluments. It is about bribery. It  is about extortion. It has changed.   But one thing hasn't changed, and that is the intent to impeach this  President. It has always been there.   But let's be honest. The President turning his back on Ukraine, that  happened in 2009, because in 2008 Ukraine invaded Georgia.   What happened? Bush put sanctions on Russia to teach them a lesson.   What happened after that? Well, in March of 2009, Hillary Clinton was  sent over to Russia with a reset button to say: Bush overreacted. We  are okay that you invaded Georgia.   It was a green light to Russia to invade Ukraine.   And what do you do? Oh, yeah, you send blankets and MREs. They can  eat and be warm while the Russians are killing them. That is what the  Obama administration did.   This is a travesty, and we are in big trouble because Schumer was  right. Now it has lowered the bar even farther. It will be used for  political battles, and this country's end is now in sight. I hope I  don't live to see it.   This is an outrage.
