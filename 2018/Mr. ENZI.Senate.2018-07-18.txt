 Mr. President, I rise to submit to the Senate the budget  scorekeeping report for July 2018. The report compares current-law  levels of spending and revenues with the amounts the Senate agreed to  in the budget resolution for fiscal year 2018, H. Con. Res. 71, and the  Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (BBA18). This information is necessary  for the Senate Budget Committee to determine whether budgetary points  of order lie against pending legislation. The Republican staff of the  Senate Budget Committee and the Congressional Budget Office, CBO,  prepared this report pursuant to section 308(b) of the Congressional  Budget Act (CBA).   This is the fifth scorekeeping report this year and the second since  I filed new enforceable levels on May 7, pursuant to BBA18  requirements. My last filing can be found in the Congressional Record  for June 6, 2018. The information included in this report is current  through July 16, 2018.   Republican Budget Committee staff prepared Tables 1-6.   Table 1 gives the amount by which each Senate authorizing committee  exceeds or is below its allocation for budget authority and outlays  under the most recently adopted budget resolution and the fiscal year  2019 enforceable levels filing. This information is used for enforcing  committee allocations pursuant to section 302 of the CBA. For this  reporting period, 10 of the 16 authorizing committees are in compliance  with their allocations.   During this reporting period, Congress cleared two pieces of  legislation with significant budgetary effects scored to authorizing  committees. The first bill was H.R. 770, the American Innovation $1  Coin Act. This measure requires the Secretary of the Treasury to mint,  beginning in 2019, new $1 coins ``in recognition of American innovation  and significant innovation and pioneering efforts of individuals or  groups from each of the 50 States, the District of Columbia, and the  United States territories.'' CBO estimates that H.R. 770 would increase  direct spending in the near term by $3 million but would be deficit- neutral over the entire budget window. This bill was charged to the  Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee. The second bill was H.R.  5956, the Northern Mariana Islands U.S. Workforce Act of 2018. This  bill modifies U.S. immigration policy regarding the Northern Mariana  Islands, thereby reducing the number of people able to claim asylum and  receive means-tested benefits. CBO estimates that this bill would save  $3 million over the budget window. H.R. 5956 was charged to the Energy  and Natural Resources Committee.   Tables 2-6 remain unchanged from my last filing.   In addition to the tables provided by Budget Committee Republican  staff, I am submitting CBO tables, which I will use to enforce budget  totals approved by Congress.   Because legislation can still be enacted that would have an effect on  fiscal year 2018, CBO has provided a report both for fiscal year 2018  and fiscal year 2019. This information is used to enforce aggregate  spending and revenue levels in the budget resolution under section 311  of the CBA. CBO's estimates show that current-law levels of spending  for fiscal year 2018 exceed the amounts in H. Con. Res. 71 by $157.4  billion in budget authority and $106.3 billion in outlays. Revenues are  $3.2 billion above the revenue floor for fiscal year 2018 set by the  budget resolution. Social Security outlays are at the levels assumed by  the resolution, while Social Security revenues are $446 million below  the levels in the budget.   For fiscal year 2019, CBO estimates that current-law levels are below  the fiscal year 2019 enforceable aggregates by $1,142.2 billion in  budget authority and $646.1 billion in outlays. The allowable spending  room will be reduced as appropriations bills are enacted. Revenues are  $5 million below the level assumed for fiscal year 2019. Finally,  Social Security outlays and revenues are at the levels assumed in the  fiscal year 2019 enforcement filing.   CBO's report also provides information needed to enforce the Senate  pay-as-you-go, PAYGO, rule. After accounting for enacted legislation  during this reporting period, the PAYGO scorecard shows deficit  increases in fiscal year 2019 of $25 million--$5 million revenue loss,  $20 million outlay increase--over the fiscal year 2019-2023 period of  $332 million--$47 million revenue loss, $285 million outlay increase-- and over the fiscal year 2019-2028 period of $487 million--$108 million  revenue loss, $379 million outlay increase. The Senate's PAYGO rule is  enforced by section 4106 of H. Con. Res. 71.   Included in this submission is a table tracking the Senate's budget  enforcement activity on the floor since the May 7 enforcement filing.  On June 18, 2018, Senator Bernard Sanders raised a Senate PAYGO point  of order against H.R. 5515, the John S. McCain National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019. That point of order was waived  by a vote of 81-14. H.R. 5515 has yet to be enacted and is currently in  conference.   All years in the accompanying tables are fiscal years.   I ask unanimous consent that the accompanying tables be printed in  the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:  [[Page S5060]]       TABLE 1.--SENATE AUTHORIZING COMMITTEES--ENACTED DIRECT SPENDING ABOVE (+) OR BELOW

Mike Enzi,      Chairman, Committee on the Budget,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: The enclosed report shows the effects of       Congressional action on the fiscal year 2018 budget and is       current through July 16, 2018. This report is submitted under       section 308(b) and in aid of section 311 of the Congressional       Budget Act, as amended.        The estimates of budget authority, outlays, and revenues       are consistent with the technical and economic assumptions of       H. Con. Res. 71, the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for       Fiscal Year 2018.        Since our last letter dated June 6, 2018, the Congress has       not cleared any legislation for the President's signature       that affects budget authority, outlays, or revenues in fiscal       year 2018.            Sincerely,                                                     Mark P. Hadley                                        (For Keith Hall, Director).

Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2017 (P.L. 115-48); a   joint resolution compact relating to the establishment of the Washington Metrorail Safety Commission (P.L. 115-   54); the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2018 and Supplemental Appropriations for Disaster Relief Requirements   Act, 2017 (P.L. 115-56); the Emergency Aid to American Survivors of Hurricanes Irma and Jose Overseas Act   (P.L. 115-57); the Department of Veterans Affairs Expiring Authorities Act of 2017 (P.L. 115-62); the Disaster   Tax Relief and Airport and Airway Extension Act of 2017 (P.L. 115-63); the Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria   Education Relief Act of 2017 (P.L. 115-64); and the Additional Supplemental Appropriations for Disaster Relief   Requirements Act, 2017 (P.L. 115-72). b Emergency funding that was not designated as an emergency requirement pursuant to section 251(b)(2) (A) of the   Deficit Control Act does not count for certain budgetary enforcement purposes. These amounts, which are not   included in the current level totals, are as follows:                                                                         Budget                                                                   Authority         Outlays          Revenues ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Disaster Tax Relief and Airport and Airway Extension Act of              263--            263--                0  2017 (P.L. 115-63)-.........................................

Subdivisions 1 and 3 of Division B contain   appropriation legislation: Subdivision 1 provided supplemental appropriations for fiscal year 2018 for   disaster relief and designated those amounts as being for emergency requirements, and section 158 of   Subdivision 3 provided authority for the duration of fiscal year 2018, for the Secretary of Energy to draw   down and sell crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Division G of P.L. 115-123 provided for the   budgetary treatment of Divisions A-F. d Pursuant to section 232(b) of H. C. Res. 290 (106th Congress), the Concurrent Budget Resolution for Fiscal   Year 2001, the budgetary effects related to the Federal Reserve's surplus funds are excluded. As a result, the   amounts shown do not include estimated increases in revenues of $2,450 million in fiscal year 2018, $2,180   million over the 2018-2022 period, and $1,750 million over the 2018-2027 period. e Sections 540-543 of the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2017 (Division F of P.L. 115-31),   extended several immigration programs through the end of fiscal year 2017. Several continuing resolutions   continued those authorities through March 23, 2018, and sections 202-205 of title II of Division M of P.L. 115-   141 further extended those programs through 2018. CBO estimates that extending those authorities for the   entirety of fiscal year 2018 will increase on-budget direct spending by $5 million in fiscal year 2018, $27   million over the 2018-2022 period, and $53 million over the 2018-2027 period. In addition, CBO estimates that   extending those authorities will decrease off-budget direct spending by $1 million over the 2018-2022 period   and by $7 million over the 2022-2027 period. Further, CBO estimates that continuing those authorities will   increase revenues by $2 million over the 2018-2022 period and by $7 million over the 2018-2027 period.   Consistent with the budgetary treatment of Divisions K-V of P.L. 115-141, the budgetary effects of extending   the immigration programs through March 23, 2018, are charged to the Appropriations Committee; the effects of   extending the programs for the remainder of fiscal year 2018 are charged to the relevant authorizing   committees. f Pursuant to sections 1001-1004 of the 21st Century Cures Act (P.L. 114-255), certain funding provided to the   Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)--in particular the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the   National Institutes of Health (NIH) in 2017 through 2026 shall not count for the purposes of complying with   provisions of the Deficit Control Act or the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974. As a   result, the amounts shown do not include $1,056 million in budget authority or $770 million in associated   outlays in fiscal year 2018, specifically, $60 million in budget authority and $22 million in outlays for the   FDA; and $996 million in budget authority and $748 million in outlays for HHS, which includes $500 million in   budget authority for state responses to the opioid abuse crisis and $496 million for NIH. g Section 255 of the Departments of Labor, Health, and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies   Appropriations Act, 2018 (Division H of P.L. 115-141), delayed implementation of the recommendations of the   United States Preventive Services Task Force with respect to breast cancer screening, mammography, and   prevention. CBO estimates that the delay will increase direct spending (budget authority and outlays) by $14   million in fiscal year 2019 and by $6 million in fiscal year 2020. In addition, CBO estimates that section 225   will decrease revenues by $23 million in fiscal year 2019 (of which $6 million will be off-budget) and will   decrease revenues by $9 million in fiscal year 2020 (of which $2 million will be off-budget). h For purposes of enforcing section 311 of the Congressional Budget Act in the Senate, the resolution, as   approved by the Senate, does not include budget authority, outlays, or revenues for off-budget amounts. As a   result, current level does not include these items. i Periodically, the Senate Committee on the Budget revises the budgetary levels in H. Con. Res. 71, pursuant to   various provisions of the resolution. The total for the Initial Senate Resolution shown below excludes $47,660   million in budget authority, $22,467 million in outlays, and $150,003 million in revenues assumed in H. Con.   Res. 71 for discretionary spending not constrained by the budgetary caps established by the Budget Control Act   of 2011 (P.L. 112-25) and subsequently amended, including spending that qualifies for adjustments pursuant to   section 4205 of H. Con. Res. 71.

Hon. Mike Enzi,      Chairman, Committee on the Budget, U.S. Senate, Washington,           DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: The enclosed report shows the effects of       Congressional action on the fiscal year 2019 budget and is       current through July 16, 2018. This report is submitted under       section 308(b) and in aid of section 311 of the Congressional       Budget Act, as amended.        The estimates of budget authority, outlays, and revenues       are consistent with the allocations, aggregates, and other       budgetary levels printed in the Congressional Record on May       7, 2018, pursuant to section 30103 of the Bipartisan Budget       Act of 2018 (Public Law 115-123).        Since our last letter dated June 6, 2018, the Congress has       cleared the American Innovation $1 Coin Act (H.R. 770), which       awaits the President's signature. That act has significant       effects on budget authority and outlays in fiscal year 2019.            Sincerely,-                                                     Mark P. Hadley                                        (For Keith Hall, Director).        Enclosure.
