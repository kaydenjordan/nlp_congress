 Madam President, one of the greatest indictments I believe  ever written was written on scraps of paper in a lonely jail cell in  Birmingham, AL, in 1963. The letter from a Birmingham jail written by  Dr. Martin Luther King is a call to action.   Last year, for the first time in the history of this body, the entire  letter was read on the Senate floor by three Republicans, three  Democrats--a bipartisan effort, a bipartisan reading of a letter that  is so important, the words of which still resonate today.   Today, we do it again. I am pleased that we have once again three  Republicans and three Democrats to take part in this historic reading.  At this point, as we get to that letter, I would like to yield the  floor to my friend from South Carolina, Senator Scott, for a special  introduction for this important reading    Madam President, continuing reading the letter from  Birmingham jail:         You may well ask: ``Why direct action? Why sit ins, marches       and so forth? Isn't negotiation a better path?'' You are       quite right in calling for negotiation. Indeed, this is the       very purpose of direct action. Nonviolent direct action seeks       to create such a crisis and foster such a tension that a       community which has constantly refused to negotiate is forced       to confront the issue. It seeks so to dramatize the issue       that it can no longer be ignored. My citing the creation of       tension as part of the work of the nonviolent resister may       sound rather shocking. But I must confess that I am not       afraid of the word ``tension.'' I have earnestly opposed       violent tension, but there is a type of constructive,       nonviolent tension which is necessary for growth. Such as       Socrates felt that it was necessary to create a tension in       the mind so that individuals could rise from the bondage of       myths and half truths to the unfettered realm of creative       analysis and objective appraisal, so must we see the need for       nonviolent gadflies to create the kind of tension in society       that will help men rise from the dark depths of prejudice and       racism to the majestic heights of understanding and       brotherhood. The purpose of our direct action program is to       create a situation so crisis packed that it will inevitably       open the door to negotiation. I therefore concur with you in       your call for negotiation. Too long has our beloved Southland       been bogged down in a tragic effort to live in a monologue       rather than dialogue.        One of the basic points in your statement is that the       action that I and my associates have taken in Birmingham is       untimely. Some have asked: ``Why didn't you give the new city       administration time to act?'' The only answer that I can give       to this query is that the new Birmingham administration must       be prodded about as much as the outgoing one, before it will       act. We are sadly mistaken if we feel that the election of       Albert Boutwell as mayor will bring the millennium to       Birmingham. While Mr. Boutwell is a much more gentle person       than Mr. Connor, they are both segregationists, dedicated to       the maintenance of the status quo. I have hoped that Mr.       Boutwell will be reasonable enough to see the futility of       massive resistance to desegregation. But he will not see this       without pressure from devotees of civil rights. My friends, I       must say to you that we have not made a single gain in civil       rights without determined legal and nonviolent pressure.       Lamentably, it is an historical fact that privileged groups       seldom give up their privileges voluntarily. Individuals may       see the moral light and voluntarily give up their unjust       posture; but as Reinhold Niebuhr has reminded us, groups tend       to be more immoral than individuals.        We know through painful experience that freedom is never       voluntarily given by the oppressor; it must be demanded by       the oppressed. Frankly, I have yet to engage in a direct       action campaign that was ``well timed'' in the view of those       who have not suffered unduly from the disease of segregation.       For years now I have heard the word ``Wait!'' It rings in the       ear of every Negro with piercing familiarity. This ``Wait''       has almost always meant ``Never.'' We must come to see, with       one of our distinguished jurists, that ``justice too long       delayed is just denied.''        We have waited for more than 340 years for our       constitutional and God given rights. The nations of Asia and       Africa are moving with jetlike speed toward gaining political       independence, but we still creep at horse and buggy pace       toward gaining a cup of coffee at a lunch counter. Perhaps it       is easy for those who have never felt the stinging darts of       segregation to say, ``Wait.'' But when you have seen vicious       mobs lynch your mothers and fathers at will and drown your       sisters and brothers at whim; when you have seen hate filled       policeman curse, kick and even kill your black brothers and       sisters; when you see the vast majority of your twenty       million Negro brothers smothering in an airtight cage of       poverty in the midst of an affluent society . . . when you       take a cross country drive and find it necessary to sleep,       night after night, in the uncomfortable corners of your       automobile because no motel will accept you; when you are       humiliated day in and day out by nagging signs reading       ``white'' and ``colored''; when your first name becomes [an       expletive], your middle named becomes ``boy'' (however old       you are) and your last name becomes ``John,'' and your wife       and mother are never given the respected title ``Mrs.''; when       you are harried by day and haunted by night by the fact that       you are a Negro, living constantly at tiptoe stance, never       quite knowing what to expect next, and are plagued with inner       fears and outer resentments; when you are forever fighting a       degenerating sense of ``nobodiness''--then you will       understand why we find it difficult to wait.    I yield the floor    Mr. President, I want to first thank my colleagues who  joined me today.   As Senator Scott said, we had hoped to do this in April on the  anniversary of the writing of this letter. Unfortunately, the pandemic  overtook us. But, as Senator Scott said, I don't think the timing could  be any better than today.   Just as last year when we did this, I am sure that each of my  colleagues today will leave the floor with an even greater appreciation  of Dr. King's legacy and I hope a better understanding of where America  finds itself today.   When we think of Dr. King, we usually see him on the steps of the  Lincoln Memorial eloquently and passionately describing his dream for  America or behind a pulpit in Memphis urging his audience to press  forward, to not be discouraged in their quest for civil and equal  rights because he had been to the mountaintop and he had seen the  Promise Land.   It is, frankly, somewhat astounding to read his thoughts that were  read on the floor today and picture him in a small, dirty jail cell,  writing in longhand on napkins and scraps of paper and newspaper to a  group of ministers who were not hateful as much as they were  questioning the need for action at that particular moment in 1963.   There are some who would say that, to share my thoughts on our  situation today, I need to move beyond a letter written in 1963, beyond  a call of action so long ago. Certainly, it is true that there are more  contemporary voices and writings that explain how we should see our  times and what actions are needed today, now and in the present. After  all, although it was uncertain in the spring of 1963, Dr. King, in a  movement, would go on to achieve historic changes with the signing of  the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and so  many other legislative victories.   But I believe we are at a similar moment today, in this time, in this  place, and that Dr. King's words are as contemporary as they are  powerful. You see, in 1963, Alabama had become the focal point of the  racism and division and hatred that existed throughout our Nation.  Bombings and fires in Black neighborhoods were commonplace; suspects  never apprehended; a Governor promising segregation now, segregation  tomorrow, segregation forever; Bull Connor shocking the Nation when he  unleashed vicious police dogs and firehoses on innocent children  engaged in a peaceful protest; and later in that year, a church bombing  that killed four young girls simply because of the color of their skin.   The question on the day Dr. King was arrested was, Why now? Why the  risk of jail and perhaps death to protest conditions in a city that Dr.  King had described as the most segregated in America--a city, though,  that had just elected a new city government that had promised change?  It is a question Dr. King and all Black Americans had heard for too  long, and it was time for an answer   I believe the wisdom of this letter is perhaps the best frame to view  how we move forward during this moment, the movement of this time, the  movement of this generation. In passage after passage, Dr. King warns  us how easily people can fall back to accepting the status quo, how  easily people can hear the word ``wait'' when, in fact, the word means  ``never.''   From a jail cell in Birmingham in 1963, Dr. King told us that action  in that moment was critical so that issues of racism and inequality  throughout the land would no longer be ignored. And here we are, 57  years later--57 years later--and his words are still just as timely.  The action in this moment, our moment, is likewise critical so that  issues of systemic racism and inequality can finally be erased.   While so many seem to be heeding Dr. King's call for action--across  the country, we see it time and again: hundreds, if not thousands, of  people heeding Dr. King's call for action today--my greatest fear at  this moment, quite frankly, is that so many people who have felt  powerless or unaffected who are willing to march and speak out, ready  to change the fairness of our laws and society--my greatest concern is  that these good people will get distracted. It is easy to be  overwhelmed by the magnitude of the problem. It is understandable to  not know where to begin. But it is not enough to simply agree any  longer, to simply have a conversation.   Remember, Dr. King confesses to the ministers to whom he is  responding that he has been gravely disappointed with what he terms, in  1963, the ``White model.''   If a conversation is all that comes from the moment we are in, then  our society will have lost the greatest chance of our lifetime to  remedy wrongs that have compounded for centuries.   It is time for both our institutions and our society to meaningfully  reverse the degenerating sense of nobodiness.   In this moment, we have a critical mass of society that understands  the legitimate and unavoidable patience of which Dr. King spoke. The  last few months have made the truths of being Black in America clear to  all.   We have watched somewhat helplessly as a pandemic killed Black people  at the rate of almost 2\1/2\ times that of other Americans, not from a  mutation of the virus but from an underfunded health system that too  often deprives Black Americans care for diabetes, heart disease, and  other health issues that are now described as preexisting conditions.   We have watched an economic toll as Black-owned businesses failed at  twice the rate of others, and unemployment for Black Americans grows  faster and will stay higher than those of the rest of America.   Of course, through this pandemic, we have also seen the heroes: Black  workers delivering packages, stocking grocery stores, and serving on  frontlines in hospitals and as first responders. But the economic  reality of being Black in America remains a sin of our Nation   There have certainly been many Black Americans who have pushed  through a system weighted against them to prosper, to find the American  dream. We celebrate those folks but must face the fact that  discrimination and institutional racism push much too hard against the  health, education, job opportunities, and financial security of those  whom this Government of the United States of America once counted as  only three-fifths of a person.   Then, while in the course of this pandemic, as we were seeing the  truths of this system and society that have been easy to pretend did  not really exist, on our screens came a video of a Black man being  killed with the knee of a police officer on the back of his neck.  [[Page S3005]]    The image of George Floyd on the ground--as low as one could  possibly, physically get in life--with the knee of a police officer--an  agent of the State--on his neck, keeping him on the ground, was far  more than just an image of the legalities of a violation of George  Floyd's civil rights and the color of law; it was an image of a society  and a culture that keep the knee on the necks of Black Americans  through systemic racism and discrimination.   George Floyd's cries of ``I can't breathe'' were not just the cries  of an innocent man pleading for his life but the cries of so many of  our fellow Americans who are choked by healthcare systems that deny  them access to quality and affordable healthcare; who are, in Dr.  King's words, ``smothering in an airtight cage of poverty,''; who can't  breathe the fresh air of affordable housing, education, and economic  opportunities; or who simply have to hold their own breath when they or  their sons or their daughters venture away from their home, fearing a  police encounter that will take their life.   Perhaps even more than the dogs and the firehoses in Birmingham or  the State trooper beatings on the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, AL,  the video of George Floyd's last moments on Earth was a confluence of  events that gave our Nation an image of itself that it could no longer  bear.   I truly--I truly and fully believe that the soul of America has come  to the streets of America looking for a way for all of her people to  live in a more just society; that we are at a time when what I have  called a crisis trifecta of health, economic, and inequality has  resulted in a careful examination and introspection of our beliefs and  our priorities about race and about poverty; that we have come to  understand more than at any time in the history of our country that  whatever affects one directly affects all indirectly.   Standing on the floor of the U.S. Senate, though, I know that this  moment requires more than introspection on our part. We in this body  and in government as a whole have the power to effect actual change. To  not do so with speed would be forever unpardonable.   As a person, as an individual, as a citizen of the United States, I  know that I must, like everyone in this country, open my heart and my  mind to listen with concern and empathy and to act as an individual.  But I also know that as a U.S. Senator, I am ready to act, freely  admitting that I might not have the ideal solution or all of the  answers but not letting the theoretical perfect be the enemy of  tangible change that we must see, not asking our citizens to wait any  longer than they already have.   As a body, we have acted before, and we should act again. To that  end, we are seeing proposals for law enforcement reform from the  administration, from congressional leaders on both sides of the  political aisle, and in both Houses of the U.S. Congress. I am  hopeful--even optimistic--that we can find the common ground necessary  to achieve meaningful reform, but we will need to do more for this  country.   As Dr. King reminds us, sometimes a law is just on its face and  unjust in its application. I would add to that that a law that seemed  to hold such promise at one time can be eroded to the point where it  becomes unjust.   To that end, I respectfully submit that we should review the Voting  Rights Act to make sure that easy success at the ballot box is a  reality, especially in the midst of a healthcare crisis. We should  examine existing laws and practices in education to make sure everyone  has equal access to a quality education. We should examine existing  laws to ensure that everyone has equal economic opportunities,  including protections from employment discrimination.   To that extent, I should add that, with the historic Supreme Court  decision yesterday--one which I applaud, even though some in this body  may not--we should immediately bring the Equality Act to the floor of  the Senate and affirm our commitment to ending discrimination in the  workplace in any form, against any individual.   We should examine again existing laws that continue to deny quality,  affordable healthcare to poor and low-income households, including  giving States like Alabama the incentives necessary to expand Medicaid  to get those Federal dollars to help lift those individuals who not  only struggled before this pandemic but have lost their healthcare  during this pandemic.   We need to examine laws like the Fair Housing Act, signed only a week  after Dr. King's assassination, in order to ensure that that act  fulfills the promise upon which it was enacted.   We spend billions of dollars each year to perpetuate housing that  keeps people without means, especially Black families, trapped in  places where it is difficult to access education, healthy food, and  economic opportunities. Unfortunately, all signs are pointing to a  worsening housing crisis because of the pandemic.   As a people and as a Congress, we cannot let this moment pass. By  saying that, I mean more than just passing reforms. Surely reforms are  needed, but the greater need is not just to reform but to transform, to  make a dramatic change in the nature and character of our institutions  and our culture toward a more just government and society.   To that end, as we focus on heeding Dr. King's call to action written  in 1963, we should also remember his words written just 3 years after  the passage of the Civil Rights Act and 2 years after the passage of  the Voting Rights Act. In his 1967 final book ``Where Do We Go From  Here: Chaos Or Community?'' Dr. King wrote:         [America] has been sincere and even ardent in welcoming       some change. But too quickly apathy and disinterest rise to       the surface when the next logical steps are to be taken. Laws       are passed in a crisis mood after a Birmingham or a Selma,       but no substantial fervor survives the formal signing of       legislation. The recording of the law in itself is treated as       the reality of the reform.    The point is simply, but significantly, to those of you who have  suffered long for equality and for opportunity: Keep this moment alive.  Keep it alive beyond the crisis mood we find ourselves in today by  continuing to engage those who have more recently seen your plight  through new eyes. Demand that we not just meet this moment with more  division, intolerance, and anger at one another that pulls us farther  apart and deeper into chaos where we have failed to heal. That cannot  be America's future.   Demand that it not be, as Dr. King's letter warned, simply a moment  for another conversation that makes it sound like something is changing  but it never does.   The path from the first slave ship to land on these shores, to the  lone, barren jail cell in Birmingham, AL, where Dr. King wrote his  letter that we read today, to the deaths of George Floyd and Breonna  Taylor and Rayshard Brooks--that path is a long one--too long. It is a  path of a multigenerational failure to be the America of our ideals,  where the Civil War is actually over and we are truly one Nation, with  liberty and justice for all.   I will tell you, as a son of the South--the Deep South--that we  should not lose this moment. We in the South have been at the center of  this divide for too long, and we can be at the center of healing it and  leading the Nation to a more just society.   Since our country's inception, we have said the words: ``All are  created equal.'' We have pledged that we are a nation with justice for  all--all, not some--all. But we know that we have never lived up to  that ideal. We all know it.   In response to many of the protests that are taking place across this  country today, where voices and T-shirts and face masks proclaim that  ``Black lives matter,'' some insist on saying that ``all lives  matter.'' Of course they do, but we will not be a country where we are  all truly equal and where justice is for all until we can all say the  words ``Black lives matter'' and mean it.   We have to mean it now. All of us must reject the voices of hatred  and intolerance and division. All of us must embrace taking action to  root out injustice and to seek justice and opportunity for all. The  road to racial justice in America has taken far too long, but it is a  path we must walk together if we are to reach the mountaintop.   To my colleagues, I say: Join me and others. To the people of Alabama  and our Nation I say: Join together.   It is time, America. It is time.   I yield the floor.
