 Mr. Chairman, I rise today in full support of  Congressman Bean's amendment to H.R. 4664. Mr. Bean's approach is  noncontroversial in ensuring government agencies do not overstep their  authority.   Serving on both the Committee on Small Business and Education and the  Workforce, Congressman Bean is a passionate voice for our job-creators  in Congress. I am grateful to serve with him.   Mr. Chairman, I urge all of my colleagues to support this amendment.
