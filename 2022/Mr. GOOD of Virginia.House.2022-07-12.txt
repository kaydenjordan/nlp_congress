 Mr. Speaker, finally, mercifully, the most  destructive Supreme Court decision in history has been reversed,  something many of us believed we would never live to see, after decades  of disappointment.   Not only was the Roe decision without constitutional merit, but no  other decision in the history of the Court caused so much destruction,  so much carnage, so much devastation, with 63 million lives lost.   Sixty-three million lives, about the population of France, more than  the population of Italy, Ukraine, or Canada. Sixty-three million lives,  1.4 million a year, more than the 2-year amount attributable to the  China virus, for every year for nearly 50 years, all of them 100  percent attributable and 100 percent preventable.  [[Page H5949]]    Thank God for the hundreds of thousands of relentless pro-life  activists, for millions of pro-life marchers, for tens of millions of  pro-life voters, and thank God for the courage of six Supreme Court  Justices who withstood the pressure, the threats, and the intimidation  to do the right thing morally and constitutionally.   May our legislative bodies in Washington now match that courage. The  responsibility passes to us now, the people's elected representatives,  to pass laws protecting all life in the womb.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.
