 Madam Speaker, I want to thank Congresswoman  Black for this bill. It seems like whenever we talk about this issue,  we always talk past each other. But the real question before us is:  Does abortion kill a little baby?   If it doesn't, I am ready to quit talking about it. But if it does,  then those of us sitting in the seat of freedom are also standing in  the midst of the greatest human genocide in the history of humanity.  And although we may not agree on all of the vicissitudes of abortion,  one thing is certain: Some day, we, as a society, will look back, we  will recognize the humanity of these little children of God and the  inhumanity of what was being done to them, and we will regret these  days.   Until then, at least can't we get together and say that we shouldn't  force taxpayers to pay for the killing of innocent little human beings?   I pray that we can open our eyes to that truth.    Mr. Speaker, I came to this building some 30  years ago. Christopher Smith was here fighting the battle for these  little babies, as he is tonight. I hold him to be a grand hero of  humanity. Words fail me to express to him the honor, the respect, and  the affection that is due him for his relentless, faithful commitment  to these little babies that could never vote for him.   All I can say to Mr. Smith is that one day he will step over the  threshold of eternity and God will say: Welcome home, Chris. You did a  good job. You protected those who couldn't protect themselves.   I can't think of anything that I think points to a greater manhood, a  greater honor, a greater stewardship of life than protecting those who  cannot protect themselves. I just want to express that in the deepest  way possible.   Certainly, Keith Rothfus, I love him. He is a wonderful man. We have  so many here. But Chris has been here forever and he has stayed with  it. He is getting to be an old guy, but he is not quitting. I am so  honored just to be in the same room with him.   Mr. Speaker, as I often do around the 22nd of January to commemorate  and to remember the tragic Roe v. Wade decision, I come with a sunset  memorial because another legislative day has come and gone in  Washington, D.C., and sunset approaches fast. So I stand here in this  House with what I call a sunset memorial.   You see, Mr. Speaker, before the sun sets today in America, over  3,000 more unborn children will be killed by abortion on demand in the  land of the free and the home of the brave. That is more than the  number of innocent lives lost on September 11th in this country. It  happens every day.   As much hope as there is in the day in which we stand in this place,  in this new moment in American history, for these 3,000, hope will  never come in time. I mourn that, Mr. Speaker, because it wasn't  necessary.   It has now been 44 years since the tragedy called Roe v. Wade was  first handed down. Since then, the very foundation of this Nation has  been stained by the blood of almost 60 million of our own unborn  children. So many of them, Mr. Speaker, cried and screamed as they  died, but because it was amniotic fluid going over the vocal cords  instead of air, we couldn't hear them.   All of them had at least four things in common, Mr. Speaker. First,  they were just little babies who had done nothing wrong to anyone. Each  one of them died a nameless and lonely death and each one of their  mothers was wounded. Whether she realizes it or not, she will never  quite be the same.   All the gifts that these children might have brought to humanity are  now lost forever, Mr. Speaker, and that is worth mourning. Yet, even  the glare of such tragedy brings a ray of hope because this generation,  even though it still clings sometimes to a blind, invincible ignorance  while history repeats itself over and over again, there is, again, a  new beacon of hope breaking over the horizon.   Mr. Speaker, not so long ago I heard Barack Obama speak some very  noble but poignant words that, whether he realizes it or not, applies  so profoundly to this subject. So I am going to quote some excerpted  portions of his comments.   Let me just say at the outset that I agreed with the words that he  spoke. I am going to say that upfront. No one was a greater critic of  the policies of Barack Obama than myself because I thought he missed  the moment. I thought he missed his moment in history. He could have  been a great and powerful friend to the helpless, yet he chose to be  the one to oppose their chance to walk in the light of life.   He said: ``This is our first task--caring for our children. It's our  first job. If we don't get that right, we don't get anything right.  That's how, as a society, we will be judged.''   I agree, Mr. Speaker.   Mr. Obama asked: ``Are we really prepared to say that we're powerless  in the face of such carnage, that the politics are too hard? Are we  prepared to say that such violence that is visited on our children year  after year after year is somehow the price of freedom?''   The President also said: ``Our journey is not complete until all our  children . . .'' are ``cared for and cherished and always safe from  harm.''   ``That is our generation's task,'' he said, ``to make these words,  these rights, these values of life and liberty and the pursuit of  happiness real for every American.''   Mr. Speaker, never have I so deeply agreed with any words ever spoken  by President Barack Obama as those I have just quoted. Yet, when he was  President, in the most merciless distortion of logic and reason and  humanity itself, he refused to apply his incontrovertible words to the  helpless unborn babies in this Nation.   How I wish, Mr. Speaker, that Mr. Obama could have somehow opened his  heart and his ears to his own words and asked himself in the core of  his own soul why his words that should apply to all children could not  have included the most helpless and vulnerable of all children. Nine  million American unborn children died under the policies that Mr. Obama  relentlessly supported.    Now, Mr. Speaker, that moment when President Barack Obama could have  heard and responded to the silent  [[Page H675]]  cries of these little forgotten souls has passed forever. Mr. Obama  takes his place as the undisputed abortion President.   While I mourn that reality, Mr. Speaker, I take great hope in a new  reality that Donald Trump is now President of the United States and  that the winds of change are beginning to blow. I believe Mr. Trump  will be a protector of these little babies that have waited so very  long for someone to come along and help them.   So now I pray that the Members of this body and those in the United  States Senate will remember the words of Thomas Jefferson when he said:  ``The care of human life and its happiness, and not its destruction, is  the chief and only object of good government.''   That phrase in the 14th Amendment that capsulizes our entire  Constitution says: ``No State shall deprive any person of life,  liberty, or property without due process of law.''   Mr. Speaker, protecting the lives of all Americans and their  constitutional rights is why we are all here.   Mr. Speaker, there is hope now. We wait for that new day that has  come to manifest and the sun to break through the clouds and shine once  again on the faces of these little babies.    Mr. Speaker, it is a new day in America. I am  very gratified that we now have a President that looks differently upon  the innocent unborn than did the last one.   Mr. Speaker, protecting the lives of all Americans and their  constitutional rights is why we are all here in this place. The bedrock  foundation of this Republic is that clarion declaration of the self- evident truth that all human beings are created equal and endowed by  their Creator with certain inalienable rights: the rights of life,  liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.   Every conflict and every battle our Nation has ever faced can be  traced to this core commitment to this self-evident truth. It has made  us the beacon of hope for the entire world, Mr. Speaker. It is who we  are. Yet, today, another day has passed and we in this body have still  failed to honor that foundational commitment.   While we move in the right direction, we have still failed our sworn  oath and our God-given responsibility, as more than 3,000 additional  American babies died today without the protection we should have  already given them.   So, Mr. Speaker, let me just say, in the hopes that we will finally  embrace the truth that abortion really does kill little babies, that it  is time we looked up together again and looked to the Declaration of  Independence and that we remember that we are the same America that  rejected human slavery and that marched into Europe to arrest the Nazi  Holocaust and that we are the courageous and compassionate nation that  can find a better way for mothers and their unborn children than  abortion on demand.   It is a new day in America, Mr. Speaker, and we all have a glorious  new opportunity to make a better world and for America to be the one  that leads the rest of the planet, just as we did in the days of  slavery, from this tragic genocide of murdering more than 3,000 of our  own children every day.   So now, Mr. Speaker, as we consider the plight of the unborn after 44  years under Roe v. Wade, may we each remind ourselves that our own days  in this sunshine of life are all numbered and that all too soon each  one of us will also walk from this Chamber for the very last time.   But if it should be that we are allowed to convene again on yet  another day, may that be the day, Mr. Speaker, when we finally hear the  cries of these little babies. May that be the day when we find the  humanity, the courage, and the will to embrace together our human and  our constitutional duty to protect these, the least of our tiny little  brothers and sisters, from this murderous scourge called abortion on  demand.   It has been 44 years, Mr. Speaker, since Roe v. Wade first stained  the foundation of this Nation with the blood of its own children. But,  thankfully, it is a new day in the land of the free and home of the  brave. By the grace of God, help is finally on the way.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
