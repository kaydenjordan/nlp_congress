 Madam Speaker, we have talked all day in here  about discrimination, and we need to put some facts on the table.   Madam Speaker, 0.6 percent of Americans identify as transgender.  However, 80 percent of Americans identify with a religious affiliation.  50.5 percent of people in this country identify as female; yet we  consistently want to infringe on the rights of all those other  Americans for 0.6 percent of the population in this country.   Now, I have daughters, and I have encouraged them their whole life to  do what you want to do in life; you can succeed. But we see, time and  time again, that males are being put in competition in sports directly  against our females.   My question is: Where are the feminists today? Why are they not here  with the Members of this caucus fighting for the rights of females?   We are going to infringe consistently on that 50.5 percent of the  American population by allowing males to compete in sports against  them.   Madam Speaker, 86 percent of the people in this Nation identify as  religious people. We are going to allow this law and the overreach of  the left in this country to start infringing on those people's rights  and, Madam Speaker, I have got to vote against it.
