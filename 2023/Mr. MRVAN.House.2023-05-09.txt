 Mr. Speaker, as we celebrate National Teacher Appreciation  Week, I rise today to recognize and honor the hardworking educators in  Indiana's First Congressional District.   I am grateful for all of our teachers who show up each and every day  with the sole commitment to inspire and provide students with lifelong  skills. Teachers' dedication and commitment to guiding our next  generation through their educational journey and into thriving career  paths is heroic.   All teachers deserve to be adequately compensated for this tremendous  work, and that is why I am a proud cosponsor of the American Teacher  Act, which would support efforts to increase teacher salaries.   Mr. Speaker, I look forward to working with all of my colleagues to  advance this legislation, and I ask my colleagues to join me today in  expressing gratitude to all educators in northwest Indiana and across  our country.                            ____________________
