 Mr. President, today I rise to recognize the 10th  annual observance of National Moth Week, which will be celebrated this  year from July 17 to 25.   What began as a plan for a statewide moth night in my home State of  New Jersey evolved into a national week of recognition and quickly  became an international citizen science project. In 2012, residents  from East Brunswick, NJ, founded this initiative to promote the  appreciation and conservation of moths and their important role in the  ecosystem. Since then, thousands of people in all 50 U.S. States and  100 countries have participated in observing and documenting moths  during this week.   National Moth Week encourages people of all ages and abilities to  shine a light on nighttime nature and record what they see. Moths are  incredibly diverse members of the Lepidoptera order of insects, with  estimates of 150,000 to more than 500,000 moth species. They serve as  pollinators of crops and flowers and a food source for birds and other  fauna. Enriching mothing events have been held at U.S. National Parks  and Monuments; State, county, and local parks; museums, libraries,  nature centers, and backyards.   This scientific event is an all-volunteer effort coordinated by the  Friends of the East Brunswick Environmental Commission with the  assistance of a team of entomologists, researchers, educators, and  enthusiasts around the world. In addition, country coordinators in  Asia, Africa, Europe, Central and South America, and Australia are  helping to increase awareness, study and appreciation of moths, their  incredible diversity, and ecological importance in their own countries.   National Moth Week has brought people together from many different  cultures and ethnicities for the purpose of observing and protecting an  important natural resource and dispelling the negative conceptions some  may have of moths. It proudly represents the best of the Garden State  and its concern for the health of our environment and all of its  inhabitants.   It is my great honor to recognize the anniversary of National Moth  Week and celebrate the vibrant research and scientific community in the  State of New Jersey.                            ____________________
