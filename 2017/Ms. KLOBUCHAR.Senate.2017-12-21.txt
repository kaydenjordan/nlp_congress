 Madam President, I ask for 3 minutes to talk about my  colleague.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.                            ____________________     Madam President, you heard in Senator Franken's  closing words the passion he has for all of the work that he has done  in this Chamber and for the people of our State. You saw the love that  he has for his family--for Franni--and the love that he has for his  staff. They are not good staff; they are wonderful staff.   I think about all of the legacies that Al will leave. One of them is  his staff, to whom he has been so devoted. Another is all of the work  he has done for veterans, the work he has done for healthcare with the  medical loss ratio--one of the major achievements in the Affordable  Care Act. One is the work he has done, way ahead of his time, for the  LGBTQ community, and another is the work he has done for our Tribal  communities. That was his No. 1 ask when he arrived in the Senate--to  be on the Indian Affairs Committee. That is not what other people ask  for. He did that. Another is the work he did on bullying in schools.  For the kids who had no voice, he gave them a voice. Another is the  work he did in carrying on Paul Wellstone's work for those with mental  illness.   When I think about what I will miss about Al, I will miss, first of  all, how he defied expectations when he got elected. I think about all  of those headlines that he mentions in his book. No matter what he did  in the first few years he was in office, they would read with things  like: Al Franken passes a bill. That's no joke. Al Franken gets  reelected. That's no joke. Yet he still carried on and defied  expectations every single day that he was here.   Another thing I will miss is all of the Senators approaching him in  his first few weeks in office with their bad jokes, which he would  smile at, and then he would later tell me they were not good jokes.   Another thing I will always miss about Al is the passion he had for  his work. I think many people were captivated by the pointed  questioning of witnesses and nominees in the last year, but it was that  kind of focus that he took to all of his work when he would examine  policies he thought were good or bad. He never gave up on that.  [[Page S8200]]    The other thing I will greatly miss is sitting next to Al in the  Judiciary Committee. While he would do the serious work, he would never  miss an opportunity to show me or Senator Durbin or Senator Whitehouse  or anyone near him the latest pictures of his grandchildren and his  family or, maybe, the doodles that he did of Senator Grassley.   The other thing I will miss greatly is the way he would talk about  Paul Wellstone. Today, he managed to do it without crying, but so many  times, whenever he would talk about Paul, he would start to cry. He  would do it in private, and he would do it in public because he  understood the legacy that Paul left behind and the burden that we all  have to carry it on.   One thing I know, as you heard in his last speech, is that when Al  leaves here, he will not be quieted in any way. His work will live on,  and his voice will be stronger than ever. I think the last call of  action that he left us with of the war for truth--for truth in what we  do and for truth in our politics--is something that no one should  forget in this Chamber. It is one way that Al's work will live on  because I know he will keep calling people on the truth.   While I will no longer be sitting next to him in Judiciary, I know we  will stay friends forever. I thank Senator Franken so much for his  work.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant minority leader.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, I rise, once again today, to express my  strong support for taking action on the Dream Act. I thank all the  Dreamers who, in recent weeks, traveled from all across the country to  Washington to make their voices heard.   Last month, I met with 50 Minnesotans, who traveled here by bus to  show their support for the Dream Act. They took time away from their  jobs, from their education, and from their families because this issue  is so critical to them and to their loved ones.   I want to get this bill passed, and while I remain hopeful we will  reach an agreement soon, I know this has real consequences with each  and every day, as over 100 Dreamers lose their status per day.   We have already seen the harmful effects of the administration's  decision to end DACA, and the situation will continue to get worse  until we take action. For the eligible DACA recipients with statuses  set to expire over the upcoming weeks, the uncertainty is unbelievably  difficult.  [[Page S8224]]    These are people who were told previously by our government that they  could stay. They registered with our government, and now, with each and  every day, more and more of them are losing their status. Just since I  spoke about this issue on the Senate floor last week, an estimated 800  additional Dreamers have lost their DACA status. In March, the number  of Dreamers with expiring protections will increase to 1,000 a day if  we have not found a solution by that time.   This is an issue where we should be able to find bipartisan  consensus. Americans want us to protect Dreamers. In fact, one recent  poll found that 86 percent of Americans support action to allow  Dreamers to stay in the United States. The Dream Act, which my  colleague Senator Durbin has led in the Senate for 16 years now, is  based on a simple principle: Dreamers who are brought to the United  States as children, and only know this country as their home, should be  given the opportunity to contribute to our Nation and become citizens.   These young people were brought here through no fault of their own.  On average, when they came over, they were only about 6\1/2\ years old.  Imagine being told that you have to go back to a country you have not  stepped foot in since you were 6, where you may not know anyone or even  speak the language.   To receive DACA status, all Dreamers have already passed background  checks, paid fees, and met educational requirements. They already did  this so they could stay in the United States and contribute to our  communities across the country.   Dreamers are already contributing. More than 97 percent of these  Dreamers, of the DACA recipients, are now in school or in the  workforce. In fact, 72 percent of them currently in school are pursuing  a bachelor's degree or higher. The American Medical Association has  urged us to take action on this issue, noting our current shortage of  physicians in the United States--something the Presiding Officer is  aware of--and estimating that passing the Dream Act could add 5,400  physicians to the U.S. healthcare system in the coming  decades. According to the American Association of Medical Colleges,  more than 100 students with DACA status applied to medical school last  year, and about 70 Dreamers are currently enrolled in medical school.    In Minnesota, our large refugee and immigrant community has  contributed so much to the cultural and economic vitality of our State.  We are proud to have big communities of Somali, Liberian, and Oromo  populations, as well as the second largest Hmong population. In fact,  we have the biggest population of Somalis in the country, the biggest  population of Liberians, the biggest population of Oromos, and we are  also proud to be the home of more than 6,000 Dreamers.   Ending DACA in my State, where the unemployment rate is hovering in  the 3-percent range, would cost Minnesota more than $376 million in  annual revenue, let alone the immeasurable impact to families who may  be ripped apart.                            ____________________     Mr. President, last week on the Senate floor, I talked  about how I have always tried to find examples of Dreamers so that the  citizens in my State can understand what we are talking about when we  talk about the fact that someone could be brought over to our country  and not even realize it and have this Dreamer status.   I talked about Joseph Medina. He was a decorated Army veteran. He  served in World War II. He lived in Minnesota. I am sad to say that he  passed away last July at the ripe old age of 103 years old. There was a  story about Joe in today's edition of our largest newspaper in  Minnesota, honoring his contributions to our Nation during World War II  and through his nearly a century as a proud and hard-working  Minnesotan.   Joe lost both of his parents before he was 1 year old. He was brought  to the United States from Mexico by his aunt when he was just 5, and he  didn't find out that he was undocumented during his whole time growing  up. When did he find out? When he tried to join the Army in World War  II.   So what he did then, because he wasn't a citizen--back then, it was  pretty simple; what they would do is have people go to Canada,  especially if they lived in Minnesota, and that is how they would  become citizens. So they sent Joe Medina to Canada for 1 day. I  remember his telling me this story--that this is what they did during  World War II when they wanted people to sign up and serve. He stayed in  a hotel for 1 night, and he came back, and with the help of our  military, he became a citizen.   He then served under General MacArthur in the Pacific. Then he came  home, got married, had a son, and that son served in the Vietnam war.   Joe came to Washington, DC, with his son for the first and last time  to see the World War II Memorial at age 99. I stood there by his side  as he looked at the Minnesota part of that Memorial and thought of the  people he knew who were no longer with us and thought of his service  and how much he loved serving our country in World War II.   At his side, along with his own son who had served in Vietnam, were  two Dreamers--two high school students who were in high school in the  suburban part of the Twin Cities, and they also wanted to join the  military. If I remember right, they wanted to join the Air Force. Do  you know what? The way the rules were a few years ago, they weren't  allowed to do that. Joseph Medina couldn't understand that because the  proudest part of his life was serving in our military, serving despite  the fact that he was born in another country but lived almost his  entire life--98 years of his 103 years--in America.   So I join with all those in my State in remembering Joseph Medina and  honoring his service to our country as we continue to work toward  finding a solution for the Dreamers in the Senate.   I note that we should also take action here at the end of the year,  and we should be staying to get a number of priorities done, including  a long-term reauthorization of the Children's Health Insurance Program,  dealing with the medical device tax, renewing funding for community  health centers. There are so many things we need to do.   In closing, I just want to make clear that I stand with my colleagues  on both sides of the aisle who have spoken out in support of the Dream  Act. We need to pass this bill.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.
