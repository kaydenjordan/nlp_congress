 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the PRO  Act.   The bill is nothing more than a payoff to union bosses at the expense  of the American workers and our businesses.   This bill would abolish States' right-to-work laws, like ours in  Tennessee. This would force workers to give money to unions from their  hard-earned paychecks, even if they don't want union representation.   Where do these union contributions end up?   Well, let me tell you: with left-wing political activist groups. $1.6  billion--and that is billion, with a B--in union member dues went to  these groups between 2010 and 2018 alone.   Last week, the Democrats passed a bill to direct tax dollars to  political campaigns. And if that wasn't enough, now they are trying to  force more workers to pay union dues so union bosses have more cash to  funnel as political donations to left-wing groups.   So let me ask you, America: Should Members of Congress be able to  tell others how to do their jobs and who can employ you? I think not.   This bill is just another progressive power grab, and American  workers and businesses deserve better.
