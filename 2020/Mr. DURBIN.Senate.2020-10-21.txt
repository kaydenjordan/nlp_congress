 Mr. President, late last night the news flash was:  Senator  [[Page S6341]]  McConnell, Republican leader of the U.S. Senate, opposes COVID-19  relief bill and informs the White House.   Supposedly, it was a statement made by Senator McConnell at his  Republican lunch yesterday, and it was later confirmed by four  Republican Senators who attended that that is what occurred.   Finally, it becomes public one of the things that has been suspected  for a long time on this side of the aisle. You see, most of us have  been paying close attention to the speeches by Senator McConnell to try  to gauge his interest in really coming back to help the American  people.   We remember on March 26, when 96 to 0--96 to 0--the Senate voted for  COVID relief in what was known as the CARES Act. It was a bipartisan  measure responding to a national pandemic that was just starting to  surface and an economy that was just starting to collapse.   Many people thought at the time that that would be the end of our  journey, that we would do what is necessary, and put it behind us. And  so the unemployment assistance, for example, ended on July 31 of this  year. The PPP--the Paycheck Protect Program--ended in the middle of  August. We were wrong.   The pandemic got dramatically worse, and the economy slumped even  further. Millions more were out of work. Thousands were dying. More  were infected. And we still are in a terrible battle now against this  deadly virus.   So the obvious solution was for Congress to come back and help again.  The first measure was good and I think helpful, but it wasn't enough.  We needed more.   So Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic Speaker of the House, 5 months ago--5  months ago--in May passed a COVID relief bill to follow on from the  original bill. She sent it over to Senator McConnell 5 months ago, and  he did nothing.   What he said was: I want to see if I feel a sense of urgency about  the need for this bill--a sense of urgency.   Well, today 220,000 Americans have died. Americans are dying at a  pace from this coronavirus that is unimaginable. Do you understand that  the death rate from COVID in America is 2\1/2\ times the death rate in  Canada? Do we realize the infection rate in the United States is five  times what it is than Canada or Germany? Do we understand that with 4.5  percent of the world's population, we lead in COVID deaths than  anywhere in the world?   The efforts to deal with COVID-19 have failed, and the American  people know it. They are tired of this way of living, with these masks,  but they know if they don't, they risk their health and the safety of  others. They want this economy to come back to life. They want the kids  to go back to school. But we can't move forward unless we have  leadership, No. 1, and that is what an election is all about; a plan,  No. 2; and the resources to implement it.   What are the resources that Senator McConnell believes are necessary  to deal with this? When it comes to testing, $16 billion for the  Nation--$16 billion.   We are currently testing 1 million people a day across the United  States. We should be testing 14 million people a day if we are serious  about contact tracing, if we are serious about reopening the economy.   So the Senator from Kentucky comes to the floor this morning and  talks about the obstructionism of Nancy Pelosi. Obstructionism? Five  months ago, she passed the COVID-19 relief bill and sent it to his  desk, and he never once brought it to the floor for debate or a vote-- not once. He mocks it and criticizes it day after day. He is afraid of  voting before the U.S. Senate. So he comes up with an elaborate  procedural scheme, which we will see in just a few minutes here, that  basically wants to put together his package for COVID relief, but his  package is missing so many key elements that we know will not respond  to this national crisis. It is the old story of a man 30 feet from  shore drowning, and someone stands by the shore and tosses him a 5-foot  rope. It doesn't work. It doesn't reach. It doesn't save him.   The Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, has told us that  if we don't do something, there will be a tragic result in the American  economy. If we pass a bill of the magnitude suggested by Speaker  Pelosi, we have a chance of recovering by the end of 2021. If we don't,  the Chairman of the Federal Reserve warns us--and others, as well--that  we will slump into an even worse recession, even more unemployment, and  even more businesses failing.   That appears to be what Senator McConnell is prepared to accept, but  we are not. Those of us set to deal with the real problems and  challenges for Americans realize we need more than an effort of  throwing a 5-foot rope to a man drowning 30 feet from shore. That is  the McConnell approach.   As we take a look at the elements that are missing in the McConnell  approach, they are lengthy. Virtually every State and local government  in the Nation has seen a downturn in revenue because the economy  contracted. We want to help these State and local governments survive  to be able to overcome the need to layoff healthcare workers, teachers,  firefighters, and police. That is what we believe, and that is what we  include in our bill, not in the McConnell bill.   Housing. There is no funding for housing or rental assistance in the  McConnell bill that he brought before us.   Economic stimulus. Remember the $1,200 checks? There are no direct  stimulus checks in the McConnell proposal. He says that we are holding  out to help the coastal elites. News flash, Senator McConnell: Coastal  elites don't qualify for these checks, nor should they. Ordinary people  do, and your bill doesn't help them.   On unemployment, Senator McConnell's bill cuts the benefits in half-- the Federal benefits for unemployment. Then he puts in this provision-- an incredible provision--that gives large companies immunity from  liability if they do not take the necessary steps to protect their  employees and customers. That is a high priority. The big shots do  pretty well in Senator McConnell's bill.   When it comes to testing, Senator McConnell is prepared to spend $16  billion, as I mentioned earlier. The bill we support has over $57  billion for hospitals and healthcare clinics and $75 billion for  testing.   Nutrition. Senator McConnell says we are just trying to help the  blue-State billionaires. I have news for him: They don't qualify for  SNAP benefits. And there is no SNAP benefit increase in the McConnell  bill. We believe there should be. People are standing in line at food  banks. America can do better.   Money to help the schools--we put more money into that than Senator  McConnell does.   There is help for the Postal Service, which has been hard-pressed by  the current state of the economy.   We also have the Paycheck Protection Program, which we all agree  needs to be there for small businesses.   I will just conclude by saying this. We have our chance now to work  together on a bipartisan basis to help people who are counting on us.  Senator McConnell's approach has to be rejected. It is just an effort  to find some cover politically so people can go home and say: Well, I  voted for something. Let's do something that makes a difference in the  lives of people and helps them. Let's deal with this coronavirus  directly and let's help those who are suffering from job loss and  struggling to make ends meet get through this crisis themselves. That  is the responsibility we face, and it is one that I think we should  face honestly.   I listened as my friend and colleague, Senator Thune, said that we  were holding America hostage with our position on the Democratic side.  We are not holding them hostage. It was Senator McConnell who refused  to participate in the negotiations and still does. We have a bipartisan  effort between the White House and Speaker Pelosi to solve this problem  and come together again as we did in March. It is time for us to do it.   The President may say he is tired of COVID, but America can't be  tired of COVID. We have to face it every single day and fight it every  day. The Senate and Congress should help.   I yield the floor.    I announce that the Senator from California (Ms. Harris),  the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. Manchin), and the Senator from  Arizona (Ms. Sinema) are necessarily absent.
