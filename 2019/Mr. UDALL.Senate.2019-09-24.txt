 Madam President, thank you for the recognition.   The Constitution demands that ``No Money shall be drawn from the  Treasury but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law.''   Like any other matter, it is Congress's power and responsibility to  determine how much taxpayer money is spent on the President's request  for a border wall.   Like most Presidents, he didn't get every dollar he wanted. Now the  President, through a sham national emergency declaration, is taking  $3.6 billion of funds we appropriated for military construction  projects to pay for his wall. The real question is not whether the  President is usurping our article I power to appropriate; he is, no  doubt about it. The real question is, Will we do something about it?   Today I urge all my colleagues to vote in favor of our resolution  terminating the President's national emergency declaration.   Madam President, starting off the debate, I ask unanimous consent to  have printed in the Record the following materials: a joint declaration  from former national security officials outlining why the President's  border emergency does not qualify under the National Emergencies Act  and a September 18, 2019, Washington Post article outlining the dire  outcomes warned by the Pentagon if the military construction projects  don't go forward.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:       Joint Declaration of Former United States Government Officials         We, the undersigned, declare as follows:        1. We are former officials in the U.S. government who have       worked on national security and homeland security issues from       the White House as well as agencies across the Executive       Branch. We have served in senior leadership roles in       administrations of both major political parties, and       collectively we have devoted a great many decades to       protecting the security interests of the United States. We       have held the highest security clearances, and we have       participated in the highest levels of policy deliberations on       a broad range of issues. These include: immigration, border       security, counterterrorism, military operations, and our       nation's relationship with other countries, including those       south of our border.

On February 15, 2019, the President declared a       ``national emergency'' for the purpose of diverting       appropriated funds from previously designated uses to build a       wall along the southern border. We are aware of no emergency       that remotely justifies such a step. The President's actions       are at odds with the overwhelming evidence in the public       record, including the administration's own data and       estimates. We have lived and worked through national       emergencies, and we support the President's power to mobilize       the Executive Branch to respond quickly in genuine national       emergencies. But under no plausible assessment of the       evidence is there a national emergency today that entitles       the President to tap into funds appropriated for other       purposes to build a wall at the southern border. To our       knowledge, the President's assertion of a national emergency       here is unprecedented, in that he seeks to address a       situation: (1) that has been enduring, rather than one that       has arisen suddenly; (2) that in fact has improved over time       rather than deteriorated; (3) by reprogramming billions of       dollars in funds in the face of clear congressional intent to       the contrary; and (4) with assertions that are rebutted not       just by the public record, but by his agencies' own official       data, documents, and statements.        3. Illegal border crossings are near forty-year lows. At       the outset, there is no evidence of a sudden or emergency       increase in the number of people seeking to cross the       southern border. According to the administration's own data,       the numbers of apprehensions and undetected illegal border       crossings at the southern border are near forty-year lows.       Although there was a modest increase in apprehensions in       2018, that figure is in keeping with the number of       apprehensions only two years earlier, and the overall trend       indicates a dramatic decline over the last fifteen years in       particular. The administration also estimates that       ``undetected unlawful entries'' at the southern border ``fell       from approximately 851,000 to nearly 62,000'' between fiscal       years 2006 to 2016, the most recent years for which data are       available. The United States currently hosts what is       estimated to be the smallest number of undocumented       immigrants since 2004. And in fact, in recent years, the       majority of currently undocumented immigrants entered the       United States legally, but overstayed their visas, a problem       that will not be addressed by the declaration of an emergency       along the southern border.        4. There is no documented terrorist or national security       emergency at the southern border. There is no reason to       believe that there is a terrorist or national security       emergency at the southern border that could justify the       President's proclamation.        a. This administration's own most recent Country Report on       Terrorism, released only five months ago, found that ``there       was no credible evidence indicating that international       terrorist groups have established bases in Mexico, worked       with Mexican drug cartels, or sent operatives via Mexico into       the United States.'' Since 1975, there has been only one       reported incident in which immigrants who had crossed the       southern border illegally attempted to commit a terrorist       act. That incident occurred more than twelve years ago, and       involved three brothers from Macedonia who had been brought       into the United States as children more than twenty years       earlier.        b. Although the White House has claimed, as an argument       favoring a wall at the southern border, that almost 4,000       known or suspected terrorists were intercepted at the       southern border in a single year, this assertion has since       been widely and consistently repudiated, including by this       administration's own Department of Homeland Security. The       overwhelming majority of individuals on terrorism watchlists       who were intercepted by U.S. Customs and Border Patrol were       attempting to travel to the United States by air; of the       individuals on the terrorist watchlist who were encountered       while entering the United States during fiscal year 2017,       only 13 percent traveled by land. And for those who have       attempted to enter by land, only a small fraction do so at       the southern border. Between October 2017 and March 2018,       forty-one foreign immigrants on the terrorist watchlist were       intercepted at the northern border. Only six such immigrants       were intercepted at the southern border.        5. There is no emergency related to violent crime at the       southern border. Nor can the administration justify its       actions on the grounds that the incidence of violent crime on       the southern border constitutes a national emergency. Factual       evidence consistently shows that unauthorized immigrants have       no special proclivity to engage in criminal or violent       behavior. According to a Cato Institute analysis of       criminological data, undocumented immigrants are 44 percent       less likely to be incarcerated nationwide than are native-      born citizens. And in Texas, undocumented immigrants were       found to have a first-time conviction rate 32 percent below       that of native-born Americans; the conviction rates of       unauthorized immigrants for violent crimes such as homicide       and sex offenses were also below those of native-born       Americans. Meanwhile, overall rates of violent crime in the       United States have declined significantly over the past 25       years, falling 49 percent from 1993 to 2017. And violent       crime rates in the country's 30 largest cities have decreased       on average by 2.7 percent in 2018 alone, further undermining       any suggestion that recent crime trends currently warrant the       declaration of a national emergency.        6. There is no human or drug trafficking emergency that can       be addressed by a wall at the southern border. The       administration has claimed that the presence of human and       drug trafficking at the border justifies its emergency       declaration. But there is no evidence of any such sudden       crisis at the southern border that necessitates a       reprogramming of appropriations to build a border wall.        a. The overwhelming majority of opioids that enter the       United States across a land border are carried through legal       ports of entry in personal or commercial vehicles, not       smuggled through unauthorized border crossings. A border wall       would not stop these drugs from entering the United States.       Nor would a wall stop drugs from entering via other routes,       including smuggling tunnels, which circumvent such physical       barriers as fences and walls, and international mail (which       is how high-purity fentanyl, for example, is usually shipped       from China directly to the United States).        b. Likewise, illegal crossings at the southern border are       not the principal source of human trafficking victims. About       two-thirds of human trafficking victims served by nonprofit       organizations that receive funding from the relevant       Department of Justice office are U.S. citizens, and even       among non-citizens, most trafficking victims usually arrive       in the country on valid visas. None of these instances of       trafficking could be addressed by a border wall. And the       three states with the highest per capita trafficking       reporting rates are not even located along the southern       border.        7. This proclamation will only exacerbate the humanitarian       concerns that do exist at the southern border. There are real       humanitarian concerns at the border, but they largely result       from the current administration's own deliberate policies       towards migrants. For example, the administration has used a       ``metering'' policy to turn away families fleeing extreme       violence and persecution in their home countries, forcing       them to wait indefinitely at the border to present their       asylum cases, and has adopted a number of other punitive       steps to restrict those seeking asylum at the southern       border. These actions have forced asylum-seekers to live on       the streets or in makeshift shelters and tent cities with       abysmal living conditions, and limited access to basic       sanitation has caused outbreaks of disease and death. This       state of affairs is a consequence of choices this       administration has made, and erecting a wall will do nothing       to ease the suffering of these people.        8. Redirecting funds for the claimed ``national emergency''       will undermine U.S. national security and foreign policy       interests. In the face of a nonexistent threat, redirecting       funds for the construction of a wall along the southern       border will undermine national security by needlessly pulling       resources from Department of Defense programs that are       responsible for keeping our troops and our country safe and       running effectively.        a. Repurposing funds from the defense construction budget       will drain money from critical defense infrastructure       projects, possibly including improvement of military       hospitals, construction of roads, and renovation of on-base       housing. And the proclamation will likely continue to divert       those armed forces already deployed at the southern border       from their usual training activities or missions, affecting       troop readiness.        b. In addition, the administration's unilateral,       provocative actions are heightening tensions with our       neighbors to the south, at a moment when we need their help       to address a range of Western Hemisphere concerns. These       actions are placing friendly governments to the south under       impossible pressures and driving partners away. They have       especially strained our diplomatic relationship with Mexico,       a relationship that is vital to regional efforts ranging from       critical intelligence and law enforcement partnerships to       cooperative efforts to address the growing tensions with       Venezuela. Additionally, the proclamation could well lead to       the degradation of the natural environment in a manner that       could only contribute to long-term socioeconomic and security       challenges.        c. Finally, by declaring a national emergency for domestic       political reasons with no compelling reason or justification       from his senior intelligence and law enforcement officials,       the President has further eroded his credibility with foreign       leaders, both friend and foe. Should a genuine foreign crisis       erupt, this lack of credibility will materially weaken this       administration's ability to marshal allies to support the       United States, and will embolden adversaries to oppose us.        9. The situation at the border does not require the use of       the armed forces, and a wall is unnecessary to support the       use of the armed forces. We understand that the       administration is also claiming that the situation at the       southern border ``requires use of the armed forces,'' and       that a wall is ``necessary to support such use'' of the armed       forces. These claims are implausible.        a. Historically, our country has deployed National Guard       troops at the border solely to assist the Border Patrol when       there was an extremely high number of apprehensions, together       with a particularly low number of Border Patrol agents. But       currently, even  [[Page S5655]]       with retention and recruitment challenges, the Border Patrol       is at historically high staffing and funding levels, and       apprehensions--measured in both absolute and per-agent       terms--are near historic lows.        b. Furthermore, the composition of southern border       crossings has shifted such that families and unaccompanied       minors now account for the majority of immigrants seeking       entry at the southern border; these individuals do not       present a threat that would need to be countered with       military force.        c. Just last month, when asked what the military is doing       at the border that couldn't be done by the Department of       Homeland Security if it had the funding for it, a top-level       defense official responded, ``[n]one of the capabilities that       we are providing [at the southern border] are combat       capabilities. It's not a war zone along the border.''       Finally, it is implausible that hundreds of miles of wall       across the southern border are somehow necessary to support       the use of armed forces. We are aware of no military- or       security-related rationale that could remotely justify such       an endeavor.        10. There is no basis for circumventing the appropriations       process with a declaration of a national emergency at the       southern border. We do not deny that our nation faces real       immigration and national security challenges. But as the       foregoing demonstrates, these challenges demand a thoughtful,       evidence-based strategy, not a manufactured crisis that rests       on falsehoods and fearmongering. In a briefing before the       Senate Intelligence Committee on January 29, 2019, less than       one month before the Presidential Proclamation, the Directors       of the CIA, DNI, FBI, and NSA testified about numerous       serious current threats to U.S. national security, but none       of the officials identified a security crisis at the U.S.-      Mexico border. In a briefing before the House Armed Services       Committee the next day, Pentagon officials acknowledged that       the 2018 National Defense Strategy does not identify the       southern border as a security threat. Leading legislators       with access to classified information and the President's own       statements have strongly suggested, if not confirmed, that       there is no evidence supporting the administration's claims       of an emergency. And it is reported that the President made       the decision to circumvent the appropriations process and       reprogram money without the Acting Secretary of Defense       having even started to consider where the funds might come       from, suggesting an absence of consultation and internal       deliberations that in our experience are necessary and       expected before taking a decision of this magnitude.        11. For all of the foregoing reasons, in our professional       opinion, there is no factual basis for the declaration of a       national emergency for the purpose of circumventing the       appropriations process and reprogramming billions of dollars       in funding to construct a wall at the southern border, as       directed by the Presidential Proclamation of February 15,       2019.

The warnings are contained in Defense Department budget       requests sent to lawmakers in recent years. They include       potentially hazardous living conditions for troops and their       families, as well as unsafe schools that would impede       learning. In numerous cases, the Defense Department warned       that lives would be put at risk if buildings don't meet the       military's standards for fire safety or management of       explosives.        Even before $3.6 billion in construction funding was pulled       to support a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, military       buildings across the country often had been neglected in       favor of other priorities. The defense spending limits that       took effect after a 2013 budget deal designed to end a       government shutdown starved the military's construction       budget for years, officials and analysts say, meaning many       construction projects are long overdue.        The details in the budget documents--annual requests the       Pentagon sends to Capitol Hill that are mostly public--      underscore the risky trade-offs Trump made in declaring a       national emergency that allowed him to divert funding for the       wall.        A Pentagon spokesman did not immediately respond to a       message seeking comment.        In requests to Congress over the past three years, military       officials describe dilapidated World War II-era warehouses       with ``leaking asbestos panel roof systems,'' a drone pilot       training facility with sinkholes and a bat infestation,       explosives being stored in buildings that didn't meet safety       standards and a mold-infested middle school. In numerous       instances, Defense Department officials wrote that the       infrastructure problems were hurting the military's readiness       and impeding the department's national security mission.        Democrats and some Republicans strongly oppose the       emergency declaration. The Senate is expected to vote for a       second time in the coming weeks to overturn it, but Congress       does not appear to have enough votes to overcome Trump's veto       of such a disapproval resolution.        A list of the military construction projects being defunded       to pay for the wall was released in early September. But it       did not contain details of the Pentagon's explanations to       Congress about why the projects were needed--and what would       happen if they were not completed. The Washington Post's       review of the budget documents is the first attempt to detail       those Pentagon warnings.        The Post uncovered budget documents pertaining to 29 of the       43 military construction projects in the mainland United       States--not including those in territories such as Puerto       Rico and Guam--that are being canceled to pay for the wall.       The review excluded two projects that had been canceled       before the emergency authorization. Many of these documents       are publicly available but have not been previously reported.        The Pentagon insists that the projects are merely being       delayed, not canceled, and Republicans say they will try to       ``backfill'' the money in question, but Democrats oppose that       strategy. In recent days, the fight over the border wall       money has caused angry divisions among lawmakers trying to       write annual spending bills to keep the government running,       raising the specter of another shutdown this year. Last       winter's record-long 35-day partial government shutdown ended       only after Trump declared a national emergency because       Congress wouldn't give him all the money he wanted for his       wall. (During his campaign, Trump repeatedly vowed that       Mexico would pay for the construction.)        Congressional Democrats have rallied around the issue,       decrying unsafe conditions in their home districts and       nationwide.        ``We see across the country--communities, military bases       and people in the military--saying, `Taking away this money       hurts us,' '' Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (N.Y.) said       on the Senate floor this week. ``All the Democrats are asking       for is to protect the troops from having their resources       robbed for a border wall--resources that Congress said should       go to the military.''        Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) said ``it shocks me that, as       commander in chief, [Trump] now insists that it's got to be       our troops, our military families and our nation's security       that have to be sacrificed for his foolishness,'' noting that       $77 million had been ``raided'' from projects in his state.                               Ominous warnings         This month, the Pentagon announced that 127 military       construction projects stood to lose funding to pay for       Trump's wall. Although Pentagon officials have expressed       confidence that the projects ultimately will go forward,       there is no guarantee that they will.        In many cases, the Pentagon has been ominous in describing       the potential outcomes should the projects not happen.        The Air Force has been seeking a new training facility for       drone pilots at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico because       the current training facility had sinkholes and a bat       infestation.        It also prevents pilot trainees from operating in a       classified environment, the Air Force wrote in its publicly       accessible budget request. This means trainees could not use       a safety system designed to alert drone pilots to the       location of ground-based personnel, as well as a separate       system designed to prevent aircraft from crashing into one       another.        The Air Force has been seeking a new control center at Hill       Air Force Base in Utah, designed to replace a pair of       ``dilapidated WWII-era warehouses'' used for air traffic       control and mission control operations even though they have       been labeled ``structurally deficient'' and don't meet       regulations. The Air Force noted in its budget request that       air traffic control equipment is at risk of being destroyed       by ``roof leaks from failing asbestos panel roof systems.''        If the $28 million project is not finished, the Air Force       warned in 2017, service members will continue to operate in       ``aging dilapidated buildings that were never intended for       the purpose they are now serving.''        The Air National Guard has been seeking to replace the       aircraft parking ramp at a New Orleans facility, which abuts       a public roadway. This means munitions-loaded aircraft--which       are kept on alert so they can be scrambled quickly in the       event of a terrorist attack--expose the public to the       ``unacceptable risk'' of being affected by an explosive       accident, the Air Force wrote in 2018. An Air Force analysis       calculated that members of  [[Page S5656]]       the public are inside the jets' ``explosive arc'' for about       3,800 hours per year as they pass by the base.        In addition, the shelters that hold the aircraft when they       aren't parked on the runway are on concrete slabs that are       sinking, causing pipes and electrical connections to pull       loose. The shelters also did not have fire protections, the       Defense Department wrote in 2018.        The Defense Department also warned that overly       decentralized weapons maintenance buildings in Anniston,       Ala., would continue to increase the risk of accidents       because of the ``unnecessary movement of artillery pieces.''        The Air Force has been seeking $41 million to repair a       central heat power plant boiler at Eielson Air Force Base in       Alaska. The Air Force warned in its budget justification to       Congress that the boiler, installed in 1951, is expected to       fail within the next several years at a base where winter       temperatures can plunge as low as 65 degrees below zero. That       outcome ``would be devastating to facilities and the missions       housed in those facilities,'' the Air Force said. The base       could be forced to evacuate, and the facilities would then       freeze and require ``many millions of dollars'' to make them       usable again.        The system in question is one of two 1950s-era boilers that       require urgent replacement at Eielson. The failure of the       other one is described as ``imminent'' and also could force       an evacuation, followed by a deep freeze that would cost       millions of dollars to recover from, according to the Air       Force's description from 2017.                           `Substandard,' `unsafe'         A different issue looms at Camp Lejeune, N.C., where       medical and dental care is provided in ``substandard,       inefficient, decentralized and uncontrolled facilities,''       according to the military, which has sought congressional       approval to build a new ambulatory care center on the base.       Not doing so ``will result in compromised readiness,       uncoordinated care delivery, and inappropriate use of medical       resources,'' the Pentagon said.        At Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort in South Carolina, the       military sought funding to build a satellite fire station,       without which ``personnel . . . will continue to work from a       significantly undersized and unsafe facility.''        In another example, the military is seeking to repair a       middle school at Fort Campbell in Kentucky, a project that       has been championed by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell       (R-Ky.) and that he has vowed to protect even after its       appearance on the list of installations at risk of being       canceled to pay for Trump's wall.        The Pentagon described conditions at the middle school as       ``substandard'' and told lawmakers in requesting $62.6       million to repair it that ``the continued use of deficient,       inadequate, and undersized facilities that do not accommodate       the current student population will continue to impair the       overall education program for students.''        At Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, meanwhile, construction       of a much-needed new child-care center has been put on hold       in favor of Trump's wall. The Pentagon notes that the       facility ``has suffered from sewage backups, heating,       ventilation and air conditioning failures and mold and pest       management issues.'' The upgraded facility is supposed to       accommodate 165 children and staff members. As of February       2018, 115 children were on a waiting list to get in.        Joint Base Andrews is also home to the hangar that holds       Air Force One. That hangar is being relocated at a cost of       $154 million to accommodate a larger Boeing model now being       used for Trump. But the new hangar displaces a specialized       area designed for unloading hazardous cargo and a separate       disposal range where Air Force officials could be trained to       defuse bombs. The Air Force requested $37 million for a new       hazardous-cargo pad and explosive-ordnance center, but that       project has been included on the list of those being canceled       to pay for the barrier along the border. The Air Force One       hangar project was left untouched.        As a result, a temporary facility will be provided. But not       replacing the hazardous-cargo pad would cause ``enduring       systemic weaknesses'' at the base, while the lack of an       explosive-ordinance range would ``adversely impact''       training, which would have to happen somewhere off the base       at greater cost, the military said.    Madam President, with that, I yield to Senator Murray.    Madam President, I very much appreciate being joined on  the floor by my colleagues at this critical time in history. Senator  Shaheen just spoke. We also had Senator Murray and Senator Leahy down  here.   This issue will come to a head tomorrow. We are really at a  crossroads. This body can continue to allow the President to subvert  our constitutional authority to appropriate, or we can take back our  power of the purse and exercise it as the Founders intended. The issue  before us is not partisan; it is constitutional. If we don't put the  Constitution above party, above politics, we might as well pack up our  bags and go home. The voters did not send us here to shirk our  responsibilities. History will not be kind to us if we allow the  Executive to run roughshod over our constitutional authority.   For the second time, we have introduced a bipartisan resolution to  terminate the President's national emergency declaration along our  southern border. I thank Senators Collins and Shaheen for once again  joining this resolution and affirming their commitment to the  Constitution.   Our first vote on this resolution in March passed 59 to 41. We had  strong bipartisan support because the President's emergency declaration  is clearly an end run around Congress. We have the power to bring this  resolution back every 6 months. I hope we can add to our majority this  time because what were once fears about a so-called emergency in March  have become a stark reality in September.   While I firmly oppose the President's approach on immigration, this  vote is not about whether you oppose or support that approach. In  March, a Republican Senator wrote in conviction about the President's  emergency declaration:         It is my responsibility to be a steward of the article I       branch, to preserve the separation of powers and to curb the       kind of executive overreach that Congress has allowed to       fester for the better part of the past century. I stood by       that principle during the Obama administration, and I stand       by it now.    We all have another opportunity to stand with the Constitution and to  object to a President actively diverting billions in defense funding  for a political purpose. Congress, not the President, was given the  power of the purse to make sure taxpayer money was spent on projects  with broad public support.   We have different views in Congress, but as a whole, we have  responded to the American people, and we have not appropriated all the  funds the President has sought for his wall. But instead of allowing  Congress to decide on spending, which is what the Constitution  envisions, the President caused the longest shutdown in American  history to get his wall. That 35-day shutdown caused a lot of pain and  anxiety for many Federal workers and contractors and their families in  New Mexico and across the Nation. When the shutdown didn't work, the  President issued his emergency declaration.   If we allow this President to issue an emergency declaration to get  funding for his wall, we will be setting a dangerous precedent--a  precedent that could be used by future Presidents on issues my  Republican colleagues surely wouldn't like.    The President is now taking $3.6 billion from 127 military  construction projects that we have approved and funded. We all know the  rigor with which these projects have been vetted, scrutinized, and  approved. According to the Pentagon, these projects are necessary for  national security and military readiness, necessary to ensure the  safety of our men and women in uniform and their children. In other  words, they are not projects simply designed to fulfill a campaign  slogan.   Two projects in New Mexico are on the chopping block, and both are  critical. One is an $85 million drone pilot training center at Holloman  Air Force Base to replace a facility that is falling apart, and the  other is a $40 million secure information technology facility at White  Sands Missile Range. Both of those are gone.   In Utah, the Air Force has sought a new control center at Hill Air  Force Base to replace ``structurally deficient, dilapidated World War  II-era warehouses'' for mission control.   In Louisiana, the Air National Guard sought to replace an aircraft  parking ramp in a New Orleans facility that exposes the public to  ``unacceptable risks'' of being impacted by an explosive accident.   In Indiana, Army servicemembers have worked in violation of safety  standards for handling explosives and need additional space from  munitions.   In Kentucky, the military seeks to repair substandard, deficient,  inadequate, and undersized facilities at a majority school at Fort  Campbell that impairs the overall education program for the children of  servicemembers.   Back in March, we worried that this would happen, but now it is a  reality. Our men and women in uniform and their children are paying for  the wall. And if we do not stand up and stop it today, it will happen  again and again. This is unacceptable, and I believe it is unlawful and  unconstitutional. We here in the Senate have decided to fund these  projects and others in 23 States instead of a border wall, and with  good reason.   Some in Congress are calling for us to backfill 127 projects and  reappropriate the funds for them. Backfilling does not solve the  problem. It does not repair the constitutional violation. It only gives  license to the President to continue raiding funds we have already  appropriated for military construction projects. Unless we stop the  emergency, the backfilled money will be subject to being raided again.  If your house is robbed, it is foolish to buy new valuables without  putting a new lock on the door.   Canceling these 127 projects is not just a one-off; we all know the  President fully intends to keep it. It has already been reported that  if the President doesn't get the $5 billion he has requested for his  wall in 2020, the administration plans to take another $3.6 billion  from the Pentagon's construction budget.  [[Page S5659]]    I will come back in a minute.   I yield to the majority leader.    Madam President, we are at a crucial point in our  democracy, with a big decision to be made. Tomorrow, we can correct  this unconstitutional violation by the President of the United States  of taking military money, military readiness money, national security  money, and moving it over for a border wall.   Canceling these 127 projects is not just a one-off. Let's remember  that. We all know the President fully intends to keep at it. It has  already been reported that if the President doesn't get the $5 billion  he has requested for his wall in 2020, the next budget year, the  administration plans to take another $3.6 billion from the Pentagon's  construction budget. This President will not stop raiding funds we have  appropriated, unless we stop him and terminate his sham emergency  declaration.   The careful planning for the 127 canceled projects contrasts sharply  with the administration's haphazard rush to build the President's wall.  The President wants 500 miles of wall before the 2020 election. To do  so, the administration may need to skirt the Federal procurement  process and aggressively take lands away from private landowners  through eminent domain.   Don't worry, says the President to his staff: I will pardon you if  you break any laws.   This is no way to run a government, and, certainly, no way to spend  taxpayer dollars.   Don't get me wrong. I support strong border security. We need well- trained officers, mobile assets, surveillance technology, and adequate  resources. But a multibillion dollar wall is wasteful, ineffective, and  offensive.   Now, I know some in this Chamber disagree with that opinion. The  place to debate and decide how we spend taxpayer dollars to keep our  border secure is in the Appropriations Committee, its various  subcommittees, and on the floor of the Senate. That is what the  Constitution says.   James Madison wrote in Federalist 84: ``An elective despotism was not  the government we fought for; but one in which the powers of government  should be so divided and balanced . . . that no one could transcend  their legal limits without being effectually checked and restrained by  the others.''   It is time for this body to check and restrain the executive branch.  The President is invading our constitutional prerogative. He is not a  despot. His constitutional powers are limited. It is up to us to  support and defend the Constitution of the United States, as we swore  an oath to do, and to do the work we were elected to do.   Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
