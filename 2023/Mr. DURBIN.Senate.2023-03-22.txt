 Madam President, today, the Senate voted to  confirm Judge Gordon Gallagher, nominated to the U.S. District Court  for the District of Colorado.   Judge Gallagher earned his B.A. from Macalester College and his J.D.  from the University of Denver College of Law. After graduating from law  school, he began a litigation career focused on criminal work. He spent  a year with Underhill & Underhill, P.C., and then joined the Mesa  County District Attorney's Office, where he prosecuted a wide range of  felonies and misdemeanors. Judge Gallagher later entered solo legal  practice, focusing on criminal defense work. During this time, he  served as a contract attorney with Alternate Defense Counsel, which  provides representation to indigent defendants when the local public  defender is conflicted out of a matter. In total, he has tried  approximately 275 cases to verdict, including 250 jury trials.   While remaining a practicing attorney, Judge Gallagher also serves as  a part-time Federal magistrate judge for the District of Colorado, a  position he has held since 2012. In this role, Judge Gallagher has  presided over approximately a dozen criminal misdemeanor and petty  offense bench trials. He also supervises the District's pro se intake  division, helping to expedite consideration and resolution of pro se  matters. Judge Gallagher was unanimously rated ``well qualified'' by  the ABA and received a bipartisan vote in committee. He has the strong  support of his home State Senators--Mr. Bennet and Mr. Hickenlooper-- and the Colorado legal and law enforcement community.   Given his significant trial experience and deep knowledge of Western  Colorado, I strongly support the nomination of Judge Gallagher and am  glad to see him confirmed.   (At the request of Mr. Schumer, the following statement was ordered  to be printed in the Record.)                            ____________________     Madam President; I was necessarily absent for  rollcall vote No. 63, motion to proceed to S.316, a bill to repeal the  authorizations for use of military force against Iraq.
