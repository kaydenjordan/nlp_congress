 Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize our men and  women in law enforcement and their commitment to public safety.  [[Page H2388]]    I especially recognize and thank our Federal law enforcement officers  on the island and the almost 12,000 members of the Puerto Rico Police  Bureau, as well as all municipal police officers across the island of  Puerto Rico.   Their courage, dedication, and tireless efforts to serve and protect  our communities are truly admirable and do not go unnoticed.   I also honor the memory of all law enforcement officers who have died  in the line of duty. We will never forget, and we are in debt to their  sacrifice and that of their families.   As we commemorate National Police Week, I am committed to continue  working with my colleagues to ensure Congress is providing our law  enforcement officers the necessary support and resources, including  through grant programs such as the COPS hiring program, Operation  Stonegarden, and the Byrne Justice Assistance Program.                            ____________________
