 President Ronald Reagan once said, ``Within the covers of  the Bible are the answers for all the problems men face.''   The Bible has provided our Nation with wisdom and guidance over our  history. Within this Chamber, Members of Congress have gathered to  debate and ultimately address the most significant challenges to our  country.   Since 1962, we have worked under those simple, yet powerful words,  the words etched behind me, ``In God We Trust.''   Without God's direction, we would have faced these challenges alone.  As we face the future, we must never forget that our Nation was founded  on biblical principles, recognizing that we are blessed to live in a  country that we can worship freely, and we must work to see that we  always remain ``one nation under God.''   Proverbs 3:5-6: ``Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and lean not  on your own understanding; in all your ways acknowledge Him, and He  will make your paths straight.''   My hope is that all Americans will continue to live by the truth and  wisdom found in the word of God. May God continue to bless the United  States of America.
