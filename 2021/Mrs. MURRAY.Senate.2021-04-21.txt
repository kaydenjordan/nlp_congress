 Madam President, reserving the right to object, I  understand the position of my colleagues from Alaska and Florida who  want to see a return to cruising by July 4. I am there with them. The  cruise industry in my home State supports over 5,500 jobs and creates  $900 million in annual local business revenue. Those jobs and that  impact on the local economy have been severely disrupted, but we have  to ensure the safety of our friends and our families on these cruises  before they disembark.   We have seen firsthand how devastating COVID outbreaks on cruise  ships can be. Just last year, we saw thousands of passengers stranded  on cruise ships--people put in quarantine or refused entry to ports as  borders closed.   Over 31 million Americans have contracted COVID, and 560,000 have  died  [[Page S2110]]  from this disease. Cruise ships require specific focus and protocols in  place to prevent future outbreaks.   While I am as eager as anyone else to see a return to travel, we  cannot cut corners. Doing so risks lives and will only further delay  returning to normal, hurting our economy more in the long run.   We must trust the science, and we must allow the CDC to continue its  work to help us return to what we love as safely as possible.   So I will continue to work with the CDC and the administration as  they develop the next phase of their cruising guidance, but for now, I  object.
