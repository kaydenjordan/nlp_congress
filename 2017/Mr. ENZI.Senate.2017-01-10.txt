 Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Wyoming, the  doctor, the Senator who has been involved in health care all of his  adult life and particularly since he got to the Senate. He has been  looking at alternatives to what we have and will play an intricate part  in any replacement that we do.    We know what the problems are, and we are in the land of denial right  now with the Democrats making speeches about the fearmongering of what  might be changed. This isn't the point at which it gets changed. This  is the point at which it gets set up so that it can be changed, and I  look forward to actually doing the repeal and the replacement under the  guidance of Senator Barrasso from Wyoming.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 52 and ask unanimous  consent that it be reported by number.    Mr. President, I don't think that is exactly what this is  about. This amendment is corrosive to the privilege of the budget  resolution, meaning it is outside of the scope of what is appropriate  for a budget resolution. Any inappropriate amendment could be fatal to  the privilege of this resolution, which would destroy our efforts to  repeal ObamaCare.   In other words, a vote in favor of this amendment is a vote against  repealing ObamaCare. In addition, this amendment is not germane to this  budget resolution. This budget resolution is much more focused than a  typical budget resolution. The Congressional Budget Act requires that  amendments to a budget resolution be germane. Since this amendment does  not meet the standard required by budget law, a point of order would  lie; as such, I raise a point of order under section 305(b)(2) of the  Congressional Budget Act of 1974.    Mr. President, I want to thank the Senator from Tennessee,  Mr. Alexander, who is also the chairman of the Health Committee--that  is, the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee--for the  succinct speech that he gave. I will be encouraging everybody on both  sides of the aisle to read that speech. I know that many were not here  to listen. But it is a fault that we have in this Chamber. We often  speak to an empty Chamber.   But it is all recorded thanks to the people who do that for a job.  You placed that so well that there should not be much doubt about what  we are going to try to do. You heard it from the chairman of the Health  Committee. He is the one that will be in charge of the health aspects  of this.   The Finance Committee is a part of the bill too. But they are in  charge of the monetary part of this. But without the health care part,  that does not work. I love the way you expressed that in the way of  taking care of a collapsed bridge, because I think people across  America do realize that the bridge on health care has collapsed and  they want to know what we are going to do about it.   You stated that very well. That should relax a lot of people. It  probably won't because of the process that we are in, but I certainly  hope that it does. So I thank you for your words and your effort and  know that it is in good hands as we lead it through this process.   All that this resolution we are doing right now does is set it up so  that this can be done. This really does not change any health care at  this point. It sets it up so that we can do reconciliation, so that we  can repeal what we can, so we can replace what we can, and then we can  set up that system of bridges that will get us to the point where all  Americans who want insurance can have insurance, but more importantly,  so that all Americans can get the health care they need and deserve.   I thank the Senator for his comments.    Mr. President, I only need to add one footnote to that  fantastic summary; that is, that the Senator from Tennessee is the  chairman of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. For  years we heard about the difficulties with No Child Left Behind. There  were a lot of efforts to build a different bridge, and they never got  completed within the timeframe that was necessary, even though both  sides recognized there was a problem.    The Senator from Tennessee undertook that, got bipartisan solutions  on it, and put forward a bill that did kind of what we are talking  about with ObamaCare. It sent it back to the States. It got rid of the  national school boards, and that passed, I think, with 88 votes in the  Senate. That is very bipartisan. That is the kind of an effort he puts  forth. You can tell from the comments he has made about what we need to  do that he has that well in mind, and I am certain some from the other  side will join us to make sure we can get that done as well.   I thank the Senator, and I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum, and I ask unanimous consent that  the time be equally divided.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate be  in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak  therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I have five requests for committees to meet  during today's session of the Senate. They have the approval of the  Majority and Minority leaders.   Pursuant to Rule XXVI, paragraph 5(a), of the Standing Rules of the  Senate, the following committees are authorized to meet during today's  session of the Senate:                         committee on armed services    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on Armed  Services be authorized to meet during the session of the Senate on  January 10, 2017, at 9:30 a.m.           committee on homeland security and governmental affairs    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on Homeland  Security and Governmental Affairs be authorized to meet during the  session of the Senate on January 10, 2017, at 3:30 p.m.                          committee on the judiciary    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on the  Judiciary be authorized to meet during the session of the Senate on  January 10, 2017, at 9:30 a.m., in room SR-325 of the Russell Senate  Office Building, to conduct a hearing entitled ``Attorney General  Nomination.''                       select committee on intelligence    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Select Committee on  Intelligence be authorized to meet during the session of the Senate on  January 10, 2017, at 1 p.m. in room SD-106 of the Senate Dirksen Office  Building.                   permanent subcommittee on investigations    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Permanent  Subcommittee on Investigations of the Committee on Homeland Security  and Governmental Affairs be authorized to meet during the session of  the Senate on January 10, 2017, at 10 a.m., to conduct a hearing  entitled, ``Backpage.com's Knowing Facilitation of Online Sex  Trafficking.''                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate  completes its business today, it adjourn until 12 noon, Wednesday,  January 11; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the morning  hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date,  and the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the  day; finally, that following leader remarks, the Senate resume  consideration of S. Con. Res. 3, with 3 hours of debate remaining on  the resolution for the majority and 3 hours for the minority.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order, following the remarks of Senator Brown.    I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of the quorum.
