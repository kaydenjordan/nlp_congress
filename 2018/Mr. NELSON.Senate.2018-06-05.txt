 Mr. President, I was necessarily absent for the June 4,  2018, vote on the motion to invoke cloture on Executive Calendar No.  542, the nomination of Robert Earl Wier, of Kentucky, to be United  States district judge for the Eastern District of Kentucky. I would  have voted yea.                            ____________________
