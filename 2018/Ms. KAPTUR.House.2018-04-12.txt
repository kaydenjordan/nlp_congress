 Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member for yielding.   This phony balanced budget amendment is an old, sad Republican rerun.  The only real answer to deficits is responsible budgets. America  doesn't need this phony constitutional amendment meant to cover up  Presidents' and congressional Republicans' failure to produce a  balanced budget, even for 1 year when they hold all the reins of power.   If Republicans actually cared about the national debt, they wouldn't  have passed their tax giveaway last year that will add more than $1.8  trillion to the deficit over the next decade.   Whoa, $1.8 trillion more debt held by the public will approach 100  percent of gross domestic product by 2028. That is economic roulette.  The deficit just rises. It kind of reminds me of President Trump being  in the casino business and bankrupting them.   Our country hasn't seen this level of debt since just after World War  II, when the debt-to-GDP ratio hit an all-time high. That is 1946; this  is 2018.   Couple that with the ballooning U.S. trade deficit, which represents  the gap between foreign imports versus U.S. exports, now reaching over  half a trillion dollars every year in the red, half of that coming from  unfair trade with China.   If this corrosive pattern of financial abandon and foreign borrowing  continues, at some point in the near future, foreign interests will  view America's financial subservience to them as a strategic victory.   Sadly, the Republican pattern of tax giveaways to the rich while  racking up huge Federal deficits is not new. Republican Donald Trump's  mammoth deficits remind me of Republican Ronald Reagan's gaping  deficits, which Democrat Bill Clinton had to rein in during the 1990s.   Then-Republican President George W. Bush, post-September 11, pulled  America into unending wars and never paid those bills. When the  terrible financial crash of 2008 hit from that Republican abandon,  Americans paid an enormous price for that, and our economy was finally  pulled out with the rigor of President Obama and Democrats in this  Congress.   Mr. Speaker, the balanced budget amendment is a ridiculous sham. It  is a transparent attempt and a very thin cover for Republicans to  protect themselves during the coming midterm elections. The Republican  Party is the party of red ink.   I can guarantee you, the American people deserve better, and that  change is coming.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of nearly 50  million baby boomers ready for retirement.   This week is National Retirement Planning Week. Let me emphasize two  earned benefits that have done more to grant security and peace in  retirement than any other: Medicare and Social Security. If future  generations are to reap their retirement security, our generation must  ensure their solvency. And if we only talk retirement with seniors, we  fall seriously short.   Although nearly half of all baby boomers say they have $100,000 or  less saved, and their Social Security is critical to their survival,  half of Generation Xers have less than $10,000 saved. Given the  financial pressures on millennials, they could end up in precarious  situations.   Congress must show real leadership on this issue; and the somber  reality is more Americans than ever are shouldering the burden of  financing retirement alone. As a society, Congress also must prioritize  financial literacy and education, beginning with young students in  schools. We must equip everyone to start small nest eggs that can grow  over the decades into what I call Social Security Plus.   Thank you to the National Retirement Planning Coalition, whose  fantastic online resources are available to Americans free of charge.  That is the National Retirement Planning Coalition, free of charge, to  all Americans. Let's get to work for security for our retirees, not  just this generation, but those to come.                            ____________________
