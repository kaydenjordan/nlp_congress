 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to make it clear that treason  is not a laughing matter. It is a serious crime embedded in the  Constitution, punishable by death. But since your Commander in Chief  chose to raise it at a political rally, let's have a discussion about  treason.   Is it treason for a Presidential campaign to meet with a hostile  foreign power to sell out our democracy and rig the election?   Is it treason for a Presidential campaign to meet with Russian spies  who promised information that was negative about a political opponent  and then failed to report that meeting to law enforcement officials?   Is it treason for your former National Security Adviser to be a  Russian asset sitting at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue doing the bidding of  Vladimir Putin?   How dare you lecture us about treason. This is not a dictatorship. It  is a democracy, and we do not have to stand for a reality show host  masquerading as President of the United States of America.
