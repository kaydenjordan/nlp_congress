 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding the time.   Madam Speaker, and still I rise. I rise tonight to take a stand on  behalf of the pro-choice movement and women who have had to make the  choice, women who have had to make this tough decision, this choice.   Let's get the record straight. Henceforth and forevermore, let it be  known that you are either pro-choice or you are anti-choice.   It is easy to be anti-choice when you don't have to make the choice.  It is easy to be anti-choice when it is not your wife who was raped. It  is easy to be anti-choice when it is not your daughter who has had the  incestuous relationship, without her permission, I always say. But even  with her permission, it is wrong.   It is easy to make the choice when it is not your child or your wife.  You can be anti-choice then. But I only wonder how many persons who  have been anti-choice, when confronted with having to make this choice,  became pro-choice. We will never know. You can be anti-choice before  the public and then pro-choice when it serves your purpose.   I sincerely believe, Madam Speaker and Mrs. Fletcher, that the long  arm of the law has no place in a woman's womb. This is not where the  law belongs. This is the property of a woman, and she should make these  decisions herself with those who she has trust in, those who care for  her, those who she believes will help her to come to the right  conclusions.   I stand for those who are pro-choice. For those who are anti-choice,  I say: Thank God you have not had to make the choice.
