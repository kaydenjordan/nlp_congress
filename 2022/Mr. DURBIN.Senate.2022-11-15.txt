 Mr. President, today the Senate is poised to confirm  another  [[Page S6682]]  outstanding judicial nominee, Maria Antongiorgi-Jordan, nominated to  the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico.   Ms. Antongiorgi-Jordan is a dedicated public servant and accomplished  litigator who will be a tremendous asset to the District of Puerto  Rico.   After earning her B.A. from Seton Hill University, her J.D. from the  Interamerican University School of Law, and her L.L.M. from Georgetown  University Law Center, Ms. Antongiorgi-Jordan began her legal career at  McConnell Valdes, a law firm based in San Juan, PR.   For nearly 20 years, Ms. Antongiorgi-Jordan had a wide-ranging  litigation practice within the firm. While she focused on complex civil  matters, she also was active in criminal defense work through the local  Criminal Justice Act--CJA--panel, representing indigent criminal  defendants in Federal court.   In total, Ms. Antongiorgi-Jordan participated in 42 trials, serving  as chief or cochief counsel in 36 of the 42.   Today, Ms. Antongiorgi-Jordan serves as clerk of the court for the  District of Puerto Rico. In that role, she has helped the court  navigate the COVID-19 pandemic and kept it functioning on a day-to-day  basis.   Ms. Antongiorgi-Jordan boasts widespread support from the Puerto Rico  legal community and civic leaders, including Governor Pedro Pierluisi  and Stephen Muldrow, the Trump-appointed U.S. Attorney in Puerto Rico.   I will support Ms. Antongiorgi-Jordan's confirmation, and I urge my  colleagues to do the same.                            ____________________     I announce that the Senator from Georgia (Mr. Warnock) is  necessarily absent.    I announce that the Senator from Georgia (Mr. Warnock) is  necessarily absent.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 5098         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Senator Paul Simon Study       Abroad Program Act of 2022''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress makes the following findings:        (1) To prepare students for success in the modern global       economy, opportunities for study abroad should be included as       part of a well-rounded education.        (2) Study abroad programs provide students with       unparalleled access to international knowledge, an unmatched       opportunity to learn foreign languages, and a unique       environment for developing cultural understanding, all of       which are knowledge and skills needed in today's global       economy.        (3) Only 10 percent of United States college students study       abroad before they graduate, leaving 90 percent of graduates       entering the workforce without the global skills, knowledge,       and experiences afforded by study abroad programs that will       position them for success in the global economy. Minority       students, first-generation college students, community       college students, and students with disabilities are also       significantly underrepresented in study abroad participation.        (4) Congress authorized the establishment of the Commission       on the Abraham Lincoln Study Abroad Fellowship Program       (referred to in this section as the ``Lincoln Commission'')       under section 104 of the Miscellaneous Appropriations and       Offsets Act, 2004 (division H of Public Law 108-199).       Pursuant to its mandate, the Lincoln Commission submitted a       report to Congress and to the President containing its       recommendations for greatly expanding the opportunity for       students at institutions of higher education in the United       States to study abroad, with special emphasis on studying in       developing nations.        (5) According to the Lincoln Commission, ``[e]xperience       shows that leadership from administrators and faculty will       drive the number of study abroad participants higher and       improve the quality of programs. Such leadership is the only       way that study abroad will become an integral part of the       undergraduate experience.'' A competitive grant program is       necessary to encourage and support such leadership.        (6) Student health, safety, and security while studying       abroad is, and must continue  [[Page S6698]]       to be, a priority for institutions of higher education and       study abroad programs.        (7) The COVID-19 pandemic has limited or prevented students       from participating in study abroad due to travel restrictions       and reduced budgets. In the post-pandemic world, increasing       access to study abroad for students at institutions of higher       education throughout the United States will be critical to       ensuring that those students gain the skills, knowledge, and       experiences necessary to maintain the leadership of the       United States in tackling global challenges, such as       pandemics, and succeeding in a global economy.       SEC. 3. PURPOSES.         The purposes of this Act are--        (1) to ensure that significantly more students have access       to quality study abroad opportunities;        (2) to ensure that the diversity of students studying       abroad reflects the diversity of students and institutions of       higher education in the United States;        (3) to encourage greater diversity in study abroad       destinations by increasing the portion of study abroad that       takes place in nontraditional study abroad destinations,       especially in developing countries; and        (4) to encourage a greater commitment by institutions of       higher education to expand study abroad opportunities.
