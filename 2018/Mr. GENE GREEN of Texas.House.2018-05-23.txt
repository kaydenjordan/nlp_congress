 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor all the  dedicated EMS workers, especially in Houston County and Harris County,  Texas, who served our community with distinction during Hurricane  Harvey last August. This week is EMS Recognition Week across our  country.   Nobody becomes an emergency medical responder, emergency medical  technician, or paramedic to get rich. It is hard work, physically  strenuous and stressful, and can involve life-or-death situations in  certain circumstances.   This was the case during Hurricane Harvey, a historic storm that  dropped over 50 inches of rain over Houston and southeast Texas.   While we honor the hard work and dedication of our EMS workers during  EMS Week, we must make sure our emergency medical service workers are  paid a fair, middle class wage and benefits, and are protected from  worker fatigue so that they can deliver high-quality emergency care  when it is most needed.   I also wish to recognize the hundreds of EMS workers who traveled  from all over the country to help the people of Houston and southeast  Texas during our time of need.                            ____________________
