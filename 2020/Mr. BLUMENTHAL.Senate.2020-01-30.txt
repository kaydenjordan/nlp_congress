 Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I send a question to  the desk for the House managers.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you.   The question from Senator Blumenthal to the House managers:         On April 24, 2019--one day after the media reported that       former Vice President Biden would formally enter the 2020       U.S. Presidential race--the State Department executed       President Trump's order to recall Ambassador Marie       Yovanovitch, a well-regarded career diplomat and anti-      corruption crusader. Why did President Trump want, in his       words, to ``take her out''?    Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Mr. Giuliani has provided the answer to that  question. He stated publicly that the reason they needed to get  Ambassador Yovanovitch out of the way was that she was going to get in  the way of these investigations that they wanted. This is the  President's own lawyer's explanation for why they had to push out--why  they had to smear--Ambassador Yovanovitch.   So the President's own lawyer gives us the answer, and that ought to  tell us something in a couple of respects: one, that the President's  own agents have said that she was an impediment to getting these  investigations. She was this anti-corruption champion, this anti- corruption champion who is at an awards ceremony or recognition  ceremony for a Ukrainian anti-corruption fighter, a woman who had acid  thrown in her face and died a painful death after months. She is at the  very ceremony acknowledging this other champion fighting corruption  when she gets the word: You need to come back on the next plane.   One of the reasons the Ukrainians knew they had to deal with Rudy  Giuliani is that Rudy Giuliani was trying to get this Ambassador  replaced. And, you know, he succeeded. He succeeded, and that sent a  message to the Ukrainians that if Rudy Giuliani had the juice with the  President of the United States, the power with the President of the  United States to recall an Ambassador from her post, this is not only  somebody who had the ear of the President but could make things happen.   So the short answer is that Rudy Giuliani tells us why she had to go.   Now why they had to smear her, why the President couldn't simply  recall her--that is harder to explain. But the reason they wanted her  out of the way is they wanted to make these investigations go forward,  and they knew someone there fighting corruption was getting in the way  of that.   Now I wanted to say, with respect to some of the arguments against  having the testimony of John Bolton, these are some of the former  National Security Advisors who have been called to hearings and  depositions: Zbigniew Brzezinski, National Security Advisor for  President Carter, provided 8 hours of public hearing testimony and  additional deposition testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee  Subcommittee to Investigate Individuals Regarding the Interests of  Foreign Governments; Admiral Poindexter testified, providing 25 hours  of public hearing testimony and 20 hours of deposition testimony before  the House Select Committee to Investigate Covert Arms Transactions with  Iran; Robert McFarland, former National Security Advisor for President  Ronald Reagan, provided over 20 hours of hearing testimony and 3  additional hours of deposition testimony; Samuel Berger, National  Security Advisor to President Clinton, provided 2 hours of public  hearing testimony before the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs,  its inquiry into campaign finance practices; Condoleezza Rice, National  Security Advisor to President George W. Bush, 3 hours of public  testimony, additional closed session testimony; Susan Rice provided  closed session testimony to the House Select Committee on how the Obama  administration handled identification of U.S. citizens in U.S.  intelligence reports.  [[Page S732]]    There is ample precedent where it is necessary to have testimony of  National Security Advisors.   Now you saw, I think, President's counsel dancing on the head of a  pin to try and explain why they are before you arguing ``We can't have  these people come here; the House should sue in court'' and why they  are in court saying ``The court can't hear it.''   I have to say I have a great understanding of the difficulty of that  position. I wouldn't want to be in a position of having to advocate  that argument. But it goes to the demonstration of bad faith here. How  can you be before this body saying ``You have got to go to court; the  House was derelict because it didn't go to court,'' and go to the same  court and say ``The House shouldn't be here''? How do you do that?   Now, they say: Well, the House is in court, so the House must think  it is OK, even though we don't think so, and we will argue that and  take it all the way up to the Supreme Court if we have to.   We don't think that is an adequate remedy. That is the whole problem.  When you have bad faith indication of privilege, when you have, in  fact, nonassertion of privilege, when you have a President who wants to  continue to cover up his wrongdoing indefinitely--a President who is  trying to get foreign help on the very next election--that process of  going endlessly up and down the courts with a duplicitous counsel to  the President arguing ``In one place you can do it and the other place  you can't'' shows the flaw with a precedent that Congress must exhaust  all remedies before it can insist on answers with the ultimate remedy  of impeachment.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, Mr. Manager.   The majority leader is recognized.                                    Recess
