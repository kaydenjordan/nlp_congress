 Mr. Speaker, in honor of Veterans Day on Friday, I rise  to recognize the brave men and women who have protected and served our  country courageously.   This is an especially significant day for my district, the island of  Guam, as it is home to over 15,000 military veterans. We are also proud  to hold the highest per capita statistics of enlistment numbers in the  Nation.   I pledge to continue pushing for legislation that provides better  benefits and services for all our veterans. I will continue honoring  their legacy by supporting those who have served and to ensure Guam's  defense is strong and resilient as tensions rise in the Indo-Pacific  region.   Today and every day we honor veterans and their families for the  sacrifices that have made our freedom possible. Their courage,  patriotism, and dedication are an inspiration for us all.   May God bless our veterans, and may God bless America.                            ____________________
