 Madam Speaker, I rise to celebrate the Inflation  Reduction Act. This law not only makes a massive $370 billion climate  and energy investment nationwide, but it could generate up to 5 million  new clean energy jobs across America.   Madam Speaker, Texas is number one in wind energy and number two in  solar energy. Texas led all States in overall renewable energy  production in the first quarter of 2022. There are nearly 240,000 Texas  workers in the clean energy industry.   This number will soon increase because of the estimated $66 billion  investment in Texas' clean power industry between now and 2030. More  Texas workers will be able to gain employment across the solar, wind,  and other clean energy industries.   President Biden and House Democrats are not only fighting the climate  crisis, but we are making sure workers can transition into good-paying  clean energy jobs. We are putting people over politics, and it is about  jobs, jobs, and more jobs.                            ____________________
