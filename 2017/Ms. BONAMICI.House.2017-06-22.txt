 Mr. Speaker, the Strengthening Career and Technical  Education for the 21st Century Act is an important step in educating  students and preparing them for the workforce. It increases  opportunities for historically underserved students. It strengthens  alignment between CTE programs and stakeholders. It includes the  amendment I worked on with Representative Stefanik to encourage CTE  programs to integrate arts and design skills.   This bill will support more programs that respond to local workforce  demands and teach advanced skills and creative thinking, like the one I  just visited at Portland Community College. Employers, including Intel,  support the school's new STEAM Lab,  [[Page H5080]]  where students are pursuing certificates and degrees in fields like  microelectronics technology.   The Federal Government does have an important enforcement role, and I  am disappointed that the bill weakens the Department of Education's  ability to hold States accountable for improving low-quality CTE  programs. But despite that concern, this bill is worthy of support.   I thank Chairwoman Foxx, Ranking Member Scott, Representative  Thompson, and Representative Krishnamoorthi for their bipartisan work,  and I urge all my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill.
