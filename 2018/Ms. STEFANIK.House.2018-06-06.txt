 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor an exceptional  patriot and military leader, Major General Jeffrey Bannister, who  recently passed away.   General Bannister served as the 10th Mountain Division commander and  senior commander at Fort Drum in my district.   I am proud to have gotten to know General Bannister and his family  during my first term in office, when we worked closely together to  successfully prevent devastating personnel cuts from taking place at  Fort Drum.   Whenever I visited Fort Drum, Major General Bannister was always a  wonderful host. It was clear he commanded the greatest respect from the  men and women stationed on post, and I know his greatest interest was  their well-being.   I remember running into Jeff with his family at the Cream Cheese  Festival in Lowville after he returned from a recent deployment. He was  casually wearing his baseball cap and eating at a picnic table with his  wife, and they both gave me a warm hug.   He was truly dedicated to our country and our community.   The hearts of our entire Fort Drum community go out to the family of  Major General Bannister, his wife Trese and his daughter Lindsey during  this difficult time.                            ____________________
