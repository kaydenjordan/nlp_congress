 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor the  life of Sharon Sanders, one of Charlotte's great philanthropists and  the founder of Kids First of the Carolinas, which through the decades  has provided essentials and Christmas gifts to over 35,000 children and  families in the Charlotte area. Ms. Sanders died January 14 after a  battle with cancer.   Sharon was a wife, mother, and friend to all, with an extraordinary  passion for helping others. Her love for children led to her founding  Kids First; and with the assistance of legendary Charlotte broadcaster  John Hancock, the organization was able to expand outreach, providing  for more than 2,000 children every Christmas and raising about $80,000  a year.   Even as she endured treatment for cancer, Sharon remained devoted to  Kids First. Despite her hospitalization, she was overjoyed that they  were, once again, able to help over 1,000 families during the holidays  past.   Mr. Speaker, the Charlotte community will miss Sharon greatly. It is  a privilege to honor her memory today.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 546, the Effective  Assistance of Counsel in the Digital Era Act.   This bill will modernize our criminal justice system by extending  attorney-client privilege to electronic communication sent or received  through the Bureau of Prisons' email system. This will ensure that  incarcerated individuals can communicate with their attorneys  efficiently and privately, as it should be.   Under the legislation, the Bureau of Prisons will be prohibited from  monitoring privileged email communications between incarcerated  individuals and that individual's attorney.   The attorney-client privilege is a vital component of our legal  system that ensures a criminal defendant has an effective advocate in  the courtroom. Emails between incarcerated individuals and their  attorneys should fall under the attorney-client protections, but  currently, that is not the case.   This bill will protect the rights of incarcerated men and women to  speak openly and honestly with their attorneys via email, without fear  that the prosecution is monitoring those communications. Other methods  of communication, such as in-person meetings and letters, can be  particularly burdensome and time-consuming. Even if an attorney is near  the incarcerated client, it can take hours to travel to a detention  facility and visit with the client.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 546 requires the Attorney General to ensure that  BOP's email system excludes the contents of electronic communications  between an incarcerated person and his or her attorney from the current  email monitoring process.   The bill stipulates that the protections and limitations associated  with the attorney-client privilege, including the crime-fraud  exception, apply to electronic communications sent or received through  the BOP email system. The BOP will be allowed to retain electronic  communications until the incarcerated person is released, but the bill  specifies that the contents may only be accessed under very limited  circumstances.   Finally, H.R. 546 allows a court to suppress evidence obtained or  derived from access to the retained emails if the emails were accessed  in violation of the act.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R.  546, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I have no further  speakers, and I yield myself the balance of my time.   I wanted to say my compliments to the gentleman from New York in  pursuit of this bill and the things he spoke to about the presumption  of innocence and the right to counsel, among those sacred core rights  that our Constitution guarantees to every individual in this country.  This important bipartisan bill is preservative of that.   That is what we do in this Chamber. That is what this Congress should  always do. So my compliments to the gentleman from New York and the  cosponsors on this piece of legislation. I encourage my fellow Members  to support it.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    I yield myself as much time as I may  consume.  [[Page H562]]    I rise today in support of the Puerto Rico Recovery Accuracy in  Disclosures Act.   In 2016, Puerto Rico was experiencing significant financial pressures  brought on by sizable debt and related obligations. In response to  Puerto Rico's financial crisis, Congress enacted the Puerto Rico  Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act of 2016. The 2016 law  established a bankruptcy mechanism for Puerto Rico to address its  obligations.   Like the general bankruptcy law, the 2016 law enables bankruptcy  professionals, like accountants, consultants, and lawyers, to apply for  payment for their services upon court approval. But the 2016 law  omitted disclosure requirements that apply to compensated professionals  in proceedings under the general Bankruptcy Code, title 11 of the  United States Code, pursuant to rule 2014(a) of the Federal Rules of  Bankruptcy Procedure.   Most significantly, the gap in the 2016 law created a potential for  undisclosed compensation terms and undiscovered conflicts of interest  vis-a-vis parties of interest for professionals serving in Puerto  Rico's bankruptcy.   To address this concern, this bill applies the disclosure  requirements of rule 2014(a) to professionals serving in connection  with Puerto Rico's bankruptcy and seeking compensation for those  services.   The bill also requires oversight of the disclosures that bankruptcy  professionals make.   This bill's disclosure and oversight requirements increase the  likelihood that conflicts of interest will be caught and timely  addressed before compensation decisions are made.   Taken as a whole, this added transparency will benefit important  interests, such as those of creditors and taxpayers--and ultimately, of  Puerto Rico itself.   Madam Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1715     Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Puerto Rico (Miss Gonzalez-Colon).   Miss GONZALEZ-COLON. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the Puerto  Rico Recovery Accuracy in Disclosures Act, H.R. 1192.   Representative Velazquez and myself have proposed this bipartisan  initiative in the last two Congresses, having achieved passage in the  House during the last session. I think Congresswoman Velazquez is very  thoughtful in terms of how important this is and the effects on PROMESA  regarding this bill.   We support this bill as an important component in ensuring the  restructuring process under PROMESA, and it looks out for Puerto Rico's  interests.   This legislation requires any counsel and professional personnel that  the financial oversight board may hire to work on a title III case for  the restructuring of Puerto Rico's debt to submit verified disclosures  of their connections with the debtor, creditors, or persons employed by  the oversight board prior to being compensated.   These provisions extend the same requirements to decisions about the  hiring of personnel for the restructuring as are imposed on such  personnel under existing bankruptcy rules. I think it is important to  have the same kind of rules for those people who are going to be  managing, as we speak, those kinds of negotiations.   Our intention is not to exclude any people with expertise and  knowledge about Puerto Rico's fiscal transactions from being resources  in the restructuring process, but I think it is essential that any such  connection be clear and known so that such persons' qualifications and  the role they are going to be playing can be better evaluated.   Conflict of interest, or the appearance of a conflict of interest,  can be best avoided if there are accountability and transparency during  the process. This bill would allow that to happen.   This bill would require that such personnel must disclose in detail  their participation and involvement with any entity involved in the  issuance of Puerto Rico's debt and in any claims involving Puerto  Rico's debt, informing the identity of each one.   Anyone who is serving in the board--and I repeat, anyone who is  serving in the board--working to inform its decisions, or representing  it before the title III court, must have the trust of all parties that  they are committed to defending the interests of Puerto Rico to the  best of their ability in accordance to the law and justice.   A lack of transparency in personnel decisions creates a lack of  confidence and distrust. Learning that someone was involved in the  business of one of the parties in the case, only after they are named  and working on the case, does not create assurance of their commitment  to the best interests of Puerto Rico or even managing the debt.    Our goal must be to reach the day that we will no longer need the  provisions of PROMESA or the fiscal oversight board, and we can  dedicate ourselves to rebuild our economy and provide for growth. But  until that happens, we must demand that those instruments created by  PROMESA be accountable and transparent in their processes. Anything  else should be unacceptable.   That is the reason this bill, H.R. 1192, is important, and I ask my  colleagues to support and pass this bill.   Madam Speaker, I say thank you to the Congresswoman from New York  (Ms. Velazquez) for this bill and for allowing this initiative to be a  bipartisan one.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman  from Puerto Rico, and I thank the gentlewomen from Texas and New York.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
