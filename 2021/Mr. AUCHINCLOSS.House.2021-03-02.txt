 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1,  the For the People Act, to restore integrity and ethics in our  electoral process.   To strengthen the bill, I have offered two amendments to empower  younger generations to work together to tackle the challenges that will  define our lifetimes. Climate change, gun violence, and reproductive  rights energize and galvanize younger Americans. The right to vote is  how they are heard and how they make change. My amendments will expand  and protect this right for young people.   The For the People Act must live up to its name, and I am proud to  offer these amendments that reinforce the importance of a democracy  that brings all Americans, regardless of age, race, gender identity, or  income, to the ballot box to cast their votes.
