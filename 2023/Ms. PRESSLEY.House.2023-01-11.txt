 Madam Speaker, as chair of the Abortion Rights and  Access Task Force, I rise to make plain exactly what is going on here.  This is not a debate about political violence. Political violence and  the violent rhetoric that drives it is a persistent threat; my staff,  my family, and I know that intimately. Everyone should condemn it.   Our colleagues across the aisle continue to say the quiet part out  loud in their selective contempt for political violence.   This resolution seeks to deny necessary medical care from those who  seek it. Abortion is healthcare and a fundamental human right.   Across the Nation, those seeking care are met with intimidation,  violence, and even loss of life. Imagine walking through a screaming  crowd to get to a medical appointment. Imagine being a doctor or a  nurse dedicating your life to helping others, and day after day your  workplace receives violent threats, and you fear for your life.   But that is not what the other side of the aisle is concerned about.  No, today, they are seeking to mislead the American people. They are  trying to conjure up hateful rhetoric, spreading misinformation about  crisis pregnancy centers.   Let me make it plain. Crisis pregnancy centers are no place to go for  reproductive healthcare. They are sham clinics that coerce folks  seeking to terminate a pregnancy or to access the full range of  reproductive health services.    Madam Speaker, to those pressing these divisive anti- choice resolutions, we see right through you.   Madam Speaker, abortion is healthcare and a fundamental human right,  and I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''
