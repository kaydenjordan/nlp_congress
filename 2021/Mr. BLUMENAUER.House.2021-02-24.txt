 Mr. Speaker, the Nation watched in horror at the  terrible situation in Texas this last week with horrific weather  conditions and then the aftermath dealing with problems with safe  drinking water and supply. It was leavened a little bit by the plight  of Ted Cruz who is notoriously struggling to tell the truth this time  as he fled his State and leaving his constituents behind and then  watching him contort trying to change his story over the course of the  next few days. It was sort of a national joke.   But what was happening in Texas was not a joke. These conditions were  unprecedented. But they found Texas unable to really respond in a way  despite the fact that 10 years ago there was a similar situation. It is  fascinating. Ted Cruz isn't the only one struggling with the truth. The  Governor of Texas, Governor Abbott, sought to blame wind energy for  their plight. Wind energy, which supplies less than 10 percent of the  total energy supply for the State, performed better than fossil fuel  which provided the majority of it.   Think for a moment how they attempted to target the Green New Deal  and AOC. While Ted Cruz was struggling to get his story straight, our  colleague, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, was raising millions of dollars to  help people in Texas cope. Blaming a Green New Deal which has never  actually been enacted--it is an aspirational goal--is foolish. What we  have seen in Texas with those extreme weather events are a preview of  coming attractions.   What we saw in Australia this last year and in the Western United  States with horrific wildfires, looking at a once-in-a-century weather  event is becoming routine, and it is going to happen more and more  frequently.   I would suggest that Texas leadership could take a look at what they  have done. Their famously deregulated energy system has given the  family with a $16,000 electric bill or former Governor and Energy  Secretary Rick Perry said: Well, people would just be happy to have a  few days without energy to be free of the dangers of Federal  regulation.   I think people in the surrounding States that survived much better  and didn't have $16,000 monthly electric bills might review that. I  would suggest that the folks in Texas leadership could start first of  all by telling the truth. It is not renewable energy, it was fossil  fuel that failed and continued reliance on fossil fuel is going to make  events like this much, much more frequent.   We need to deal with reliability in Texas and around the country.  Last, but not least, we must fight for climate justice and a low carbon  future. That will help make these situations less frequent and more  bearable, and it is a path forward that we can take confident that  history will reflect we were on the right side.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentlewoman's courtesy  and her careful, thoughtful explanation of what we are doing.   I strongly support the Equality Act, extending civil rights  protections to all citizens. I have been honored to be a part of this  process throughout my political career, dating back as a child  legislator in the 1970s in county government, in city government in  Oregon, and for the last 25 years here in Congress.   The arguments that we are hearing have been heard before. The same  sort of hysterical concerns have proven not to be the case. Wild claims  have been proven wrong; and especially I think of marriage equality as  the most compelling. Each reform, each step of the way, has been for  progress, and equality was positive, and ultimately supported by the  public, as is the Equality Act. The wild claims have been proven  groundless.   At the end of the day, one of the reasons is that Americans are  biased in favor of fairness and equality. Another important reason, as  alluded to by my friend from Pennsylvania, is personal experience.  There was fear and misapprehension, but as people became experienced  with a family member who married, a transgender child, when you deal  with the reality of real people, what we find is that they are people  like everybody else, and we do not want their lives to be turned upside  down.    I come from a State where by and large these protections are in  place, but they aren't in place for everybody everywhere, and we have  an opportunity to make additional progress. One of the reasons that we  have seen  [[Page H606]]  this progress take place is the advocacy of those in the LGBT community  who have been tireless, thoughtful, articulate, strategic, moving the  agenda forward and bringing along often reluctant politicians.   Last but not least, I would reference what happened with our young  people. Young people understand this. Young people are not hysterical.  Young people express their concern and willingness to embrace others,  regardless of sexual orientation, and that is why ultimately this cause  will win. It is why so much progress has been made and why it will  ultimately be successful.   I deeply appreciate this being brought before us, an opportunity for  us to approve the Equality Act, affirm the bedrock principle of full  equality, move it on to the Senate, and hopefully now with an  administration committed to equality, we can enact it into law for the  benefit of citizens all across the country.   I just have one 30-second evaluation of the notion of scientific  forest management.    Mr. Speaker, I will just say, I come from an area  where so-called ``scientific management'' of forests has resulted in  more forest fires, problems with water quality, problems with habitat.  We are learning that we need to make different changes, and one of the  tools that we have is extending wilderness protection. It strengthens  the environment, protects wildlife, water resources, and makes them  more resilient, not less.   It is not a matter of raking the forests, as Donald Trump said, but  having an opportunity to allow the healing power of nature to provide  those protections.
