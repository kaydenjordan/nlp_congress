 Madam Speaker, I rise today on the eve of President Biden's  State of the Union speech to strongly urge Congress to pass immigration  reform to boost our economy, grow our GDP, and create jobs across the  country.   Right now, our economy is roaring back after the depths of a global  pandemic, and workers and families are still feeling the effects. As we  continue this recovery and work to grow our economy, lower costs, and  create jobs, it is now more crucial than ever that we secure a pathway  to citizenship for the millions of hardworking, immigrant, essential  workers across the country who contribute to our economy every day.   We must secure a pathway to citizenship for the farmworkers and  meatpackers who feed America, the construction workers who build  American cities, the restaurant and hotel workers who serve our  families, and the nurses, doctors, and healthcare workers who have  cared for us in this public health crisis. Now is the time to deliver  on immigration reform to boost our economy and keep families together.   Members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus join me in this fight to  urgently act. That is why we have worked tirelessly with the Biden  administration to enact policy changes to build a more efficient, just,  fair, and humane immigration system that reflects our American values.   We have pursued an all-of-the-above and any-which-way approach to  achieving immigration reform using every tool at our disposal to secure  a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers, farmworkers, TPS holders, and  essential workers.  [[Page H1182]]    In the House, CHC members have introduced and passed meaningful  bipartisan bills to achieve that goal. As the proud son of farmworkers,  I was thrilled when Democrats, Republicans, growers, and workers came  together to pass the Farm Workforce Modernization Act. This bipartisan  bill would give farmworkers and their families a pathway to  citizenship.   Doing so would stabilize our workforce and the price of our food,  making your produce, my produce, and everybody's produce available at a  reasonable cost. The CHC also led efforts to pass the bipartisan  American Dream and Promise Act to allow DACA, temporary protected  status, and deferred enforced departure beneficiaries to earn permanent  residence and continue contributing to our workforce and economy.   CHC, with House Democrats, delivered. Unfortunately, Republicans in  the Senate blocked these commonsense bills that would benefit all  Americans and help keep families together. However, we didn't let their  refusal to do what is right for this country and American families  stand in the way of our work to enact positive change.   That is why the CHC led efforts to pass immigration reform through  the Build Back Better Act and provide a much-needed pathway to  citizenship for Dreamers, TPS holders, essential workers, and  farmworkers, and meaningful protections and work permits. Out of the  House, we passed significant reforms to address the historic labor  shortages our Nation faces, grow our GDP, and fight rising costs for  American families.   Now, with these much-needed provisions awaiting consideration in the  Senate, I call on my Senate colleagues to take up the Build Back Better  Act without delay and pass it with a pathway to citizenship. I call on  the Senate to pass the American Dream and Promise Act. I call on the  Senate to pass the Farm Workforce Modernization Act.   We must urgently pass immigration reform right now. We will work with  the administration to achieve positive, meaningful immigration changes.  It is our duty to our Nation to give hardworking, immigrant, essential  workers the opportunity to stay in the country that they call home.   Our Nation's immigrants are professionals, entrepreneurs, doctors,  nurses, and essential workers who make America stronger. We are at our  strongest when we embrace our immigrant communities.   Later tonight, during President Biden's State of the Union address,  CHC members will be virtually joined by Dreamers from our districts to  highlight their contributions to our country, their home. Dreamers are  part of our efforts to rebuild and to recover. They are our future and  our constant inspiration in this fight.   Tonight, I am proud to be joined by Alma from Thermal, California, my  constituent, to say: ``You are not forgotten.'' ``No son olvidados.''   You are home.                            ____________________
