 Madam President, anyone watching the Senate yesterday  saw another installment in an ongoing series that has become somewhat  familiar. Republicans roll out yet another effort to forge a bipartisan  compromise around coronavirus relief, and Democrats reply with partisan  cheap shots and threats to block everything.   Republicans develop a serious plan to get historic amounts of  additional money in the pipeline for kids, jobs, and schools, and  Democrats just point fingers, call names, and keep blocking American  families from getting any more help before the November election.   In July, Republicans put forward a serious framework, but Speaker  Pelosi and the Democratic leader refused to talk unless the starting  point was their literally absurd $3.4 trillion far-left wish list that  even House Democrats called a stunt.   In August, with those talks stalled, Republicans proposed narrow  agreements on specific urgent policies to help families, unemployment  benefits, the Paycheck Protection Program. Democrats refused again.  This time their invented excuse was that any assistance short of their  entire wish list was too ``piecemeal''--too ``piecemeal''--and not  worth doing.   If Democrats didn't get their diversity studies for the cannabis  industry, stimulus checks for illegal immigrants, and tax cuts for blue  State millionaires, they would make sure millions of Americans would  lose their unemployment benefits and PPP would close. That is what they  threatened, and that is what they did.   So here we are in September. Schools and colleges have gone without  the $105 billion that Republicans wanted to give them back in July.  That is more money than Speaker Pelosi put in her bill.   American workers have gone without the second round of the PPP that  Republicans proposed weeks and weeks ago. Speaker Pelosi had no money  for PPP in her $3.4 trillion bill.  [[Page S5480]]    The race for treatments and vaccines has gone without the additional  funding that Republicans wanted to deliver. Families have gone without  the economic relief that Republicans wanted to put in their pockets.  And Washington Democrats have just kept trying to run out the clock-- run out the clock--until November.   But here is one thing: The Senate majority works for the American  people. We fight for American families. We are not going to let Speaker  Pelosi and the Democratic leader kill and bury coronavirus relief  behind closed doors without putting every Senator on the record. So we  have put together a new, targeted proposal containing several of the  most urgent and most popular policies that would help Americans right  now. Tomorrow, the whole Senate will vote on it.   It will be a procedural vote. It is not a vote to pass our bill  tomorrow, precisely as written. It is a vote for Senators to say  whether they want to move forward toward huge amounts of relief for  kids, for jobs, for healthcare, or whether they are happier doing  absolutely nothing.   That is what every single Senator will decide tomorrow. Do you want  to do something--something--or do you want to do nothing?   Democratic leaders know this simple choice will put the spotlight on  their partisan antics. They know this vote will expose their  obstruction.   Speaker Pelosi and Leader Schumer were attacking our new proposal  yesterday before they even read it, before it had even come out. I  would normally make fun of that, but in this case it makes perfect  sense because their position clearly is that they do not want any  bipartisan relief whatsoever. They do not want any bipartisan relief  whatsoever to reach American families prior to the election.   They didn't even need to see what we were proposing. If it helped  working families in any way--in any way--between now and November 3,  Speaker Pelosi and Leader Schumer knew for sure they opposed it.   Their red herrings and cherry-picked arguments have now given way to  total dishonesty. Yesterday, our colleague from New York railed against  a provision pertaining to critical supply chains, calling it some  sinister giveaway to big business. A provision pertaining to critical  supply chains he called a sinister giveaway to big business? That  provision is cosponsored by his own Democratic ranking member on the  committee. So either the Democratic leader is impugning his own ranking  member right along with Republicans or else he simply doesn't know what  he is talking about.   Likewise, the junior Senator from Vermont attacked this provision as  ``corporate welfare,'' but he himself did not vote against this very  provision in committee on two occasions.   They are so desperate to keep working families from getting any help  before the election that some Democrats are now attacking things they  previously supported. At this point it is just silly season on the  Democratic side. They have run out of excuses not to legislate, and  even their cheap shots just backfire in embarrassing ways.   So tomorrow--tomorrow--the Senate will cut through all the noise with  one vote. Every Senator will either say they want to move forward,  agree where we can, make a law to help people, and keep arguing over  our differences later or say they prefer to do absolutely nothing.   Every Senator will vote on this significant package, which secures  Federal unemployment benefits, reopens the PPP for a second draw, sends  more than $100 billion to keep kids safe in school, helps parents with  childcare, helps families afford expenses or homeschooling, and  rebuilds our strategic medical stockpile.   This is not a simplistic argument over big versus small. Republicans  want more money for K-12 and college than was in the Democratic bill.  We want more money for PPP, which their bill forgot to fund. These are  bipartisan priorities that Democrats left behind and Republicans want  to take care of.   So tomorrow--tomorrow--American families will learn who wants to make  a law for them and who is happiest if they get nothing.                            ____________________     Madam President, on a completely different matter, on  Saturday, the world of sports once again revolved around my hometown of  Louisville for the 146th Kentucky Derby. Like so many other events, the  coronavirus made this year's derby look a little different.   The race had already been postponed for only the second time in  history, and none of the 150,000 spectators who normally fill Churchill  Downs were there to sing ``My Old Kentucky Home,'' but the most  exciting 2 minutes in sports refused to be defeated.   The derby remains the longest continuously held sporting event, and  this year's Labor Day derby proved worth the wait. The winning  thoroughbred, Authentic, outlasted a ferocious challenge from the  favorite. So I would like to extend the Senate's congratulations to the  entire Hall of Fame team.   (The remarks of Mr. McConnell pertaining to the introduction of S.  4547 are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced  Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')    I yield the floor                            ____________________     Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, this year's Kentucky Derby showed that  our great traditions can adapt to overcome any challenge. But our sport  must be protected.   I have been proud to stand up for Kentucky horse racing throughout my  career. I introduced a checkoff bill to promote the sport domestically.  I assembled a coalition to open new markets in Japan and Hong Kong. I  worked to make sure internet regulations did not unduly restrict the  racing industry. I have secured tax provisions to promote equine equity  and grow investment in Kentucky. It has been my privilege to deliver  for this sport and Kentuckians who stand behind it.   Today, I am introducing new legislation to keep it up because,  unfortunately, the coronavirus isn't thoroughbred racing's only  challenge. In recent years, tragedies on the track, medication  scandals, and an inconsistent patchwork of regulations have cast clouds  over the future. A national publication's editorial board even called  for this sport to be abolished altogether.   We needed action to protect the sport we love, to defend our history  and the 24,000 Kentuckians who work in the thoroughbred racing  industry. So in Lexington, the horse capital of the world, I announced  with my friend Congressman   Andy Barr that we had found a way forward.   Today I will introduce the Horseracing Integrity and Safety Act to  recognize a uniform, national standard for thoroughbred racing.  Baseball, football, and other professional sports have a central  regulatory authority. Thoroughbred racing should as well.   Some of the biggest names in the sport--Churchill Downs, Keeneland,  the Breeders' Cup and the Jockey Club, just to name a few--are  supporting our plan to provide Federal recognition and enforcement  power to an independent Horseracing Integrity and Safety Authority.   The board will be made up of both industry-selected and independent  members. It will set national standards for track safety, anti-doping,  and medication practices and lab protocols. This will make thoroughbred  racing as fair and as safe as possible.   I am proud to partner with Senator Kirsten Gillibrand on this  bipartisan legislation. New York is home to another leg of the Triple  Crown. Their junior Senator has previously introduced similar  legislation to protect our sport. I am also glad to have the senior  Senator from California and the junior Senator from Arkansas as  original cosponsors on this bill.   Today, Congressman Barr and Congressman Tonko will present this  legislation over in the House. I am grateful for Congressman Barr's  years of leadership on this issue, and I am glad we  [[Page S5515]]  are making bipartisan, bicameral progress with our bill. This way, when  we can all return to the grandstands to watch the thoroughbreds round  the final turn toward a thundering finish, we will be taking pride in a  fair and safe race.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be  printed in the Record   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 4547         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

A bill to give Federal courts additional discretion to  determine whether pretrial detention is appropriate for defendants  charged with nonviolent drug offenses in Federal criminal cases; to the  Committee on the Judiciary.    Mr. President, this year's Kentucky Derby showed that  our great traditions can adapt to overcome any challenge. But our sport  must be protected.   I have been proud to stand up for Kentucky horse racing throughout my  career. I introduced a checkoff bill to promote the sport domestically.  I assembled a coalition to open new markets in Japan and Hong Kong. I  worked to make sure internet regulations did not unduly restrict the  racing industry. I have secured tax provisions to promote equine equity  and grow investment in Kentucky. It has been my privilege to deliver  for this sport and Kentuckians who stand behind it.   Today, I am introducing new legislation to keep it up because,  unfortunately, the coronavirus isn't thoroughbred racing's only  challenge. In recent years, tragedies on the track, medication  scandals, and an inconsistent patchwork of regulations have cast clouds  over the future. A national publication's editorial board even called  for this sport to be abolished altogether.   We needed action to protect the sport we love, to defend our history  and the 24,000 Kentuckians who work in the thoroughbred racing  industry. So in Lexington, the horse capital of the world, I announced  with my friend Congressman   Andy Barr that we had found a way forward.   Today I will introduce the Horseracing Integrity and Safety Act to  recognize a uniform, national standard for thoroughbred racing.  Baseball, football, and other professional sports have a central  regulatory authority. Thoroughbred racing should as well.   Some of the biggest names in the sport--Churchill Downs, Keeneland,  the Breeders' Cup and the Jockey Club, just to name a few--are  supporting our plan to provide Federal recognition and enforcement  power to an independent Horseracing Integrity and Safety Authority.   The board will be made up of both industry-selected and independent  members. It will set national standards for track safety, anti-doping,  and medication practices and lab protocols. This will make thoroughbred  racing as fair and as safe as possible.   I am proud to partner with Senator Kirsten Gillibrand on this  bipartisan legislation. New York is home to another leg of the Triple  Crown. Their junior Senator has previously introduced similar  legislation to protect our sport. I am also glad to have the senior  Senator from California and the junior Senator from Arkansas as  original cosponsors on this bill.   Today, Congressman Barr and Congressman Tonko will present this  legislation over in the House. I am grateful for Congressman Barr's  years of leadership on this issue, and I am glad we  [[Page S5515]]  are making bipartisan, bicameral progress with our bill. This way, when  we can all return to the grandstands to watch the thoroughbreds round  the final turn toward a thundering finish, we will be taking pride in a  fair and safe race.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be  printed in the Record   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 4547         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.
