 Mr. Speaker, I rise to support the opposing of the  rule and opposing of H.R. 4712 to support the right of a woman to  choose and to support loving families.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the Rule and the  underlying bill.   I strongly oppose this latest attempt by the Republican House  majority to limit women's rights to safe and legal abortions.   H.R. 4712 amends the Born-Alive Infants Protection Act--a 2002 law  that the pro-choice community did not oppose.   This bill, however, adds penalties to the law and an entirely new  section in which Congress attempts to intrude directly into medical  practice of abortion care for anti-choice ideological purposes.   Anti-choice lawmakers say this new bill is necessary because some  babies ``survive'' abortion procedures.   They cite the now-discredited videos attacking Planned Parenthood as  their evidence.   Of course, such allegations are untrue: newborns already have many  legal protections, and there is no similarity between safe, legal  abortion care and infanticide.   This bill is a solution in search of a problem.   No evidence of lawbreaking has been uncovered that necessitates  congressional involvement.   Abortion practice is safe, legal, and humane; any evidence of  wrongdoing can and should be handled under existing law.   If there is ever a case of harm or mistreatment of newborns, then of  course, it should be investigated and prosecuted.   No such case exists here.   That makes it even clearer that H.R. 4712 must have other purposes;  we believe the bill's true goals are to inflame the public with  outrageous accusations, to interfere with medical care, and to  intimidate doctors out of practice.   This legislation is consistent with the assaults that the Trump  Administration and anti-abortion members of Congress in both the House  and Senate have been undertaking throughout the 115th Congress and show  no signs of ending.   The bill intrudes into medical practice, its mandate is so broad and  the penalties so severe--up to five years in prison and the threat of  financially crippling lawsuits--that one can only conclude that H.R.  4712 hopes to intimidate abortion providers out of practice.   This interference in medical care could also cause tremendous  additional grief to some families making difficult decisions in  heartbreaking cases.   We would not tolerate similar intrusion by politicians into any other  medical specialty; abortion care is no different.   Finally, it is important to put this legislation into the proper  context.   We are in the midst of an unprecedented assault against reproductive  rights: this bill is just one in a litany to restrict a woman's right  to choose while using women as political pawns with an extremist, anti- choice base.   Instead of spending time attempting to roll back women's  constitutionally protected rights, this House should be advancing  legislation that will reform our truly broken immigration and criminal  justice systems.   The bill before us is offered for a simple purpose; to sensationalize  opposition to abortion and serve as a political decoy to shut down our  government.   The United States Supreme Court ruled over 40 years ago, in Roe v.  Wade (410 U.S. 113 (1973)), that a woman's constitutional right to  privacy includes her right to abortion.   Since this landmark decision, abortion rates and risks have  substantially declined, as have the number of teen and unwanted  pregnancies.   Restricting all access to reproductive and women's health services  only exacerbates a woman's risk of an unintended pregnancy and fails to  accomplish any meaningful overthrow of Roe v. Wade.   In recent years, state policymakers have passed hundreds of  restrictions on abortion care under the guise of protecting women's  health and safety.   Fights here in Congress have been no different.   In my state of Texas a law that would have cut off access to 75  percent of reproductive healthcare clinics in the state was challenged  before the U.S. Supreme Court in 2014 and 2015.   On October 2, 2014, the Supreme Court struck down as unconstitutional  a Texas law that required that all reproductive healthcare clinics that  provided the full range of services would be required to have a  hospital-style surgery center building and staffing requirements.   This requirement meant that only 7 clinics would be allowed to  continue to provide a full spectrum of reproductive healthcare to  women.   Texas has 268,580 square miles only second in size to the state of  California.   The impact of the law in implementation would have ended access to  reproductive services for millions of women in my state.   In 2015, the State of Texas once again threatened women's access to  reproductive health care when it attempted to shutter all but 10  healthcare providers in the state of Texas.   The Supreme Court once again intervened on the behalf of Texas women  to block the move to close clinics in my state.   It seems every month we are faced with a new attack on women's access  to reproductive health care, often couched in those same terms.   But we know that's not really the case.   If my colleagues were so concerned about women's health and safety,  they would be promoting any one of the number of evidence-based  proactive policies that improve women's health and well-being.   Instead, they are attacking Planned Parenthood in a back-handed  attempt to ban abortion.   That is their number one priority. This is certainly not about  protecting women's health, it's about politics.   Just as the 1988 Human Fetal Tissue Transplantation Research Panel  (or the Blue Ribbon Commission) sought to separate the question of  ethics of abortion from the question ethics of using fetal tissue from  legal elective abortions for medical research when laying the  foundation for the 1993, NIH Health Revitalization Act (which passed  overwhelmingly with bipartisan support), we must separate the personal  views of abortion from the legal issues of federal compliance.   Namely, the NIH Health Revitalization Act prohibits the payment or  receipt of money or any other form of valuable consideration for fetal  tissue, regardless of whether the program to which the tissue is being  provided is funded or not.   A limited exception, and crux of the applicable issue of legality,  lies with the provision allowing for reimbursement for actual expenses  (e.g. storage, processing, transportation, etc.) of the tissue.   Planned Parenthood repeatedly maintains and supports that their  affiliates involved with fetal tissue research comply with this  requirement.   In fact, of the 700+ affiliate health care centers across the  country, only 4 Planned Parenthood affiliates currently offer tissue  donation services and of those 4, only 2 (California and Washington)  offer fetal tissue donation services--that's 1 percent of all Planned  Parenthood service centers.   The California affiliate receives a modest reimbursement of $60 per  tissue specimen and the Washington affiliate receives no reimbursement.   It is worth noting that fetal tissue has been used for decades.   Since the 1920's researchers have used fetal tissue to study and  treat various neurological disorders, spinal cord injuries, diabetes,  immune deficiencies, cancers and life-threatening blood diseases.   One of the earliest advances with fetal tissue was to use fetal  kidney cells to create the first poliovirus vaccines, which are now  estimated to save 550,000 lives worldwide every year.   The most widely known application in the field of human fetal tissue  transplantation has been the Treatment of Parkinson's disease.   Many of our other common vaccines, such as polio, measles, chicken  pox, rubella and shingles, have been developed through the use of fetal  tissue or cell lines derived from fetal tissue.   When looking at the 1 percent of health care providers involved in  fetal tissue donation and research, and no clear credible proof of  illegal activity, it is obvious that attacks on Planned Parenthood are  wholly misguided.   Planned Parenthood has one of the most rigorous Medical standards and  accreditation processes in the country.   It is the only national provider that has developed a single set of  evidence-based Medical Standards and Guidelines that define how health  care is provided throughout the country.   Guidelines are developed and updated annually by a group of  nationally-renowned experts, physicians, and scientists, including  medical experts from Harvard and Columbia.   Planned Parenthood affiliates must submit to accreditation reviews  that include 100 indicators (or high level areas of review) and over  600 individual Elements of Performance (or measures for review). Half  of these relate to the provision of medical care and patient safety.   Planned Parenthood has strict requirements regarding compliance with  all federal, state, and local laws and regulations. A specific area of  compliance is with mandatory reporting laws and regulations regarding  reporting in instances where the welfare of a minor is endangered.   All staff with patient contact are rigorously trained regarding  compliance with federal, state and local laws and regulations governing  service to minors.  [[Page H502]]    Violations of mandatory reporting regulations are subject to  disciplinary action, up to and including termination.   It is no secret that the Center for Medical Progress is an extreme  anti-choice organization with a goal of outlawing legal abortion  procedures in this country.   To achieve that goal, they have shamelessly targeted Planned  Parenthood and the funding that provides healthcare services to  millions of women every year.   They continue to use deceptive tactics and secret videos to try and  undermine Planned Parenthood.   Just like Live Action, the Center for Medical Progress is not a group  that can be taken credibly.   The Center for Medical Progress is simply recreating a history of  doctoring and manipulating video intended to create misimpressions  about Planned Parenthood.   It is a coordinated effort by anti-choice forces--not only on Planned  Parenthood or a woman's right to choose, but on women's health care  across the board.   At the same time, national media is reporting about a major  coordinated push by anti-choice groups and Members of Congress to  defund Planned Parenthood.   This coordinated effort to defund Planned Parenthood is an assault on  all progressive health care, service, and advocacy organizations who  aim to provide vital care and services to women and men across this  country.   The public is standing by Planned Parenthood, which plays a vital  role in defending women's health and rights.   Hundreds of thousands have already spoken up, including leading  groups and communities such as the growing voice of our millennial  generation.   My colleagues should be doing more to connect our youth and women to  services that help them reduce their risk of unintended pregnancies and  STD's, and improve their overall health through preventative  screenings, education and planning, rather than restricting their  access to lawfully entitled family planning and private health  services.   I urge all Members to vote against the rule and the underlying bill.    Mr. Speaker, my good friend from Oklahoma--and he is  a good friend. We have seen each other often in the Rules Committee-- protests too much. This is not a bill, and the American people should  know that it is not a bill. It is an affirmation of the inability of  Republicans to govern.   Republicans have the Presidency, the Senate, and the House. A few  months ago, their President indicated that we need a good, beautiful  government shutdown. Those are not my words. Those are the words of the  President of the United States. This is not an appropriations bill.  This is a stopgap emergency method in order to save ourselves from  collapse. That is the Republican's responsibility.   Democrats, so many months ago, passed a budget, as a member of the  Budget Committee, a budget that respected the needs of all Americans,  including the United States Department of Defense. It provided funding  for ordinary men and women who put on the uniform, some of them on food  stamps. It provided for veterans health. It provided for the children's  health insurance. It provided for infrastructure, and it provided for  ensuring that Americans could have good healthcare. That was the  Democrat's budget.   The Republican budget was a $2.4 trillion, and counting, cut to the  needs of the American people. It threatened Medicaid and Medicare,  quite contrary to Democrats. Now, we find ourselves in the midst of  those in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands who barely got lights or  power during the holiday season or thereafter. It is dealing with  Texans who have no power in their homes, living in shells. They have no  heat. They are waiting on disaster supplemental relief that is not  coming.   And, of course, what about CHIP? I represent the Texas Children's  Hospital with my colleagues. My district surrounds that area. I have  been to that hospital. I have seen what the Children's Health Insurance  Program means to saving lives. What does that mean? Six years, that is  nebulous. What about permanent?   What about passing Mr. McEachin's bill on working with seniors and  children? That is serious. And I don't know what my friends heard, but  earlier this morning, I heard the President say: Snatch CHIP out of it.  They want to be in negotiation. I just want to be mean.   And you know how you are being mean? You are not here seriously  dealing with this. You are going off on a rally so that you can support  the man that is running in the Pennsylvania suburbs who loves the  President. That is not democracy. Whoever is running, let them run.   Right now, in here, we need some help and we need to work on these  issues for the 700,000 near-Americans. They are DREAMers, but they  serve in the military. They are in medical school. They are Ph.D.s.  They are teachers, and we have them suffering. Some of them have  committed suicide because of the ugliness of this body controlled by  Republicans in the House and the Senate.   Finally, let me say that any President who can call something an s--- hole is not a serious negotiator.   I believe it is the Republicans' responsibility to put a bill on the  floor.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak on the Rule, which makes in order  legislation extending the Continuing Resolution now in effect for  another month, or until February 16, 2018.   This resolution is yet another short-term Continuing Resolution (CR)  to extend government funding for a few weeks, this time until February  16th.   This is the fourth time House Republicans have chosen to kick the can  down the road rather than work with Democrats to come to a necessary  bipartisan agreement to lift the Budget Control Act (BCA) spending  caps, giving appropriators the direction they need for full-year  funding bills.   The reason given for passing each of the prior Continuing Resolutions  was that the extra time was needed to reach a comprehensive agreement  to fund government operations in a fair and balanced way.   Yet, even with the extra time, House Republicans made no progress  during any of the previous extensions.   Mr. Speaker, I cannot support a rule that does not make in order  legislation that provides full funding for disaster recovery, extends  additional health access for veterans, provides funding to combat the  opioid epidemic, and protects pensions.   Most important, it is outrageous that House Republicans would bring  to the floor and request support for a fourth CR extension that does  not address and resolve the crisis the Republican Administration has  inflicted on 800,0oo Dreamers and their families, including 124,000  Dreamers in my home state of Texas.   Instead of acting responsibly to address these issues and fund the  government for the remainder of the fiscal year, House Republicans  continue wasting time.   Mr. Speaker, the legislation before us includes a six year  reauthorization of the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP),  which provides health coverage to nine million children, and which  Republicans allowed to lapse on September 30, 2017.   In contrast, making CHIP permanent would not only provide long-term  stability for families, providers, and states, it would save $6 billion  according to the Congressional Budget Office.   Republicans are only just now getting around to reauthorizing the  program because they wasted months on efforts to repeal the Affordable  Care Act and enact unpaid for tax cuts for the wealthy.   This resolution includes additional tax cuts totaling over $26  billion, including a two year delay of the medical device and Cadillac  taxes, and a one year delay of the health insurance tax.   At the same time, the resolution fails to address numerous other  expired and expiring health priorities, from funding for community  health centers to waiving caps on therapy services for seniors on  Medicare, to preventing cuts to safety net hospitals.   Mr. Speaker, despite controlling the House, Senate, and the White  House, Republicans have not funded the government for the entire year,  even though we are already four months into the fiscal year.   Because Republicans refuse to work with Democrats and compromise on  how to provide relief from the BCA's sequester level spending caps,  they are lurching from CR to CR--degrading the readiness of our  military and preventing government agencies from properly serving the  American people.   This is not a responsible way to govern.   Therefore, I cannot support the Rule or the underlying bill.   Instead, Republicans need to work across the aisle with Democrats and  get our work done--including upholding the long-standing precedent of  agreeing to parity when providing relief from sequester caps.    * * *    Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to Rules Committee  Print 115-55, legislation extending the Continuing Resolution now in  effect for another month, or until February 16, 2018.   But before I proceed further, I want to note--and Americans needs to  know--that this is not a spending bill; it is instead an affirmation of  the House Republicans' inability to govern.   This is the fourth time House Republicans have chosen to kick the can  down the road rather than work with Democrats to come to a necessary  bipartisan agreement to lift the Budget Control Act (BCA) spending  caps, giving appropriators the direction they need for full-year  funding bills.   The reason given for passing each of the prior Continuing Resolutions  was that the extra time was needed to reach a comprehensive agreement  to fund government operations in a fair and balanced way.   Yet, even with the extra time, House Republicans made no progress  during any of the previous extensions.   This should not be surprising; the House GOP is carrying the water  for the president, who a few months ago said ``we need a big beautiful  shutdown.''   Mr. Speaker, I cannot support a CR that does not include full funding  for disaster recovery, extends additional health access for veterans,  provides funding to combat the opioid epidemic, and protects pensions.   Most important, it is outrageous that House Republicans would bring  to the floor and request support for a fourth CR extension that does  not address and resolve the crisis the Republican Administration has  inflicted on 800,000 Dreamers and their families, including 124,000  Dreamers in my home state of Texas.   Instead of acting responsibly to address these issues and fund the  government for the remainder of the fiscal year, House Republicans  continue wasting time.   This is not appropriations; this is a stop-gap funding measure to  save ourselves from collapse.   Mr. Speaker, the legislation before us includes a six year  reauthorization of the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP),  which provides health coverage to nine million children, and which  Republicans allowed to lapse on September 30, 2017.   This is not a meaningful extension.

Republicans are only just now getting around to reauthorizing the  program because they wasted months on efforts to repeal the Affordable  Care Act and enact unpaid for tax cuts for the wealthy.   I know firsthand about the important work done through CHIP.   My state is home to the Texas Children's Hospital. Any Republican who  believes it is acceptable to play politics with children's health  clearly does not appreciate the work done there.   This CR includes additional tax cuts totaling over $26 billion,  including a two year delay of the medical device and Cadillac taxes,  and a one year delay of the health insurance tax.   At the same time, the resolution fails to address numerous other  expired and expiring health priorities, from funding for community  health centers to waiving caps on therapy services for seniors on  Medicare, to preventing cuts to safety net hospitals.   Mr. Speaker, despite controlling the House, Senate, and the White  House, Republicans have not funded the government for the entire year,  even though we are already four months into the fiscal year.  [[Page H536]]    Democrats, meanwhile, have done the work with which we were tasked. I  am a member of the Budget committee and we Democrats proposed a budget  that:   Respected the needs of all Americans, including those who serve  bravely in the Department of Defense;   Honored the sacrifice of our heroes in uniform;   Protected programs like CHIP, made investments in infrastructure and  ensured that Americans have access to quality healthcare.   Because Republicans refuse to work with Democrats and compromise on  how to provide relief from the BCA's sequester level spending caps,  they are lurching from CR to CR--degrading the readiness of our  military and preventing government agencies from properly serving the  American people.   This is not a responsible way to govern; therefore, I cannot support  this bill.   House Republicans need to work across the aisle with Democrats and  get our work done--including upholding the long-standing precedent of  agreeing to parity when providing relief from sequester caps.    Mr. Speaker, let me tell you what we did not do  today for the American people's enhancement.   What we did not do today is provide for enlisted men and women. We  need to increase compensation for their families who are on food  stamps. We did nothing for them today.   We did nothing for Rose Escobar and her husband. Her husband was  departed to El Salvador, a place where he has never been. They have two  children and live in Houston, Texas. We have been pleading for his case  to be reviewed. He is a DREAMer. He is DACA-eligible. He was managing a  paint store. He was buying a house. We did nothing for him today.   Who else did we not do anything for?   The millions of people who use community health clinics and whose  funding will expire. For 25 years, Central Care has been the facility  that has served African Americans, Hispanics, and others for fee-for- service and Medicaid. We did absolutely nothing for them.   So we should not be afraid of stopping this government, if we have to  do it, because we need to do something for the DREAMers. We need to do  something for people who don't have healthcare and have to use  federally qualified health centers.   My God, we need to do something for the enlisted men and women whose  families are on food stamps and whose salaries are not commensurate  with the sacrifice they make.   I am standing, Mr. Speaker, with each and every one of them.                            ____________________
