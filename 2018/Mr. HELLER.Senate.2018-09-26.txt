 Madam President, while it has been nearly a year since a  madman's actions devastated Las Vegas, the shock and pain related to  October 1 still remains today.   Fifty-eight innocent people lost their lives. Over 800 people were  injured, and many of them continue to face a long road to physical and  emotional recovery. Know that you are not alone on that road--we  support you and we are praying for you.   Our community is still grieving, and it will never be the same, but  hatred and fear will not win that night. That is because even though  one man's horrific actions exposed humanity at its worst, what followed  were countless stories of true heroism and humanity at its very best.   Las Vegas showed the world what it meant to be Vegas Strong, and I  had the honor of experiencing it firsthand in the eyes and voices of  those who survived and those who were eager to help others. On that  tragic night, so many ordinary Nevadans made the choice to be  extraordinary. Let me give you a couple examples.   They stayed on the field to help the wounded as shots continued to  rain down. They took their shirts off their backs, used their belts as  tourniquets, applied pressure to help stop a stranger from bleeding to  death. Some made stretchers on the spot using the festival barriers.  Some used their trucks and vehicles to transport the wounded to the  hospital. For example, Taylor Winston, a marine and Iraq war veteran,  managed to escape the gunfire. He helped several people over the fence  when they took cover. Then he found an abandoned vehicle, turned it  into a makeshift ambulance. After rushing multiple people to the  hospital, he turned around and went back. He ultimately drove around 30  injured people to the hospital.   That night, police officers also covered concertgoers, shielded them  from gunfire, and directed them to safety. Firefighters, paramedics,  ambulance drivers, who had never encountered anything as horrific as  that carnage of October 1, plunged into danger to save lives without  hesitation, even though they were defenseless, because that is what  they do.   That week I had the privilege of meeting a Las Vegas police officer,  Sergeant Jonathan Riddle. He was stationed a block from the shooting  scene doing traffic control. After shots were fired from Mandalay Bay,  he took off sprinting toward the hotel, even though everyone else was  running away from it.   Dozens of Metro police officers, including Officer Tyler Peterson,  who was on his second day of the job, did the exact same thing. They  rushed toward the firestorm to help in any way they could and of course  to save lives.   When I visited the local hospitals, I was struck by the stories  doctors and nurses shared about concertgoers who  [[Page S6322]]  responded bravely and admirably; stories about people who reacted to  cowardly violence, stood in the face of danger to protect a neighbor, a  friend, a family member, or someone they had never met.   A doctor at UMC put it best when he said, the patients showed  exemplary courage. He told me he spoke to all the patients in the  trauma room. Some of them were strangers who accompanied the person who  sustained injuries while shielding them from bullets. He told me many  of the patients in the emergency room that night said to the doctors:  That person is more seriously injured than I am. Take care of them  first. Come back to me later.   When I visited UMC, I had the opportunity to meet with one of the  respiratory therapists who attended the concert. She showed me her  phone, which had been shattered by a bullet that night. Plastic had  torn through her hand, and it was embedded in her skin. What did she  do? She pulled the shards out of her hand, bandaged it herself, rushed  to the hospital to try to help people who she said needed more help  than she did.   I am so grateful for the staff at our hospitals whose skill, whose  composure and dedication saved one life after another. I am also  grateful for the work of our law enforcement and our first responders  on the scene. Each unit took an all-hands-on-deck approach, and  everyone functioned as one team.   Instead of being frozen by the aftershock of crippling grief, Nevada  mobilized and true leaders emerged. My friend Sheriff Joe Lombardo, who  heads the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, is one of them, but  many of the heroes who emerged in the wake of this tragedy didn't have  a badge. Instead, they were teachers, waiters, security guards, and  construction workers who assumed the responsibility to protect others.   Take the story of Jack Beaton, a man whose final act on Earth was  draping himself over his wife to protect her from deadly bullets or  John, a cab driver, who accelerated toward the screams and chaos and  drove nearly a dozen people to safety.    Everyone banded together. Local organizations and businesses  throughout the State and country stepped up to help. Las Vegas  Convention Center's South Hall was dedicated to family reunification  and support services. Airlines answered the call to provide free  flights to families of victims. Hotels and casinos across Las Vegas  offered free rooms. Lines of people eager to give blood twisted around  Las Vegas. Some even waited in line more than 7 hours just because they  wanted to help in any way they could. Just a few hours after the  injured concertgoers flooded the hospitals in Las Vegas, the Red Cross  encouraged volunteer blood donations. In a statement, the Red Cross  said, ``Last night, tragedy illustrates that it's the blood already on  the shelves that helps during an emergency.''   My wife Lynne and I joined the masses of Nevadans who donated blood  in Las Vegas last October, and on Monday, this October 1, on this day  each year going forward, we will donate blood in recognition of this  anniversary. Members of my staff who want to give blood have committed  to doing the same.   While it may be just a small gesture, it is an important one because  when the city of Las Vegas needed help, patients needed blood, the Red  Cross was able to step in because the inventory was there.   When I returned to Washington, DC, from Las Vegas last October, I  immediately began pursuing every available option to provide relief for  victims and their families, as well as assistance for local law  enforcement and emergency responders. From pressing the Attorney  General to make funding available for victims and their families and  securing funding to cover Nevada's law enforcement overtime costs  relating to the response to the shooting, to leading a bipartisan  resolution recognizing the innocent lives which were lost, working with  Senator Cortez Masto to ask health insurers and our airlines to do  whatever they could to help victims, I worked with this Congress and  this White House to deliver resources to Nevada to try to help in any  way we could.   To help Las Vegas prevent future attacks, I also spoke with the  President on Air Force One on our way out of Nevada last October about  the critical role of Federal funding to protect a city that welcomes  over 40 million people annually.   As a direct result, the criteria used to determine funding that is  allocated to high-threat urban areas for terrorism was updated, and  this year Las Vegas received nearly double the amount of Federal  funding compared to last year. I will never stop working to see that  Nevada has the resources it needs to keep our communities safe.   As President Donald Trump said, this attack was an act of pure evil,  and unity cannot be shattered by evil. He also said the bonds between  the people of the United States cannot broken by violence, and I agree  with him. We are all still in this together, and together we will  continue moving down the long road of recovery by honoring the memory  of those lost and by holding on to the sense of compassion and  community that emerged.   I, like many others, could not only feel the strong sense of family,  faith, and strength in the wake of October 1, I saw it firsthand. The  immeasurable pain, the suffering and devastation inflicted by one man  elicited a profound, innate, and immediate human response from a city  of people who stood side by side during its darkest hour to protect a  friend or a stranger they had never met.   Ronald Reagan once said: ``Those who say that we are in a time when  there are no heroes, they just don't know where to look.''   On October 1 and in the days that followed, the world witnessed a Las  Vegas that they may have not known--a place that has been further  defined by the heroes among us, the ones who sprang into action that  night. That was truly the identity of Las Vegas. Las Vegas is  resilient, and together we will continue to be Vegas Strong.   Thank you.    Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Audrey  Rosenstein of Las Vegas, NV, for her tireless efforts on behalf of  children in need of a family and her work that has distinguished her as  a 2018 Angel in Adoption honoree. After learning of Audrey's story, I  was proud to nominate her for this award, which is presented to  individuals for outstanding contributions to adoption and child welfare  through the Congressional Coalition on Adoption Institute.   Audrey and her husband, Craig, are parents to five biological  children and 10 adopted children. Sixteen years ago, the Rosensteins  decided to fill the empty bedrooms of their adult children with  children in need of a safe and loving environment. Since then, their  family has welcomed 25 foster children into their loving home. As a  father of four, I have great admiration for the Rosensteins who have  opened their heart and home to those who are in need of it most.   In addition to her parenting role, Audrey is committed to serving her  community. Audrey is the president of Fostering Southern Nevada, an  organization that is dedicated to improving foster parent recruitment  and retention. She also works closely with the Clark County Department  of Family Services on the Quality Parenting Initiative, as well as with  Child Haven and Peggy's Closet to help ensure that foster families have  access to the resources that they need.   Audrey was quoted in a Las Vegas Review Journal article saying, ``I'm  hoping we give children a feeling of being loved, important and being a  part of a family. The idea that we've made an impact in someone's life  makes it all worth it.''   I certainly believe that Audrey has made a significant impact on many  young lives, and I believe that Nevada is better off because of her  unwavering commitment to providing young Nevadans with much-needed hope  and love. I offer my deepest appreciation to both Audrey and her  husband Craig for their efforts to care for Southern Nevada's children,  and I ask that all of my colleagues join me in recognizing their  service to our community.                            ____________________
