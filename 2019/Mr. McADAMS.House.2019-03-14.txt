 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the President's  budget proposal, which would increase the Federal deficit from $779  billion in 2018 to $1.1 trillion in 2020. If the goal is to rein in  deficits and debt, this budget represents epic failure.   I am a public servant who takes seriously the responsibility of  spending other people's money. As a freshman Member of the Congress,  the current deficit hole we have dug for ourselves wasn't my doing, but  I was elected to solve problems, not make them worse.   America's $22 trillion debt is a bipartisan problem. Democrats and  Republicans have acted in a way that suggests that debt doesn't matter.  But Utahns know that if it was their small business with books so badly  out of balance, they would soon be out of business.   Our government has been living beyond its means for years, and I  believe it is wrong for one generation to forever burden generations  yet to come.   As a former mayor who had to balance, in bipartisan fashion, a budget  every year, I know these choices aren't easy. But it is our job to roll  up our sleeves, come together, and work out a budget that takes serious  steps toward reducing the dangerous, unsustainable levels of debt in  our country. Those steps are not in the President's budget.                            ____________________
