 Madam Speaker, I yield 3\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from California (Mr. McClintock), the ranking member of the Immigration  and Citizenship Subcommittee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Arizona (Mr. Biggs).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. McCarthy), the distinguished Republican leader.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Steube).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from North Carolina (Mr. Bishop).    Madam Speaker, I yield 3\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Kentucky (Mr. Massie).    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Roy).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Burchett).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Arrington).    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from Texas.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Ohio (Mr. Wenstrup).    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, there is a crisis at the border, I mean, the President  even said so. There is chaos at the border. The crisis and the chaos  have been created by policies of this administration.   We were down at the border 2 weeks ago. Every single Border Patrol  agent we talked to said the crisis has been created by policy changes  made by the Biden administration; specifically, three changes.  [[Page H2014]]    They announced to the world that they weren't going to deport anyone.  Moratorium on deportation. They announced to the world they weren't  going to finish the wall. And, most importantly, they got rid of the  remain in Mexico policy.   And what do we have?   In March, we had the highest number of illegal immigrants coming into  our Nation since they have been keeping records. So it is definitely a  crisis, definitely chaos.   And what do the Democrats do? What do the Democrats do?   Last month, they passed two bills that give amnesty to millions of  illegal immigrants. You can't make this stuff up. And then, today, they  are going to pass a piece of legislation that takes power away from the  Commander in Chief, takes power away from the individual who was on the  ballot and elected, and gives it to the unelected secretary of state  and Secretary of Homeland Security.   I mean, you would think, if they were going to take power away from  the President, they would at least give it to the Vice President. After  all, she is the one who has been put in charge of this thing. They  don't even do that. They don't even do that.   The answer is real simple. What we should be focused on is  reinstating the policies that worked. In fact, again, when we were down  there 2 weeks ago--by the way, we invited the Democrats to go with us,  and they said no. When we were down there 2 weeks ago, every Border  Patrol agent said: Reinstate the policies that were working and we  don't have the problem, we don't have the crisis.   But, no, we couldn't do something that common sense. We couldn't do  something that simple, that basic. They, instead, come with this  legislation.   Reinstate the policies that work. Don't take power away from the  individual who was elected by the American people, the Commander in  Chief. Don't implement crazy policies. Do the things that work. But,  no, that is not what we are going to do.   And then after this bill is done, they are going to say, oh, by the  way, bring in the lawyers. Give access to counsel to people coming into  our country.   It makes absolutely no sense.   One of the speakers earlier said: Out of many, one.   That is so true about this country.   But is it too much to ask to have the many who come into this country  do it legally?   And have policies in place that make sense. Is that too much to ask?   I think most taxpayers, most Americans, think that makes good, common  sense.   This bill does not. I hope we vote it down. I hope we go back to the  policies that work.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from California (Mr. McClintock), the ranking member on the Immigration  Subcommittee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Roy).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  North Carolina (Mr. Cawthorn).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this legislation requires individuals entering our  country at ports of entry, tens of millions of them, who are referred  for secondary inspection to get a lawyer. Yet, Democrats tell us this  is not going to cost the taxpayers anything. I mean, this is some kind  of miracle.   You have a mandate for tens of millions of people coming into our  country, and it is not going to cost Americans any money? I have never  seen a government mandate that didn't cost something. This is amazing.   I remember my days in the State legislature. Local governments were  concerned about unfunded mandates from the State. This may be the  biggest mandate we have ever seen.   But somehow, our agents, who are busting their tails working night  and day right now with this crisis on the border, it is not going to  cost them anything in time and effort.   I think the American taxpayers are smarter than that.   Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr.  Biggs).    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to  gentleman from Arizona.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from Texas (Ms. Van Duyne).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record this cost estimate on H.R.  1573 from the Congressional Budget Office.  [[Page H2021]]              Congressional Budget Office Cost Estimate, April 15, 2021         H.R. 1573 would require the Department of Homeland Security       (DHS) to allow individuals subject to secondary immigration       inspection at U.S. ports of entry to consult with an       attorney, accredited immigration official, family member, or       immigration sponsor during the inspection. The bill also       would require DHS to allow the counsel or interested party to       appear in person at the inspection site to the greatest       extent practicable. (A secondary immigration inspection is       conducted by customs officers if individuals entering the       United States do not have the required documents for entry or       if their information cannot be initially verified.)        Approximately 10.2 million individuals were referred to       secondary inspection at the United States' 328 ports of entry       in 2019. Using information provided by Customs and Border       Protection (CBP), CBO expects that roughly 8 percent of       referrals would request access to counsel each year.       Immigration at ports of entry has declined significantly in       fiscal years 2020 and 2021 because of the coronavirus       pandemic; CBO assumes referrals would return to pre-pandemic       levels beginning in mid-2022.        CBO estimates that CBP would need two new full-time       officers on average at each port of entry to provide security       and transportation services for individuals requesting access       to counsel. (The number of CBP officers stationed at each       port of entry ranges from several individuals to up to       several thousands, and the number of additional officers       needed at each port under the bill would vary by the size of       the port.) CBO estimates that salaries, benefits, and       overtime for the additional staff would cost about $700       million over the 2021-2026 period; such spending would be       subject to the availability of appropriated funds.        Additionally, using information provided by the agency, CBO       expects that 222 ports of entry (nearly two-thirds of all       ports) would need additional space or other upgrades to       accommodate the bill's requirement to allow counsel to appear       in person at inspection sites. Using that same information       and historical patterns of construction costs, CBO estimates       the total cost for construction and operation of the       additional space would total $123 million over the 2021-2026       period.        Specifically, CBO estimates that construction costs at 113       land facilities would total $62 million over the 2021-2026       period, with $10 million spent in subsequent years. CBO       estimates the cost of renting additional space at 109 airport       facilities would total $44 million over the 2021-2026 period.       In addition, CBO estimates the cost of initial setup,       recurring maintenance, and other operational expenses       associated with the additional space would total $17 million       over the 2021-2026 period. All construction and operational       costs would be subject to the availability of appropriated       funds.        The costs of the legislation, detailed in Table 1, fall       within budget function 750 (administration of justice).    Madam Speaker, the gentleman said it wasn't going to cost  anything.   This is straight from the Congressional Budget Office: $825 million  over the next 5 years, this is going to cost. This is based on Customs  and Border Protection telling the CBO what costs they are going to  incur.   So right there it is. He can say it is not there, but the CBO says it  is.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr.  Cline).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Good).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Colorado (Mr. Buck).    Madam Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time is  remaining on both sides?    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Gohmert).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from New Jersey (Mr. Van Drew).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from New York (Ms. Malliotakis).    Madam Speaker, the gentlewoman from New York is exactly  right. When will the Democrats take it seriously? When will the  President go to the border? When will the Vice President go to the  border, the person who is supposed to be in charge of dealing with this  crisis? When will the press be able to enter the holding facilities and  actually show the American people how bad it is, what Ms. Malliotakis  just described?    When will Secretary Mayorkas come in front of the Judiciary  Committee? We have asked for him to come, answer our questions, tell us  how he is dealing with this crisis.   When are the Democrats going to take this seriously? We do. We have  all been down there. We asked them to go. They wouldn't go with us.   The American people understand what is going on, how bad it is. I  just hope the Democrats will deal with it sometime soon.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California  (Mr. Issa).    Madam Speaker, I yield the gentleman from California an  additional 30 seconds.    Madam Speaker, I yield the gentleman from California an  additional 15 seconds.    Madam Speaker, for all the reasons that we have stated  here in the last half hour, we urge a ``no'' vote on this legislation.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
