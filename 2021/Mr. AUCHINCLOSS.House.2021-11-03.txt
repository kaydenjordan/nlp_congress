 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the  inclusion of universal childcare and early education as part of the  President's Build Back Better legislative agenda.   In Massachusetts, a family with two young children spends on average  28 percent of their income on childcare for 1 year. The Build Back  Better Act will provide universal, high-quality, free preschool for  every three-and four-year-old in America. It will ensure that a four- person Massachusetts family making up to $170,000 pays no more than 7  percent of their income on high-quality childcare.   Investing in the health and education of our children is the best  long-term investment our country can make. With our future in mind, we  must provide access to as many families as possible, as soon as  possible. This will require raising provider wages to a living wage  immediately and ensuring that more families can benefit in year one  when we pass the Build Back Better Act.                            ____________________
