 Mr. Speaker, when the Supreme Court overturned Roe v.  Wade, Republicans swore up and down that all they wanted was for the  States to decide.   But this week, in this Congress, they introduced a national criminal  ban on abortion, saying this is what we stand for, this is what we will  do if our party takes the House and Senate.   Their bill is designed for one purpose and will have one effect: to  shred protections women still enjoy in States like New Jersey, where we  codified Roe v. Wade this year.   Let me tell you where the overwhelming majority of folks in New  Jersey stand. We know abortion is a painful and personal issue for many  families. That is precisely why we want and trust women to decide, not  the government. The issue is complicated. Who decides is not.   That is why I will do everything in my power to prevent Congress from  imposing on New Jersey laws that treat women and doctors as criminals  and why we must enshrine the freedoms Roe v. Wade protected in the law  of our land once and for all.                            ____________________
