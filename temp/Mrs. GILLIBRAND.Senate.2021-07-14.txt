 I rise today to call for every Senator to have a  chance to consider and cast a vote on the Military Justice Improvement  and Increasing Prevention Act. This bill would ensure that people in  the military who  [[Page S4895]]  have been subject to sexual assault or other serious crimes get the  justice they deserve.   I know that my colleague from Oklahoma, the ranking member of the  Committee on Armed Services, reached out to our military chiefs for  their thoughts on this bill. While there was, as Army GEN James  McConville wrote, recognition ``that there are concerns with the way  our current process pursues justice for major crimes,'' I understand  that they also have concerns about this legislation, and I would like  to allay those concerns today.   More broadly, the service chiefs' letters all seem to indicate a  misunderstanding of how fundamental this change would be. Marine Corps  Gen. David Berger, for instance, wrote that the bill ``appears to  create a more complex system that could potentially slow the military  justice process.'' Space Force Gen. John Raymond wrote that ``the  proposed changes add a layer of complexity that needs to be fully  understood.''   This bill would streamline, not complicate, the military justice  process. The lawyers who would be making these prosecution decisions  under our legislation are already working on these very cases.   Navy ADM Michael Gilday expressed concern that ``large scale removal  of commanders' authority could cause sailors to doubt the capabilities  of their commanders or to believe that their commanders operate without  the full trust of their superiors.''   That worry is unfounded. Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America  surveyed their members--recent veterans--and 77 percent said that  moving a serious crime like sexual assault out of the chain of command  would have no impact on their view of the commander's authority. Nearly  1 in 10 said that the change would lead them to view their commander as  more of an authority figure.   I would point out that the IRC Chairwoman, Lynn Rosenthal, said:         The IRC rejects the motion that, by moving legal decisions       about prosecution from the command structure, that commanders       would have no role. It's simply not the case. Commanders are       responsible for the climates they create. They're responsible       for working to prevent sexual assault and sexual harassment,       and they're responsible for making sure that victims are       protected when they come forward to report. So, the idea that       they won't have an interest in solving this problem if they       are not making those technical legal decisions, we think, is       simply false.    I trust that our commanders will be able to maintain their authority  and maintain their investment in the welfare of the troops without  being responsible for deciding these serious crimes.   General Berger put it well. He wrote:         I expect commanders to always bear responsibility for their       Marines; changes like those in this bill will never relieve       commanders of their duty to care for and lead their Marines,       including when certain military justice processes are removed       from their control.    There were also questions about whether or not these changes were  needed for all serious crimes. Admiral Gilday wrote that he had ``seen  no evidence that there is a lack of trust among victims for all crimes  for which the punishment exceeds one year of confinement.''   There is evidence. The Department of the Air Force inspector general  conducted a survey in 2020 which found that one in three Black  servicemembers said they believe the military discipline system is  biased against them and that three in five Black servicemembers believe  they do not and will not receive the same benefit of the doubt as their  White peers if they get in trouble. That level of distrust must be  addressed.   General Raymond also suggested a more limited reform, writing that  beyond sexual assault, ``the other offenses are not as complex and do  not require specialized training.'' On the contrary. Crimes included in  our bill, like murder, manslaughter, fraud, and extortion, all present  complex cases, and they deserve to be put in the purview of trained  legal experts.   As you know, Mr. President, our bill has a bright line at felonies.  To be a felony, it has to be a complex crime. Our bill does not include  misdemeanors.   The service chiefs' letters also included calls to put an emphasis on  preventing, rather than prosecuting, these crimes. I, too, would rather  see these crimes not happen, which is why this bill includes various  provisions on prevention efforts. But given the current reality,  prevention is not enough. We must prosecute these serious crimes and  show that there are real consequences for anyone who commits them.  Doing so not only changes the culture, it will remove recidivists from  the ranks, preventing them from committing more crimes.   Right now, there is a deep lack of trust in the current system and  whether or not it can or will deliver justice. That is detrimental to  our armed services. As General Raymond wrote, ``Lack of trust and  reluctance to seek justice are, in themselves, readiness issues.''   I remind my colleagues that our job is to provide oversight and  accountability over the executive branch, including the armed services,  and to ensure that those who serve our country in uniform are being  well served by their government.   As Berger noted, if the Uniform Code of Military Justice does not  adequately ``promote justice'' or ``assist in maintaining good order  and discipline,'' then it must change. The current system does not  adequately promote justice, and it must change. It is our duty and our  obligation to do the work to change it, and this body and every Senator  in it deserves to have a vote.   As if in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent that at a time  to be determined by the majority leader in consultation with the  Republican leader, the Senate Armed Services Committee be discharged  from further consideration of S. 1520 and the Senate proceed to its  consideration; that there be 2 hours for debate equally divided in the  usual form; and that upon the use or yielding back of that time, the  Senate vote on the bill with no intervening action or debate
