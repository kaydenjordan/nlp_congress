 Madam Speaker, abortion care is healthcare.   The Women's Health Protection Act protects the right of healthcare  providers to provide abortion care free from undue burdens.   This bill is needed now more than ever with Texas creating the  harshest most inhumane abortion ban. And for all the men in this room-- that is one missed period. One.   And frankly, I'm old enough to remember what this country looked like  before Roe . . .   Such draconian laws disproportionally impact Black, indigenous,  LGBTQ+ individuals, and especially those experiencing domestic violence  and sexual assault.   Abortion care is essential. Period.
