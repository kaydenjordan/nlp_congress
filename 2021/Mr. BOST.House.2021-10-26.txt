 Madam Speaker, $10,000 a year, an average of $200 a week.  Under the Democrats' IRS surveillance plan, that is all you will need  to spend before they require the IRS to collect personal information on  your bank transactions.   Let's put that in perspective. According to the USDA, an average  family of four on a low budget paid roughly $196 per week for groceries  in 2019. That is almost enough right there to require your bank to turn  over your information.   Now, with skyrocketing inflation and the costs getting higher and  higher--and what if you pay rent, have credit card bills, a car  payment, or need to buy gas that you can drive back and forth to work  to support your family? That can easily exceed the threshold, and  probably five times over.   This proposal is not simply targeting the richest Americans or big  corporations. It means the IRS would have the personal information of  almost every American with a bank account. This is an invasion of your  privacy and a serious cybersecurity risk.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   Madam Speaker, preventing domestic violence and supporting survivors  should never be a partisan issue. Unfortunately, this bill makes it  one.   First, by removing the prohibition on reimbursements for healthcare  services, my colleagues across the aisle would allow for Federal  funding from this bill to be used to pay for abortion services.   Secondly, it includes provisions that will effectively bar faith- based organizations from participating in these domestic violence  prevention and survivor support programs. These organizations play a  vitally important role in providing support to women, children, and  families who are in need.   We should be providing survivors with as many lifelines as we can,  not alienating care providers based on their religious beliefs.   Madam Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on this bill to protect the lives  of the unborn and request we revisit a clean reauthorization of this  legislation.
