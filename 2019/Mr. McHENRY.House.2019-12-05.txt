 Madam Chair, I thank the ranking member of the Investor  Protection, Entrepreneurship, and Capital Markets Subcommittee, Mr.  Huizenga, for his good work in committee and working on important  legislation for economic growth and for his constituents in Michigan.   Madam Chair, preventing and punishing bad actors for illegal insider  trading is one of the top priorities of Republicans on the House  Financial Services Committee because this illegal activity hurts  everyday Main Street investors as well as the integrity and the  efficiency of our markets.   Trading on material insider information in breach of a fiduciary duty  is currently prohibited by court-made law under the antifraud  provisions of the Federal securities laws that we have. The Securities  and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice have the power to  bring insider trading cases, and both agencies regularly exercise this  power and have done so for decades.   Our body of insider trading laws has been developed through those  decades of judicial precedent to protect investors and the markets by  punishing bad actors who illegally trade on insider information.   Codifying nuanced case law and regulations that have been developed  over decades into a single statute is really difficult. It is a very  difficult undertaking, and it is, really, a very delicate piece of  legislating that must occur.   Both Republicans and Democrats who have served on the Securities and  Exchange Commission have expressed concerns about Congress drafting a  statute that accurately captures this extensive and expansive body  of law without expanding it into new areas, inadvertently, perhaps, or  perfectly by design in some areas.    Moreover, bipartisanship is never easy. It is a give-and-take. It is  a difficult process. I appreciate the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr.  Himes)  [[Page H9274]]  for his willingness to work with us in a bipartisan manner.   The bill on the floor today is not perfect, and, as the gentleman  from Connecticut knows, I have several concerns with this bill.   I have concerns about the lack of an explicit personal benefit test  consistent with Supreme Court precedent.   I am concerned that ambiguous language currently in the bill, such as  ``relating to the market,'' is ripe for activist judges and overzealous  prosecutors and private plaintiffs to exploit, leading to greater  uncertainty for anyone involved in investing. That is not what we want;  that is not what we seek; and that should not be this undertaking. And  I also don't believe that that is the intention of my colleague from  Connecticut in the drafting of this bill.   I am also troubled that the Rules Committee print before us does not  include an exclusivity provision establishing that this bill is the  insider trading law rather than just an additional action around  insider trading.   Finally, the Rules Committee print includes a rule of construction  section that has yet to be vetted through the Financial Services  Committee; and without a full understanding of the implications of this  language, the bill could further open the door for activist judges,  overzealous prosecutors, and trial lawyers, creating even more  confusion around insider trading law.                                time  1345    That is not good for investors. That is not good for our markets. It  is not good for anyone outside of a narrow few that personally benefit  through fees around lawsuits.   My amendment, which I will offer in a minute, addresses some of these  concerns, and I appreciate my colleague from Connecticut, and I  appreciate the chair of the Financial Services Committee, Ms. Waters,  for their engagement so that we can actually come to a bipartisan  agreement on this important act.   Now, Republicans continue to support sensible bipartisan insider  trading bills, such as the one that Chairwoman Waters and I brought  forth, or she brought forth, as the first action of our committee on  this House floor in this Congress, which was promoting Transparent  Standards for Corporate Insiders Act, which we passed out of this  Chamber. And starting off with the fact that we are going to be tough  on bad actors from the Financial Services Committee and doing it in a  bipartisan way shows our seriousness. And this bill before us is an  addition to that seriousness that we take against bad actors in our  area of jurisdiction.   Finally, I would say this: We currently have out of decades of  lawsuits, decades of regulatory enforcement, we have the greatest  clarity on insider trading that we have ever had in this Nation, and  that is due to two Supreme Court cases, in particular, giving us  serious rules of the road. And I think that clarity is good. And what  we want out of this legislation is to put in statute what is confirmed  and established currently in the marketplace and currently in the  courts of law.   This is not to create more confusion or more lawsuits, but rather,  codify what is a well-regulated, bright-line space that we currently  have. And we want to take that consistency that we currently have and  establish it in statute. And that is the reason why Republicans have  engaged deeply with Democrats over the last 5 months to come to some  reasonable conclusion on this important matter of banning insider  trading.   So Congress will have its say. I believe we will have a bipartisan  vote for final passage, if my amendment is adopted, and I would hope  that that would take place. And we have had good conversations along  those lines, and I think we have workable language that could be  acceptable to all in this body.   I want to thank everyone who has participated, but most particularly  Mr. Himes from Connecticut. While we don't agree on every issue--heck,  I don't think you would get reelected in Connecticut if you agreed with  me on every issue, nor I in North Carolina in my district-- bipartisanship is a hard thing, but if we are going to do big,  important things, we have to try for that. And when you are in the  majority, it is implicit you have more votes than those in the  minority.   So Democrats could pass this bill on their own. They could. And if  they wanted to just use this as a political issue, they could just jam  the language they have; they could, right? But it was your willingness  to reach out, so that we could actually have a big bipartisan vote,  rather than a narrow victory. That is also something that is a marker,  that most in this country don't hear about, that we actually do talk.  We may disagree on big things, we may, and from time to time Chairwoman  Waters and I have had our public disagreements, but at the same time we  have been able to come to terms on important things in our jurisdiction  and get things done.   So while that is not the everyday case for this Congress, when it  happens, I think we should actually acknowledge it. Not that anybody is  going to pat us on the back for it, but we should acknowledge it.   I thank my colleagues on the Democrat side of the aisle for their  work, and I thank my colleagues on the Republican side of the aisle for  their work, as well.    Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, as I just mentioned a few minutes ago, I  have concerns with H.R. 2534, the Insider Trading Prohibition Act in  its current form. And, Madam Chair, my amendment addresses several of  these concerns and improves this bill to better demonstrate  congressional intent of codifying current insider trading law and not  expanding it.   I thank the bill's sponsor, the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr.  Himes) and his staff for their diligence and patience in working with  us over the last few months and over the recent Thanksgiving holiday. I  also want to thank both of our staffs, as well as the Waters' staff.  And I want to thank Mr. Himes for agreeing to support this amendment in  order to make this underlying bill a bipartisan approach to codify  insider trading law and punish bad actors.   My amendment reflects Republican priorities discussed at our May  markup, such as the inclusion of an explicit personal benefit test  consistent with Supreme Court precedent, the removal of the novel rule  of construction section from the Rules print of this bill, and a  clarification of ambiguous words to ensure judges and prosecutors know  that this bill is not intended to expand or create new insider trading  liability.  [[Page H9276]]    The bill as drafted does not explicitly include the so-called  personal benefit test, a significant element of insider trading law  that prosecutors must currently satisfy in certain insider trading  cases. In the 2016 Salman case, the Supreme Court noted that in order  for a violation to have occurred, the insider or ``tipper'' providing  the material, nonpublic information must have received a direct or  indirect personal benefit, including but not limited to, pecuniary  gain, reputational benefit, or a gift of confidential information to a  trading relative or friend.   Including an explicit personal benefit test, as set forth by the  Supreme Court, ensures that this important test cannot be read more  broadly by judges than the Supreme Court has allowed, and also, this  prevents activist judges and overzealous prosecutors from reading the  test out of law entirely.   My amendment also clarifies the ambiguities within the ``relating to  the market'' phrasing in the underlying bill. This phrase ``relating to  the market'' is not a legal term of art defined within the existing  body of insider trading law, nor is it defined in this bill. It is  entirely plausible for an activist judge or a rogue prosecutor to  interpret this phrase far more broadly than the drafters of the bill  intended.   This amendment provides a limiting principle by applying only to  nonpublic information that has or is reasonably expected to have a  material effect on the market price of a security. This ensures that  the statute will still capture cases where the receipt of material,  nonpublic information was not from the company itself, but from another  source. This is referenced in the Supreme Court's 1987 Carpenter  decision.   Finally, my amendment strikes the rule of construction section in the  underlying bill that was not reviewed or debated in the House Financial  Services Committee. I believe this provision is, at best, unnecessary  and at worst, could have been read as giving a congressional stamp of  approval for a poorly reasoned judicial set of decisions.                                time  1400    As such, my amendment would ensure that Congress' intent is to simply  codify existing law, not expand liability or create additional defenses  for those accused of insider trading. This is about codifying what is  already existent, period, end of statement.   That being said, my amendment does not achieve all the Republican  goals that we have previously outlined in our committee markup and  committee hearing. Unfortunately, the bill, even if it is amended by  this amendment, still will not contain an exclusivity provision to make  this the exclusive law of the land for insider trading.   While my amendment does not make this bill perfect, it does allow for  Congress to exercise its Article I authority to produce a comprehensive  insider trading law for the first time and does so in a bipartisan  manner that simply intends, we believe, to codify current insider  trading law without expanding liability to good-faith people innocent  under the law.   Mr. Chair, I urge its adoption, and I thank the bill's sponsor for  working with us on it.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
