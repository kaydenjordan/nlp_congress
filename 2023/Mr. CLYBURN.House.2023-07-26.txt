 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me the  time.   I rise to take note of the sad irony that the extreme Republican  majority is bringing this appropriations bill to the floor on the 75th  anniversary of President Truman's desegregation of the Armed Forces.   President Truman's heritage would suggest that he would be an  unlikely champion for civil rights. He grew up in a segregated town in  Missouri, in a family that owned slaves and defended slavery.   When our 33rd President heard of the blinding of Sergeant Isaac  Woodard, Jr., a decorated Black World War II veteran who was brutally  attacked by a police officer while traveling home to  [[Page H3969]]  Winnsboro, South Carolina, on a Greyhound bus--still in his uniform  after being honorably discharged--Truman was moved to forsake his  upbringing and desegregate the Armed Forces.   President Truman courageously recognized and acted to further our  Nation's fundamental obligation to our servicemembers and veterans,  regardless of their backgrounds.   We should be working to build upon the progress he made, but  regrettably, the MILCON-VA bill that the majority is bringing to the  floor today would constitute a significant step backward.   This ill-conceived legislation, in addition to reducing funds for the  military construction projects that are fundamental to our  servicemembers' quality of life, is also an attack on the dignity of  our veterans.   It attacks the dignity of women veterans by blocking reproductive  healthcare when their health is endangered.   It attacks the dignity of veterans in need of gender-affirming care  by blocking the VA from providing it, even if it is recommended by a  doctor.   It attacks the dignity of veterans and all Americans of color and  others who have been historically underserved, marginalized, and  adversely affected by persistent poverty and inequality by blocking the  Biden administration's ongoing efforts to advance equity.   President Truman recognized that our national security is enhanced by  respecting the dignity of all American patriots who sacrifice to defend  it. This legislation being brought today by the extreme Republican  majority is at odds with that principle.                                time  1245    If the Members of today's extreme Republican majority were in office  in 1948, I fear they would have attacked President Truman's  desegregation order as an unacceptable diversity, equity, and inclusion  measure, which section 417 of this legislation would ban.   I fear that if this bill were enacted into law, it would prevent the  military from discussing the blinding of Sergeant Isaac Woodard and its  influence on President Truman because the topic would be deemed  critical race theory, which would be banned by section 415, rather than  the historical fact that it was.   Will this section ban our military leaders from making repairs to the  GI Bill benefits that were denied Black World War II veterans?   Mr. Speaker, when President Truman was informed of Isaac Woodard's  blinding, he reportedly exclaimed: ``My God, I had no idea it was as  terrible as that. We have got to do something.'' Sadly, this extreme  Republican majority seems to find new ways to be terrible every week.   I rise in opposition to the consideration of this awful bill because  Democrats know we have got to do something to prevent them from pushing  us off our trek toward a more perfect Union that President Truman so  courageously advanced 75 years ago today.
