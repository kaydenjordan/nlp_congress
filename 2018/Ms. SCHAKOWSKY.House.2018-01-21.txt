 Mr. Speaker, well, it is day two of the Trump  shutdown, the first government shutdown in history when one party has  control of the House, the Senate, and the White House. But I believe  that the issues at the heart of this debate actually have support from  a majority of Americans and a majority in Congress. So I ask my  Republican colleagues:   Who are the 218 Republicans who would vote against funding community  health centers as well as the Children Health Insurance Program?   Who are the 218 Republicans who oppose addressing veterans' programs,  workers' pensions, and the opioid epidemic?   And, yes, who are the 218 Republicans who would vote against the  young DACA recipients and the Dream Act?   We don't lack votes. We lack willingness from President Trump and  Republican leadership to negotiate.   I am here. We are here ready to work. The Democrats want to come  together with the Republicans on a bipartisan deal to end the Trump  shutdown.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R. 4872, the End  the Shutdown Act of 2018, a continuing resolution that would  immediately reopen the government through Tuesday while negotiations  continue on a budget agreement that adheres to parity and on other  critical issues.
