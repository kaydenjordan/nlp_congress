 Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 1449) to designate the facility of the United  States Postal Service located at 3033 203rd Street in Olympia Fields,  Illinois, as the ``Captain Robert L. Martin Post Office''.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1449         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. CAPTAIN ROBERT L. MARTIN POST OFFICE.         (a) Designation.--The facility of the United States Postal       Service located at 3033 203rd Street in Olympia Fields,       Illinois, shall be known and designated as the ``Captain       Robert L. Martin Post Office''.        (b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation,       document, paper, or other record of the United States to the       facility referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be       a reference to the ``Captain Robert L. Martin Post Office''.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend  their remarks and include extraneous material on this measure.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues in consideration of  H.R. 1449, to designate the facility of the United States Postal  Service located at 3033 203rd Street in Olympia Fields, Illinois, as  the Captain Robert L. Martin Post Office.   Captain Robert L. Martin was a true American hero dedicated to  serving his country to ensure the continued safety of all Americans.   Robert L. Martin graduated from Iowa State University, where he  completed a civilian pilot training program, and joined the Army Air  Corps in January 1944. Captain Martin was one of the Tuskegee Airmen  during World War II, serving as a combat pilot in the 100th Fighter  Squadron of the 332nd Fighter Group.   During his 64th mission, he was shot down over German-occupied  territory and safely evaded capture for 5 weeks to return across Allied  lines. He left the Army in 1945 with the rank of captain.   His war decorations include the Distinguished Flying Cross, the Air  Medal with 6 oak leaf clusters, and the Purple Heart. Martin was also  awarded the Congressional Medal in 2007 by President George W. Bush at  a ceremony honoring the Tuskegee Airmen.   Having lived in Olympia Fields, Illinois, it would be a tribute to  his life's accomplishments to name the post office there as the Captain  Robert L. Martin Post Office, bringing a source of pride to the  community in honoring a great American hero.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 1198) to designate the facility of the United  States Postal Service located at 404 South Boulder Highway in  Henderson, Nevada, as the ``Henderson Veterans Memorial Post Office  Building''.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1198         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. HENDERSON VETERANS MEMORIAL POST OFFICE BUILDING.         (a) Designation.--The facility of the United States Postal       Service located at 404 South Boulder Highway in Henderson,       Nevada, shall be known and designated as the ``Henderson       Veterans Memorial Post Office Building''.        (b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation,       document, paper, or other record of the United States to the       facility referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be       a reference to the ``Henderson Veterans Memorial Post Office       Building''.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend  their remarks and include extraneous material on this measure.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues in consideration of  H.R. 1198, to designate the facility of the United States Postal  Service, located at 404 South Boulder Highway in Henderson, Nevada, as  the Henderson Veterans Memorial Post Office Building.   Every day, Americans across this great country rely on more than 2  million brave men and women who have committed their lives to ensuring  the comfort and safety of the rest of us by serving in the United  States military.   Today, there are more than 18 million veterans who have served in the  armed services. These brave Americans protect the very foundation of  this great country. Naming a post office to honor the veterans who have  served and sacrificed for us is but a small part of what these brave  men and women deserve from the country to whom they have given so much.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 828) to designate the facility of the United States  Postal Service located at 25 Route 111 in Smithtown, New York, as the  ``Congressman Bill Carney Post Office''.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 828         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. CONGRESSMAN BILL CARNEY POST OFFICE.         (a) Designation.--The facility of the United States Postal       Service located at 25 Route 111 in Smithtown, New York, shall       be known and designated as the ``Congressman Bill Carney Post       Office''.        (b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation,       document, paper, or other record of the United States to the       facility referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be       a reference to the ``Congressman Bill Carney Post Office''.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend  their remarks and include extraneous material on this measure.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues in consideration of  H.R. 828, to designate the facility of the United States Postal  Service, located at 25 Route 111 in Smithtown, New York, as the  Congressman Bill Carney Post Office.   Representative Bill Carney was a man truly committed to public  service. Before serving as a distinguished Member of this body, Bill  not only served the people of Suffolk in their legislature, but also  the United States of America as a member of the Army Medical Corps.   Bill Carney was born in Brooklyn, New York, and went on to serve the  United States Army Medical Corps after graduating from high school.   After leaving the military, Bill began serving in the Suffolk County  legislature before being elected to serve the people of New York's  First Congressional District in 1978.   Representative Carney is remembered not only for his contributions to  this body, but also for the lighthearted personality, humor, and  humility that he brought with him each day he served.   Sadly, Bill Carney died in May of 2017, and he is sorely missed.  Naming a post office in Bill's honor in Suffolk County is the least we  should do to honor the great career and life of Bill Carney.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance my time.    Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support  H.R. 828, as well as the other two postal-naming bills, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
