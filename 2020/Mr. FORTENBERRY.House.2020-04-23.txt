 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Steve called me recently. He has one of the businesses that has been  hardest hit by coronavirus. He is down 90 percent. We talked through  some issues. Steve decided to fight back. He got in line early for the  Paycheck Protection Program and made a decision to bring his employees  back, and then he had a virtual ribbon cutting where he announced his  reopening.   Madam Speaker, our country is in dire need of some good news, and  this PPP has been a bright spot in the trauma that we have all faced  here.   Where I live, Madam Speaker, the banker knows the farmer, the banker  knows the barber, the banker knows the cafe owner. CPAs, financial  advisers, credit unions, we have all pitched in. This is what I call  community solidarity.   It was clear from the beginning that this program would run out of  money, and we have reached that point. This has been a bipartisan  airlift, a lifesaver for so many people who make things with their own  two hands and take care of others under their employ. I wholeheartedly  support this bill.
