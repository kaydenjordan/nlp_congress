 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Illinois for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I join my colleague, Ms. Jenkins, and I appreciate her  support in leading this legislation as we support S. 1616, a bill to  award the Congressional Gold Medal to Senator Bob Dole.   Service, sacrifice, and statesmanship--these are the words that  describe Senator Bob Dole, one of Kansas' proudest native sons and one  of the greatest men to serve and walk the Halls of Congress.   Born and raised in Russell, Kansas, Senator Dole attended my alma  mater, the University of Kansas, where he excelled as a three-sport  varsity athlete for the Jayhawks.   His college career was interrupted by World War II, when he answered  his country's call and enlisted in the U.S. Army. He would distinguish  himself in the service, earning several decorations and becoming  seriously wounded in combat in Italy.   Although those wounds would cause a lifelong disability for him,  Senator Dole did not shy away from the challenges they presented. He  instead used that personal experience to help others, becoming a fierce  advocate for disability rights and the father of the Americans with  Disabilities Act.   His career in public service spanned over 46 years, with his first  election to the Kansas House of Representatives in 1951 and ending with  his Presidential campaign and retirement from the Senate in 1996. His  legislative and political accomplishments during that time are almost  too many to count.   His top priority has always been service to others, whether it is  people with disabilities, Kansas farmers, or his fellow veterans.  Senator Dole has always put his country ahead of himself, and he stayed  grounded in his strong Kansas roots.   I can think of no one more fitting to be recognized with a  Congressional Gold Medal. As a member of the Kansas delegation, I am  truly honored to follow in the footsteps of Senator Dole by serving our  great State and our great country in Congress. He is an inspiration to  me and an enduring example of what statesmanship and public service  should look like.   I ask my colleagues in the House to support this bill and to join me  in working daily to uphold Senator Dole's legacy of service and  civility in Congress.                                time  1745    Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to  the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern).   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the legislation my  colleague, the gentlewoman from Kansas (Ms. Jenkins), has introduced  that would give Bob Dole the Congressional Gold Medal.   I am a liberal from Massachusetts, but Bob Dole is one of my heroes.  I admire him not only for his statesmanship and for his civility, but I  particularly admire him because he has led the effort in this country  and around the world to end hunger.   Nobody that I can think of, other than George McGovern, who worked  with Bob Dole during the 1970s, did more to try to strengthen our  nutrition programs and to make sure that nobody in this country, the  richest country in the history of the world, went hungry. And he worked  in a bipartisan way and ensured that these programs were strengthened  so that we were making great progress toward ending hunger in America.   And then he joined with George McGovern in the formation of the  McGovern-Dole International Food for Education Program. Essentially,  this is a program that expands school feeding initiatives all around  the world, and millions and millions and millions of children are not  only getting fed and getting a nutritious meal, but they are getting  fed in a school setting. So they are getting the nutrition they need,  and they are getting the education that they need so they can be  literate and hopefully lead their countries out of poverty.   The developing world cannot develop with an illiterate population,  and Senator Dole understood the importance of education but also the  importance of nutrition in helping people develop to their potential.   And this McGovern-Dole program has also been incredible in getting  more young girls into schools. In some countries where education isn't  valued for girls, all of a sudden parents are sending their girls to  school because they will get fed, and they will get the nutrition that  they need.   So Senator Dole, in my opinion, not only deserves this, but he  deserves the respect and admiration of everybody in this Chamber,  Democrat and Republican alike.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1  minute to the gentleman.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, he should be an example and an inspiration  to us all. These are very difficult times for our country, and these  are very tumultuous times in Washington, but you look at the example of  Senator Dole and you realize how good this place can be, how good  Congress can be, and how effective Congress can be.   You don't have to agree on everything to agree on something, and I  think that was Senator Dole's guiding principle. Where he could agree  with people on the other side of the aisle, he reached across and got  things done. Where there were disagreements, you know, he fought  passionately for his point of view.   But he represents the kind of civility and the kind of decency that  we need more of in Washington, and so I am  [[Page H6641]]  proud to support this legislation. I congratulate my colleague,  Congresswoman Jenkins, for leading this effort, and I urge all my  colleagues to support it.
