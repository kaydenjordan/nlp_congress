 Mr. President, first, I know you will be taking the  floor in a few minutes. I spoke about the bittersweet mood we all have  of your departure--bitter in the sense that you have done so much for  the Senate, for Vermont, and for America over the years that we will  badly miss you; sweet because you will get to spend more time with  Marcelle, your children, your lovely grandchildren. And you deserve it,  after all these great years of service.   It is one of the most extraordinary records any Senator has compiled  in the history of this country. So thank you for your service and your  continued service through January of 2022.
