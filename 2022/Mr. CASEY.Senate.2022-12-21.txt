 Madam President, I ask consent to speak as in morning       business.         Madam President, I rise today--almost as we get to the       early evening--during this week when Hanukkah, the Festival of Lights,       is being celebrated to speak about the evil of anti-Semitism and the       trauma and darkness it causes in all of America.        This past November 18, I visited the site of the deadliest attack on       the Jewish community in all of American history: the Tree of Life       synagogue in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood of Pittsburgh, PA. A       killer, full of rage, entered the synagogue during Shabbat morning       services on October 27, 2018, and massacred 11 Pennsylvanians from 3       different Jewish congregations and injured 6 others, including 4 law       enforcement officers who had responded in just minutes to the site.       These Jewish Americans who died ranged in age from 64 to 97.        Visiting the site 4 years later this past November was both moving       and disturbing as we walked through a house of worship frozen in time       from that awful day.        The venomous hate that motivated the killer to take so many lives in       a murderous rampage was unabated when he was arrested. He was making       anti-Semitic statements even as he was apprehended and was being       treated by first responders.        The evil that attacked the Jewish worshippers in Philadelphia that       day is the same evil--the very same evil--that targets Americans based       upon their race and gender or whom they love or how they worship. Too       often, unlike any other nation in the world, this evil, this hate, is       coupled with the easy availability of powerful weapons, which results       in the mass shootings we have seen in so many communities in America--      just by way of a very small limited set of examples, Mother Emanuel AME       Church in Charleston, SC; Pulse nightclub in Orlando, FL; a Walmart in       El Paso, TX; a grocery store in Buffalo, NY; and Club Q in Colorado       Springs, CO.        The following data--and these are numbers, but they tell a part of       the story. These numbers, this data, should alarm any American. In       2022, the Anti-Defamation League, which we know as ADL, published an       audit of anti-Semitic incidents and reported over 2,700 anti-Semitic       incidents throughout the United States just in 2021. This was a 34-      percent increase from 2020 and the highest number on record since ADL       began tracking incidents in 1979.        The rise of hate is further documented by congressional testimony       from FBI Director Christopher Wray. At a Senate Judiciary Committee       hearing in August of 2022, Director Wray stated that the ``top domestic       terrorism threat we face continues to be from [domestic violent       extremists] we categorize as racially or ethnically motivated violent       extremists.''        Director Wray later highlighted that the number of FBI investigations       of suspected domestic violent extremists had more than doubled since       the spring of 2020. This continued an upward trend when Director Wray       testified in March of 2021 that investigations had also doubled since       2017 to more than 2,000 investigations and that the number of       investigations into White supremacists had tripled.        Furthermore, on December 12 of this year, the FBI released its annual       hate crime report and reported over 7,200--let me say that number       again: 7,200--hate crime incidents just in 2021, the third largest       number in the past decade. And, of course, December 12 is not the end       of the year.        This number is even more shocking considering the massive       undercounting and lack of data used to compile the report, which the       FBI readily acknowledged. Due to the transition to a new reporting       system, only about two-thirds of police departments across the Nation--      a significant drop from last year--reported data. Some States--for       example, Florida and California--had already almost no reporting, with       only 2 jurisdictions in Florida and 15 in California sending data.       Unfortunately, my home State of Pennsylvania was not far behind, with       just 41 agencies reporting data to the FBI. Several major cities,       including New York, Los Angeles, Miami, and Chicago, did not provide       any statistics or simply reported zero.        So while the underreporting is a concern and must be addressed, it is       even more concerning that we would have likely seen record-high reports       of hate crimes across the Nation had police departments participated at       similar levels as in prior years.        This data is further reinforced by the lived experience of too many       Americans across this Nation.        By way of one example, in a Wall Street Journal article from December       15 entitled ``Antisemitism is Rising at Colleges,'' a student at       Rutgers University in Newark, NJ, spoke of needing to take indirect       routes to class and hiding her Star of David necklace under her shirt       to avoid harassment from other students.        Citing the ADL's ``Audit of Antisemitic Incidents,'' which I       mentioned earlier, this article noted that vandalism, threats, and       slurs on college campuses directed at Jewish students has more than       tripled--tripled--from 41 in 2014 to 155 in 2021.        Every incident, of course, fueled by hate and extremism does not       result in death. Often, as evidenced by the example in the Wall Street       Journal, hateful acts involve vandalism, destruction of property,       bullying, or harassment, just to name a few. But these acts are the       manifestation of evil as well.        Incidents involving such hate, deadly or not, are contrary to       American values, including the values inherent in the inscription on       our currency: E Pluribus Unum--from many, one--one country, one Nation       that is strengthened by our diversity. That is the source of our       strength: our diversity.        People of different ethnicities, faiths, and points of view have come       together over generations to build our democracy and to build the most       powerful Nation on Earth. Any American who claims to support American       values that our people hold dear while engaging in acts that constitute       anti-Semitism is a hypocrite and a threat to all of us. It is a       disgusting perversion of Christianity to make anti-Semitic or other       hateful statements or, worse--worse--to act violently against someone       because they are Jewish, because they are transgender or of a different       race.        From the parable of the Good Samaritan to the Sermon on the Mount,       Jesus taught us how to love and respect all those whom we meet on the       road of life.        Anti-Semitism, racism, or other hateful ideologies are contrary to       our values but, also, not just contrary to American values but contrary       to the values inherent in all religions.        Each of us, as citizens, has a moral and civic obligation to speak       out against anti-Semitism and racism. Those who are public officials or       public figures have a heightened obligation, a duty, to condemn       categorically anti-Semitic acts, rhetoric, or other conduct, whether       those acts, rhetoric, or conduct involve a President, a recording       artist, or an athlete or any other American.        Of course, the U.S. Senate must speak with one voice against anti-      Semitism and racism, both here at home and around the world. The Senate       did act in 2021 to pass the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act after the rise in       hate            [[Page S9747]]            crimes against Asian Americans during the pandemic.        But an action like that cannot be the end of our action. That is why       I was proud to support the Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act when       Senate Democrats tried to pass it in May after the racially motivated       mass shooting in Buffalo.        And the leader of that effort is our distinguished majority whip,       Senator Durbin, who is with us here on the floor. And I appreciate his       work on this, trying to pass that legislation.        I was also pleased that on December 12 the Biden administration       announced a new interagency task force charged with developing and       coordinating a national strategy to counter anti-Semitism and other       forms of bias and discrimination in the United States.        This announcement followed in response to a December 5 letter that I       joined, along with 124 bipartisan colleagues in the House and Senate,       calling on President Biden to take a ``whole-of-government approach''       to address the ``scourge of antisemitism,'' including establishing an       interagency task force.        So I stand ready, as I know many here do in the Senate, to work with       colleagues in the new Congress to ensure that we are taking steps       necessary to combat this growing threat of hate and extremism.        But even in these dark times, it is critical to hold up and recognize       those who are lighting the path forward to ending identity-based hate.       The Tree of Life community is not merely lighting the path for       Pittsburgh but for the Nation and, indeed, for the world by coming       together to establish the ``REMEMBER. REBUILD. RENEW.'' campaign.       ``REMEMBER. REBUILD. RENEW.'' That is their campaign.        In the ``City of Bridges,'' as Pittsburgh is known throughout the       world, it is fitting that the Tree of Life community--that members of       that congregation and synagogue--is trying to connect communities       across the world as a leader in the fight against anti-Semitism and       other forms of identity-based hate.        Rooted in honoring and remembering those who tragically lost their       lives on October 27, 2018, the community will repair and preserve the       Tree of Life building as a historic synagogue while establishing a       museum, memorial, and educational center to inspire and empower those       in that community and around the world to stand up against anti-      Semitism.        Never before have we seen such a transformative, multidisciplinary       approach under one roof and on such hallowed ground to bring people       together in our fight against hate and anti-Semitism.        As Rabbi Myers shared with me, Tree of Life is striving to transform       the site of a tragedy into one of hope and inspiration for future       generations to come. It is striving to fulfill the longstanding Jewish       concept of tikkun olam, to repair the world. Through remembrance and       renewal, Tree of Life is lighting the way forward for all of us to       finally--finally--counter the root causes of hate and end, once and for       all, anti-Semitism.        We owe it to every survivor, family member, and the community members       impacted to join them on this important journey. May the memories of       the victims at Tree of Life be for us a blessing.                                Authorizing Appointment of Escort Committee              Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the President of the       Senate be authorized to appoint a committee on the part of the Senate       to join with a like committee on the part of the House of       Representatives to escort His Excellency, Volodymyr Zelenskyy,       President of Ukraine, into the House Chamber for the joint meeting on       Wednesday, December 21, 2022.         I yield the floor.        I suggest the absence of a quorum.
