 Madam Speaker, as Maya Angelou said, ``When someone shows  you who they are, believe them the first time.''  [[Page H6346]]    Despite Paul Gosar's history of dangerous rhetoric, and despite his  conduct showing him to be a dangerous extremist, he is still here in  Congress. Now he has depicted himself killing one of our colleagues and  the President of the United States.   Never doubt that leaders' calls for violence can lead to actual  violence. We have seen it throughout the world, and we have seen it  right here on January 6.    Nor should the actions of his taxpayer-paid staff in creating and  disseminating this vile video be ignored. They are grown adults, and  they have cultivated a hostile work environment for the subject of this  disgusting video and for her staff.   Paul Gosar has glorified violence against a duly elected official who  came here to serve her district. She, nor any of us, sign up for this  kind of abuse. Our families should not have to live with the fear that  we will be the subject of violent attacks.   Paul Gosar has shown who he is. Believe him. Censure him.
