 Madam Speaker, I speak in favor of this amendment.   On March 27, 2 weeks after the U.S. Government had declared a state  of emergency due to the COVID-19 virus, leaders of the Mashpee  Wampanoag Tribe, the Tribe that helped the Pilgrim forefathers survive  the devastation of illness and starvation in their first winter,  received a phone call from the U.S. Secretary of the Interior's office.   Now, you would think that maybe they were going to see how the Tribe  was doing, a Tribe that is disproportionately affected by the virus.  Maybe they were calling to see if they needed any help. Regrettably,  that wasn't the case.   In an act with discretionary timing, and one of the most  reprehensible acts I have witnessed since I have been here in this  Congress, they were informing them that, on behalf the U.S. Government,  they were taking away their land, their buildings, their medical  center, and leaving them in financial ruins.   Now, fortunately, the D.C. Circuit judge rebuffed this unconscionable  act, calling it arbitrary, capricious, contrary to law, and unusually  so, calling it an abuse of power.   Now, due to the close relationship between the White House and the  lobbying group that is dealing with this, this could rear its ugly head  again.   This amendment is different than the three that we passed before, in  terms of legislation. It is much more narrow. All it does is make sure  the Tribe, the Tribe which helped the Pilgrims survive their first  year, is allowed to do so themselves in the coming year.
