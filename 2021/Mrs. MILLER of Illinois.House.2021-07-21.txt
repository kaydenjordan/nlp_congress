 Madam Speaker, in October of 2019,  California passed legislation requiring public universities to provide  chemical abortion pills to female students starting in 2023.   Chemical abortions have increased. Actually, it has skyrocketed in  the past 20 years from just 5 percent in 2001 to 39 percent of all  abortions in 2017.   We want women across the country to know that we are there for them  as a pro-life movement, and there are so many other safe options other  than choosing abortion.   Congress must act now, not just to protect innocent babies from  abortion, but to protect the vulnerable women from the lies of the  abortion industry and the potential horrible physical, emotional, and  spiritual damage of having a chemical abortion.   This is why I have joined Congressman Chip Roy and Senator Steve  Daines in introducing the Protecting Life on College Campus Act.   The Protecting Life on College Campus Act would uphold the Hyde  amendment and prohibit Federal funds to go to universities that provide  chemical abortion pills to students.   This would be another step in the right direction to save the lives  of the unborn and protect the safety of women and our families.   The fight for life in the United States has never been more important  than today. For the first time in 40 years, the Hyde amendment was  excluded from the spending bill introduced in Congress.   Further, it was even cleared by the House Appropriations Subcommittee  on Labor and Health and Human Services.   The rest of my Republican colleagues and I are ready to fight and  demand that Hyde be reinstated into this year's bill.
