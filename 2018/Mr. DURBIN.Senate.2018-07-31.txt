 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in  morning business.    Mr. President, from the earliest moments in the  Presidential campaign, Donald Trump made it clear that immigration was  an important issue to his election. You will recall statements that he  made about the construction of the wall on the southern border of the  United States. He called it the big, glorious, gorgeous 2,000-mile  wall, and he promised us that the Mexicans would pay for it. Over and  over he promised us they would pay for it. That wasn't the only  reference made to immigration during the course of the campaign, so it  came as no surprise, when President Trump was elected, that immigration  became a major issue in his administration.   It is ironic, in a way, that this Nation of immigrants called America  would have such struggles these days with the issue of immigration.  Many of us can trace our origins to recent immigrants. In my own case,  my mother was an immigrant to this country, and here her son turned out  to have a full-time government job as a U.S. Senator.   My story is my family's story, but it is also America's story of how  the sons and daughters of immigrants came here and tried to--and in  many ways did--make a difference in the country we live in. Despite  that fact, despite the Statue of Liberty and all of our heritage from  immigrants coming to America, there has always been a political voice  and a political force that has resisted more immigration.   There were people who have said: We have enough. They are going to  take our jobs. They don't practice our religions. They don't speak our  language. Their food smells funny. We don't like the way they dress.   Over the course of decades, if not centuries, that was always part of  the American political life, but it was a minority position. With the  Trump administration, immigration issues have been front and center. We  have seen that many times.   Years ago, I introduced the Dream Act. The Dream Act said that if you  were brought to this country, undocumented as a baby, as a child, you  should have a chance to earn your way to legal status to become part of  America's future. I have tried to pass that bill, and I have been  successful in the Senate a few times. We have been successful in the  House, but it has never made it through both Chambers to become the law  of the land.   President Obama created a program called DACA, based on the Dream  Act, which allowed those who qualified to have 2-year temporary,  renewable status, protected from deportation, with the legal right to  work.   Last year, President Trump abolished the program, and 790,000 young  people who were protected--who had registered with the government, who  had paid a filing fee, who had gone through a criminal background check  and were going to school and working--were told their protection would  go away.   Were it not for a court decision to protect them, many of them would  be deported today. But that court decision can change any day, any  week, any month.   We tried in February on the floor of the Senate to come up with a  bipartisan approach to solving this problem, but we fell short. When a  bipartisan group of Senators came up with a proposal, which I supported  and which received over 50 votes, at the end of the day, the Trump  administration opposed it, so it went down, and we did not answer the  need for the passage of legislation.   There is a new issue before us, one most Americans are well aware of;  that is, the President's announcement of what is known as the zero  tolerance policy. It started at the beginning of April, and it was a  policy by our government to literally arrest and charge every person  who came to this border without legal status.   You could come to the United States without legal status and apply to  become a person protected with asylum or a refugee. Just coming to the  border itself is not a crime if you come for that purpose.   But this new zero tolerance policy said that they would charge every  person who came to the border as a criminal. Well, one thing led to  another because once a person has been charged as a criminal--even as a  misdemeanant criminal--in most circumstances, their children, minors in  their custody, are removed from them. That is exactly what happened. In  2,700 cases, our government, under the President's zero tolerance  policy, forcibly removed children from their parents.  [[Page S5475]]    We had a hearing on it today, and it is the reason I have come to the  floor. We asked the heads of the agencies who created this policy some  basic questions. We asked them if they had created a means of  determining what would happen to the children, where the parents would  be, and how they would be reunited. The sad answer, the real answer, is  no.   So when a Federal judge in Southern California stepped in and said  that the zero tolerance policy must end, and now there must be a  reunification of these families--parents with their children--it turned  out that this Government of the United States of America did not have  the records to reunite parents and children.   They literally turned thousands of people loose, trying to match up  these kids with their parents--kids who had been separated by our  government at the border. You think to yourself, as one of my  colleagues said: When you take your child into Chuck E. Cheese, they  sometimes give them little plastic bracelets so that they don't get  lost and we know who that little child belongs to.   Our Federal Government didn't do that, and, as a consequence,  thousands--thousands--of children were turned loose into a system, and  when the court order was applied we couldn't comply; we couldn't  reunify them.   Where are we today? Today, out of the 2,700 or more children who were  separated from their parents, we have reunified about 2,000 of them,  roughly, but for 711, we are still short of bringing the reunification  together; the parents are not reunited with their children. For 94 of  these children, we do not have information. We don't know where their  parents are. Think about that.   In the United States of America, with our vast wealth and talent and  resources and computers, we removed children from their families and  tossed them into the bureaucratic sea. I am not sure how this story is  going to end, but it is a pretty sad situation.   One of my colleagues, Senator Blumenthal from Connecticut, asked the  assembled representatives of the Trump administration the following  question: Do you believe that the zero tolerance policy was a success?  Not one of them did. Do you believe that the United States should  engage in further family separation? Not one of them did.   So we know it was a mistake, and we know there are still victims out  there--kids who have not been reunited. The obvious question is: What  can we do about it? Well, we can use every resource at our disposal to  make sure that we bring these children back in contact with their  parents.   I went to one of the shelters in Chicago about 5 weeks ago to meet  with 10 of these kids. Their ages ranged from about 5 years of age to  14, and the youngest ones were from Central America and Mexico. They  came into the room. I remember two little girls holding hands, walking  into the room, cutest little things, and they looked like twins because  their hair was fixed the same way. It turns out that they were not  twins; they were not even sisters. One of the little girls said: ``No,  amigas''--friends.   I watched them. They held on to one another through the entire  meeting, and as they left the room, they held hands together. They were  clinging to the only connectivity--the only anchors--in their lives:  other children who were going through the same experience. They had  been forcibly separated from their parents.   I brought some cards with me, made by kids of my staff in Chicago-- just cards with stickers on them, construction paper with little  messages, some in Spanish, some in English. I let the kids choose from  these cards if they wanted them. Every single one of them took one and  hung on to it like it was a Christmas gift.   What is it like for these children to be separated at that early age?  I am not an expert. I have been a dad and a grandfather, if that gives  me any claim to expertise. But when you turn to the experts, the  pediatric physicians, they say that it is institutional child abuse to  forcibly remove children from their parents and set them off in a  strange setting, this institutional setting, for weeks and for months,  and that is exactly what we did.   The President finally realized that he was wrong and reversed the  policy, but the kids are still there. The kids have not been united,  and we have not solved the problems that face this country.   There are a lot of things that divide Democrats and Republicans in  this town. I hope there are several things we can all agree on.   No. 1, the United States needs border security. We can't have open  borders for everyone who wants to come to this country. It wouldn't  work, it wouldn't be safe, and I am not advocating that. I doubt that  many people are.   Secondly, we need to make sure that dangerous people who want to come  into this country are stopped, and anyone who is here, undocumented and  dangerous, should be removed. I think we all agree on that.   The third thing we need--clearly need--is comprehensive immigration  reform. Our immigration system is desperately broken. It doesn't serve  our needs in so many different ways.   I was part of an effort 5 years ago when eight Senators--four  Democrats and four Republicans joined together. John McCain, Chuck  Schumer, Lindsey Graham, Michael Bennet, Bob Menendez, Jeff Flake,  Marco Rubio, and I spent about 6 months writing a comprehensive  immigration reform bill. We all had to give a little. That is what  happens when you are in a political situation.   We brought the bill to the floor of the Senate, and it passed with 64  votes. That is a pretty healthy margin in a Chamber that is often  bitterly divided.   We had comprehensive immigration reform. So what happened to it? It  crossed the Rotunda into the House of Representatives and disappeared.  They never held a hearing, and they never called a bill. They ignored  it completely. They left the mess that we now have in place.   Well, we need to return to this issue, and we need to do it quickly.  We need to make sure that we have another comprehensive immigration  reform bill that starts addressing the basic issues we addressed in our  last effort. That, to me, is the only way to put us on the right track  to do the right thing.   In the meantime, there are too many victims, and too darn many of  them are children. We can do better as a nation. The United States is a  caring and compassionate nation. We have proved it over and over again  throughout our history. We need to do it again.                     National Defense Authorization Bill    Mr. President, I want to discuss the conference report that is coming  over for the 2019 National Defense Authorization Act.   I want to thank Senator John McCain, who has been absent from the  Chamber for months, but we think of him every day and remember fondly  his amazing ability to shepherd this bill through the Senate and  through conference committee; Jack Reed, the Democrat serving on that  same defense authorization committee; Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma, who has  stepped in to fill in for John McCain in his absence; Congressman  Thornberry, Congressman Smith, and all of those who worked on this  conference agreement.   Since I am the ranking Democrat or vice chair of the Defense  Appropriations Subcommittee, I know how hard it is to take a bill of  this complexity and size and work out a political compromise. But that  was achieved with the National Defense Authorization Act, and it was  done with many extraordinary efforts when it came to defense and  foreign policy.   No compromise is perfect, but I am troubled and disappointed by  several particular provisions in the bill, and I wanted to speak to  them on the floor before the bill comes up for consideration later this  week.   This last January, Secretary of Defense Mattis, whom I respect  greatly and voted for, argued in his national defense strategy that we  were seeing ``the reemergence of long-term, strategic competition,''  especially against Russia and China. I don't think anyone disputes  that, and yet two high-profile provisions in this Defense authorization  bill weaken the pressure that we should be exerting against these two  nations.   Russia has illegally seized territory in Ukraine and Georgia. It has  protected the murderous Syrian regime. It has murdered its critics with  chemical attacks on foreign soil. It has attempted to undermine  democratic elections across the Western world, from  [[Page S5476]]  France to our own United States. For that reason, Congress put in place  tough sanctions against Russia last year. They passed with overwhelming  votes in the House and the Senate. I voted for them as did most of the  Members from both sides of the aisle.   Many of those sanctions required the President to impose the  sanctions. It was mandatory that he do this. It gave Congress the right  to review those sanctions if the President decided to waive and not  apply them. Why? It is sad to say that this congressional review was  included because no one trusted President Trump to stand up to Vladimir  Putin. He believes the word of Vladimir Putin over that of our  intelligence community professionals. Unfortunately, our President has  shown on almost a daily basis, that he simply doesn't have it in him to  stand up for American interests if Vladimir Putin disagrees.   Yet the conference report before us provides the administration with  an even bigger national security waiver on these sanctions, a larger  escape clause so that the President could avoid applying sanctions to  Russia, and it removes Congress's ability to review that decision. I am  sure the Secretary of Defense will use his powers in this bill wisely  to allow the United States to help key allies wean themselves off of  Russian military equipment. The problem is that this is not the only  way the administration can use this broad waiver. It makes  congressional review more, not less, important, and yet the conference  report, I think, goes in thing wrong direction.   We need to be firm with Russia. They need to understand there is a  price to pay for what they are doing to their neighbors, as well as to  the rest of the world and especially to the electoral process of the  United States. It was only last week that we received the latest  notification that one of my fellow colleagues in this Chamber has had  her office hacked by the Russians during the course of her reelection  campaign. This is not the end of Russian intrigue, and we have to  address this Russian threat with our eyes wide open. I wish the Defense  authorization bill were more explicit in that regard.   This conference agreement also waters down sanctions against China.  Last year, a large Chinese telecommunications company was caught  redhanded evading U.S. sanctions on North Korea and Iran.   Earlier this year, the Department of Defense also stopped selling its  phones to the military because it ``may pose an unacceptable risk to  personnel, information, and mission.'' These phones from China ``may  pose an unacceptable risk to personnel, information, and mission.'' Our  Department of Defense has warned us that this Chinese equipment can be  dangerous if used by our military establishment in the United States.   We responded forcefully to these repeated violations of the law and  national security risk, passing a provision to prohibit this company  from doing any business in the United States, but, again, just as with  the Russia provision, this was watered down from prohibiting it from  doing business with the U.S. Government. What it means is that the  Chinese telecommunications company, which we fear is going to make us  weaker in terms of national security, is prohibited for business with  our government but is able to sell its products in the general commerce  of America. That cannot make our country any safer.   The agreement also contains a comprehensive overhaul of the way we  protect our economy from national security threats. So perhaps next  time, if the Chinese violate it or any other country does, we can catch  them before damage is done. We could have made this provision much  stronger.   Another reason why I am disappointed by this conference committee  report is the irresponsible removal of provisions related to Myanmar,  formerly known as Burma. The House bill contained five provisions  restricting security engagement with Burma, imposing sanctions on  Burmese officials responsible for human rights abuses, and requiring  the State Department to make a determination on whether the atrocities  committed against the Rohingya people, a minority, constituted ethnic  cleansing, crimes against humanity, or genocide.   These provisions were included in the House version of the National  Defense Authorization Act with overwhelming bipartisan support. Similar  language passed out of our Senate Foreign Relations Committee in a  stand-alone bill with bipartisan support. It looked like these  provisions were destined to be in the final work product.    We are all aware of the horrific persecution of the Rohingya people  by the Burmese military, stemming from decades of deep-seated  misconceptions and hatred that have led to violence, most recently last  August, when a small group of militants attacked a security outpost.   The Burmese military brutally responded in a scorched-earth campaign  against the Rohingya people, killing thousands, including children,  violating their women, forcibly starving their people, and burning down  their villages. More than 700,000 Rohingya people fled Burma to nearby  Bangladesh, as they had been overwhelmed by the Burmese military and  their forces.   In neighboring Bangladesh, they were forced into squalid refugee  camps, which I visited. I know the Bangladeshis and others are doing  their best to help them, but these are horrible living conditions for  anyone.   In Burma the government authorities continue to deny that any of this  took place. They burned and overtook former Rohingya villages. They  ignored calls for safe and voluntary repatriation and accountability.   I am particularly disappointed in Aung San Suu Kyi. Her silence on  these problems is hard to explain. Many of us admired her for a long  period of time and the courage she showed against the Burmese military,  but when it comes to this moral humanitarian choice, her silence is  distressing. Just this month, an extensive and devastating report  released by the group Fortify Rights found that the Burmese authorities  had actually made the preparations for attacks against the Rohingya  people before the August 25 militant attack, which they blamed for  their actions. Groups such as Fortify Rights, Amnesty International,  Human Rights Watch, and countless others have even documented the  Burmese military officials and units responsible for the crimes against  the Rohingya, led by General Min Aung Hlaing.   Despite this, our President has been slow to sanction military  officials. The Trump administration has been sitting on a potential  list for months and so far has sanctioned one person only. Here in the  Senate, one of our Senate leaders, dismayed, continues to block  movement of any bipartisan sanction effort aimed for those responsible  for this atrocity.   I am sorry to say that what looked like an easy bipartisan provision  to condemn this behavior by the Burmese military is a casualty of this  conference committee, and it is another reason that I am troubled by  the work product. Finally, I want to note that this conference  agreement provides zero paid increases for defense civilian personnel.  That is just unacceptable. The President did not request an increase in  his budget proposal even though Secretary Mattis has called their  contributions essential to our military operations for everything from  acquisition to policy expertise.   Congress should exercise its independent judgment to provide this  civilian pay increase. After all, we cannot expect to continue to  recruit and retain the best civilian workers in our military without  appropriate pay.   I am glad that the Appropriations Committee was providing modest  increases for all Federal and civilian employees, but every committee  in every branch of government must take responsibility for this in the  future. I understand that one cannot demand perfection in the  legislative process, and there are many provisions in this conference  report that I appreciate and the work that was put into it.   The conferees rejected unrelated poison pill environmental provisions  from the House and retained a very strong Senate statement in support  of NATO. These are two of the hundreds of good provisions contained in  this bill and conference report. But as I stated at the outset, I  believe the agreement also makes improper changes in the key areas that  I have outlined, and for those reasons I will be voting against cloture  on the conference agreement.  [[Page S5477]]    I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, today I want to say a few words about a  special anniversary. Earlier this month, we celebrated the 50th  anniversary of the very first Special Olympic Games, which took place  at Soldier Field in Chicago, IL.   The Special Olympics didn't just give people a chance to compete; it  gave them a chance to come out of the shadows. It is hard to imagine,  but before the Special Olympics, people with intellectual disabilities  were offered little education and oftentimes were left in isolation and  despair. Thankfully, Eunice Shriver shared the compassion and vision to  create these games, but I want to talk about someone whose role in the  games creation is often overlooked: Illinois Supreme Court justice and  my friend, Anne Burke.   Before becoming a justice on Illinois' Supreme Court, Anne was a  physical education teacher. She had an idea to create a summer jamboree  where kids with special needs could compete in an athletic competition  at Soldier Field, just like other children who attended day camps  across the State of Illinois. So Anne took that idea to Washington, DC,  and Eunice Shriver. What did Eunice Shriver say to Anne's proposal?  Unacceptable. It was simply too small. Eunice decided it needed to be  bigger. With Eunice's help, Anne returned home to Chicago, rewrote the  proposal, and made it a national Olympic program. Eunice joined Anne in  Chicago on July 20, 1968, and they celebrated the first Special Olympic  Games.   During those first games in 1968, Mayor Richard Daley told Eunice:  ``The world will never be the same after this.'' Eunice Shriver and  Anne Burke knew it. Eunice boldly predicted that 1 million of the  world's intellectually challenged would someday compete in these games.  Well, she was wrong. Today, more than 5 million athletes train year- round in all 50 States and 172 countries.   Here are just a couple examples of how the world changed after that  summer day in Chicago. In 2003, after the games were held in Dublin,  Ireland rewrote its antidiscrimination laws. Across the Middle East,  people who were once forced into the shadows now play soccer in the  light of day. That is the legacy of the Special Olympics: inclusion.   I will close with one more story from those first games at Soldier  Field. After one athlete, Frank Olivo, finished competing, he said:  ``People always put me down. And said, I wouldn't amount to anything.  And now they say, he does amount to something. He's special.'' That is  what makes the Special Olympics so special.   Congratulations to the Special Olympics for 50 years of making  athletes like Frank understand that hearts beat the same.                            ____________________
