 Mr. Speaker, where is the proposed budget plan? We just  voted to approve the use of the Capitol Grounds for a soapbox derby,  but we can't vote on the budget?   Article I of the Constitution gives Congress the primary  responsibility of creating spending priorities for the Nation. The  President submitted his budget weeks ago. Rather than fulfilling this  obligation to govern, House leadership is asleep at the wheel.   It is irresponsible to not allow us to vote on a budget resolution.  We are more than $22 trillion in debt. We can't continue this broken  process. The American people deserve to see the Speaker's spending  priorities and know where taxpayer dollars are going to be spent.   Mr. Speaker, I say to Speaker Pelosi, show me your budget. Let's vote  on a budget. Let's get to work.                            ____________________
