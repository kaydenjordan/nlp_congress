 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairwoman for  yielding, and I thank our colleagues on the other side of the aisle.   I am so thrilled today to rise in favor of the Christa McAuliffe  Commemorative Coin Act.   Christa McAuliffe was a teacher at my alma mater, Concord High  School, and she was my hero. Christa was smart; she was charming; she  was the kind teacher who left her mark on countless students through  her willingness to do whatever it took to help them succeed.   The Concord and broader New Hampshire community was thrilled when she  was chosen out of over 10,000 applicants as NASA's first teacher in  space. Her mission was to inspire a generation of American students to  look toward the sky and pursue careers in science. And her motto, as  Mr. Hoyer noted: ``I touch the future. I teach.''   She cared about America, and every year she invited my mother, former  State Senator Susan McLane, into her classroom so that her students  would know about our government and opportunities for their future.    Her husband, Steve, and their two children, were important in our  community. And I am reminded of the story, when President Bush  announced Christa's appointment, he whispered into Steve's ear: ``You  will be making your dinner a lot more on your own.''   Tragically, on January 28, 1986, Christa, along with six other  members of the Challenger Space Shuttle crew, perished when the shuttle  exploded.   I can't tell you the number of colleagues when I was asking for their  signatures to join us in this bipartisan bill said, I remember exactly  where I was when that happened.   But we remember Christa because she wanted her students to seek out  the best in themselves, and always to reach a little higher. Inspired  by Christa's leadership, her students did just that by going on to  become teachers and to pursue careers in science and education and  public policy.   Christa's legacy can be seen all over the State of New Hampshire;  from the Christa McAuliffe-Shepard Discovery Center, which is a  planetarium in our town, to Christa McAuliffe Middle School in Concord.  And I am proud that this coin will help cement Christa's place in  American history for generations to come.   So it is fitting that the proceeds from the coin will support FIRST  Robotics, a nationwide leader in STEM education, founded, as Mr. Upton  said, by New Hampshire inventor, Dean Kamen, to help fulfill Christa's  legacy by helping students discover the wonders of the world through  education and science.   I was so proud to work with my colleagues and friends, Fred Upton,  Debbie Dingell, and my new colleague from New Hampshire, Chris Pappas,  to help secure the cosponsors needed to pass this bill. I appreciate  Leader Hoyer's and Chairwoman Maxine Waters' willingness to move this  bill and to honor Christa McAuliffe.   I urge my colleagues to vote for this bill.                                time  1600
