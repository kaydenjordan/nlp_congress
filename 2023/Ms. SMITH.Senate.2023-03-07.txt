 Mr. President, I rise today in support of the nomination  of Patrice Kunesh to be the Commissioner of the Administration for  Native Americans at the Department of Health and Human Services.   Ms. Kunesh is a descendant of the Standing Rock Lakota and a  distinguished lawyer, advocate, and thought leader. She currently works  at the Native American Rights Fund, but her career spans from being  counsel for the Mashantucket Pequot Tribe to being the director of the  Center for Indian Country Development at the Minneapolis Federal  Reserve--all in the service of Native communities. Ms. Kunesh also  served as the Deputy Solicitor at the Department of the Interior and as  Deputy Under Secretary for Rural Development at the USDA.   The Administration for Native Americans at HHS helps Native  communities, including Indian Tribes, Native Hawaiians, and Alaska  Natives, with financial support and technical assistance for Native  language preservation,  [[Page S667]]  economic development, and self-sufficiency.   I know that Patrice is up to the task. She is knowledgeable,  experienced, and deeply connected to Tribal leaders and Native  communities. She knows how the Federal Government works and how we can  best fulfill our trust and treaty responsibilities in Indian Country.   Patrice's nomination is supported by the National Congress of  American Indians and numerous Tribal nations. Most importantly, filling  this role at HHS is essential to meeting our responsibilities to Tribal  nations and Native communities.   I urge my colleagues to vote yes on Patrice Kunesh's nomination.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
