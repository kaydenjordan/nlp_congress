 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in  morning business.    Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the destructive  path that the majority is headed down with their attempts to repeal the  Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.   The Republican bill, and, frankly, the House Republican bill that the  Senate is now considering in addition to other ideas is, in my  judgment, not really a healthcare bill but a tax cut bill. It is a tax  cut bill for the super-rich--not only the rich but, literally, the  wealthiest few Americans--while increasing costs for middle-class  families. It gives States the option to allow insurance companies to  discriminate again like they did before the ACA was passed. It would  also allow those same policies to devastate our hospitals, particularly  those in rural communities. I live in a State where 48 out of 67  counties are, in fact, rural counties.   The Republican bill would rip away healthcare, according to the  Congressional Budget Office, from 23 million Americans. Here is what  that means in Pennsylvania, based upon the Congressional Budget Office  numbers: Up to 770,000 Pennsylvanians could lose health insurance by  2026 if the bill were to pass, 48,000 Pennsylvania seniors on Medicare  could lose access to services covered by Medicaid, and 52,600  Pennsylvanians with disabilities could lose Medicaid coverage. I live  in a State  [[Page S3320]]  where, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, over  722,000 Pennsylvanians with disabilities rely on Medical Assistance for  their medical care. Medical Assistance is the State version of  Medicaid. We know that if you are a child, if you are a senior, or if  you have a disability, many Americans in those categories, of course,  rely upon Medicaid.   We also know, based upon the CBO numbers, that 180,000 Pennsylvanians  could lose access to mental health and substance abuse care now  provided by Medicaid. We have heard a lot of talk, and there has been a  lot of work, actually, in this body, as well as in the other body, in  the last year on the opioid problem. We have Democrats and Republicans  focusing on a major national problem, an urgent public health problem.  We have made some progress--not enough but some good progress--on  opioid legislation. All of that would be badly undermined if we made  the changes to Medicaid that some want to make here because of the  significant impact that cuts to Medicaid would have on the challenge of  reducing the opioid crisis.   So even the possibility that this bill might become law is, in a  sense, destabilizing to the healthcare marketplace, which has been  better each year we move forward from the passage of the ACA in 2010.   Just last week, the Pennsylvania Insurance Department announced  average proposed rate increases for health insurance premiums for 2018.  Here is what the Pennsylvania Insurance Department told us. If we  maintain current law, premiums will go up 8.8 percent in Pennsylvania.  If the Republicans get rid of the cost-sharing subsidies, which many  seem either to want to get rid of or to want to ignore, thereby  creating uncertainty--if those cost-sharing subsidies are thrown out  the window--premiums will go up 2.5 times as much, by over 20 percent.  So far, it is 8.8 percent under current law or 20 percent just based  upon the cost-sharing subsidies being taken away.   Also, if the individual mandate is repealed, premiums will go up  almost three times as much, by 23 percent. If we get rid of both the  cost-sharing subsidies and the individual mandate, premiums in our  State will go up by over 36 percent.   So we have a basic choice to make, at least as it relates to  Pennsylvania. Under current law, it is 8.8 percent, and we should try  to bring that down. I think there are ways we could work together in a  bipartisan fashion to bring that down. But if we go in the direction  that many want to go--especially on the Republican side--to undermine  or to do nothing about cost-sharing and get to rid of the individual  mandate, premiums go up 36 percent. So folks can make their choice to  go up about 9 percent or to go up 36 percent. It is a real simple  choice with basically two options.   The bill that was passed in the House would destroy the lives of many  vulnerable Pennsylvanians. What should we do about it? Well, the first  thing we should do with the bill is to throw it in the trash heap. That  is where it belongs, and I hope that is where Senate Republicans are  headed and that they are going to start over on a new bill, because the  bill that was passed in the House is very bad for the country.   Among the 3 million Pennsylvanians with preexisting conditions are  two remarkable young women whose mother first contacted me in 2009.  Stacie Ritter, from Manheim, PA, is the mom of four children, including  her twin daughters, Hannah and Madeline, who are depicted here in this  picture when they were much younger. Hannah and Madeline were diagnosed  with a rare and dangerous type of leukemia when they were just 4 years  old. You can see their picture there at that time.   Stacy and her husband Benjamin went bankrupt trying to pay their  daughters' medical bills. She wrote to me at the time, saying that  without healthcare reform, ``my girls will be unable to afford care,  that is if they are eligible, for care that is critically necessary to  maintain this chronic condition.''   Fortunately, things have changed in the last 8 or so years.  Fortunately, Hannah and Madeline are healthy young women now. They are  freshman at Arcadia University and are doing well. They rely on the  Affordable Care Act's protections to ensure that they have access to  affordable coverage, whether they are on their parents' plan or  purchasing a plan in the individual market. As you can see on my left,  this is a picture of Hannah and Madeline today as college freshmen.    Without the Affordable Care Act, Hannah and Madeline could be denied  health insurance. As their mom said, they could be ``punished and  rejected because they had the misfortune of developing cancer as a  child.''   The Republican bill passed in the House would put them at risk of  being denied health insurance or being charged more because they are  cancer survivors.   I don't know why anyone would support a bill that would do that.   Just a number of months ago I received a letter from Pam Simpson from  Chester County, PA. Pam and her son Rowan have their story to tell.  Rowan is 5 years old, and a number of years ago he was diagnosed with  autism. I have talked about Rowan before on this floor and in other  places and what Medicaid means for Rowan and his family. Medicaid  provides important services for Rowan and others with disabilities,  enabling Rowan to go to preschool and allowing his mother to work. Here  is what his mom said to me. I won't read the whole letter, but I will  just highlight the first page.   The first page is Rowan's life before he was diagnosed with autism-- all of the challenges that he and his family had--and Rowan's life  after the diagnosis of autism, but, then, ultimately, when he received  Medicaid, or Medical Assistance, as we call it in Pennsylvania. Here is  what his mom told me in the letter after he received word that he was  going to be enrolled in Medical Assistance:         Late January 2016, I applied for Medicaid.    That is Medical Assistance.         After Rowan was awarded Medical Assistance, we were able to       obtain wrap-around services. These services included a       Behavioral Specialist Consultant and a Therapeutic Staff       Support worker.    She goes on later in that paragraph to say that these wrap-around  services ``have been a Godsend.''   Then she goes on later and says:         I am thrilled by Rowan's daily progress. I cannot say       enough good things about this program.    Then she says:         Without Medical Assistance, I am confident that I could not       work full time to support our family. Our family would be       bankrupt or my son would go without the therapies he       sincerely needs.    Here is the last line of her letter:         We are desperately in need of Rowan's Medical Assistance       and would be devastated if we lost these benefits.    She is referencing ``Medical Assistance'' for Medicaid, the same  program at the State level.   So we have two families now that are totally reliant on these  programs, either the ACA more broadly or, in particular, the Medicaid  Program. Both families have referenced bankruptcy because of healthcare  challenges in the life of that family--one who would be on the brink of  bankruptcy, Rowan's family, and the other, who actually went through  bankruptcy because of those healthcare challenges. No family in the  United States of America should have to worry about going bankrupt  because of a healthcare problem. We are well on our way to solving  these problems, and no one should pull the rug out from under those  families. But, unfortunately, when it comes to this legislation, that  is exactly what could happen to many of them.   I will give a third example: Alex. Recently I met Alex, who is from  Southeastern Pennsylvania. He is 9 years old, and he has Down syndrome.  Here is what Alex, a 9-year-old, wrote:         Although I have a medical diagnosis of Down Syndrome, I am       an excellent student. I get 100 percent on my spelling tests       and I get picked as the Math King quite often. . . . My       parents, my teachers, and everyone around me thought from the       beginning there was nothing that I could not do. . . . I am       able to get a good education because of the supports that I       get from Special Education. That's why I am very concerned       about the possible cuts in Medicaid funding in schools. . . .       Medicaid funding in schools is a very, very important part of       what makes it possible for us to receive successful education       in school and become contributing members of our society.    That is a 9-year-old in Pennsylvania reminding us about this  important program. Alex has tremendous potential that would be in  jeopardy by the proposed cuts to Medicaid.  [[Page S3321]]    Here is another example: Peg Fagan of Pennsylvania. The Republican  bill includes an age tax that will allow insurers to charge older  Americans up to five times more than younger Americans. Peg is from  Bucks County, in Southeastern Pennsylvania. She is a three-time cancer  survivor who could not afford health insurance prior to the Affordable  Care Act. She is approaching Medicare eligibility but still has a few  years to go before she is old enough to enroll.   Peg was able to find affordable health insurance thanks to the ACA,  but under the Republican bill, she could once again be discriminated  against for being an older adult, and another possible object of  discrimination would be that she is a cancer survivor.   That was the old law. That is where we were before, where insurance  companies were allowed under the law to discriminate in that fashion.  They could discriminate against you because you were a woman. They  could discriminate against you because you had a preexisting condition.  They could discriminate against you because you were a cancer survivor  or because of your age, or so many other circumstances. I thought we  were beyond that. I thought we had finally cured that problem, but some  want to go back in time.   So the CBO tells us that the Republican bill would rip away  healthcare from 23 million Americans. I just went through some  Pennsylvania stories. We have a lot more, and my colleagues will be  hearing them. But for Hannah and Madeline and Rowan and Alex and Peg,  we should ask ourselves a couple of basic questions. Healthcare for  those Pennsylvanians should not be made worse, and they should not be  made worse off, in order to give the top one-tenth of 1 percent a  $200,000 giveaway. That is what the first version of the House  healthcare bill would do. It would give the top one-tenth of 1 percent  an average tax cut of $197,000. I exaggerated; I said $200,000. Let's  be exact. It is $197,000 each. Why would we take away healthcare or  even risk or create uncertainty about healthcare for Hannah, Madeline,  Rowan, Alex, and Peg because some people around here want to give tax  cuts to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars to very wealthy  people? That is not what I call a healthcare bill.    The Senate has an obligation, in my judgment--both parties--to stop  this bill from being enacted into law. We cannot allow this legislation  to pass or anything like it to become law. So I ask each Member of the  Senate to consider these Pennsylvanians and plenty in your home States  and the countless more like them who are anxiously hoping and praying  this Congress will not vote to take away their healthcare.                      Drug and Veterans Treatment Courts    Mr. President, I rise to express my support for the drug and other  treatment courts, including veterans treatment courts, in Pennsylvania  and the more than 3,000 across the Nation.   Just last month during National Drug Court Month, drug courts across  the country held graduation ceremonies to recognize individuals who  completed this rigorous treatment program. These courts, which serve  about 150,000 people a year, hold offenders with substance use and  mental health disorders accountable for their actions through strict  supervision while also connecting them to the treatment they need. More  than 1.25 million people have successfully graduated from drug and  treatment court programs and are now on a path to recovery.   Research has demonstrated that drug and other treatment courts not  only reduce crime but also reduce spending by slowing the cycle of  recidivism. Drug and other treatment courts are also an important  resource to law enforcement and community stakeholders working to  combat the opioid epidemic. Opioid addiction is a growing public health  crisis in Pennsylvania and throughout the Nation, and it demands real  action. As public officials, we have an obligation to ensure that the  resources and policies are in place to fight this scourge so that more  families won't have to endure the heartache of losing a loved one to  addiction.   Veterans treatment courts are innovative and collaborative programs  to address some of the unique challenges that face our veteran  communities. There are approximately 22 million veterans in the United  States, and Pennsylvania is home to nearly 1 million. The majority of  veterans return to our communities as leaders and lead exemplary lives;  however, not every veteran's path is straightforward. That is why we  need to make sure the right programs and support services are in place.   According to the Department of Justice, in 2011 and 2012,  approximately 8 percent of the total incarcerated population in the  United States were, in fact, veterans. These veterans found themselves  serving time in correctional facilities because they had not received  the treatment they needed. While this represents a very small  percentage of veterans, it is important that we support programs like  veterans treatment courts for veterans who face significant obstacles  returning to civilian life, including mental health concerns, post- traumatic stress disorder, and substance abuse issues. These treatment  courts can have a lifelong impact on a veteran by helping them get out  of the criminal justice system and get the necessary treatment they  have earned. It is our obligation to work every day to ensure veterans  are receiving the care and support they deserve.   There are many stories from across Pennsylvania and our country that  exemplify why these veterans treatment courts are critical. Just to  give one, shortly after Michael Colletti from Montgomery County  received an honorable discharge from the U.S. Coast Guard, he found  himself in the grips of a serious addiction to opioids. To support his  growing habit, Michael began stealing from his employer, resulting in  his arrest and jail time. His crimes were caused by his opioid use  disorder, and Michael found himself in the Montgomery County Veterans  Treatment Court.   Finally, getting the accountability he needed and connecting with the  benefits he earned as a veteran, Michael began the process of leaving  behind his life of addiction and crime to start a new path. Today,  Michael Colletti is a partner in a successful small business and a  mentor to others in his community struggling with their own substance  use.   He says of the veterans treatment court:         I wouldn't be here without the support network from the       court. I wouldn't have my girlfriend, I wouldn't have my       beautiful place, I wouldn't have my career, and most       importantly, I wouldn't have the sound clarity of mind to be       myself again. Now I am committed to paying it forward.    I and I know many others are proud to support a recent letter led by  our colleagues, Senator Klobuchar and Senator Wicker, highlighting the  importance of funding the Drug Court Discretionary Grant Program and  veterans treatment courts. As we go through the appropriations process,  I urge my colleagues to consider the proven track record of these  courts in improving outcome for graduates, and I hope Congress will  offer strong support for these important programs that have been  helping the justice system better serve individuals, veterans, their  families, friends, and communities.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.
