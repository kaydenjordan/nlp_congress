 Mr. Speaker, at 10:15 a.m. on Thursday morning, with the  U.S. on the brink of a devastating default, our colleagues across the  aisle decided to call it a week. Turning their backs on the American  people to beat Memorial Day traffic is a new low for House Republicans.   House Republicans have left town while America speeds toward a  devastating default, and they chose that route. They are willing to  drive our Nation off an economic cliff and trigger a global recession,  cutting veterans' benefits, taking food from hungry families, and  laying off first responders.   The American people didn't send us here to play chicken with their  retirement plans. House Republicans created this crisis, and they can  end it. There is an off-ramp from this highway to hell. The  overwhelming majority of Americans don't want the far right driving our  national agenda.   Responsible Republicans need to come to the table for the American  people, not skip town with the MAGA extremists.                            ____________________
