 Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of Black  women and girls everywhere.   While Black women play one of the most active and essential roles in  our economy, we continue to be left behind and are the ones who are hit  the hardest by economic downturns.   Every day, Black women face seemingly insurmountable challenges  ranging from structural barriers to systemic inequities that can hinder  us from achieving full and meaningful lives.   According to ``An Economy for All: Building a `Black Women Best'  Legislative Agenda,'' a comprehensive report that provides compelling  and connective legislative policy proposals to improve the lives of  Black women, when we center and uplift Black women, we are, in fact,  uplifting everyone.   At its core, Black Women Best serves as a blueprint for economic,  racial, and gender prosperity. Today, the Congressional Caucus on Black  Women and Girls, which I cofounded and co-chair, released an updated  report outlining a legislative agenda informed by the Black Women Best  framework.   The report's policy proposals include everything from maternal health  to criminal justice reform to food injustice and breastfeeding  injustice, all of which demonstrate just how vital it is to craft  legislation that benefits all communities.   Soon, I will reintroduce the Black Women Best resolution to address  the systemic injustices Black women and girls face and to encourage  Congress to craft legislation that benefits every American as laid out  by the Black Women Best framework, which was developed by former Labor  Department chief economist Janelle Jones.   These policies all have two things in common: They bring Black women  from peril to prosperity; and they benefit the economy, as well.   Black Women Best is about giving Black women the freedom to thrive,  the freedom to stay employed, and the freedom to continue driving our  Nation's economic growth. Equity-focused legislation uplifts not just  Black women but our entire economy.   If we are going to change anything, we need to start giving Black  women and girls the very tools that they need to thrive. Black women  and girls are the missing piece to securing our Nation's future, and I  hope that every single one of my colleagues, Democrat and Republican  alike, support the Black Women Best resolution. Every action we take  towards bettering the quality of life for Black women and girls  everywhere is a step in the right direction.                            ____________________
