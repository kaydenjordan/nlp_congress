 Mr. Speaker, on April 16, 2021, I was unavoidably  detained by a meeting with the U.S. Small Business Administration  Administrator, and was not present for one roll call vote on a bill  considered under suspension of the House rules.   Had I been present, I would have voted: Aye on Roll Call 119, on the  motion to suspend the rules and pass H.R. 1482, the 504 credit Risk  Management Improvement Act of 2021.
