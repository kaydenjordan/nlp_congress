 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of United States  Navy Lieutenant Ridge Alkonis, who, for the last 365 days, has been  unjustly jailed by the Japanese Government.   The State Department and the Department of Defense need to  demonstrate strength and exercise leverage and bring Ridge home and  bring him home now.   America needs to bring Ridge home for justice's sake. America needs  to bring Ridge home to send a message to the 50,000 troops we have  stationed in Japan that the brass, bureaucrats, and politicians have  their backs.   America needs to bring Ridge home to demonstrate to the Japanese that  we are the United States of America, the world superpower, and our  commitment to their defense against China and North Korea comes with a  few conditions, and one of them is to treat our troops fairly.   Madam Speaker, our government has negotiated for the release of other  Americans who have done far less for our great Nation than an Active- Duty naval officer. America needs to bring Ridge home. A year in prison  is far too long.                            ____________________
