 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be  allowed to speak as if in morning business for up to 15 minutes.    Mr. President, judging by the deafening silence of  Senate Republicans, you would think there was no conservative support  in this country for even the most measured response to climate change.  However, many prominent Republicans are actually clamoring for climate  action. They are just not doing it here in Mammon Hall.   See, for example, the January 16 op-ed in the Wall Street Journal.  The Wall Street Journal is not exactly a progressive lefty rag. The  opening line of the Wall Street Journal op-ed is: ``Global climate  change is a serious problem calling for immediate national action.'' I  agree.   The op-ed is signed by 27 winners of the Nobel Prize in economics,  four former Federal Reserve Chairs, 12 past Chairs of the President's  Council of Economic Advisers, and two former Treasury Secretaries. Many  were appointed by Republican Presidents.   Let's look at what this bipartisan group of experts and economists is  proposing.   Here is the first policy recommendation:         A carbon tax offers the most cost-effective lever to reduce       carbon emissions at the scale and speed that is necessary. By       correcting a well-known market failure, a carbon tax will       send a powerful price signal that harnesses the invisible       hand of the marketplace to steer economic actors towards a       low-carbon future.    Again, I agree. We must make the price of fossil energy reflect the  costs of carbon pollution. That is Econ 101. We have to do it if we are  to reduce emissions as much and as quickly as we need to. This is why  Senator Schatz and I introduced the American Opportunity Carbon Fee Act  to put a price on carbon.   It is not just academic economists and policymakers who recognize  that putting a price on carbon pollution is the most efficient way to  reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Business executives agree. Few firms  are more capitalist and fiercer than the legendary Goldman Sachs.  Consider this from Bob Litterman, the former head of risk management at  Goldman Sachs, writing recently in the New York Times:         [F]or society at large, and the government in particular,       the most important and urgent action required is to minimize       future warming by creating appropriate global incentives to       reduce carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels.       Economists generally agree that rather than regulate       behavior, it is more effective to allow individuals to choose       their actions, as long as the prices appropriately reflect       the costs--    Again, back to Econ 101--       including the risks posed by climate change.        To date, prices of energy have not reflected the risk of       future climate changes. This is a stupid mistake. . . .    That is not very complicated economic jargon. This is the former head  of risk management for one of the smartest and most capitalist firms  the planet has ever seen saying that what we are engaged in now is a  ``stupid mistake.'' Again, I agree.   Republicans typically support free market solutions, and this is a  free market solution. Yet, still, there remains that deafening silence  from the other side of the aisle here in the Senate.   Here is the second recommendation from the economists' op-ed in the  Wall Street Journal:         A carbon tax should increase every year until emissions       reductions goals are met and be revenue neutral to avoid       debates over the size of government. A consistently rising       carbon price will encourage technological innovation and       large-scale infrastructure development.    These are two things we want--innovation and infrastructure. So  again, I agree. As to revenue neutral, the carbon pricing system  Senator Schatz and I proposed is revenue neutral. Every penny goes back  into the pockets of Americans--none is designed to make more or bigger  government. As to innovation, a carbon fee levels the playing field so  that polluters have to compete in the market on even terms with  nonpolluters. Competition on a level playing field will incentivize  innovation in renewable energy, innovation in energy efficiency,  innovation in resilient infrastructure, and innovation in low-carbon  manufacturing and transportation.   This is not a novel concept. Nobel Prize-winning economist William  Nordhaus showed as far back as 1992 ``that a low tax on carbon, set to  rise slowly, over time, could be enough to keep emissions at reasonable  levels, saving us from climate change at little, if any, cost. The tax  would promote innovations in new forms of power generation, and,  eventually, a widespread adoption of clean-energy technologies.''   The latest Republican claim is that innovation is the solution to  climate change. Fine, but you are not going to get adequate innovation  on the tilted playing field that the fossil fuel industry protects.  Carbon pricing uses market forces to drive innovation.   What else do the economists recommend?         A border carbon adjustment system should be established.       This system would enhance the competitiveness of American       firms that are more energy-efficient than their global       competitors. It would also create an incentive for other       nations to adopt similar carbon pricing.    Again, I agree. A border carbon adjustment system means that products  from countries without a carbon price are subject to a harmonizing  tariff so that they don't have an unfair advantage over domestic  products. This protects American manufacturers, and, in turn, American  jobs. It motivates other countries to help solve this global problem.  People who say we need a global solution must look to a carbon price  because it is the most efficient global solution. That is why the  Whitehouse-Schatz bill includes just such a border adjustment system.  By the way, we filed this bill three Congresses ago first. So we have  been at this for a while. The economists' Wall Street Journal op-ed was  just a few weeks ago. So we seem to have some convergence here.    The economists continue:         To maximize the fairness and political viability of a       rising carbon tax, all the revenue should be returned       directly to U.S. citizens through equal lump-sum rebates. The       majority of American families, including the most vulnerable,       will benefit financially--    Let me repeat that again--       will benefit financially by receiving more in ``carbon       dividends'' than they pay in increased energy prices.        The majority of our families, including the most vulnerable       will benefit financially.    As I already noted, the Whitehouse-Schatz plan returns all revenue to  the American people. Carbon pricing is not a tax increase. Lower and  middle-income households actually get more money back than they may pay  in higher prices.   More than two dozen Nobel Prize winners signed this Wall Street  Journal op-ed. Their economic expertise is unimpeachable. We have at  least one Nobel Laureate from almost every year since the late 1990s.  There are only a few missing names, and many of those names actually  have endorsed carbon pricing in other venues.   You might say: OK, they are just a bunch of academics. They are all  out of touch with political realities.   Well, these were all chairs of the Council of Economic Advisers to  the President. When you are advising the President of the United  States, you generally adopt some sense of political reality. Note that  this is a bipartisan list. It includes advisers to four Republican  Presidents and two Democratic Presidents. When this group of people can  agree on an economic policy, you better believe it is not some fringe  idea, and these experts all say that carbon pricing is a practical  solution to a very real and pressing problem.   Here is yet another bipartisan list of signers on the Wall Street  Journal op-ed: Fed chairs and Treasury Secretaries. We have top-level  economic appointees from five different Republican Presidents, all  saying that ``global climate change is a serious problem calling for  immediate national action'' and  [[Page S908]]  all saying that setting a carbon price is the best action to take. They  don't write very big checks. So they don't get heard from much around  here, it seems.   But let's think for a minute. What about this President? What about  President Trump? What might he say? What might President Trump think  about action on climate change?   This is a full-page advertisement from the New York Times from 2009.  Back in 2009, Donald Trump and his children and the Trump organization  all signed this letter published in the New York Times. This letter  urged then-President Obama to pursue what they called ``meaningful and  effective measures to control climate change.'' It goes on: ``If we  fail to act now''--this being 2009--``it is scientifically irrefutable  that there will be catastrophic and irreversible consequences for  humanity and our planet.'' ``Irrefutable,'' ``catastrophic,''  ``irreversible''--there is not much ambiguity there.   Well, a decade has passed since this letter, and much has changed.  Now Donald Trump mocks global warming, and the GOP in Congress has fled  from taking any serious action on climate change--even on policies that  are as mainstream and widely supported by appointees of Republicans as  carbon pricing.   How did this come to pass? Well, I was here. I saw it happen. The  year after President Trump signed this letter, the Supreme Court's  disastrous Citizens United decision opened the floodgates to unlimited  special-interest money--money from polluters into our politics--and  that changed everything.   In 2007, we had bipartisan climate bills. In 2008, we had bipartisan  climate bills. In 2009, we had bipartisan climate bills. Bipartisanship  was the theme of responding to the climate change problem for those  years. By my recollection, we had five different bipartisan Senate  climate bills kicking around.   Then, in January 2010 comes the Citizens United decision. The fossil  fuel industry pushed for it, asked for it, saw it coming, and took  immediate advantage of it. Before you know it, there is that unlimited  money, often unleashed through dark money channels, so you don't know  who is behind it, and there are the threats and promises that  necessarily accompany that power. Think about it. If you are given the  power to spend unlimited money in politics, do you not necessarily also  have the power to threaten to spend unlimited money in politics? Of  course, you do. The two cannot be separated.   So the unlimited spending, the anonymous dark money, and the threats  and promises combined to shut down the Republican Party on this issue.  It was like turning off the lights. From January 2010 forward, no  Republican in this Chamber has been willing to get onto any serious  piece of legislation to reduce carbon dioxide.   Republican voters aren't there. Republican young voters are up in  arms. Republican economic leaders aren't there. You can look across the  Republican Party, and you find a strong and solid desire to address the  climate problem, and you even have Republican leaders supporting a  specific solution. It is just here where it stops. It is just here  where political spending is so important that it has been able to  overcome even the judgment of Nobel Prize-winning Republican appointees  as to how to solve this.   After he received his Nobel Prize just last October, William  Nordhaus, Nobel Prize-winning economist, lamented: ``It's hard to be  optimistic. . . . We're actually going backward in the United States,  with the disastrous policies of the Trump administration.''   Where is 2009 Donald Trump? Where is the guy who signed this? I want  that guy back. These economists of all political backgrounds know what  is going on, and they know how to fix it. The American people know what  is going on, and they want us to fix it. It is time for us to take  action, and it is time for us to wake up.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
