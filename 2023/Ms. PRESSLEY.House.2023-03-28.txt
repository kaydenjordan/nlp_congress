 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Transgender  Day of Visibility.   I am introducing my bill, the Name Accuracy in Credit Reporting Act,  legislation that is informed by the lived experiences of transgender  and nonbinary people throughout the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and  our country.   My bill will rectify the inequities and inaccuracies in credit  reporting, which disproportionately impact transgender and nonbinary  people.   During their transition, many transgender people choose to legally  change their names. However, even after their legal name change is  finalized, their credit report continues to deadname them, or refer to  them by their prior name.   Deadnaming a trans person in their credit report comes with many  harms to one's mental health and financial well-being. When external  entities like potential lenders or employers receive the inaccurate  credit reports, transgender folks are exposed to discrimination and  harassment in credit services, housing, and employment.   Further, some trans and nonbinary consumers have reported that when  they change their name, the credit bureaus fragment their credit  report, resulting in a loss of credit history and a drop in their  credit score.   My bill will improve accuracy in consumer reporting and increase  access to housing, jobs, and credit for transgender and nonbinary  people by preventing their unfair denials that result after a name  change.                                time  1030    The status quo is unjust, inaccurate, and unsafe for transgender and  nonbinary people. We know that the credit bureaus can easily make these  changes. They do this every day when people change their name to get  married. It is past time that we realize trans justice is economic  justice.   My bill has the support of key advocates and trusted voices, but most  importantly, it is endorsed by transgender and nonbinary people who  have been impacted by these issues. I am a firm believer that the  people closest to the pain should be the closest to the power, driving  and informing the policymaking.   On this Transgender Day of Visibility, may we, as Members of  Congress, renew our efforts to condemn transphobia in all of its forms.  The rhetoric is harmful, the policy is violent, and it stands to harm  our most vulnerable and marginalized communities.   May we stand with trans students who deserve to learn in a school  environment free from hate. May we stand with the parents who are  raising trans children fighting to make a safer world for them. May we  stand with the community organizers, movement builders, and status quo  disrupters who are on the front lines of trans liberation. May we do  more than espouse the values of equality and freedom but actually  practice them to include all people.   When we say Black lives matter, that must include Black trans lives.  In the fight for human rights, we must affirm that trans rights are  human rights. When we evoke the words of Fannie Lou Hamer that nobody  is free until we all are free, that must include our siblings in the  trans community.   No doubt, the trans community, our neighbors and loved ones, have  experienced disparate harm, hardship, and violence. But the transgender  community is certainly much more than their pain and trauma. I thank  them for showing up every day as their authentic selves and living  their lives unapologetically. I thank them for the roles they play  every day as public officials, as small business owners, as veterans,  and more.   This is true across our country, including in my district, the  Massachusetts 7th.   Organizers like Tre'Andre Carmel Valentine, who advocates for trans  and nonbinary folks and has established a leadership academy to create  new opportunities for employment and education.   De'zyre Dupree Lewis, who serves as a lead community health worker  helping residents throughout the district access needed care.   Armani Pasqual, another leader who is dedicated to transformational  change and manages a reentry program and combats hunger among those  experiencing housing insecurity.  [[Page H1471]]    They, and so many others in the trans community, are rightfully  taking up space while simultaneously creating space, utilizing their  talents and skills to shape the Massachusetts 7th and beyond into a  stronger and more beautiful place to live.   I am truly humbled to serve as their Congresswoman, and I will never  stop fighting for bold and intentional policy solutions that promote  and support their healing, safety, and justice.                            ____________________
