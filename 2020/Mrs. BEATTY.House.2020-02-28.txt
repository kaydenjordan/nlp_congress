 Madam Speaker, I rise today to observe Black History  Month, remembering a few legends whom we lost this past year--for them,  we unite and celebrate our shared history--to build a more perfect  Union for all Americans. Standing on the shoulders of:   Ohio's Toni Morrison, poet laureate, who voiced the struggle for  justice and equality for all Americans;   Congressman Elijah Cummings, sharecroppers' son, friend, mentor,  civil rights giant, and first African American male to have a committee  room named after him;   Katherine Johnson, the famed NASA ``Hidden Figure,'' who was behind  Ohio's John Glenn's orbit of the Earth and putting a man on the Moon.   Standing on their shoulders, I empower the next generation of  leaders, like this third grader, Paris, who dressed up as me for her  Black History project.   Madam Speaker, we thank Paris. We fight every day for her future.  Paris is brave and talented. She is our future.  [[Page H1256]]  She embodies why Black History is American history.   Thank you, giants; thank you, America; and God bless America for  Black History Month--American history.                            ____________________
