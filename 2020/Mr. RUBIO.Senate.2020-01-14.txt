 Mr. President, whether it is tomorrow, later today, or  sometime next week, I know there will be an effort here to restrict the  President's ability to engage the Armed Forces of the United States in  a conflict with Iran.   I think, any time you have something like that come up, there are two  most important questions that need to be answered: No. 1, Why? Why do  we need this law that you are pursuing? No. 2, What would that law do?  Let me try to answer the ``why.'' I can deduce two separate arguments.   The first is the argument that somehow the actions of the United  States, for example, of pursuing a maximum pressure campaign against  Iran and leaving the Iran deal--according to at least the language of  the version I saw, which I know is going to be amended--have included  economic, diplomatic, and military pressure and that this is raising  the risk of retaliation against U.S. troops and personnel, which will  lead to a cycle of escalating back-and-forth violence between Iran and  its proxies and the United States, and that these warnings have been  proven to be correct. I guess the first argument is that we left the  Iran deal and that this is the reason we are now on the verge of what  some view to be an all-out war against Iran.   The second argument is rooted in the constitutional views that some  of my colleagues hold that Congress has a role to play and that no  extended military engagement should be allowed without there being  congressional approval. These are two separate motivations, and I think  it is possible to hold that second position and also be motivated by  the first. I think, for many of my colleagues, it is solely a  constitutional question, which I respect. So let's analyze the ``why''  for a second.   First of all, I think it is just not true that the reason Iran and  its proxies are trying to kill Americans is that we pulled out of the  Obama deal with Iran. Iran has most certainly responded with violence  to our decision, but that is not what motivated Iran. For example,  before there was even an Iran deal from which to pull out, it was  already equipping and supplying Shia militias in Iraq with weapons that  killed and maimed Americans in the hundreds. In fact, Iran's antagonism  toward us predates any discussion about an Iran deal. It predates our  presence in the region and the numbers that we currently have there. I  think it is also flawed because, during the Iran deal--even when the  Iran deal was in place--Iran was still sponsoring all of the same proxy  groups with all of the same weapons and was undertaking all of the same  targeting.   One of the flaws of the Iran deal and one of the reasons the Iran  deal was not a good one was that it actually didn't deal with this  activity. The only thing it dealt with was enrichment. It did nothing  to limit Iran's missile program, and it did nothing to limit Iran's  sponsorship of terrorism. In fact, the only impact it had on its  missile program and on its sponsorship of terrorism was that it  provided economic activity that generated revenue to fund those things.   Despite the denial and the repeated and bold-faced lies of some who  have gone on TV and have said: Oh, there was never any cash transfer,  there absolutely was. There was over $1 billion delivered to the  Iranians. They say these were funds that had been frozen. They say this  was their money and that this is why it was released to them as part of  this deal. The Iranians don't tell you that there is close to $50  billion in unpaid claims that have been adjudicated in U.S. courts on  behalf of Americans who have suffered at the hands of Iranian terror  and who have not been paid.   Suffice it to say that the Iran deal was flawed. One of the reasons  it was flawed is that it did nothing to prohibit the sponsorship of  terrorism, and it actually generated economic activity and the delivery  of over $1 billion in cash. I assure you this was not used to build  bridges, roads, and schools but was used to fund these nefarious  activities that Iran undertook before the Iran deal, during the Iran  deal, and after the Iran deal.   So the fact that Iran is responding with violence to economic  sanctions, which by itself is unacceptable, tells us the nature of this  regime is to respond to economic sanctions--not to military action-- with violence and efforts to kill Americans. It doesn't mean this is  the reason Iran was doing that. Iran was already doing that. It has  just been part of its response.   This leads me to the second point. Iran has already been doing it  because Iran's goal is not simply to get us back into the Iran deal;  its goal is to drive us from the region. Iran does not want an American  presence there, and it does not want American influence in the region.  Iran does not want it in Iraq, which it has been against from the very  beginning, and it doesn't want it in Syria. Yet it is not just limited  to Iraq and Syria. Iran doesn't want our presence in Jordan, in Kuwait,  or in Bahrain. It doesn't want any American presence in Afghanistan. It  doesn't want us anywhere in the region because Iran views it as an  impediment to its desire to be a dominant regional power, and Iran  views it as an impediment to its ultimate design of destroying the  Jewish State.   Iran decided not last week, not last year, and not at the beginning  of the Trump Presidency but well over a decade and a half ago that the  way it was going to get us to leave the region was by inflicting  costs--i.e., with the deaths and the injuries of American service men  and women--and that Iran would make it so painful for us to be there  and so painful for these countries to host us that we would ultimately  leave. That is the reason Iran is undertaking these attacks.   Now, why are we there? It is a good question and a valid one to  answer, and I will answer it in the cases of both Syria and Iraq.   We are not there on an anti-Iran campaign the way in which some  describe. There is an element of prohibiting Iran from capturing Iraq  and turning it into a puppet state. By the way, many Shia politicians  in Iraq share that view. They may not want us to be the protector, at  least openly, but they are nationalists just like they are Shia.   The fundamental and the principal reason we are in Iraq is as part of  NATO's anti-ISIS mission and as a train-and-equip mission. We are there  to train and equip Iraqis to fight against ISIS. It has been an effort  that has been successful. It has worked. It is interesting that for a  time, when Iran shared the same fears of ISIS, you saw Iran sort of  stand down a little bit. Even after we pulled out of the Iran deal,  Iran pulled back a little bit because it, too, wanted ISIS defeated.  Now it argues that, in its mind, ISIS has been diminished and that it  is time  [[Page S184]]  for the Americans to go. If you will not leave on your own, then we are  going to start killing people until you decide the price of being here  is too high.   Here is the bottom line. The reason there are American troops in  large parts of this region is for an anti-terror campaign. Iran has  decided to use proxies and these deniable attacks--by ``deniable,'' I  mean getting some other group to use the weapons you gave them to  attack Americans--so Iran can say: It was not us, even though everyone  knows it is Iran. That way, you can sort of try to avoid a direct war  with the United States and international condemnation, but everyone  knows it is you. That is why Iran is attacking us.   Now, I ask you: What is supposed to be the U.S. response?   First of all, it is in the law. It is a constitutional requirement,  and the power resides in the Presidency--the right to defend U.S.  service men and women when they come under attack. No. 1, there is a  constitutional power and, in my mind, an obligation to defend, to  prevent, to repel, and to respond to attacks against American troops  who are deployed abroad.   No. 2, it is embedded in congressional authorization for that anti- terror mission to begin with. In both Iraq and Afghanistan, we are  present at the authorization given by Congress over a decade and a half  ago, and imbedded in that authorization is the right to self-defense.   The third point I would make is that if you look at this argument  about AUMF, you would think what we are seeing here looks something  like the run-up to the Iraq war or the run-up to the Afghanistan war.  This is complete fiction. The Afghanistan war was one in which the Bush  White House came to the Congress back then and said: Look, the Taliban  is allowing al-Qaida to act with impunity from its territory, and we  are going to go take them out. It was an offensive operation--an  invasion. With Iraq, we all know the justification, which turned out  not to be the case, about weapons of mass destruction and the like-- again, an offensive military operation.   No one in American politics whom I see--certainly no one in the Trump  administration--has talked about ramping up and sending 150,000 or  200,000 troops marching into Tehran. No one is contemplating that. The  only thing the Trump administration has talked about is that if you  attack our troops or if we think you are getting ready to attack our  troops, we are going to prevent it if we can. We are going to repel  that attack if it happens, and we are going to respond proportionately  in return as a deterrent. You don't need congressional authorization to  do that.   Imagine the practical implications if that were the case. The  President of the United States would have to come to Congress on  December 30 because we are under attack and ask us to reconvene;  everybody fly in, take a vote, debate for a week and a half, and then  decide. By that time we would have 300 dead Americans. It is  ridiculous. It is not a requirement. It is not even practical.   So I don't understand the purpose of this AUMF. What war are you  trying to prevent? Unless you believe that we brought this upon  ourselves because we pulled out of the Iran deal--even if you believe  that one of the reasons we stayed in the Iran deal was to prevent these  sorts of attacks, which I don't think is justified--it is not a  justified argument by the very fact that even during the Iran deal they  were already doing some of these things and have a long history of  doing that. If you argue it and believe it, you can't argue that  attacking and killing Americans--violence--is an appropriate response  to economic sanctions. You most certainly cannot argue that we cannot  have a military response to protect our men and women and our interests  in the region. Yet that seems to be the argument embedded in the AUMF.   Some will state that all it does is restate law, and it doesn't have  any practical impact in the end. If the House doesn't pass the same  thing, what is this really going to mean? That is true in a legal  perspective. Let me state what the headlines already say and are going  to say. Here is what they are going to say: ``Congress votes to limit  President's military options'' or ``Congress votes to limit Trump's  ability to respond militarily to Iran.''   I want to be clear because I have heard this from others--the fact  that they were being told not to debate this issue. Debate all you  want, but those headlines and how they are read in places like Iran are  very different than the debate we are having here. How they would read  it is that the President has political domestic constraints about how  much he can respond to what they do.   We already have a fundamental problem with Iran, and that is, unlike  many countries in the world, they don't view or respond to things in  the same way. For example, it is pretty clear that their view of what  they can get away with is much higher than the reality of what they can  get away with, as evidenced by the increasing scale and increasing  magnitude of the attacks that their proxies were taking against the  United States and the region. So the threat of miscalculation on their  part is very, very high. Let's not forget that just a week ago they  launched over a dozen rockets at a U.S. military installation where, by  the grace of God, no one was killed. But they could have been. You  don't launch that many rockets at a U.S. military installation and not  expect that some Americans are going to die. So their internal calculus  about what they can get away with is already twisted.   Imagine adding to that the perception that somehow the President's  hands are tied: No matter what we do, we can kill 100 Americans because  he is really not going to be able to do very much because the Congress  took away his power.   You can take the chance that these guys are somehow legal scholars in  schools in the American legal system. You can take the chance that they  read Congressional Quarterly or whatever publication or that they have  read the latest issue of whatever the congressional research office has  produced for the practical implications or you can worry that they will  misinterpret this vote and its impact for what it means to what they  can get away with.   If you want to have a debate, have it. I don't know what you are  going to have a debate about. There is no one planning an all-out war  against Iran. The administration's strategy is pretty straightforward:  If they attack us or are getting ready to attack us, we will respond.  If they don't, we won't.   The question of whether there is going to be armed conflict between  the United States and Iran is not in the hands of the White House; it  is in the hands of the Ayatollah. I assure you, no matter what we vote  on here, it is not going to impact their decision over there.   No one--no one I know of--wants a war with Iran. That is not the  goal. The goal, hopefully, is to have an Iran that doesn't sponsor  terrorism, that doesn't want nuclear weapons, and that acts like a  normal country. I bet that is the goal of millions of Iranians  themselves.   In the interim, until that day comes, we have an obligation to  protect our interests. We have an obligation to protect our men and  women whom we have sent into harm's way. For the life of me, I just  don't understand what this AUMF seeks to prevent--a war that no one is  calling for.   I don't want to imply that we can't have these debates in America,  because we can and we should. We are a free society. But I want  everybody to be clear about how these debates can be misinterpreted and  how these headlines can be misinterpreted by the people who actually  have these rockets and control these proxy groups.    The bottom line is that Iran's goal is not just to get us back into  the nuclear deal; their goal is to drive us from the region. They want  us out, and they have concluded that the way to do that is to use other  groups whom they are arming and equipping with increasingly more and  more capabilities, meaning bigger and deadlier ammunitions and rockets  and the like to kill Americans, and the more Americans who die--even if  they are there on an anti-terror mission--the likelier it is that we  are going to have to pull them out of there. That is what they want.  They want us to leave Iraq so that they can turn it into a puppet  State.   They want all NATO and allied presence out of Syria so that they can  control Syria entirely. They want to fracture our relationship with  Lebanon so  [[Page S185]]  that Hezbollah can control that country. They want to destroy our  presence in Bahrain, where the Fifth Fleet is located. You can go on  and on.   In the end, I think the question becomes, Are we prepared to retreat  from that region entirely? You cannot come here and criticize the  President for removing troops from the Syrian-Turkish border and  abandoning the Kurds and at the same time argue: But you don't have the  power unless we authorize you to defend those very troops if they come  under attack by some Iranian proxy group. Yet that seems to be the  argument.   You cannot argue: We cannot just pick up and leave the Iraqis at the  mercy of the Iranian regime. I assure you that if the President  announced tomorrow ``I am pulling out of Iraq'' or if he said before  the Soleimani strike ``I am pulling out of Iraq,'' the floor would be  filled with people saying that we have abandoned our allies; we have  abandoned the Kurds in Northern Iraq; we have abandoned the Sunnis, who  are scared of the Iranians.   You cannot argue that and argue at the same time that you think we  need to be present and continue to work toward the functionality of  that State and at the same time say: But you need congressional  approval to act in defense of the people we send there who wear the  uniform--or our diplomats, for that matter. Yet that seems to be the  argument behind this AUMF.   The vote is going to be what it is. We are going to have this debate.  I remember about a year and a half ago, when tensions were high with  North Korea, they wanted an AUMF for that.   You can disagree with this White House all you want. I don't think we  have had a more anti-war President in my lifetime than the one we have  right now. If you think about it for a moment, almost any other  predecessor may have responded with a lot less restraint to some of the  provocations and attacks we have seen from Iran and its proxies. He  acted in a way that I think history will fully justify and in defense  of American lives in taking out Soleimani and disrupting a near-term  plot that could have very easily have killed dozens, if not hundreds,  of Americans in the near term.   I chuckle when I hear people saying: Well, how do we know what  Soleimani was doing? Well, that was his full-time job. He wasn't a  stockbroker or realtor or diplomat. His full-time job was to travel the  world to set up groups and equip groups so that when he told them to  go, they could go kill Americans. That was his full-time job. That is  what he was doing there.   I believe when all is said and done, history will fully vindicate the  decision that was made.   We will have this debate at some point. I imagine that at some point  it will move to the floor. It is a privileged resolution. I just think  it is shortsighted, and I hope that some of my colleagues who have  signed on to it thinking that somehow we were exerting Congress's  constitutional authority--I have no problem with asserting Congress's  constitutional authority when it is actually being challenged, but  there is no congressional constitutional authority that can prevent a  President or should prevent a President from acting in defense of our  men and women in uniform when we deploy them abroad. In my view, that  is what this bill, which will shortly be before us, does. That is the  practical implication of it, so I hope those who chose to be for it  will reconsider.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, today I honor the life of Paul  ``Pete'' Dye, Jr., who was a legend in the sport of golf and the most  iconic golf course architect in the modern era. Just one of five  architects to be inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame, his death  on January 9, 2020, marks an end to an illustrious career of dedication  and contribution to the sport.   Born on December 29, 1925, in Urbana, OH, Dye was first introduced to  golf by his father, who built Urbana Country Club, a nine-hole course  on their family's land in Champaign County. As a high schooler, Dye won  the State championship and went on to medal in the State amateur golf  championship.   While many know Dye as an iconic course designer, he was also deeply  committed to our great Nation. In 1944 at the age of 18, Dye enlisted  in the U.S. Army during World War II.   Dye leaves behind an extraordinary legacy, including the world- renowned ``Island Green,'' the 17th hole at TPC Sawgrass in my home  State of Florida, where Dye lived for many years. Florida was a special  place for Dye, and it was also where he met his wife, Alice Holliday  O'Neal, while he was enrolled at Rollins College. They went on to have  two sons, P.B. and Perry, who to this day have continued their father's  work, honoring him by designing courses under the Dye Designs banner.   With immense gratitude for his work and service, I am honored to pay  tribute to Pete's life.  [[Page S191]]                                ____________________
