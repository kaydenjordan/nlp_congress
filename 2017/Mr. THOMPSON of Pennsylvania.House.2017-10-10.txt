 Mr. Speaker, over the weekend, I had  the opportunity to participate in both the opening and the closing  ceremonies for the traveling version of the Vietnam War Memorial Wall.  The traveling wall was in State College last Thursday through Sunday,  and it was a truly moving experience for all those who visited.   The theme for Centre County was ``Welcome Home.'' We all know that in  many instances, our Vietnam veterans did not receive a warm welcome  home when they returned from war. This is a scar on our history and one  that we are working to heal.   The traveling wall serves as a reminder of the efforts to promote  liberty and freedom that our Vietnam veterans put forth. It finally  recognizes their struggles and thanks them for their service after  years of underappreciation.   Mr. Speaker, the wall tells the story of so many Americans. They were  sons and daughters. They were our friends and our neighbors. They are  American heroes.   It is never too late to honor our veterans to ensure that they  receive the recognition that they deserve.                            ____________________
