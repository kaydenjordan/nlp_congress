 Mr. Speaker, if there was any overriding issue of  clarity in the last election it was that Americans feel strongly that  they should have the freedom to make their own healthcare decisions,  not politicians.   Apparently, House Republicans weren't listening because just 2 months  after a record number of Americans voted to vehemently oppose the GOP's  efforts to criminalize abortion care in this country, we have today a  set of rules that will make their extreme agenda a reality. These rules  will pave the way for the immediate passage of not one, not two, but  three bills that will limit women's rights to reproductive care.   Mr. Speaker, 25 percent of their initial agenda is anti-choice. This  is not what the American people want. Sixty-one percent of this country  strongly support a women's right to abortion care.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to stand up to this  extremism and stand up for the people who we were elected to serve.   Vote ``no'' on the previous question to bring up the Women's Health  Protection Act and vote ``no'' on the rule. Let's listen to our  constituents.
