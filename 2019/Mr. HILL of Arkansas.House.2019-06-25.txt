 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Arkansas  Attorney General Leslie Rutledge and her program, Prescription for  Life.   Arkansas has the second-highest opioid prescription rate in this  country. Prescription for Life is a drug abuse prevention program used  in high schools across Arkansas. This program aims to encourage  students to avoid taking prescription drugs in an illicit manner.   The course is interactive and designed to educate young people  through animated videos about the dangers of prescription drugs. This  course also teaches students how to recognize the symptoms of a drug  overdose and abuse and how to help people who may be suffering from an  overdose.   Prescription for Life is provided at no cost to Arkansas schools.   Thank you to Attorney General Leslie Rutledge, and to all the  contributors for this important effort.                           Vascugenix Business Plan     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate  Vascugenix, a medical device company representing the University of  Arkansas at Little Rock, for winning the undergraduate division of the  2019 Delta Plastics Arkansas Governor's Cup Collegiate Business Plan  Competition.   Vascugenix is a Little Rock startup that is run by students at the  University of Arkansas at Little Rock and led by Dr. Dwight Chrisman, a  cardiologist with Arkansas Cardiology and Baptist Health in Little  Rock.   Dr. Chrisman invented Vascugenix's flagship product, the Speed- Torque, which is a device that allows surgeons to perform heart surgery  faster and safer, all while being minimally invasive.   Vascugenix is partnering with local hospitals such as Arkansas Heart  Hospital and Baptist Health, along with Arkansas' medical university,  UAMS.   I congratulate the team who served this great new product and great  new company in Little Rock.                         MacArthur Museum Recognition     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  MacArthur Museum of Arkansas Military History for receiving the  Outstanding Achievement in Collections Care and Conservation Award by  the Arkansas Museums Association.   This award recognizes excellence in preservation and conservation and  practices that illustrate exceptional standards that are set forth by  the American Alliance of Museums and Society of American Archivists.   The museum received this award for renovations last year of the  historic Arsenal Building built in 1841, which now houses the military  history educational exhibits.   MacArthur Museum's Executive Director, Stephen McAteer, was also  recognized and received the Distinguished Museum Professional of the  Year Award for his oversight role in these renovations.   MacArthur Museum opened in May 2001, and continues to educate local,  State, national, and international visitors about Arkansas' military  heritage.   Thank you to my friend, Stephen, and all of the dedicated workers at  the MacArthur Military Museum of History for your service and  leadership in the preservation of Arkansas' heritage.         Recognizing the Recipient of the 2019 Steve Willbanks Award     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate my  friend, John Maus, for being awarded the 2019 Steve Willbanks award for  community service in his outstanding work in Morrilton, Arkansas.   The Steve Willbanks award was established in 2011 to honor his more  than 40 years of leadership as president and CEO of Community Service,  Incorporated.   Maus is a lifelong resident of Conway County, and serves as president  of the Sacred Heart School Board, where he  [[Page H5085]]  graduated in 1981. He also serves as president of the Sacred Heart  Parish Council, and recently co-chaired their $3 million school and  church renovation project.   John is active in the community, and serving on the Board for  Community Service Properties, and a member of the ASU Beebe Ag-Tech  advisory board, as well as the University of Arkansas Community College  at Morrilton Board of Visitors.   John's service to the State of Arkansas, and commitment to our youth  will never be forgotten, and I join all Arkansans in congratulating  John Maus on this recognition, and I wish him much continued success.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment is very  straightforward. It ensures that $5 million within the Small Business  Administration's entrepreneurial development program is spent in  support of the Small Business Administration's Regional Innovation  Clusters program.   Earlier this year the SBA awarded a $500,000 contract through this  Regional Innovation Clusters program to an organization in my district  called the Conductor. The Conductor is a public-private partnership  between the University of Central Arkansas in Conway, Arkansas, and  Startup Junkie in Fayetteville, Arkansas.   The Conductor is one of seven clusters nationwide to be awarded this  competitive contract, and this important funding will enable the  Conductor to bolster its ability and expand its footprint across  underserved areas particularly in rural Arkansas. With only a small  amount of money, $5 million, the SBA can continue to drive innovation  and job creation in Arkansas.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr.  Womack).    Mr. Chairman, I am proud to work with my friend  from northwest Arkansas on this important amendment. I appreciate my  colleague's support.   In just the 3 years since it has launched, the Conductor has served  nearly 9,000 people through its free programming and its business  consulting. I thank UCA for its leadership on the Conductor.   Mr. Chairman, I encourage all Members to support this important  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.
