 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill, not because it  is perfect or even sufficient, but because the lives and the  livelihoods of Americans are at risk.   This bill provides immediate cash assistance. It allows for  unemployment benefits. It puts direct money in the hands of small  businesses who are struggling in my district. It creates $100 billion  in assistance to hospitals, something Minnesota hospitals are  desperately in need of, and it creates $150 billion in funding,  necessary funding, for State and local governments.
