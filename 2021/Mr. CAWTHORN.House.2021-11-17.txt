 Madam Speaker, the Halls of this hallowed Republic have  become darkened with the smut and filth of corrupted justice.   Imagine: a predawn raid. Waking from a dead sleep in sheer terror to  men with guns screaming and searching furiously for damning evidence  against their authoritarian master.   This horrifying vision is not pulled from the pages of some graphic  novel. This was last week's headlines.   A dedicated group of whistleblowing journalists, including James  O'Keefe, faced illegal raids by the FBI to confiscate personal  cellphones and crucial documents that incriminate tyrant Joe Biden.   Madam Speaker, why do you sit in silence while the White House's  secret police round up dissenters?   Why do you sit in silence while diligent journalists face harassment  at the hands of left-wing enforcers?   There is no greater tyranny than that which is perpetrated under the  shield of law and in the name of justice. The flag of freedom lies in  tatters when liberty is crushed beneath the heavy hand of a  totalitarian regime.   Hear my message loud and clear: The American people will raise that  flag of freedom, and it will fly high again very soon.
