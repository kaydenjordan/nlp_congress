 Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chairwoman, I am proud to cosponsor the  Enhanced Background Checks Act, H.R. 1112, and I am also proud today to  present an amendment that will make sure we can track and learn from  the good that this bill will accomplish once it becomes law.   In 2017, 39,773 Americans died from gun violence. This is a public  health epidemic.   Under current law, if a background check is not completed within 3  business days, a federally licensed firearm dealer may move forward  with a firearms transfer or sale.   The devastating reality is that many horrific acts of gun violence,  including the massacre of the Emanuel Methodist Church in Charleston,  South Carolina, which ended nine lives and left several people wounded,  could have been avoided.   Today, we will vote to close the loophole that allowed for that  tragedy by closing what has become known as the Charleston loophole.  The Enhanced Background Checks Act will provide the background check  system with additional time to make a final determination on a  potential firearm purchaser before a licensed dealer can transfer a  gun.   We have an obligation to the American people and to the victims of  the shooter at the AME church to pass the bill before us today, and I  am proud to be part of this effort to protect our communities from gun  violence.   My amendment to H.R. 1112 will require the Government Accountability  Office to submit a report to Congress 1 year, 3 years, and 5 years  following the implementation of this law. These reports will analyze  the extent to which the changes made by this law will prevent firearms  from being transferred to prohibited persons.   I am proud that this amendment has broad support from all  stakeholders that have been involved in making this bill a reality.   We must strive for effective, evidence-based policies that promote  public health and protect our communities. My amendment will cost us  nothing, but it will help build the evidence base around the  effectiveness of good gun violence prevention policies like this one.   This amendment is all the more important, given the regrettable lack  of Federal funding for gun violence research. My amendment will finally  help us demonstrate with data that gun violence prevention measures  like the one before us today will prevent firearms from ending up in  the hands of people who should not have them.   I came to Washington because the people of southern Macomb and  southeastern Oakland Counties sent me here on a mission, and that  mission includes protecting our communities from senseless gun  violence.   I stand today in solidarity with the courageous people of Michigan's  Ninth Congressional District's Moms Demand Action and Students Demand  Action.   We have a responsibility as Members of Congress and as human beings  not just to talk about the horrors of gun violence, but to do  everything in our powers to end it. Today, we will take the critically  necessary step to do just that.   I would like to thank Congressman  Jim Clyburn, Peter King, and Joe  Cunningham for their leadership to ensure that we close the Charleston  loophole. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1112 and support this  amendment.   Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Nadler), the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee.                                time  1030     Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my  time.
