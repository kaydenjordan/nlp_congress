 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4044, the  Protect and Restore America's Estuaries Act. As Co-Chair of the  Congressional Estuary Caucus, I am pleased to support this bill to  reauthorize the National Estuary Program through Fiscal Year 2026. The  Lower Columbia Estuary Partnership, in my home state of Oregon, is one  of the twenty-eight National Estuary Programs across the country. The  Lower Columbia Estuary Partnership is leading outstanding resiliency  efforts in the Pacific Northwest to restore and protect habitat,  improve water quality, restore flood plains, and address marine debris.  This bill will help the National Estuary Programs consider the effects  of extreme weather events that are increasingly common in the climate  crisis, and implement appropriate adaptation strategies in their  management plans. Additionally, this bill takes important steps to  allow the NEPs to better address storm water runoff, coastal  resiliency, and accelerate land loss mitigation efforts. This past  weekend, we celebrated World Wetlands Day. Our coastal wetlands and  estuaries are often overlooked and undervalued, but they are on the  frontlines of the climate crisis. We can help support and safeguard our  National Estuary Programs by passing the Protect and Restore America's  Estuaries Act.
