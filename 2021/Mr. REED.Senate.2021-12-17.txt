 Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to GEN Raymond  Odierno, one of the greatest commanders of his, or any other,  generation of American military leaders.   Ray served the Army and the Nation with great distinction. He  attended West Point, and following graduation, he went on to serve  nearly 40 years in the Army, retiring as a four-star general.   Ray's service took him around the world, from Germany and Albania to  Kuwait and Iraq. He reached the heights of his career as the commander  of all coalition forces in Iraq and a tenure as the 38th Chief of Staff  of the U.S. Army.   Throughout his distinguished career, Ray was an inspirational force  to the men and women he commanded and the leaders he advised. His  character, professional skills, and abiding love and respect for those  around him made him a preeminent soldier. His steadfast loyalty and  commitment to his fellow soldiers and veterans was unwavering.   I was privileged to have worked extensively with Ray. His courageous  leadership in so many demanding jobs leaves me with great admiration  and gratitude.   We were both West Pointers and both had the privilege of serving in  the Army, so we shared many things in common.   I recall first meeting Ray in Iraq when he commanded the 4th Infantry  Division. I was immediately struck by his presence, his keen insight,  and the mutual and profound respect he shared with his troops. His  example of selfless service, dedication to his mission and his  soldiers, together with his personal integrity and decency, sustained  and inspired all who served with him.   I also had the privilege of working closely with him while he served  as Chief of Staff of the Army. He proved an innovative and resourceful  leader who continued to focus on soldiers and their families as he  maintained an Army on the most robust deployment schedule in our  lifetime.   Ray's love for his country was surpassed only by his love of family-- his wonderful wife Linda and their three children; Tony, Katie, and  Mike; and their beautiful grandchildren.   I offer the Odierno family my deepest condolences on his passing and  thank them for sharing Ray with us for so many years.   The Odierno family's military tradition runs deep and strong. Ray's  father was an Army sergeant in World War II. And his son, retired Army  Captain Tony Odierno, also graduated from West Point. Tony served with  distinction in Iraq before he was wounded there and came home and found  other ways to serve. I know that legacy of service will continue and  manifest itself in many different ways.   Ray Odierno was a powerful, inspiring person. He dedicated his life's  work to serving others, and his was a life well-lived. He will be  missed by all who have had the privilege to know him and to serve with  him.   I am proud to honor the legacy of GEN Ray Odierno, and I know the  Members of the Senate will join me in recognizing the incredible  contributions he made for our Nation.   And in words familiar to all West Pointers:       And when our work is done,      Our course on earth is run,      May it be said, ``Well done; be thou at peace.''    GEN Raymond Odierno, well done. Be thou at peace.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President. I rise today to honor one of our Nation's  most distinguished and honorable military and diplomatic leaders, Colin  Powell.   Few American leaders have served their nation more, from combat  overseas as a young officer to the heights of military command and  diplomacy on the world stage. Colin Powell will and should hold a  renowned place in our country's history.   Throughout his life, Colin Powell was the epitome of selfless service  and courageous leadership. He gave everything he had to America--and  then some. And he always did what many profess but few do: He took  responsibility.   Colin Powell was a trailblazer for countless Americans. He paved much  of the way on his own. Raised in the South Bronx as the son of Jamaican  immigrants, he joined ROTC at the City College of New York and went on  to serve with incredible bravery in Vietnam, sustaining wounds on two  tours and saving the lives of many fellow soldiers. Colin Powell's  remarkable skill as a military commander was clear to everyone around  him, and he rose quickly through the ranks, eventually becoming  National Security Advisor to President Ronald Reagan and, later,  Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff for President George H.W. Bush.   The ``Powell Doctrine,'' as his theory of warfare would become known,  guided the United States to its most decisive military victory since  World War II through Operation Desert Storm. Colin Powell insisted that  war should be the last resort in any national conflict, but, when  necessary, it should be focused, overwhelming for the enemy, and  controlled with clear objectives. We would do well to remember that  vision today.  [[Page S9301]]    Colin Powell reached the summit of his career when he was named  Secretary of State for President George W. Bush. Once again, he served  his country selflessly and demonstrated his innate decency and  integrity.   A distinct honor of my life was the opportunity to work with and  learn from Colin Powell in the years afterward. I made a point to call  him when I was named chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee.  His advice was deeply appreciated. Indeed, both in and out of uniform,  he advised generations of Presidents, diplomats, military leaders, and  lawmakers with wisdom and candor. Colin did not shrink from the truth,  and he will be remembered as one of our Nation's most thoughtful  strategists.   Perhaps most importantly, to the countless Americans who looked up to  him, Colin Powell leaves a legacy of courage and integrity. He was the  first leader of color in many of the land's highest offices, including  National Security Advisor, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and  Secretary of State. He was beloved by his troops, respected by his  peers, and trusted more than any other American of his day.   Colin Powell was resolute and honorable throughout his life and  career, and America is fortunate to have benefited from his leadership.  I offer my sincere condolences to Alma and his wonderful family, whom I  know he loved deeply and fiercely.   May we all strive for the wisdom, courage, and humility that Colin  Powell imparted upon this great Nation.                            ____________________
